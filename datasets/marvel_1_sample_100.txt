a boring lifeless movie from start to finish. it almost made me want to turn into tony stark's more accurate comic counterpart. an alcoholic. the plot might be interesting but 2008's iron man suffers from a not compelling villain miscasting and cheesy action courtesy of director jon favreau. what. this movie sucks. i don't understand why anyone thinks this is a good movie. the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and the storyline is boring. thor two is better don't recommend this one at all. movie was dull. iron man has never been my favorite character. barely-watchable trash. i stuck through it to be polite to the person who wanted me to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels. loud noises and expensive special effects can't make up for the absence of a plot writing characterisation or really anything interesting. just a blockbuster hollywood movie with tons of special effect and surely tons of millions dollars but no scenario bad acting and a story seen so many times nice to see but only one time. this was kind of terrible. boring overrated lacks a lot of important things robert downey jr really doesn't fit this role. the suit had more abilities than spider-man and parker wasn't really the outcast that persevered and made you want to root for him like in the comics and earlier movies. spider-man was just too dependent on iron man for both his core initiative and succeeding in his mission. the story was forced in order to set-up the character for avengers infinity war which made an iconic comic hero seem incredibly insignificant. very boring and uninteresting. doesn't capture the real spirit of a spiderman film. very very unmeaningful. i could not even know that people could have done such shallow movie like this. spider-man is young ok fine. but that is definitely not an excuse for the childishness of this movie. young audience is not an excuse either. maybe holland did well in this 17 spider-man version or it just because he is young and naive too. this role can ruin his other up-coming performances. how the hell this this movie hit 92%. movie was ok at best maybe its time to watch the movies before firing reviews online. one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen. spider-man homecomingi agree with the economists review. spider-man homecoming was not amazing. the film was an iron man movie not a spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake. let's go over the differences. the iron man story is about physics and the american spirit of capitalism and innovation. tony stark the man behind the iron man suit is a flamboyant billionaire who invents gadgets and new technology. in fact tony stark is based of the flamboyant billionaire howard hughes. the theme of iron man is money and creativity. iron man has unique abilities to concur evil because of his enormous amounts of money and genius allowed him to create a special suit. because of this special suit his superpowers are acquired. in comparison spider-man is a story about genetics. spider dna somehow mixing with human dna has occurred in a man. the mans name is peter parker of new york city. spider-man has a unique ability to concur evil because of genetics. he has some of the same abilities of a spider because of the spider dna mixing with his own. because of a genetic mutation his superpowers are innate. now in spider-man homecoming it's all horribly mixed up. you have a spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics once in the script. and spider-mans powers so to say are in large measure because of a special suit that iron man has made for him. this is stupid. it shows a lack of understanding about the fundamentals of the science and story behind the spider-man and iron man characters. spider-man's unique ability to fight crime has been acquired because of a super suit tony stark made with a drone on his chest and an augmented reality heads up visual display. really. give me a break. a great spider-man flick should be heavily concentrated on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made. moreover where are the iconic new york city scenes. where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man would see as he swings though nyc giving the audience an almost vr experience. micheal keaton is a great actor perhaps one of the greats of our time. hannibal buress was absolutely fantastic in his role. but the rest of the cast was. can anyone really say they enjoyed looking at jacob batalon for two hours. how did zendaya make it though casting. laura harrier is spider-man's love interest. and why is spider-man once again played by a british actor. i love the uk but for integrity purposes spider-man could have be played by an american. preferably a new yorker. there are tons of qualified kids out of nyu. contrary to what the economist spider-man review says teenagers are not annoying. but creating an iron man film because you can't come up with a decent spider-man script is. great movie minus all the virtue signalling. spider-man is one of my all time favorites. i have been waiting and hoping he would join the mcu. the movie is good the actor is great but changing all the supporting cast for the sake of virtue signaling really ticked me off. btw mj is an all american redhead girl. not the sjw bs that she was changed to. the only reason i didn't abandon the movie entirely is because her name isn't mary jane. also flash isn't some stupid debate team jock that acts like this moron. he is a literal jock and bully. not this stupid idiot the producer came up with. a disappointing reliance on a mish-mash of avengers characters and pretentious teenage angst. so uninteresting i couldn't finish watching it. didn't end up with the asian. who the fudge wants to see white guy with a black girl. dans game i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day. another comic destoyed by insufferable liberal sjw's. by far the worst of the spidey reboots that has ruined this action hero who should now be called an affirmative action hero. took all the likable qualities of peter from the comics and washed them down the drain. this movie is complete garbage spidey doesn't even throw a punch. not to mention the complete comic book inaccuracy to the supporting cast thanks to sjw disney and amy pascal. thanks for taking a big dump on my favorite character. lame. i thought the original with toby was too much a loser. but this thing drags on and on and on and on totally juvenile. more cgi than actually real stunts. story is boring. child's play. they ruined it. characters were needlessly black brown yellow-washed for no reason other than to virtue signal.
