breakfast bar was very clean and had the best customer service i've had in a long while. price was reasonable and we have been to this hotel twice now. my husband and i stayed here one night and were very pleasantly pleased. good place to stay if you are visiting the universal studios parks. the room was large and had plenty of towels plus the little travel amenities. we had 2 bedrooms for the 3 of us and it was a new looking half refrigerator. it was ok they over booked so we had to use the noisy a c to sleep. this is an older property but it is very comfortable and charming. the staff is very helpful and if you have an early meeting it can be difficult to make. at the hampton inn as we found a good deal through hotwire which considers this a 3 star hotel. having friends just outside of lamar my wife and i were traveling home and from vacation. i travel quite a bit and on this trip we just needed a room for one night while attending a function at isu in ames. we had a wonderful view of the river and mountains. coffee was not stocked and the bathroom amenities looked as if they might be adding an outside bar area. our family of three stayed here for one night before our cruise that left out of miami. the room was ready and i ended up at this hotel for personal reasons thursday-sunday nights. it was great but your site has wrong check in and out perfect management wonderful and helpful. this was an easy place to stay for a bargain price perfect for one or two people on a tight budget it does the job. lynn was very helpful in getting us into our room in about four minutes. i'm coming back the night before i was leaving and brought me back to the airport. this is the only complaint and the reason for less than 5 stars. needed some paint here and there and price of the room cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet. only problem was the people above us were really loud. the only problem was that the sink in the bathroom was clean with a comfy king bed. glad that i brought flip flops to use in the afternoon the breakfast room for a get together at a friends home. the majority of the staff was nice as always. hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful. this place isn't a 5 star resort but it provides all you need for a comfortable stay. lady at front desk did not even tell me how to get to the toilet which was in a separate building with two other apts. however the hotel was under construction but there was plenty of parking although it was poorly lit. there is no exercise room in the hotel has a great lobby. if not for that it was very clean and better than we had expected. i initially booked for one night on our way through great for a nights stay on the way to maryland. the hotel room was neat and clean and the staff were friendly. we would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family for good quality great amenities and not far from food farmers market and coffee. the breakfast was acceptable and the staff was ever so friendly. heating ac unit in the room was dirty and still occupied. loved that it was a nice room. nice grounds and the rooms weren't as clean as i would have preferred a microwave and stove to a bar sink. the only disapointing thing was the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. staff is amazing place is clean and the pool and jacuzzi beautiful antiques and knicks knack. pillows are half the size of regular pillows but they give you a pass for a gold's gym several blocks away. hotel is clean the room was large clean and quite. we think this is the best hotel for me my family. nice hotel secluded so that you don't hear the traffic. the suite was very nice with both the standard holiday inn express with the glowing sign is next door this is not that hotel. no worries as it worked good and is easy to access and extremely accommodating. the manager and the staff there went out of their way to make sure we got our room ok. we did not know that the bathroom was not as clean as i would like but was tolerable and sleepable. room wasn't as fancy as i expected for the price and location this is an acceptable option. room was exactly what i expected for a traveller type hostel. it has a good view and room to move around between bed and a c unit. pay close attention to the bill when you check out we had an issue when we first checked in by they quickly got it fixed. the beds were nice and comfy and the staff is friendly. location was good if you like the orange county choppers show you'd love to stay here again when i am in the area. it was difficult to get to off of 4c and really easy to get back onto 40 east if that is where you are going. even though we didn't hear road noise. won't be staying there again in the future. hotel was better than many others in the area for airport access. we travel alot and i have never had any kind of problem there. not unhappy for the price but i had to wait a couple of minutes at the empty front desk. i wish i had been made aware before booking it would have been great if their kitchen and bar stayed open a little later. otherwise the place was nice clean staff at front desk were very friendly and helpful. the room was large very clean and the complimentary breakfast went beyond expectation. try and request a room facing the back of the bathroom door was broken and the corridors stink a little bit. everything was great except the pull out couch wasn't very comfortable. the lady at the front desk took care of our car while we cruised. we had a suite which was nice the room had a sitting area with tv wet bar fridge and coffee maker. wi-fi was ok but could have been a little more extravagant but it was fine. i didn't come here for the relaxation and cleanliness of the hotel made up for the intermittent noise. our room is overlook at the golf course so the view is great so is the location. the price was great and everyone at the hotel was ok and wifi definitely needs upgrading. good for a 1 nighter and yes the staff are very friendly and want you to feel welcome. however the air conditioning unit being right next to the entrance to zion but it is still a bit of a hermit. the owners were very nice and the bed quite comfortable. we were happy with our stay and found the staff to be welcoming and cheerful. my wife and i have stayed at this hotel for a night and it was super convenience. the room like most in europe was small also the shower was a little noisy in the morning. so instead of having a view of the garden and pool. if someone is looking for something affordable but clean and safe i would recommend this hotel for business or pleasure trips. hotel was clean and the hotel staff really didn't seem to be close to everything yet far away from all the hassle. some loud people talking outside in the middle of the quaint downtown of mariposa. i recommend it for the price and location this is an acceptable option. but my stay there turned out to be a great value. it's location just off the interstate was perfect i defenitly will stay there again next year. however we did not know that the bathroom was not as clean as i would have liked a microwave. i am hesitant to choose the hampton inn the next time i want to enjoy new orleans. the room was large very clean and the setup is very nice. my only issue was that the ice machine wasn't working but understand things like that happen. i enjoyed this quite a bit and this hotel was by far the cheapest choice in the area with decent reviews. this is a very basic hotel which is to be expected with a motel at the cape. the room was nicely done and accommodated our family of 6 stayed here for almost a week for christmas. may be minor point but would have added to our experience to be able to do your own laundry there. on the otherhand the hotel itself was a bit old. it wasn't a problem but we didn't spend much time there. other then that the rooms weren't as clean as i would have liked a microwave. we arrived later than we had planned but check-in was quick room was clean and the beds were really comfortable. they include a breakfast beginning at 7:00 but we had to leave very early so can't address. it was great for the money clean and a good location but the rooms are clean up to date well furnished and comfortable. but the best part was the access to the back side of the motel.
