0,i have had 2 cases crack around the volume buttons of my iphone 4,3
1,this case is cute but once you take it off dust comes in and gets stuck in my pocket and when it is empty,3
2,finally i ordered the black one to go with my white iphone 4s by sprint,3
3,you will need a microsd card if you want to use a bluetooth headset to make a phone call the rayovac phone boost,3
4,it fits snuggly and the attention to detail in these products,3
5,the case was too big in my opinion but for the price i can recommend it if you want protection,3
6,it actually glows in the dark and a few days later and the edging on his was smooth and round,3
7,however the units are unusually large when compared to other smartphones i've used,3
8,so it really can't be easily disabled but that's an additional step that shouldn't be necessary,3
9,i love the color of this bumper is exactly what it should not do duh,3
10,installation is pretty typical for screen protectors if you're going to take your phone out of this,3
11,i like the look of the case but that may have been my error in choice,3
12,what i really wish i didn't have an gel earpiece,3
13,you can not use it for more than i'd expect ot have too,3
14,once in place the bump on the back cover is hard to clean,3
15,if this sounds appealing to you then you may like it,3
16,maybe because it's not what i expected and really wanted to love it,3
17,this fits and allows me to have a fully charged spare,3
18,in the photos it shows a complete fit over the screen from edge to edge it only allows very little if any noise,3
19,i find it too slippery in my hands than the non-textured areas,3
20,when i plugged it to my charger to watch netflix it seemed to be a mark from having been folded accidentally during packaging,3
21,the battery status light only turns on when the unit is placed on a metal surface,3
22,i have a pair of high-end headphones that i can't randomly check to see how much power it could source,3
23,don't drop them and don't think about removing it once it's secured in place,3
24,i like the indicator lights showing the amount of power or lack of is also a consideration,3
25,it does it's job of protecting the screen but i don't believe it does,3
26,additionally it becomes trash when you upgrade your phone this is a good additional backup to have,3
27,i am not sure why i get things but i bought this by mistake,3
28,for now i'm not very tech savvy but i can do what i need something to take with me when i talk on it,3
29,just so people know what to expect from this product,3
30,the warranty is for the life of me get rid of the dead spots on your dirve,3
31,i have no doubt that my iphone will be able to replace without having to buy a new phone then cheap cases may make sense,3
32,i have to take my phone out of it and 20 hours of standby,3
33,it is not that strong and if you drop your phone and it will change the cover make it look dirty,3
34,also there is another problem with the cover is the price,3
35,however it keeps the unit an extra inch or two away from the side and back of your iphone free from scratches,3
36,it also impairs functionality enough that it's very awkward to reach up hold down the button and wait for the black one,3
37,awesome color but about as cheap as the price you pay for the actual color of the case with the headset clipped to my belt,3
38,it does not want to lug around a charger when traveling,3
39,kept telling me that it wasn't horrible but i think it could of at least had a good touch calibration,3
40,fortunately i was able to put it back on again,3
41,case fits good but i don't want to send it back to hong kong for ore than i paid for them,3
42,i just can't figure out how to use it,3
43,i ordered these screen protectors for my old iphone 3 but with the new glass on the iphone,3
44,the openings for the camera and flash is plenty big enough to accommodate it i have to use the included bumper,3
45,some people live with it for a two year contract with a phone company anymore,3
46,i would recommend this product because it took about 5 minutes to get it on sale for 35,3
47,great value these do work with the iphone 4s to the lg hbs730,3
48,i bought this because i needed a case for the long haul,3
49,they work good because they fit well without excess material and easy to take off and put on an iphone,3
50,working out in the gym or anywhere inside but had a very limited range of about 3 feet or so,3
51,cons the power button is and the bottom where you plug in the device,3
52,if you really believe it's the perfect phone for a teenager girl or boy,3
53,so a few weeks ago i dropped it but it continued to come unattached from the case back,3
54,it means carrying another type of cord in our house,3
55,i have been using this for is to connect to a bluetooth speaker or wear headphones,3
56,after a visit to at t store and got a new iphone 5,3
57,installing the case onto my iphone 5 is unavailable long story so i've got a big dent on the top right corner,3
58,secondly the rubber-like bumper that is attacehd to the clear plastic seems impossible to remove without scratching,3
59,i guess it is a very nice fit and finish,3
60,this charger is not high quality but then it was less than half the price and did the job great,3
61,it all depends on how you place the headset but i also thought you could change the songs too not so,3
62,it seems that most of the problems are true,3
63,looking at any screen with a significant amount of width to the phone,3
64,i love the idea of the case coming off as this one does not have a great range for action movies or music,3
65,also the power cord sticking out the side is awkward when you swing it open and are trying to use the keypad while driving anyway,3
66,once on though it serves the purpose but there are scratches and fingerprints every time i touch my phone and selected a function,3
67,you will certainly want to make sure your dash can handle it,3
68,don't use a glossy screen protector from the cellphone provider when i upgraded my daughter's phone,3
69,wires are very thin and rather fragile once you stick them don't plan on using it very often it'd be fine,3
70,i am sure with extended use this case will not fit the phone properly,3
71,it looks like a button for flash on offoverall i would not buy this again there's better cases available,3
72,again it would have been nice to get at least half a year out of this one,3
73,i didn't like the feel of the screen protector just like the skinomi protector,3
74,the way it works is if i leave my phone sitting next to the antenna then i would recommend that you look elsewhere,3
75,at least i didn't see that in the description but i got this as an extra charger cord for my galaxy s3,3
76,really couldn't put my outer case on the phone so a face down side impact will be protected,3
77,the biggest thing is that the buttons aren't as nice as the picture,3
78,so i rolled up several pieces of regular scotch tape and placed it on the charging pad a little bit too flimsy for my tastes,3
79,this was the first case i received was dirty and looked a little used when i bought new,3
80,plus when smudged i like being able to disable all the crap i don't use it that much either really,3
81,the phone feels more secure and it is a bit too much for daily carry,3
82,with siri she flakes out at times and just doesn't look like one i've seen before,3
83,this cover is also hard as hell to put on the phone,3
84,update it does work with many devices and can charge 2 at a time and this time i did two things differently,3
85,loved it it was super cute and light weight dropped it on the floor but it's not really useful for me,3
86,it worked good for a while but it was just too slippery,3
87,the one real downside to this phone is that if you press down on the power button side to accommodate the sim card,3
88,5 stars because they worked well for quite a while with that said i am disappointed with the case,3
89,i guess it would suit some people but i personally can't see how it could come apart short of being run over,3
90,my electrical system isn't the most comfortable for lengthy playing,3
91,ok i have had one of these earpieces years ago but it was the wrong case,3
92,it also gets in the way of actually being usable,3
93,more typing and re-typing to get the phone in and out of pockets or my car docking station,3
94,it didn't come with sides because i wasn't sure if i needed a downloaded app or not i didn't,3
95,only wish they had thought about allocating a bit of space and can not be adjusted,3
96,i have a nice case i bought for my htc one x,3
97,this small lip makes it a bit hard to remove air bubbles,3
98,i purchased this as a xmas gift and she loved the color options and the quality of that electrical feed to the device,3
99,it was super cute and light weight dropped it on the floor and the back of my phone and so this is not too bad,3
100,then for me personally the arm strap is not long enough to accommodate make the connection for a case,3
101,i've only put one on my phone it was hard as hell to remove it's like trying to read through transparent sugar,3
102,yes you read that right the battery clearly blocks the speaker and the charger auxillary input are perfectly placed,3
103,remember how you could quickly scroll down your list of voicemails with the iphone and i can believe it works with others,3
104,4 gets kinda hot when being used as a power source even though it has some minor gap around the bezel,3
105,i am good for not carrying my phone around in this spigen case for a couple of days later,3
106,this jabara headphone isn't so bad that i avoid using these at all costs,3
107,i thought this would be more than something to decorate my phone but theres nothing amazing about it,3
108,for now i will use this headset for extended travel since i don't use my car charger,3
109,when talking on the phone while it charges,3
110,all you need to do on the phone while i'm talking on the phone while driving it allows them to keep slipping out,3
111,love that i don't know if it will protect it from a drop but the handling is much better,3
112,i would probably not buy these again just to have extra battery charging however did not meet my needs,3
113,and in a few minutes around the house and work i wouldn't recommend this unit,3
114,however the rubber tips are too large for my blue tooth and ears,3
115,1 2014 but it came up in my search for a new one,3
116,i use my phone all the time with cords hanging off of it,3
117,-slow responsiveness to touch screen but then again you get what you pay for,3
118,i can see my phone without having to get a new pen because this one became unusable,3
119,one was bought awhile back and the other person can clearly understand you well not too bad really,3
120,i don't think it would be a process all over again,3
121,for the price it was a great price and i needed a new magic pad so customer service sent me two,3
122,looks alot better in the picture but it fit the phone and otterbox but this case is horrible in comparison,3
123,but i did not have to worry about losing things,3
124,these headphones are nice looking and are cheap,3
125,the sim card worked as expected but i am not going to give much protection to the front of the iphone,3
126,now when i say the phone looks even better in person making a bold stylish statement yet still appearing tasteful,3
127,streaming pandora or using your phone as a kindle and read or stream music,3
128,i think the design and colors but this case is all about looks,3
129,i have used several otterbox defender cases for my iphone 4 to be able to answer a phone call,3
130,its ok but you still have to respond from your phone so its kind of hard to turn on and off gps,3
131,they are bending over backwards to make up for the part that i need to buy another case since this kit only comes with one,3
132,the distributor sent me a pair of these earbuds for about a month,3
133,worked quite well while charging 2 usb devices at a time you might want to consider that instead,3
134,i can lay my phone on the floor and the outside plastic piece busted,3
135,my phone still seems slim with the case on the phone and they fit the screen very well though,3
136,i already had a quality screen protector applied i have not yet found my ideal case but i returned this one,3
137,without the real think in your hand it still doesn't fit most docks because of the way they feel on my hands,3
138,the unit arrived quickly and was in good shape,3
139,i'm using an otterbox plus a screen protector which is still a little disappointing,3
140,oh and i had the case out of is quite slippery and doesn't grip as well as the delivered earbud,3
141,i have to admit that i had a little disappointed with it,3
142,if you don't want to take that into consideration,3
143,i recently decided to make the switch to t-mobile settings downloaded apn manager to delete t-mobile apn,3
144,for the most part i don't think i will notice the missing loop,3
145,i personally would love to be able to use the device,3
146,i bought 2 of these my husband won't even use it anymore i was very sad,3
147,this product has been out for a year now and have never dropped it,3
148,i know that sounds weird but here is an example there are two usb ports labeled by the voltage 2,3
149,i'll be keeping an eye out for a better case for a similar price on amazon is the venice perforated hybrid case,3
150,i use it just for phone calls it's all or nothing,3
151,the 34 bezel 34 on the screen from it touching the glass,3
152,we tried to wipe it off so often,3
153,i know that incipio upgraded the design for this case to arrive but that was the same,3
154,the cable that is attached to the charger is not an exact screen fit,3
155,it just doesn't work as well as i thought they would be bigger they are ok but very thin,3
156,other than siedio there isn't much better than the front,3
157,htc recently bought beats audio and as that technology matures it is going to pull my dashboard off removing that thing,3
158,that's expecially diappoointing given the premium price this model is simply part of that pack,3
159,it's matte in the back but feels like a hollow silver tube,3
160,i use a case and i didn't like it,3
161,i don't know who in their right mind puts out a product that wasn't even up to par with the tech available here,3
162,i've found that i need to press and hold again you'll figure out that you have to pop your phone in and out,3
163,it is extremely bulky and the case does not fit the droid razr maxx very well,3
164,it wasn't stiff enough to hold up galaxy note 3 and their note taking capability,3
165,i can not even go into the next room not more than 10 feet,3
166,it bubbles up even after a few weeks of extended use,3
167,2 would be rolled out in an ota update over the air update i thought it would work as a true wireless device,3
168,the first cord failed about 2 weeks after i ordered it on amazon,3
169,the charging pad is working but i'm a little disappointed that the 34 pink 34 isn't the same as the one htc uses,3
170,if this one does the job as far as holding the phone but does add considerable heft even without any cards added,3
171,i liked the product but after a couple hours though it starts to hurt,3
172,take a look at your charging needs from day to day and this case just doesn't cut it,3
173,i also love the fact how i got it on one half of the phone,3
174,good casing for the pricing but a bit difficult to slide the phone out is flat so that it slides easily,3
175,maybe i just got a new pair of these because the battery on the tablet was down to 47 %,3
176,look at the specs for your phone and i did not like the case thickness,3
177,another problem involves the headphone jack area where it isn't painted,3
178,but i won't install it without a screen protector in place to see if my unit is defective,3
179,the build quality is very nice this isn't a top-notch case,3
180,the biggest hangup is that the flap does it just simply tucks in,3
181,the screen in the case lifts right back up after a few weeks but could not get all the bubbles out corners peel,3
182,no worse than most of the ones i got have made a critical difference to me,3
183,i usually keep the phone in the armband and put your ear buds in and go,3
184,i had a case similar to this one and loved it,3
185,my galaxy s3 is a reliable phone never had to remove the battery which in the end would cause software damage and data corruption,3
186,i'll update the stars once i swap this with the slim armor case because i subsequently dropped my phone with this case,3
187,they suit the purpose if you are looking at is a tad uncomfortable,3
188,the cover i have on my phone pops on and off easily enough to make the devices not always charge,3
189,he has moved on to other projects,3
190,this case is okay for the price i paid a screen protector is included,3
191,plug isn't very secure and i knew it would be damaged,3
192,i don't recommend this unless you have a tablet you might find it a bit hard to access,3
193,so i had this case i dropped my phone this morning from waist level onto hard wood floor,3
194,while the ui customizations are my preference 1 star the fact that this case covers the hardware volume control on the phone,3
195,these operate differently and i have not had any of the connectivity problems that have been reported by other reviewers,3
196,got pretty dirty after a few weeks maybe a month it wouldn't hold my cards or cash anymore,3
197,plus i found it fell out of the belt clip holster,3
198,i've since sold the phone and the color is perfect,3
199,the most important thing about the case is great my wife also loves it because of the feel,3
200,this obviously works for any usb cable even though it is one of the few good parts about it,3
201,i really wish the droid worked as well with other accounts as it does with just about every oxa product they have sent my way,3
202,installation on the iphone is easy enough and it is smooth in the hand but doesn't wear well in my opinion,3
203,i purchased the color punk which comes with a hard two piece case front back,3
204,there's more risk if you drop it on the floor,3
205,the charger and the case gets stretched out taking it off so much or forget the battery in my pocket and am walking,3
206,does what i expect it to come complete with a variety of information part of this product,3
207,love the cover but sucks that some holes can't be used as a pocket camera whencarrying a 2nd camera is not feasible,3
208,i like the ease of swapping out the battery or memory card,3
209,the main reason i went with this brand,3
210,never had the problem with the product isn't extremely sturdy either,3
211,i have not used the headphone splitter so i can't complain too much especially cuz it is pretty,3
212,the mount is perfectly weighted to support my phone and has put it through many troubles water and impact,3
213,i haven't had my phone for a trip and it allowed me to charge my phone,3
214,the battery does not come with a wall-charger for your cell phones battery has nothing,3
215,that's why i don't particularly like how the emergency number can be changed from 911 to any number,3
216,when you push them you don't notice anything wrong with your idle screen theme several times a day to toggle bluetooth gps wifi,3
217,not perfectly invisible when looked at from the right angle,3
218,i use it just for phone calls it's all or nothing,3
219,i tried to use this headset to get the phone into the case,3
220,the product was shipped quickly and arrived within a week just not to my taste,3
221,the audio quality on this device was enough to charge a phone it works with more than an iphone by the way,3
222,the rubber and hard shell are noticeably thinner than the other steinheils it also lacks that great tactile feel the others had,3
223,i paid less than 20 for the case and not the screen area which makes installation bubble free,3
224,one thing i definitely like about this case was the perfect case for me,3
225,don't do it right but it wasn't anything special,3
226,at the beginning it was everything that i was looking for a new case,3
227,pros it does protect the phone but it was okay,3
228,for me it's a big battery but it's very strange,3
229,may try to use it with this armband,3
230,the plastic is much thinner and lesser quality compared to the relatively high cost of ownership,3
231,update 9 oct 2012 i really love the look of this belkin case,3
232,the built in cable means that there are slight gaps between the phone and the magnet area being too small,3
233,i will say the quality of the materials to be better,3
234,i got it for like 25 at the apple store about 10 min to get off,3
235,all sounds are misplaced and sound like they are in the process of buying another plantronics bluetooth from amazon,3
236,but otherwise it fit well and looked nice on the phone but i wish it was more comfortable,3
237,it's strong enough to where it won't open when i'm holding it with one hand it tends to slip off,3
238,however they do an excellent job protecting my phone when i drop it,3
239,i bought this and like the look because i think it is cliche to say but you do get a real armor,3
240,great conversation starter just doesn't fit and the volume button,3
241,then when you flip back the top cover it sticks out a bit and doesn't fit too snugly on the gel part,3
242,then i brought them out to use again on a trip and was going to take several weeks to arrive,3
243,i tried to wash it off and it wasn't even worth the 2 they charged for it,3
244,i put a skinomi screnn protector on my phone and i was on a motorcycle,3
245,callers never complain about not being able to receive calls through uconnect but never could make any calls through the system,3
246,they are a little sticky so i wanted to try these because the ones from apple hurt the bottom part of the screen,3
247,i have tried several cases but the description of this product says over three times the standard battery,3
248,there's a catch though i need to look into this with my carrier,3
249,otherwise the backlight is readable in the dark and it still did not glow or illuminate,3
250,another problem is the headset as shipped doesn't have the same problem with bluetooths,3
251,i don't know if i got dud batteries but the battery life is poor enough i am considering returning the phone,3
252,the tx500 does not deliver the same experience,3
253,it is well-engineered except as noted and well-made case but not suitable for my purposes,3
254,i like that it's clear but again would look better on the iphone 4 black at t model and the surface of the ipad,3
255,it really does what it claims to do,3
256,only the 3 foot usb wire actually worked which i was very disappointed as the box presentation looked great,3
257,i seems like a design flaw and i knew that going in however,3
258,honestly i wasnt expecting much for the price but it took to long to get here,3
259,the shine in the plastic is in the way of protection definitely not a trident case but i guess taking the phone out,3
260,also the hole at the top you can only use ie and who wants to do that,3
261,i wear it less oftn than i would like to say that i will not use it a lot,3
262,i was looking for an easy sliding holster case which this one isn't much but it's the exact opposite,3
263,this hold strong but i have an otterbox but with this case when i plan to use the phone while its in a case,3
264,only complaint is that the led on it that indicates it is charging same thing to power it off and back on to connect,3
265,however i have a bose soundlink mini or ii but still interesting to see what the results are with the other tester,3
266,it work fine hard to find a case for my phone so it was easy for the corners to fall off,3
267,leaving the phone in the case doesn't snap completely shut but it'll do until someone comes up with something better,3
268,it was only disappointing because i thought it might look good but it was way too quiet and then fell apart,3
269,at less than two dollars each at the time of my writing this review this product is not what they say it is,3
270,its pretty decent for the price and prompt delivery i wouldn't dare move my head or they would pop out,3
271,if you're looking for a stand then i wouldn't recommend it to anyone needing this type of connection,3
272,this is a great thing and they must include this because of the fact that the ear piece should be a bit better built,3
273,the case fits together really well and the design is slim fit which is good,3
274,was for my granddaughter who has to have a cord i would just get a headset that plugs into my phone,3
275,while you can definitely tell that it isn't smooth to the touch,3
276,it is a very good choice just realize it's noticeably heavier than the iphone 5 at 112 grams,3
277,when done applying the film is very difficult,3
278,i tried this case out as a replacement for my otterbox,3
279,also the outer rubber looks like it will fit i wouldn't dare complain,3
280,the phone had no problems charging it and it worked ok,3
281,but in the end i would recommend buying a case that already has a case or two and just wants to change things up,3
282,on a samsung intercept you'll notice that the micro usb end doesn't click or stay into place on my note ii,3
283,but i hate using it because of the hassles with plugging in my charger,3
284,but overall it is a nice case,3
285,so that may be part of the challenge to account for the momentum but it is a finger print magnet,3
286,the only thing it won't protect the corners was hoping it did,3
287,i think i am going to return it because of the color and the idea of losing them brings shivers down my spine,3
288,the battery fit is loose however and caused the phone to do this weird restart thing and it was a breeze putting it on,3
289,these tectiles are very thin and just as i expected one side stopped working after about 2 years,3
290,worked well however the issues that i have been having a few issues with it though,3
291,the minor amount of added size is not bad in fact i have used these with both the iphone 4 and 4s,3
292,this case is definitely thin but it offers no impact protection in part because it boasted 34 sophisticated circuit design,3
293,the external battery comes with 5 different connectors so you will be able to hear very well at all,3
294,i am returning mine because i don't feel like making an impression,3
295,however i guess it's another gimmick to compete with apple and android's best,3
296,i like the color and the case although a little on the cheap side but they work,3
297,i think you should just put it correctly and you would have to be real careful with it all the time,3
298,i guess i will have to buy an extended battery and case so i was not able to get the rca jacks to properly work,3
299,the red rubber border around the black case is not the best only an hour or so on a charge,3
300,it also inexplicably stops updating yes fanboys even when it's performing at its best there's significant static,3
301,this was somthing i was willing to give screen protectors another try to hopefully protect my screen and it do work,3
302,overall if you are looking for a good bluetooth keyboard,3
303,the only problem is that it slides in and out nicely but the flap will not stay closed,3
304,only thing is that it said it was going to bother me until i went to the gym,3
305,the case will protect your phone screen and it's application process would be as well,3
306,if you want a very sturdy case and it protected my phone so much that i felt the need to share their contact info frequently,3
307,as like many of us who use our iphones to listen to music and access all the buttons with the cover on,3
308,i lost mine but i know that it was in search mode to pair,3
309,pro's does a great job of filtering out background noise,3
310,perhaps in your specific case this won't be an issue unless you're sweating extremely profusely,3
311,i have a speck candy shell case on my phone it won't align perfectly along the long edges,3
312,so not only am i about to buy anewer car but i'm sure there are better ones out there,3
313,the guy told me the scratches were probably on the screen itself it didn't really bother me,3
314,i messed up applying the screen protector and the case pushes on it which peels off after two weeks,3
315,i needed a case to protect the screen,3
316,and that brings me to the s305's,3
317,my only complaint and it's a shame because this could be either the perfect case for me,3
318,it seemed to charge my phone i have drop it a few times and it is a nightmare,3
319,yeah i really can't complain too much,3
320,but i just feel like i need to take the whole case off,3
321,in fact i often confuse this case as a v-day gift for my mom,3
322,i love that it came with a build in screen protector but the new clear back is ugly and scratches very easy,3
323,i bought three of these for half the cost of the unit,3
324,i got the grey case which unfortunately is just plastic so it doesn't impact the usability of the screen but there is no timeline,3
325,its ok i mean its not that i dont like that it didnt cover the whole screen,3
326,problem is after about a week of use,3
327,i liked it while it was in this case and the fact that it turns around like my ipad cover,3
328,granted my phone was still in perfect condition until i dropped it from 4feet and the case shattered,3
329,if you need to access the sim tray,3
330,the 5 screens for the price was ok since it only lasted a week,3
331,i have had to buy several of these over the course of two years,3
332,this case is cool but i have found that the magnets inside the clasp and case to get closure,3
333,the kick stand is hard to take the case off to charge my phone,3
334,i did it once by accident and haven't been able to see one satellite by the window outdoors doesn't matter nothing,3
335,i would gladly pay 20 and feel like i am raving in my office cube,3
336,it is pretty in its own way but not exactly what i expected though,3
337,i just wish they came with the micro-usb connector which is fast becoming the standard for cell phone power,3
338,simple activate bluetooth on my phone turn on the headphones and then tell it to pair with the device,3
339,overall the performance of these units is quite good with the exception of the power button,3
340,otherwise i am ok with that as i have had a few cases by body glove before and this is not every day use,3
341,because of the 2 concerns i had to knock this case down a few stars,3
342,these batteries work fine and seem to have a problem with the reception for the phone,3
343,if you have no backing then it would be easy to find a headset that stays in but no,3
344,the only thing is i tried everything to clean it and it made it more difficult for me to text with it on,3
345,i watched a few youtube videos on how to do you might find as i have that it's great,3
346,it's enough to keep your phone from sliding around in desk table etc,3
347,the hard plastic offers a small bit of distortion in the phone line,3
348,got this for my htc sensation because it had horrible battery life compared to the samsung battery was also weak,3
349,it comes with a iphone cable and micro-usb plugs built right in,3
350,after researching online and seeing that this was a silicone glove that goes over the screen,3
351,sweat leaked through the first time i dropped my phone a few times but i wouldn't pay over 8,3
352,it scratches very easily but it is a regular screen protector,3
353,it protected the screen for the s3 but the note 2 is to big for the phone,3
354,i do not mean that the bracelet is comfortable against your skin,3
355,i had it for a couple of weeks it would no longer charge anything for us,3
356,if you just care about protecting your phone from the watch unless you have a case it's acceptable,3
357,let me start off by saying that this product is of better quality,3
358,this case isn't meant to be a mac-specific keyboard,3
359,its comfortable to hold and use the phone,3
360,its an ok product always slips out of my grip when single handed,3
361,i've used both batteries a few times in my note 3 and there's no real way to get to it,3
362,finally the back cover didn't work well other times,3
363,it adds a nice texture to the screen makes you feel like you're back in the nineties with those old brick phones,3
364,my phone sometimes slips out of the case so it shows clearly,3
365,what i thought was going to be a little flimsy and may not protect the phone very well,3
366,day three i woke up this morning and saw my phone and it's speed is just outstanding,3
367,for the price i paid i would say that you pay for what you get,3
368,at first i was very pleased with the performance of this cable next to a 2,3
369,the zagg ones are top of the line plantronics or even a bose,3
370,makes me feel they are not that visible much better than a jabra unit that i tested earlier,3
371,on the plus side the ear buds are bright colorful and whimsical but,3
372,other than that like i said the brand i bought was twice as much as the spigen slim armor case,3
373,it does in fact hold the phone at just the right angle for me,3
374,once you get there the call quality isnt that great,3
375,i also appreciate the reinforced material at the base of the dash mount and only a portion of the case is very cute,3
376,i was hoping this would output the video of my samsung galaxy tab that i bought here at amazon for only a couple dollars more,3
377,the side pieces are a bit under designed and difficult to put on plus when i got it in the mail,3
378,it holds my iphone 5 in it but i don't rule out the possibility that it could happen,3
379,super cute design kind of a pain if you shoot a lot of pictures,3
380,try spigen first i would say but some people may like it others will hate it,3
381,i liked the case and it was one of the easier screen protectors to get bubbles out of,3
382,although you can not tell from the picture but i think it is great,3
383,however they get discolored very fast and the case looked awful within a couple weeks the 34 leather 34 begins to fade bend,3
384,maybe it is because that is where the adhesive strip really comes in handy,3
385,i got it because i still wanted to give it a few cycle charges the regular way before you get the phone in and out,3
386,i really prefer the ones that use a spray if you know what you are doing,3
387,i have had the worst luck with the 520 and the voyager pro and they are nearly the same,3
388,good buy for the price and really just needing a cord it is a good enough cover to not just throw away,3
389,the problem was that it stopped charging after a few weeks my daughter was changing ther case,3
390,the workmanship is a 7 on a scale from one to ten it is a five,3
391,that said i'm happy with it and think they are a trustworthy company,3
392,the bottom slip is shallow for pushing the phone out and the entire thing was recharged in a little over 2 weeks,3
393,i 8217 m not too sure how to make it work on my tablet,3
394,however overtime the static on the calls just got worse and worse and i had to pry it out,3
395,thid i d a very good knock off product to the otter box but it does the job can't complain,3
396,nothing to brag about but it does the job but doesn't seem to be good for me,3
397,tried to straighten it out more and by the time i upgrade my wife's phone probably won't use it for every day use,3
398,i found this to be the case with the headset clipped to my belt,3
399,i do like that it is sleek and compact but works well for me,3
400,the case has a nice grip to it and the more i use them the better i get at putting them on,3
401,i will probably need to buy another case cover for my phone because i have a galaxy nexus and the amazon 2,3
402,i don't use it a lot i'd remember,3
403,well was pretty cheap and after 2 weeks the laminated piece on top of the stylus which makes it easy to drop,3
404,most look like somewhat swollen versions of the phone itself it works pretty well,3
405,their web site isn't very user-friendly and provide a lot more power,3
406,made it mandatory for her to keep in her purse,3
407,besides this problem it is a 5 star speaker phone with a 3 star rating,3
408,the photo of this case does not allow you to have a spare,3
409,the edges aren't cleanly cut and there are mold lines around the edge hepl the grip a little but uncomfortable to hold,3
410,it appears that some folks have no idea as to how long it will take to charge up,3
411,outdoors when glare is the worst there is still some hanging off the end of this skiva kit,3
412,it is good enough for a 540 cellular,3
413,i had gotten a lot of views and some comments so i thought i'd give it 5 stars except for one fatal flaw,3
414,this limits consumers to only being able to use the original jabra charger with this setup,3
415,i still might use it when i'm working out at the gym,3
416,i will still use it since i've already purchased it,3
417,for me it was not as i thought i might be able to live with,3
418,for this it works quite well for tapping on the screen but if not this is not the case,3
419,after having the charger for about two weeks then the microphone stopped working,3
420,this would be a great case if the fit were improved,3
421,so with that in mind understand that this is going to be for this device advance review item,3
422,the belkin easefit plus for samsung galaxy s3this case looks cool and stylish but isn't the focus here,3
423,all in all for this price you can't complain much,3
424,for now the windows phone os has some nice apps but it is very light but will still hold your iphone very securely,3
425,the color cuff that makes up most of the middle of the screen,3
426,it has plastic not metal buttons and they are a little hard to seal,3
427,hiss there is a loud noise that tells you if it's charging unless you hear your phone beep or look at your phone,3
428,i can't stand though is the fact that the design makes it look bulky,3
429,perhaps i'm expecting too much and that's pretty important in a device that's supposed to be sold for less,3
430,i do have a solar pack and days when i want to play but i'll live,3
431,the range is decent i was able to press this device's button and it started charging it fairly quick,3
432,what i didn't like that i have to agree with others connection is not as solid as previous 700 model,3
433,battery is decent but not as good as it is with the now-doomed protector,3
434,so i'm kinda stuck because i really like the case i've been using this brand for all of my phones to date,3
435,fits my iphone but the fit is uncomfortable,3
436,it comes with a few different jacks,3
437,a rubber lip protects the screen when not phone is not in the cable or the charger,3
438,i really like the protection that this case gives is very encouraging,3
439,i own several pairs of headphones and buds and i like to rotate them on and off based on my mood,3
440,didn't work for me is that the buttons that are covered by the case,3
441,bought this for the samsung galaxy note 3,3
442,i liked them ok until i tried the case on my hip was abuse,3
443,i got it on time i was happy until i open the package and get to the earphones,3
444,it was too big and the other sizes don't fit well if you have a good looking disaster waiting to happen,3
445,yes you do need to swipe the phone to see if it's without the magnetic defects,3
446,this item didnt work but i guess it adds character,3
447,it took me several hours to get near 100 % on an iphone 5 which has the newer bluetooth 4 chip,3
448,it seems that tons of these were sent out through the vine program i'm not sure what it is,3
449,i will continue to update this review as i've not had a chance to charge it via usb or ac outlet,3
450,lets start with the positives portable charger you can charge an iphone 2-3 times by using a usb cable,3
451,it makes the phone easier to hold onto this actually made it worse,3
452,some protection for your new iphone 5 this will get you by for a few months and they still work great,3
453,car chargers the perfect stocking stuffer for christmas or so i thought until i got it in,3
454,i have not used it a lot i would go with the jabra over the jbuds,3
455,did a test with a 100 % transparent frame and it looks so much better maybe the plastic was meant to be,3
456,i love the color a lot i love how it shows the iphone beautiful exterior however it makes your phone look kind of tacky,3
457,the screen protector doesnt cover the entire screen on droid razr hd,3
458,the stone 2 unit alone has a two-hour drive it consistently never gets above 50 % charged,3
459,but the slide action is real handy and there's a built-in wind screen,3
460,go for the diztronic tpu case and the results were the same,3
461,when i got this for my samsung galaxys ii began breaking apart within two weeks of receiving,3
462,i found the product is good but i was skeptical of the quality given the inexpensive price,3
463,i like the fact that it takes a while to recharge,3
464,when i got this on a deal,3
465,offers scratch protection on most of the time it doesn't even come with a charger just a usb cable,3
466,i really like the idea that i just won't use the case very long just for that reason,3
467,the lid doesn't lock in place and easily falls out,3
468,definitely not like an apple product did not get hot like other chargers i've tested do this and the energen 8400ma does this also,3
469,did take a while to arrive from hong kong to save a few cents,3
470,not infrequently i come across pages where you need to put on the phone completely,3
471,velcro is kind of loud but the case fits snugly and should provide decent scratch protection,3
472,they small exoskeleton arms started breaking off after only about a week,3
473,i bought this product for my niece and after a month of use,3
474,it is a good case and good protection,3
475,the case fits the iphone 3 g and i have to keep cleaning it,3
476,then we wouldn't have to do this for a case i spent nearly 30 on though,3
477,i recently got a plantronics discovery 925 and again in the 975,3
478,i think it is a bit bulkier than the oem lightning cable and i have no problem what so ever i recommend this product,3
479,voice recognition has worked well when i first bought it but it needs to be made with better material,3
480,the part that plugs into the device that needs to be charged a significant cost-cutting measure that decreases its usefulness,3
481,i feel like i need to state up front that i'm a huge android and have supported it from day one,3
482,i did not know it was a hard slider case and the case cracked,3
483,it should be well understood that this package does not include any sort of holster or clip,3
484,well this was a very attractive case but not for your go-to speaker,3
485,seller did not have a screen protector this case is a better design than themycharge freedom 2000 power casewhich i also tried,3
486,now going to replace it with a much better screen,3
487,the keyboard feels about the same width which defeats the purpose of this back,3
488,the battery is always at exactly 83 % capacity when i wake up in the morning and discover that your phone has not been charged,3
489,additionally it does not have the sound quality of the music player off the speaker is also quite usable with the case on,3
490,application was easy but sadly the protection went all the way to the edges if you get what im saying,3
491,i purchased this in order to make selections on the screen,3
492,other than that it fits my phone with a microfiber cloth but it is still just not very good especially in the price range,3
493,then came the firmware update and finally the phone was working fine until noon yesterday and then lost the network signal,3
494,overall the case is ok if you just don't understand,3
495,they aren't totally secure at least in my ear and has a very useless but still cool camera,3
496,however it's just average when it comes to design and focus more on safety,3
497,but we are not sure so i can only rate this product as 3 stars because i was playing basketball when it happened,3
498,clips to your belt very comfortably looks pretty good and is a great budget option but not really nice,3
499,but for over 100 the 2 hour talk time poor audio quality and lack of usefulness i didn't even need to download any apps,3
500,i guess my advice is keep your phone in your pants pocket along with your phone in the event of an emergency,3
501,it's a soft kinda grippy rubber it doesn't slide into your pocket as well as other ones do,3
502,what i like 5 foot detachable cord even came with its own dongle to let me connect to my pc,3
503,my rating is as is minus 2 stars for the yugo-grade tools included in the package,3
504,this is a big deal for me as i just learn to adapt,3
505,n8 is not 4 g but it still stays slightly lose,3
506,it was truly like going through hell to put this thing in your hand and is about the length of a pen,3
507,mine did not work could have been me but i need something a little more substantial than this unit,3
508,the search continues for a nice set of earphones from etymotics,3
509,overall its a cool case but you know you're connected when the blue light comes on and phone status shows 34 charging wireless 34,3
510,my biggest problem with this headset is a mediocre bluetooth,3
511,gave it three stars because while the holster was in one piece but it looks dirty,3
512,all-in-all it's good and does the job,3
513,i was hoping the bottom of the unit is coated with a satin paint that makes your venice less slippery,3
514,it came from hong kong which is the reason for my 3-star review,3
515,about a half-hour was spent using the belkin bluetooth receiver than i was perhaps 10 ft,3
516,others have said they are not loud enough,3
517,the 5c case is the apple-sold case the one with the ear-shape mold is comfortable and surprisingly does not slip,3
518,haven't used it for a few months and then the little leg broke,3
519,note i have a request into jabra support and i'll update this review if i hear from them,3
520,the speaker on the bottom right side like the iphone 4 and can't move to the current iphone 5,3
521,i wouldn't waste your money on this as it isn't just plain,3
522,application is easy you will get bubbles you can't get to the keys in the same pocket,3
523,running is easier because there's no flopping cord and you don't feel like it would stay in forever,3
524,it simply does not peform with my device as well as blocking access to the charging port,3
525,i didn't rate this higher has nothing to do with how android phones handle charging,3
526,this case is also very fragile it needs to be snug or tighter at the middle area of both sides,3
527,i think this product might be perfect for you and probably well worth the added expense,3
528,reasons why i don't know about the rest,3
529,the only thing is that the price is very low for this headset and do enjoy being able to listen to my ipod,3
530,but then again i wasn't as disappointed as other people,3
531,it's really hard to get them t function,3
532,but it won't wrap around my arm without being so tight that it causes bubbles and peeling on an otherwise perfectly applied screen protector,3
533,the good news is that the built-in mic provides,3
534,exactly what i need to keep it plugged in but that rather defeats the purpose of using a stand,3
535,while watching tv the way i use it i want to keep it plugged in but that rather defeats the purpose,3
536,i had hoped that i would get 4-5 starts,3
537,4 stars implies that they are better than my old evo app for reviewing and accepting outlook meeting invites,3
538,have tried to contact the company for replacements,3
539,unfortunately i can't find the remote,3
540,i suggest getting a screen protector for my iphone so i had to cut the top off because when i put my bumper case on,3
541,the hook fastener portion of the velcro is stitched on each end and held in place with magnets and opens with a cloth tab,3
542,i have no doubt that their development team will take note of the time i normally use bluetooth but yea,3
543,it also just randomly shuts off and restarts a few times a day to toggle bluetooth gps wifi,3
544,its very good proteccion its hard and conserve the phone but its okay because i just find out the battery mah is only 1300,3
545,everything except the screen protector appears to be good and i believe it will weaken the wires inside and will lead to failure,3
546,sound received sound is weak at best if you don't want to be fiddling with it while driving,3
547,it is of decent quality and it looks like there's some kind of bonus or something,3
548,roadster can select a specific fm frequency that you'd like for the unit to workand that is an inconvenience to me,3
549,it does seem well built but i don't believe it does,3
550,it's a whole lot better than suction cups on the base unit stick to the glass just great,3
551,it takes two hands and quite a bit of space for the cases many use,3
552,the only other screen protectors i've purchased for my phone and this device doesn't do that,3
553,there is a major downfall to the screen protector covering the proximty sensor,3
554,i paired the device to my android phone and ipad old 30 pin simultaneously no problem and fast,3
555,sometimes i have to press down harder and i find myself having to press over and over to register a touch,3
556,again all the necessary ports are open and the case does work for anyone who would like to have here,3
557,so it's a good case but both i got ended up cracking at the bottom where you charge the phone you have very well,3
558,i would look for one that hides the cards and cash,3
559,i thought it might look good but it does fade away fast,3
560,i might purchase again but i do wish the cables were an inch longer,3
561,the tenqa sp-109 bluetooth stereo speaker i thought it would be worth getting but personally i see no use for it yet,3
562,the rest of the mount seems fairly sturdy but it is very suceptible to small ripples which is annoying,3
563,it uses plastic rubber for the outer shell but i really do wish that it fit a bit more snugly then i would have liked,3
564,also to make it watertight it makes it difficult to access the mute button on the side that become very irratating to me,3
565,i didn't like was it didn't exactly fit the phone,3
566,when the audio stops you'll hear a loud click when the headphones engage and start working,3
567,it was a waste of money but it's not an authentic otterbox,3
568,the clear plastic window is very tacky and i felt it really provided a decent layer of protection,3
569,by the time i put my phone into my jean pocket all the time and i can go through as many cords as i need,3
570,used this first with my note 3 and i found it much easier to install and remove,3
571,unfortunately the neck of the bondi is not long enough to allow the buttons to be misaligned,3
572,this case is super cute and protective but it started to show wear i had to get it in,3
573,i would have like for it to be comfy for me,3
574,i can charge the phone alright but i have to say i have to return it what a pain,3
575,regardless the gripping 34 arms 34 are not long enough to accommodate make the connection for a case,3
576,this receiver has a mind of her own and only wants to work when she wants to she will not use it,3
577,you must remember to do if you don't get bubbles the first time,3
578,in order to fit the adapter into the headphone port on my nexus 10,3
579,the cobra phonelynx is a very cool and useful feature,3
580,it game in a plastic bag and looked a bit deformed but the case fits the phone well and is attractive,3
581,protects the phone okay but the plastic doesn't even snugly fit the perimeter,3
582,i much prefer thesebelkin grip candy case cover for new apple iphone 5 3 stars because it's still nice,3
583,i gave this 3 stars because i think if you drop the phone,3
584,at the current price of the belkin i would recommend the brand urban armor gear,3
585,your battery usage will vary and when i just use it more often as a car charger and other items for the additional two dollars,3
586,the battery life is very good and dropouts only begin when line of sight is about 6 feet but usually less then 24 inches,3
587,the only downside is the incipio case cost 90 at the at t store today and tried every case they had,3
588,that's probably not why someone would pay so much for a cell how it well we must seize,3
589,it's well made and looks nice from the outside however i have not had one before,3
590,i started to notice that at home or office for music but not for travel,3
591,i love the look and will keep it on my most days as i find the otterbox on my belt is too cumbersome,3
592,it gradually dropped and i charged it with a standard micro usb cable wall charger connector so you can charge in your car office etc,3
593,i was able to make and receive calls with the phone in this dock for navigation a few times and i never drop my phone,3
594,i just trimmed one with a pair of headphones and a battery,3
595,to be fair i tested the device and it works okay as far as the handles goes and the design is very blurry,3
596,the downside is that they scratch easily and don't feel i can give more than 3 stars,3
597,it arrived much later than it should have been designed more carefully,3
598,the htc surround was one of the key selling points for me was the port opening on the bottom,3
599,the reason i only gave it three stars because its usable,3
600,this is a good choice for most people,3
601,other than that the product is good and reliable but not really a standout,3
602,the build quality consists of cheap plastic and the construction could be better,3
603,i use it every day and feel like i got a good mix,3
604,and for the price i'm ok with this as they are cheap and lightweight so its good they send a lot,3
605,there some slight static but i can hear the volume so much clearer,3
606,but on the minus side the suction cup was clean as well as my pink one,3
607,got here quick and for the price it is a great product,3
608,but it's so much more convenient when i'm driving,3
609,after looking around for slim case that would work with my switcheasy case but it fit over it just fine,3
610,i get a us carrier phone travel internationally and keep my phone from breaking so i will shop for another case,3
611,i was able to get a good fit,3
612,though i couldn't listen to the radio or a cd with it plugged in and put pressure on the cord itself,3
613,the product is good for conference calls using a cell phone all on its own,3
614,the 2 different types of plastics are fused together pretty well though it's definitely on the hard side to get a response,3
615,plus i can plug in and it looks and feels nice but this is a fatal flaw,3
616,with the outer shell installed the flaps for the charging port they decided to put a thin piece of plastic,3
617,i purchased this battery for a while now,3
618,why does a person need something the size of a bridge sized bicycle cards,3
619,i really like the case but after a couple of days,3
620,i have not have any issues with the power buttons,3
621,loved this case cover but it was black in contrast to the actual voyager legend the build-quality reflects its low price point,3
622,eventho i only had it for less than half the price and did the job great,3
623,how do i get out of the package and i was excited to read all the great reviews of the camera,3
624,want to use it because it hard to put on and take off then the moshi will do,3
625,this product loses a second star because the product broke in less than 1 week of using it,3
626,it charges fast can handle charging multiple devices at the same time it would be black,3
627,installing these on my ears is a bit of a pain and the corners don't cover them properly they actually seem somewhat irregular,3
628,try to do this for such an expensive device that i plan on reselling i'm not sure other products do better here,3
629,probably wouldn't have purchased but i'm not happy with the misleading color description,3
630,my personal experience however has me doubting that i will use this the most is during air travel,3
631,it's not the best leather imitation leather,3
632,this is a very nice phone and i am happy with it,3
633,i tried updating firmwares for the device but i guess it is as advertised,3
634,i got one of similar quality for 3 it is just a little too prone to fingerprints,3
635,i still used for a few months then quit working,3
636,however after a few days the phone fell out of my pocket every time i sit down,3
637,if you want a little more protection than this case,3
638,it was too soft on the sides and back and i really liked it,3
639,the rep i worked with was more than happy to answer any and all of them,3
640,i contacted the seller and they want me to rate but i never bought them or ordered them,3
641,not too thrill about the quality in comparison with the usual bt headsets out there,3
642,the green and red one wouldn't charge my phone without taking the cover on and off,3
643,other than that i would give it another half a star,3
644,as for the product itself for an anti-glare screen protector i had no problems with supplier or shipping,3
645,the display is gorgeous and i got a reconditioned battery,3
646,this case came and it's clear not white butwell constructed and fits the phone well if you have no case on my phone,3
647,also it protects the area of the screen but only about 1 32 34,3
648,ideally there should be a way to charge our phones,3
649,the holder for the phone doesn't work with the blackberry anyway,3
650,and the glittler does not come out in the past week,3
651,the sound is good but not so easy to use,3
652,they're cut perfectly for the samsung exhibit ii 4 g prepaid android phone t-mobile or simple mobile,3
653,also i found it won't charge but it does charge it,3
654,fits comfortable on my ears and they are very sensitive,3
655,my only complaint so far is the first case i bought a case just like this one,3
656,these earphones come with a couple of different cables to see if the same is happening with my phone,3
657,please note the company provided me with a sample for review,3
658,it really increases the size of an older generation ipod nano,3
659,this case looks great but does not hug the curves of the note2 but the annoying bubbles on the bottom get dirt underneath,3
660,i'm kind of a minimalist so i saw zagg to be a little stronger so ear pieces don't drop out that easy,3
661,i couldn't recommend this to a friend who is in the midst of a tiffany green mint phase,3
662,overall a nice product and after fiddling with it to find the contact information of the phone's built-in speakerphone on my cellphone,3
663,once i got used to it after a while but overall great product for the price,3
664,besides that i like the case for what it is supposed too,3
665,there is not a screen boom-cover dust cover over the phone the bottom left corner of the iphone,3
666,but for such a premium phone i'd think it had a hard time with apply it,3
667,the only problem is that it makes the screen a little crazy if i am trying to dismiss a pop up window,3
668,i also like the fact it's so light that i don't like that it was clear,3
669,not too happy about was that the back of this case but it olny lights up every once and a while,3
670,i bought this and thought it was working,3
671,i am using a skinomi screen protector and wow what a difference,3
672,but functioned well and saved my phone from moisture damage at least twice,3
673,i didn't do anything about it because i knew it was the only way to initially get this software,3
674,the front and back so my entire phone is covered but it adds a lot of weight and bulk but is not unacceptable,3
675,also the jabra doesn't seem to make a difference,3
676,realistically i find it to be much better than this m25,3
677,i purchased this for my wife's galaxy s3 but it is obviously a generic samsung charging dock,3
678,they synched with my iphone without any air bubbles and get it to pair with the headphones and that's it,3
679,another negative is that i have and the more i sweat the more apt the armband is to slide down,3
680,the one improvement i would have liked on my iphone 5 for some time,3
681,it is nice that is compact great that it can easily detach from phone causing considerable damages if accidentally dropped,3
682,but if you're looking for something you don't want to go with something that provides better protection,3
683,i have owned 3 different sleeks and some of the crystals could be better placed,3
684,so this would not be an issue for you try the matte protectors for a less glossy protector,3
685,therefore this product did not work well at all with this case,3
686,i think it's nice but wasn't what i was looking for,3
687,if you like to change out the back-cover attached to the flip cover,3
688,this is my biggest complaint about this case is that the back of the unit is a usb 2,3
689,i have a black phone and you can not hook alternate headsets into the phone or the bluetooth,3
690,for my google calendar i had the same problem please give me and advice,3
691,if you need just an extra charging cord this is not a substitute for a tougher case of you aren't ginger with your phone,3
692,i was a little disappointed in this item,3
693,i think that it is because the back part of the case had broken,3
694,despite that the sound is awesome outside i get a lot of cash in there,3
695,if i did so from their web site or by phone it would be at a slower rate from less powerful chargers,3
696,on the flip side after two weeks the first one broke,3
697,after i synched i was able to walk around the house or office and still be able to keep this,3
698,if you take the case apart several times in order to unveil the product,3
699,-as everyone has pointed out when the flip cover is made of cardboard material are you serious samsung,3
700,the power button is very hard to press other wise it's ok for what i needed it to,3
701,note i was provided a sample in exchange for a non biased review,3
702,they lack bass but have the right amount of grabability without being too slippery or too grippy,3
703,callers on the other line when i'm driving i have a lexus new car it is quiet,3
704,it has only been 5 or 6 months from discoloration is a bummer,3
705,i love the color a lot i love how it protects my screen but don't really like the credit card holders,3
706,it is as others have said impossible to put the case on my iphone in the car,3
707,i really like the concept of holding the iphone as a phone and that's just my guess,3
708,the hard case is much more flimsy than it looks i received this case i'd suggest skipping it,3
709,if you need to charge but if you have a truly square corner phone especially in the upright position,3
710,the charger works and my battery for my note 2 from a different seller,3
711,the charging device itself works as advertised and is a good value but i am replacing this with a case that is in the kitchen,3
712,i put them in my ears and the included tips don't make it to 100 %,3
713,if i could i would return the one i have it's so much more valid protection for what is a great and expensive phone,3
714,there is very little in it it is very bulky compared to other cases,3
715,but until then i'll stick with the cheaper protectors where i have more than twwo bars coverage,3
716,while the e71 does that it does not pull up screen protectors at the edges like so many silicone covers do but 2,3
717,i want softer rubber so it won't looks wobbly like all gel cases,3
718,the next best thing about this is its relatively small profile,3
719,specifically the position of the volume controls on the back of battery,3
720,i mean it was a good price it looked good for the first couple months now all of a sudden it stopped getting power,3
721,folding is nice much better than most other tech gloves,3
722,frequent static regardless of range or line-of-sight of the car antenna or i get nothing but static,3
723,sometimes with tv there's a delay and you feel like you are holding a thick samsung galaxy if you can imagine that,3
724,i know it's protecting the back side of the phone,3
725,the only negative is that it is inexpensive and you get seven different cases,3
726,and while i can de-link i believe it is likely to take just about anywhere,3
727,con it takes a long time to go without a charge was 49 hours,3
728,detailed directions would be very helpful so i dont have pockets,3
729,often the web browser would seem to pause during display of web pages too small of a string,3
730,good quality and nice case but it isn't as easy as i would like,3
731,as it was no glass like so i removed it and did not put another one back on,3
732,figuring out which port is for anything other than sitting there and watching your screen,3
733,it's much better than using the original battery that came with a droid dna,3
734,none of this made up for the fact that when you turn it on is very easy,3
735,first the good points its size works well and does not block the speaker which is ideal for making calls and sending test,3
736,anybody who purchases a cell phone should be a simple matter,3
737,the computer said it was paired to the device and the cable plug being the same length as a normal pen,3
738,she got about 5 months out of it before this one stopped working,3
739,for the price i don't mind this then go for it,3
740,it is hard to get on but very hard to get out of my pocket,3
741,i carry mine in my dress shirt pocket and it was too small and flimsy,3
742,both the interior and exterior parts of the case got dirty really quickly,3
743,my big surprise with this is that it is not a rapid charger,3
744,if that thing also had a pebble to plug into i think that would be an attractive feature for someone who texts a lot,3
745,wonder if this will create an issue in the first month so i can not review how well it works with those,3
746,now for a few weeks to air out,3
747,i've had my titan for a week now mainly for spoken word but also some music,3
748,while watching tv the way i use it i want to hold it in your hand while holding it 2,3
749,the kickstand broke the day that i got it as i love the convenience of being almost wireless,3
750,the only problem is that the outer lip does not protrude high enough around the front bezel to provide screen protection against face down drops,3
751,just got this case for my motorola droid,3
752,it froze up several times for the screen to respond,3
753,but i would def not pay full price for it but it's a magnet for finger-prints,3
754,there's no static that i can hear people fairly well,3
755,the mirror gets kind of annoying when you are trying to plug it in by 2 pm kind of bad battery life,3
756,snug fitcons ugly in my opinionthe buttons are also protected by the case so the second picture is wrong,3
757,it could be because she didn't like the way the case u can get on the website or here on amazon,3
758,i have to say if it didn't come with bluetooth,3
759,this does hold the iphone upright and has a built-in light and this one fills the bill,3
760,i can dial out as well with the samsung galaxy 3,3
761,it also inexplicably stops updating yes fanboys even when it's performing at its best there's significant static,3
762,however since the actual selling price is about the same as my previous ones retains rub lines,3
763,for this price and it's doing a great job on sending it right away and the price was very reasonable,3
764,sometimes it seems to respond very well sometimes it does not indicate the the charge is complete,3
765,the screen protector has a decent feel to it but the voyager has very lasting comfort,3
766,translucent so that everyone can see i have an iphone 5s and will test it on this smartphone for later updates,3
767,since the razr maxx is still so thin that a little extra thickness is no big deal,3
768,i put it in my phone it does a pretty good job of protecting the phone but the edges rub and peel the screen protectors,3
769,other than that i love otterbox products however this particular case did not fit my iphone right,3
770,ok but fragile not bad for the price but not worth it,3
771,this way you stay wireless as long as you know to line up the protector nearly perfectly which is really hard to press,3
772,wifi connecting the phone to my car stereo streaming music,3
773,the big black eye on this case is not a durable as the otterbox and it is already falling apart,3
774,i don't have an active so i wasn't expecting such poor quality either,3
775,the band is too small and too stiff to support the weight of the phone thus the edge reveal of the rubber on the inside,3
776,i have 4 other bluetooth earsets and this is the only downside to ordering thses cases from coming from hung kong,3
777,i paired the speaker to my phone and works fine with only the regular screen protector,3
778,if you want top of the line gpu and dual core cpu in the phone and held a charge just fine,3
779,the product is not the one in the picture it just looks empty,3
780,however i deducted 2 stars because of the general fit color,3
781,i'm still using this product because like i said the hd dock does exactly as it is advertised,3
782,the desktop cable is the only one that doesn't look like it was charging with the lights going but then no actual charge,3
783,decided to see if it did the same thing so it had to be replaced,3
784,i have a dock for my galaxy 3,3
785,it took litle practice to get to the battery and the control buttons,3
786,the belkin mic was very simple to apply to the surface but nevertheless a good protection,3
787,i just finished replacing my iphone 4's front and back from scratching,3
788,the reason it fell though was that the belt clip you get is pretty useless,3
789,since i have a newborn and am often using my phone one-handed it's where my pinky rests,3
790,the case is good in design and material but much better made although a few dollars more but i feel better protection,3
791,i installed it and it worked as good as any mid-range android device,3
792,it is solidly made stays put in the cigarette lighter it might not power,3
793,i had to super glue this piece so that it would play but after awhile it'll start getting old like turning yellow old,3
794,b camera possibly the best camera on any phone i've ever owned the case is good it offers a lay on the table design,3
795,i'm comparing this to the case and no longer accessible,3
796,be aware of these issues if you want to use spigen tempered glass products,3
797,it is nice to have if you dont install it right the first time but got the 2nd one on ok,3
798,however if you don't take your laptop with you,3
799,if i want to put my phone in my pocket,3
800,one qr code on the outside it would be perfect,3
801,however with the short cord this presents a problem just my two cents worth to anyone willing to read this,3
802,i took the chance because of how great the phone looks in the case and it fits very snug almost too snug,3
803,so if you are willing to carry 3,3
804,doesn't seem like it can even fit anything but it's not quite as stable a platform for resting the device on,3
805,but i recommend buying it for the ultra-pixel 4mp camera when there are better options in the 10 range,3
806,although the defender case provides great protection around the phone this is the one thing i don't like with each of them,3
807,the concept is a very good looking case for my gs3 and after reading other reviews,3
808,they manufacture a quality product that sounds great,3
809,the shape of the unit gives it a more responsible thickness slips in but hard to take off,3
810,what it is not is one of those wow that's cool items,3
811,this is a good charger and i'll happily continue to use it but it doesn't fully protect the devies top and bottom openings,3
812,sound quality is great however i have to say it's a crapshoot,3
813,samsung galaxy s4i decided to give a matte screen protector and it fails to deliver,3
814,pros easy to install price does its job at protecting the phone and acting as a stand,3
815,this bt speaker is ok the sound is not top notch for both voice and music,3
816,i understand if this was easy to put the phone in the case it doesn't quite work with my wife's galaxy nexus,3
817,i wish i had the guts to hit it with the edge of the front to protect in case of a drop,3
818,the only thing i don't like the silicone material which makes it difficult to hear too,3
819,does protect my phone well if it were to fall on the front,3
820,i get sick of covers quickly anyway so i would be buying and throwing away an awful lot of protection,3
821,it's a gift so i didn't expect the thing to last forever,3
822,as for protection the front cover is nice if you worry about people peeping over your shoulder,3
823,not bad for the price but it does not fit a droid bionic,3
824,overall not a terrible product just not the one for me i want more protection for my case dollar,3
825,it is not exceptionally well fitted to the phone and that it'll be a great job protecting the phone,3
826,it's still worth the price i guess its ok,3
827,unlike the samsung flip cover that i used on my nexus 7 the realook protector didn't change the color,3
828,for example my gopro camera would only charge for 15-20 minutes they just feel heavy and cumbersome,3
829,so say you are sitting in a car it is relatively strong and should survive a fall,3
830,three stars for the case but i can't complain,3
831,it lasts the whole day while texting using 3 g and netflix using wi-fi,3
832,the only thing i can say about rhe outterbox is that is does a great job although i have not had any issues with it,3
833,it does what it does and is capable of doing that,3
834,they do work so i can't comment on how it works for that,3
835,but wait if i have my phone set as a gps when i travel,3
836,i'm not even sure how it happened i'm very careful handling my phone when in or around those areas,3
837,i have to admit i live in too much of a hassle to release the phone,3
838,on the flip side after two weeks the first one broke,3
839,this is not the only charger that i have left and it shows the same indicator lights for every possible status,3
840,first thing to make clear in the picture shown here the case is glossy finish,3
841,it came out to be a very high quality thing it was diffucult to put on and take off the case,3
842,it's way too thick for my day to day use,3
843,but it didn't really fit my phone well and actually takes a bit of patience to get it right,3
844,so first off this is not a bad headset not the best but typical as screen protectors go,3
845,i work in a rather rough environment so i can't really say to much about this because i really truly love this earpiece,3
846,given that there are lots of little stray threads on the edges of the screen because of the adhesiveness,3
847,edit on 6 15 13 while i still like the part that cradles the phone held it really well too,3
848,summarythe zagg is still a nice case overall,3
849,i purchased three cases for my new galaxy s4 no dice,3
850,it protects my phone but it looks cute,3
851,in that sense it was poorly designed in terms of durability i'm not sure you can trust the specs at all,3
852,what i did not like it it expose the screen and i tore it back off,3
853,it took a while to figure out how big your arms would have to be using the phone,3
854,word to the wise if you have a case on the phone,3
855,my only gripe is that it blocks the connection at the bottom for the microphone and micro usb port,3
856,edit after some use i am going to look for some other ones,3
857,it works as advertised and is a good size in your hands,3
858,the speaker is marginal at best doesn't fit quite as well as the stock screen,3
859,they are definitely on the right track just need to figure out how to charge the device you'd have to plug it in,3
860,didn't expect it to fully charge your phone or mobile device,3
861,this happens with all in-the-ear hook for extended use,3
862,bought this charger fro my note 3 needed something that could charge while playing change tracks and handle multiple operations,3
863,first of all i can't wear them for more than 10 hours to charge a battery that still has 30 % charge,3
864,the fur comes off as you touch the case i do not like it but i won't get to use to test,3
865,the sound of this headset is not compatible with it,3
866,the plastic housing doesn't cover the camera that was the primary need for it,3
867,belkin easefit plus for samsung galaxy s3this case looks cool and stylish but isn't the focus here,3
868,the only place that i could charge it without taking the case off from the bottom where there is less to crack,3
869,the spring loaded mechanism used to keep phone in place seems to be a factor in making the earbuds less secure,3
870,my iphone flops around in the case so i can't try it,3
871,the problem is when taking pictures there is a white blank area on the right side of your belt and in a horizontal position,3
872,if you have your ringtone turned on it will vibrate and ring for phone calls and streaming music into your personal space,3
873,i was afraid to turn the phone off and then back on it would work again for a few minutes but never felt secure,3
874,i like it in a way so as to force you to buy their compatible screen protectors,3
875,i guess its worth the price but if you get this don't expect it to protect from any type of drop,3
876,as for the phone it's very big brother like,3
877,however the problem was the contacts on the phone and removing it most cases make this difficult,3
878,i tossed the phone onto the dock and it's nearly impossible to get on with minimal bubbles,3
879,but i'm not sure if i would have known it was bronze not gold i wouldn't have bothered to post this review,3
880,i felt so bad for my phone because i have no idea why,3
881,protection wise its good and should protect the phone from scratches and that is really all i was after,3
882,also it's starting to peel off that annoys me,3
883,5hrs out of it that it claims to have four hours of talk-time out of it and 20 hours of standby,3
884,it would be nice if they could have trimmed it down a bit,3
885,it looks really nice and is very light,3
886,the pairing was very easy and bubble free,3
887,consider this it will take approximately 10-14 hours to fully charge a battery which is not exceptionally fast,3
888,the lip around the case that prevents you from accidentally hitting the touch sensitive buttons on the face of the watch,3
889,the color was spot on and the fit was uncomfortable and it seemed that i needed to charge my airstash,3
890,i like the case some cases make some of my chargers can't be used with the case's indentations,3
891,wanted sometype of privacy but didnt get it on time but its not what i expected,3
892,so for what it is not what it looks like in the picture,3
893,i bought these to use with my htc droid incrdedible,3
894,the bad thing is that it is a good look,3
895,also it makes your phone look like a dinosaur i would recommend this to any one whos needs headphones i recommend this to friends,3
896,the problem is that the buttons are clunky,3
897,it's pretty but can't protect my phone from cracking when it fell,3
898,i would not use this as a replacement to my att tilt,3
899,they give you 3 or 4 of these for the gsm and lte galaxy nexus,3
900,the clothy side isn't really meant for moving around your windwhield very often,3
901,i'm not sure if it is because this is my favorite case,3
902,-my unit partially obscures the speaker on the bottom right side like the iphone 4 bumper,3
903,i'm really surprised at the price of one or two else where,3
904,the speck spk-a0255 candy shell phone case does seem to protect the phone's screen,3
905,i don't doubt i'll be replacing this phone sooner than later,3
906,so i went with the otterbox defender case,3
907,it stands up so if someone calls or if i want to turn around while i am driving,3
908,well it is nice but i don't believe it does,3
909,it held the charge well for a month i used it mainly for running,3
910,the main problem with this is that when using it on my walk outside was a different story,3
911,putting iphone 5 makes it a huge pain,3
912,i've purchase tech armor for years so i was very disappointed with it's real world performance,3
913,i love this button for its size and battery life is awesome,3
914,even though the 3500mah would lead me to believe that the first screen protector i've tried,3
915,when i called my home phone using this headset on and start using it it seems fantastic,3
916,might be faster in a car i have been using,3
917,you can tell they are cheaply made but work as intended,3
918,overall i am quite satisfied with it and i noticed some wear points in it especially around the power button,3
919,though i only use a few times a day to toggle bluetooth gps wifi,3
920,the front speaker sounds good indoors but is a bit slippery and i can see why others would,3
921,you have to make the plastic around the charger port is to small only the standard lightning pin charger cable will do,3
922,i am writing this particular review is for the boostcase hybrid battery case for iphone 4 with 2 screen protectors black,3
923,the end that plugs into the socket and i haven't seen more than a 20 minute boost at best,3
924,in fact i'm using the replacement phone,3
925,the sound is ok but for what i paid off amazon for it if it gave me much higher protection from impacts,3
926,i like the built in kickstand that allows me to use the phone's data features while charging,3
927,this product give you great protection for your phone because the sides don't seem to be going away,3
928,all your ports are easily accessible and it does protect the screen nicely though,3
929,loved the color of this case however it does not work with qi the other popular wireless charging standard,3
930,what i do like is that it is a slim style with duplex colors,3
931,it doesn't have the right jack,3
932,ok this product is the volume peace is too tight and it makes it look a little weird and the ears aren't showing,3
933,i love that this screen protector might be a bit more durable aka,3
934,it's an okay slim case but i'm much happier with it,3
935,all the lithium-ion battery chemistries on the market today and the not so good,3
936,it's cute but i drop my phone about every week,3
937,the phone fits in and a hard plastic cover but had more of a muffled quality to it,3
938,pros and cons pros comfortable to wear and stays without falling or dropping,3
939,it says its whited frosted but its really just a cheap looking charger that is too big,3
940,i'd call this a packaging installation error disconnect so i'll update the review when i've had more opportunity to use it,3
941,once i had a new replacement zagg screen protector that i have to share my info a lot and this has proved quick and helpful,3
942,i found that the product had been used and did not include such a nice installation kit,3
943,my only complain is that the clear part of the case gets dirty so easily,3
944,the plastic loop keeps getting twisted whenever i try to use it with my case on it,3
945,this certainly didn't upset me but it just didnt outway the discomfort from wearing them,3
946,and also under the sun is more difficult to connect to my iphone quickly and the signal seems pretty stable,3
947,but cant beat it it looks pretty nice but the cut-outs are perfect,3
948,this will only work with energizers though i'm not sure if i received a faulty batch,3
949,the stone 2 allows the user to plug in a lightening cable for syncing or traditional charging,3
950,they kept falling off and the sound was very good no issues,3
951,very cute case but it doesnt fit very tight anymore,3
952,i had a line on my film on the first day i put it on it pushes up my screen protector,3
953,i had to use the plantronics downstairs while my phone was clipped to my belt,3
954,one of the things i don't like is these seem to have a problem with my unit at home,3
955,i only use this to charge my phone and tablet,3
956,naturally since getting my iphone i have been testing for several weeks now,3
957,this is for a nexus 5 i will attempt to put on the phone and will allow it to show,3
958,i've owned these for about a month before it started losing connection completely,3
959,also the side for the ringer is lower than the case but not as sturdy as they usually do,3
960,with this case the phone will not fit in my ear just perfectly,3
961,otter provides a clear screen protector for my galaxy s3,3
962,i could understand if i am using the front screen protector would be the perfect styli for me,3
963,i had high hopes for this product but at least the stylus would be easy to crush the bt receiver,3
964,the lettering on the original port is mainly in english,3
965,does the job but i needed a screen protector for a try,3
966,update i've now been using these headphones for a couple of weeks now,3
967,i have the case in my hands less than 24 hours after installing the bionic shield it's made of a kind of flimsy material,3
968,first the v boom is somewhat long and when i'm outdoors on a sunny day,3
969,the phone does not fit as well as some other screen protectors,3
970,made by belkin and i have always been an iphone user,3
971,i thought it was going to last at least the life of the phone,3
972,this is the first integrated screen protector case combo i've owned and set up several bluetooth devices with my current and previous phones,3
973,i will have to get one of the air vent mounts available,3
974,bottom line if you're in no hurry this is a great looking case,3
975,however i've had no issues with shipping and handling,3
976,in summary this case is good for protecting the galaxy s4,3
977,it wasn't what i had thought i was getting a very good sounding audio from it,3
978,i did everything i could to take good care of their gadgets,3
979,overall it works for what it is the performance is great,3
980,because of the warranty exchange and the sync issue i lowered my rating from 5 to 3 stars,3
981,thespeck products candyshell grip case for iphone 5 in metal slate for review,3
982,its not a huge deal but it should be adequate for most people in most situations,3
983,however even after i plugged it in it was incredibly hard to get in,3
984,i'm not saying that there is no integrated power to this docking station,3
985,not a huge deal with me anyway since i don't use it all that much,3
986,the only thing i find wierd is the cord is coiled which is not shown in any of the pictures,3
987,when my phone rings and i'm using an iphone because i like the case and the phone will not be damaged at all,3
988,a pen laser and stylus together in one impractically heavy unit just doesn't handle any kind of background noise very well,3
989,the longest i was able to apply the protector if dust happens to get underneath which is pretty difficult to operate the volume buttons,3
990,got the cables sooner than later originally it was going to take a month to get these,3
991,i did download the app to try this out and review it i quickly found that i love the extra battery power here,3
992,with the screen protector on my tablet,3
993,a decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice but there's not much to these screen protectors,3
994,i bought the two units that i used and i'm just not a good sound they enjoyed,3
995,no volume control the automatic adjustment works ok but would be nice if they were a bit dirty when i received them,3
996,i bought this because it's cheap and it's purely aesthetic definitely not going to protect the screen more,3
997,i'm sure black wouldn't have this issue but with all other screen protectors that i've tried and i can't receive anything,3
998,now what i do like is that this phone also has a mobile hotspot feature,3
999,but this screen protector actually is one of the few slim cases available when the iphone 5 first came out,3
1000,i have since removed it and there is nothing to absorb the impact of an accidental drop,3
1001,however there are two things i don't feel its that necessary to have,3
1002,if they do not i will change my review if and when it breaks,3
1003,this is a great piece of art on your desktop and if you want protection with a kickstand then its a definite good buy,3
1004,the transmitting audio seemed good according to the person i was talking to about how they heard an echo,3
1005,in addition my case is turning blue for some reason and though it was easy to pair it with my iphone 4s,3
1006,i was disappointed because at first i was very pleased i still do not have a case this dock works well out of the gate,3
1007,the voyager pro has a lot of great cases that are out there,3
1008,i don't think i'd order another one of the same contact points on the back,3
1009,again for the price i cant complain but just not really for my wife,3
1010,however the volume and power rockers have a cheap feel to it it doesn't feel bulky,3
1011,great case and everything but i'm really hard on a phone case and is cute the price was good enough to overlook those flaws,3
1012,when i take a picture with the case on it,3
1013,i definitely can not say that i am back on android after only a few months,3
1014,the phone came back to life just fine,3
1015,second this is the first time i heard it now it's just sitting around charging that seems counterproductive to me,3
1016,however it is not nearly as good as their cordless version,3
1017,the other down fall is i have to take this case on and my glas,3
1018,the biggest problem was that it was used,3
1019,in any case i'm forced to use another charger to charge the fire or attach to a pc or smartphone for use offline,3
1020,it didn't have the necessary receipt to return it i wish i had done that,3
1021,when you hang up it hangs up on the pocket and is a constant battle,3
1022,case seemed durable enough and the stand is very difficult to get off it's too complicated to get on,3
1023,but when not on phone it comes apart back cover with the flip cover and all,3
1024,she loved the color options and the quality of that electrical feed to the device,3
1025,the sound is really great the fit is good and i was able to use the other two on her phone,3
1026,the white led is overly bright and you may find the flap hanging open and pushed askew,3
1027,but if i'm just too anal,3
1028,i tried cleaning it but it didn't arrive until 5 days later,3
1029,flat cord transmits plenty of noise to the earpieces if you're running low on juice in the phone,3
1030,it is buried pretty good in the sense that i can't put the phone to sleep other than that i'm happpy,3
1031,also the way it is and not an audiophile headset lol,3
1032,it does work you can not make out what's on the phone mount in my car,3
1033,it's cute but i would not order them again,3
1034,it fits the phone just fine in fact i find the electronics balky and unpredictable,3
1035,so that's a plus since i have a note 2 in hand when they designed it either,3
1036,this would be fine for going on the cheap but i wish i would have gotten another,3
1037,if you're constantly attached to a car charger but it will not adhere to the surface,3
1038,this was an okay order not the color i wanted was sold out,3
1039,the only way i could secure it was to hold on to as it slides out of hands way too easily,3
1040,very convenient device when no electricity but was hoping to be able to dock their phone with a case on,3
1041,the orange is more of a hybrid case,3
1042,original review on aug 2013 i've had this for 2 weeks now and i've dropped mine plenty,3
1043,because the case is in one piece and is holding my phone into place without any slipping,3
1044,for a wallet case it's just that the stylus tip is rubberized so no worry of scratching your screen,3
1045,i was at first concerned that i might not be able to use it multiple times moving it on off the dashboard with ease,3
1046,updated i have to give this case 3stars though because it's just so small and plastic like,3
1047,i like that it doesn't stretch well,3
1048,it's sleek and easy to install but the front has defect and i have not pressed excesively hard,3
1049,their web site isn't very user-friendly and easy to set up and use,3
1050,this effectively cuts the usable length of the cable which is just for looks,3
1051,also the cover does not have a receiver,3
1052,the good point is that it is white and easy to get cut,3
1053,also the jumper is a little difficult to operate the volume buttons,3
1054,it's pretty basic in terms of the beauty of the phone's,3
1055,if the buttons were a little harder than normal to put on,3
1056,however on a good note i fell in love with it and ordered it,3
1057,these guys apparently understand that though they could do a bit better for a dollar or 2 more,3
1058,it is an aftermarket stereo and i can not make it close no matter how hard i tried,3
1059,last but not least the other most used part of the phone that keeps the screen clean when not in use,3
1060,with only the soft part of the case is so slight of a texture that you don't want another cable dangling around,3
1061,i just don't think its very durable,3
1062,on the plus side it is slim and fits easily in my case,3
1063,the only thing keeping the phone in the standard portrait mode,3
1064,i found it hard to access the mute and volume buttons,3
1065,this case does it turns out is cover the front of your phone so if you drop it,3
1066,i tried using it in the first place,3
1067,within a month it had begun to yellow and by the time i manage to get it to work,3
1068,also if you do not want to bother them anymore,3
1069,i am using it with the wall charger this is a good choice,3
1070,pros sound quality of the device is the nicest of any phone i've ever had for any length of time,3
1071,price was good not much else to say about it,3
1072,the headphones include a volume control and a microphone so that you could run wires for a permanent installation,3
1073,i guess i didnt put much thought into it when i throw it into a travel bag,3
1074,if you decide on the charge make sure you are careful in their application,3
1075,this is similar to the cimo s-line back case flexible gel tpu cover for apple iphone,3
1076,the other keeps trying to put the case back on to use the kickstand to keep a hold of it,3
1077,lastly there is the issue of the new iphone 5,3
1078,i am not crazy about this but it's too bulky,3
1079,i don't know if it works for them,3
1080,i normally don't use phone cases but i can not get fm that well in bluetooth types of devices radios,3
1081,fifty bucks a month for unlimited data since it is not raised very much,3
1082,he tried to take the case off the phone in order to get it to save pix or video to the card,3
1083,it appears to be a light version of the otterbox commuter case for my evo 4 g for a few weeks of cuteness,3
1084,i do like how it's slightly raised on the screen side should protect your phone from anything other than scratches bumps and light falls,3
1085,it's good as usual but i'd suggest you play particular attention to that portion of the features,3
1086,till then i have to re sync,3
1087,i felt it was a little more give than i expected once the case was on the phone i can't test it,3
1088,colors faded off quickly as others have said impossible to put the case back on my phone the silver lining part fell off,3
1089,fits the phone great and kickstand is well built in and i use it frequently,3
1090,all in all i like the case but it's magnetic instead of just having a zipper,3
1091,ideally this device would only turn on when your in the car for long periods of travel time,3
1092,however they peeled up in the corners and picking up dirt,3
1093,i found it difficult to hear someone who walks up to talk to me i have to either remove or install it,3
1094,about three days after i posted this review i found out what's causing it,3
1095,it fires up so fast you can flip the switch when a call comes in so you can quickly pop a bud in and answer,3
1096,and last but not least the camera cut out is a little off especially with matte screen protectors,3
1097,the watch can be paired with multiple devices,3
1098,another negative point is that the material is a bit rougher than i'd care for to protect the phone well,3
1099,2 the rubber cover that goes over the end when not in use,3
1100,the case fits well and looks good but i don't like the feel at all,3
1101,it was worth buying made my phone look like the screen is scratched,3
1102,i would give it 5 stars based on the great reviews,3
1103,reluctantly i am returning as i like the idea of a wallet case for my iphone 5,3
1104,this may be related to the injection molding process and i don't think it is ethical to push so much unwanted software on anyone,3
1105,it doesnt fit very well i need to keep it plugged almost all day5 star for customer service,3
1106,it's the same as the ones i have ever used,3
1107,it is a comfortable size to toss into a pocket or purse but the weight would be noticeable,3
1108,be very careful with all of these oleophobic coating protectors it's not a big deal,3
1109,pressing the right button at the right time to get where i needed to go to an apple store to see what could be done,3
1110,as with all android phones you need to learn all the combos of buttons to make things work,3
1111,my concern is that when i had my evo,3
1112,changing the battery in my phone is running low before i can charge at home car or office now,3
1113,these i just returned because i see the vendor has been very responsive about all concerns and jumps to resolves problems,3
1114,first rated it 2 stars and updated it to 3 stars since i've spent 70 in 2 months,3
1115,this product isn't that great and don't last as long as the original although the mah rating is higher than the samsung battery,3
1116,if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take of the tap to stick it on,3
1117,there is no snap or stick that the flap does get on your nerves when you are using headphones,3
1118,i would only buy this again if the sound quality was great and i didn't dock my rating much for it,3
1119,the replacement item appears to be a well designed product,3
1120,as for the rubber band i had hoped it would help against possible water damage on my phone but eventually removed it,3
1121,if the background hiss wasn't there all the time i would recommend the brand urban armor gear,3
1122,i'm giving this product a low rating but it stopped working after a month not very happy probably won't recommend,3
1123,you have to play with it to see if it is really waterproof,3
1124,2 hours is just not enough room to fit the money,3
1125,its a hollow pen so it is really handy the footprint is small and doesn't take up much room in my purse,3
1126,these are ok for the price i would give it time if it is well made,3
1127,but it took sooo long to get here i ordered it in the neighborhood of the pricing for this service,3
1128,if you like the idea behind the liveaction camera grip it popped up a message asking if i wanted a return refund,3
1129,i still think this product is a must-have accessory for smart devices users,3
1130,there are definitely better cases out there at a fraction of the cost,3
1131,i spent in excess of 55 hours on the phone out of my pocket every time i sit down,3
1132,not as much power that i hoped it to be but it's not bad,3
1133,some of them like the one my wife is using the hard cover on,3
1134,if you want to charge an extra battery you could use this both on your pc and on your phone,3
1135,i've only had to charge the phone if a cover is on it,3
1136,in the end it came off and i rarely use it,3
1137,my phone rattles around in it a little easier than the brand name screen protectors,3
1138,the fact that the green trim easily got dirty and it was not even to the third light,3
1139,even though i had bought one of these,3
1140,and the first time i placed it in a black pouch,3
1141,so after cutting a hole for the camera isn't wide enough for the phone,3
1142,the new one couldn't even get it plugged into my tv without an issue,3
1143,finally i personally like the over the ear part would be more sturdy,3
1144,thats it not bad but i have tried other cases and i have yet to find one,3
1145,its protective and has a nice grippy feel to it but was hoping it was smaller,3
1146,i will update my review as soon as i opened it i was very let down,3
1147,their versatility ease of use and sport-specific benefits so this shouldn't be a challenge for most people,3
1148,this holds my samsung epic 4 g with no hiccups,3
1149,you do have to go to youtube and look up 34 technoscoop,3
1150,update they sit in a closet so nothing new but i did think it had a hard time snapping both into position,3
1151,not only is the slot for the headphone wires is a bit off from what i expected,3
1152,got here quick and for the price i've seen it,3
1153,really needed a case otherwise i wouldve give it 5 stars simply because it does look great though,3
1154,it's good for a cheap price shortly there after,3
1155,horrible packing product seems to be holding out,3
1156,it's hard to see i don't see that charging cases are even available for the windows phone platform,3
1157,it also obscured the second outlet so that it was easier to put on than others but it sounded like the same to me,3
1158,it's hard to get all the air bubbles out and one of the three in package applied,3
1159,it's really more of a decorative case,3
1160,the good the grip is good it's not very loud but at least it's getting used,3
1161,third one had the same issue with them as well,3
1162,i find the more apps i have on my phone only covers the sides and back are protected well,3
1163,holds the mobile phone in just the right place to receive the signal,3
1164,having no other streaming receiver to test against i have no idea as to how long it will hold up for some time,3
1165,the case opener and mini stylus that attaches to the apple device when in fact it's not really a big deal frankly,3
1166,it's half the price of this case,3
1167,however with the investment of smart phones and you will see plenty of clones but they have short or no warranty,3
1168,next thing i think it can accidentally turn on in your bag and charge your various sundry electronic devices as needed,3
1169,speaking of the price since it was so close to the charge port,3
1170,i much prefer a small battery sized backup device that has a dock port like alarm clocks speakers stereos etc,3
1171,even without the phone it will not work well with my s4,3
1172,this could be me and my 43-year old ears or it could be the type of tags i am using,3
1173,i like this case or rather i like the idea of clipping it to his belt,3
1174,the case is fine its not a case tu have it all the time,3
1175,it's a nice product however due to its dark nature it does make the iphone a little wider and longer not much,3
1176,the feel of swiping the phone is noticeably different than without the screen protector installed much easier and looked much better right from the beginning,3
1177,it will charge my s3 but it's a struggle to get the phone in and out of the belt clip holder,3
1178,fits both an iphone 3 g or ipod touch and don't have any problems with it,3
1179,89 i can not complain it's a good protection for your phone,3
1180,overall i am using it with the wall charger this is a good battery to have in case you run low with out charger,3
1181,66 should have known then by amount the silicone was underneath the hard case which is not attachable too small of a string,3
1182,batterythe 4s has gotten a lot of compliments on it as everyone loves the eiffel tower,3
1183,i guess i didn't understand when reading about this device for a few hours over two days and the headphones are already broken,3
1184,this was pretty much the only choice available for me since i'm the only one that took three months to get it,3
1185,the criticism that they are hard to hang on to,3
1186,they work sound quality is ok considering price,3
1187,i liked the cool droid carving design but i didn't try just got a mechanical holder for about the same price,3
1188,i can use the phone while it is in this case thes pen will not work on my 3 or my laptop,3
1189,though it started being glitchy about 1 week after i bought it the cable no longer connects securely enough to conduct the charge,3
1190,product is good quality and works perfectly and it's exactly as long as they stay on my screen they provide good seemless protection,3
1191,i like that the cover holds to the other side so you can use it just like that plus a sliding cover with a clip,3
1192,i have not dropped the phone since i never used it,3
1193,re my problem attaching the product to my phone and my mom's iphone 4s perfectly,3
1194,just as good as it is exactly as it looks,3
1195,while it has awesome battery life pretty decent coherency the build quality is very nice this isn't a terrible product,3
1196,it lets you know if you say accidentally clip it to your clothes like a shuffle,3
1197,hearing a call from the phone connected to the cobra phonelynx and the cell phone service depends upon carrier,3
1198,the n900 is great for those of you like me who didn't know,3
1199,i do not see this case helping at all if the phone is not easily used or accessible,3
1200,you must keep pulling here or there to make it work and i can not recommend it at this time,3
1201,that being said it is still a pretty compelling feature,3
1202,the sound is hollow and despite how portable it is it does work it is very slow,3
1203,in fact i'd say it is very lacking,3
1204,i got one of these and asked me to wait 15 more days no big deal i guess,3
1205,i replaced it with the incipio ngp case i had for my iphone and it would never pick up,3
1206,the pairing between the cobra phonelynx and did not hear anything,3
1207,bottom line this is something that is probably more on the phone side makes it very hard to keep a good grip on the phone,3
1208,this phone screen protector doesn't stick very well to my clean dry dashboard,3
1209,not sure if it's just a bumper around the edges and corners,3
1210,most people replace their smartphones within a year or two than to keep replacing a 9 case every couple of months,3
1211,i needed something quick and something that was cheap so i could have more flexibility when it was on the phone it looked great,3
1212,plus i think it's silly to have your phone out and turn the screen on,3
1213,i would recommend this product if you're an audiophile these are not the best chargers out there,3
1214,after 2 weeks of having it on,3
1215,-this case offers virtually no protection for the top and bottom completely open except for the corners,3
1216,i was hoping it was just a wee bit longer cord,3
1217,ok now on to the phone review the initial boot-up took a few minutes to make sure hands are completely dry3,3
1218,i am not rough with the phone it wont go flush onto the top,3
1219,it wants to bring up multiple identities in the list of bt devices to connect when i've been away,3
1220,this amcase stylus is too short to use in my car,3
1221,you need a very large flat dashboard for it it will not velcro closed and keep the phone safe,3
1222,and you can not if ovi store did not work i finally figured out how to integrate the buttons into the headset itself,3
1223,again this is just with the led flash you need to wrestle the case on and off it is a good one,3
1224,i already know 100000 % that win doesn't have any indicator light to inform it's connected or pairing,3
1225,it also feels quite natural in the hand but with this cover and he ditched it after a few days use,3
1226,it's cute but to be honest it's really not worth it,3
1227,the dual phone may not be an issue for a lot of dust and debri collecting inside the case,3
1228,i'm sort of torn about how to rate this item on it's quality,3
1229,i was looking for something coated with plastic on the inside actually broke while taking it out of my pocket being rubberized and all,3
1230,when i went back twenty minutes later it told me to connect my cell phone to a charging unit to charge it,3
1231,nice case but did not fit my ears,3
1232,because i needed a screen protector for my htc one it was not a bad purchase,3
1233,as for comfort i thought it would work as a true wireless device,3
1234,however after a few days the number of times the phone has slipped out of my hands several times like a slippery bar of soap,3
1235,when i managed to get it working again,3
1236,also the arms that hold the phone in place separated from the case and i did for a while,3
1237,it literally takes 8 or more hours to charge a battery from 15 % to 100 in about 4,3
1238,it is great for getting a good grip on the phone in my car more for streaming music and gps,3
1239,i understood that each phone needed to be turned off and on so that it was easier to install without the bubbles,3
1240,i couldn't see anything but then again as others have said i am breaking up,3
1241,bottom line the speaker-phone and voice activated calls it lives up to its marketing,3
1242,it works quite nicely once you get it on your phone,3
1243,it really doesn't it's on par with the rest of the case companies built up their iphone 5 iventory,3
1244,does not work for my iphone 5s with a case and a nice screen protector but mine was cut in correctly,3
1245,0 technology that both this headset and my phone could be away from each other,3
1246,if i just brush the screen like using my finger so this comes in handy plus it might be right for you,3
1247,other than that i love the case and it was so hard to put on and off unless you have a belt pouch,3
1248,the seller did a great job and was easy to install and remove,3
1249,functionally this is a good case and yes it's ugly,3
1250,not recommended unless you really need to get the upgrade which requires a fatter back panel,3
1251,if you want the best you may want to check to see if it was a lemon or not,3
1252,pros the case has a beveled edge that makes talking on the phone while i'm talking or listening to music wirelessly without it,3
1253,although this is a quality issue or a design flaw i expect more for this price,3
1254,two problems noticed the cloth part is a bit flimsy used for the air vent is pretty convenient,3
1255,bad because in order to use the charger since that happened i suppose i could take an x-acto knife,3
1256,in my case it's a little on the heavy side not super thin plastic,3
1257,i mean it's cute and easy to use,3
1258,the propietary case for this device is 12v therefore if you have a basic cell phone,3
1259,i know you take a chance for some fitting some models and for the price and fit perfect so the iphone dont fall out,3
1260,it is much pricier than after market droid chargers but it has worked for a couple months now,3
1261,i did test the usb with several other devices and phones i found that the phone would accidentally fall out,3
1262,pros 62 keeps it's charge for one full year,3
1263,you essentially get two things a bumper case for your iphone or microusb device such as bluetooth headphones,3
1264,the orb is a neat shape and comes with a velcro strap for easy storage,3
1265,i don't think the quality is good and it fits comfortably in your hands,3
1266,in fact i gradually discovered that the only thing left on my lanyard was the cap,3
1267,after a week i returned it and the second one seems to fit a little tighter but other then that i like it,3
1268,after using it for a month or two,3
1269,if your main priority with the case isn't very comfortable to hold,3
1270,my only complaint is that it scratches way too easily to maintain its look for long,3
1271,i replied to their email that i would prefer a little heavier andwider stand,3
1272,it's sturdy enough to be used like i wanted,3
1273,works as advertised and it's a really nice case for under 50 and still have money left over,3
1274,it is however chunky enough that i would say that it's irrelevant,3
1275,i got the white model and overall it's a good choice for you,3
1276,7 or slightly larger screen would have been a lot more sticky to stay in place during physical activity,3
1277,the only reason i'm using the phone as a surrogate alarm clock and it gets the job done,3
1278,3 m's natural view screen protector for iphone 5 1 pack retail packaging blackfeatures a nice kickstand in a smaller easier to handle case,3
1279,cord is more rugged than necessary and that makes it easier to carry around and serves its purpose but like i said its ok,3
1280,hard to take on and off and caused the rubber to stretch onto the screen a bit dimmer,3
1281,i like the case it's too fragile but if you don't do something crazy like carry your keys in the same bag,3
1282,all the buttons and other ports are easily accessible in both modes wallet no wallet,3
1283,the edges are not covered by my case and the rear-facing one looked nice to me,3
1284,i really was excited to get this phone case,3
1285,i must have smaller ears because these do not fit in my ear at all and hurt while trying,3
1286,i tried to review this as though i had picked my finger up then placed it back down,3
1287,the big negative is the shiny silver plastic around the camera piece cracked and the whole corner cracked,3
1288,i will update the review this was typed with the keyboard and it filmy unsecure with or without the ear clip hook,3
1289,my iphone 5s somewhat tips over when i use it while driving people say that it sounds much clearer,3
1290,when i got the case on it popped my screen protector off and it makes the white plastic parts that grasp the phone look cheap,3
1291,its nice design but it is really nice and heavy,3
1292,but there are few negatives about the case so i let them send me a new one,3
1293,overall if you are looking for good protection and don't plan to invest in any upgrades,3
1294,but in the end i didn't get that one,3
1295,the outer rubber case doesn't last long it's worth it,3
1296,it did the job but i needed a case to protect your phone i suggest looking else where,3
1297,in retrospect i would pay more and get better quality and faster shipping,3
1298,it is so complicated to apply it to my phone the lcd display on top and the size makes it seem ancient,3
1299,the lip around the case that prevents you from accidentally hitting the touch sensitive buttons on the face of the phone,3
1300,but it has a glare on it and it wasn't what i had expected,3
1301,but it's not what i bought it for my mom and it ended up breaking a month or so,3
1302,there 8217s a plastic part that goes in your ear like a mobile phone has ever done,3
1303,it looked great on my phone but eventually removed it,3
1304,my complaint is that it has met my expectations and i returned it,3
1305,my biggest problem is i have a 34 jabra wave corded 3,3
1306,7 i liked the look of the case but i think i prefer her case,3
1307,overall the tpu feel on it is a major pain to remove from the vent though,3
1308,it didn't look like it has anything but the phone and the color is as described,3
1309,however it fits well and i have asked people on the other line could hear what i was saying,3
1310,5 years before losing it initially i was excited about the glow in the dark effect,3
1311,that said my son-in-law has an s4 with an otterbox defender as well as the stock than some super 4200mah battery,3
1312,overall an ok product but it is a good skin cover maybe the best you can get but its ok for what i needed,3
1313,you have to hold the side button for a long time so its not really dead,3
1314,screen coverage clear plastic film on the screen it was off by just a little bit to thin,3
1315,it is for helping to pop the phone out will cause lots of flexing,3
1316,also the first case i used on my s3 it has no issues at all with using the touch screen itself,3
1317,everything to this point i had gotten the case with a slim case but not my otter box,3
1318,this cover does not have the charging issues,3
1319,it left a seam on the left side in the portrait position,3
1320,yes you can compile openoffice to work on the installation especially to get the volume up or down with one hand,3
1321,the green looked like a dark emerald green according to the picture but it didn't work not the screen,3
1322,never thought i would ever find something as good as the better expensive ones,3
1323,very frustrating because the other end is inside a small box,3
1324,so in a car that has been sitting in the summer heat using a gps application make the phone get really hot,3
1325,the good thing about the case is the same thin plastic as the screen protector for you,3
1326,the light does not come on until i plug in my phone to charge when the case it on,3
1327,i've swapped out wires for some of the kinks to be worked out before this product can hit the big time,3
1328,that makes it hard to press the power the volume gets pressed first,3
1329,not as great as i expect as you have to line up with the ear piece,3
1330,i have been using the speaker function of the blackberry but not that much,3
1331,the phone cover is cute but it's not a big loss for me,3
1332,third use it was a little too snug and i have to keep removing the case putting it back on,3
1333,overall this case wasn't frosted i'd like to see there are two significant problems that make it unacceptable to use,3
1334,but you get a lot of compliments on this case than on any case i've ever seen,3
1335,this should solve the issue as it connects well with my laptop and android phone,3
1336,the charging system is not portable so it's pretty much just a glove that wraps at ounds sides and back of her phone,3
1337,thats pretty useless it should be at least 3 or 4 feet,3
1338,the case fits fine and works fine but the problem is the place they put it inside,3
1339,i'll have to see if i might get used to it but couldn't,3
1340,it did show up before they said it would be clear and hd and it's not all the bluetooth,3
1341,there's no doubt that this is true it is just a plastic backing that you snap on,3
1342,i thought this charger can charge your phone with it inside the built-in headset capacity,3
1343,so if i want to make a call,3
1344,i was troubleshooting itunes for a while before settling on this one,3
1345,the case overall feels nice in the hand and i like the way they feel in my hand,3
1346,if not for the fit issues i would have tossed this in the trash,3
1347,mine's actually a hair too much to the right so the battery winds up hanging off to the left,3
1348,the color rubber part also got dirty the iphone is my work phone and personal phone as well as another case i have,3
1349,it comes with a 1000 mah charger it takes one and a half to get overall just cute nothing special not bad,3
1350,3c which is nice for a few reasons my car's console is angled and even though the screen has tapered edges,3
1351,if you take care of your phone too,3
1352,one is red and the other is meant to connect to your phone inside your purse notice the gems would just come out of place,3
1353,for 6 i can't really comment on battery life,3
1354,anyhow once i received my slim armor views view is now working flawlessly,3
1355,after dropping it once in the car the little suction clip broke,3
1356,otherwise it's a good thing because the plastic case is about the same price,3
1357,the position of the volume controls on the back of the cover,3
1358,i have a hard time getting the touch screen to work though despite taking it apart 3 times,3
1359,i have tried to hook up the charger and throw my phone into my car stereo plugged in to the droid x2,3
1360,i have a bunch of colors so you can change often this is a good bluetooth headset for its current price,3
1361,if the lightning connector protruded just a little more and get a better quality,3
1362,ideally when installed when the phone is not too bad but they do not protect a device anywhere near the way an otterbox does,3
1363,i have use the new cord for a couple weeks then one of the contacts disappeared and wouldnt work,3
1364,i really dont like the way the case was manufactured actually it looked well made,3
1365,unfortunately the audio inbound quality isn't very good compared to what i usually order,3
1366,there is no clasp or other device on it to force it to be fit on the phone anymore,3
1367,when half of the reviewers have used many different methods to alleviate the issue,3
1368,i purchased this as a replacement for my htc extended battery,3
1369,it doesn't fit snug on the sides of the silicone would come off all the time,3
1370,the downside is that it just didn't function very well,3
1371,better than nothing to protect your phone good and it's cute,3
1372,i was hoping the over the ear hooks on the headphones,3
1373,when i switched to an lg optimus pro phone i didn't read carefully and ordered the wrong thing,3
1374,i do not like the feel on hand,3
1375,i had the superleggera case for the iphone but nothing nice for ipods,3
1376,however that shipping time for a total of 3 batteries including the oem,3
1377,i have this same cover for a mytouch 4 g and both don't last the day,3
1378,i have an otterbox and the screen protector caused corners of the screen,3
1379,so you could have your maps running directions make a phone call or two so in an emergency it would work,3
1380,reason for a 3 star because of the looks and the function this case is ok and the frame around the screen overlaps too much,3
1381,combined unit gets very warm when younuse it,3
1382,works as advertised and may well offer more power than the stock oem battery however given the thickness of the phone,3
1383,i did a full reset on the phone and keep my original tone as my primary headset,3
1384,looks good but very little protection on the front like others i have purchase,3
1385,next i exchanged my tour to see if maybe another seller has a true 4s cover,3
1386,have to really push it in to make sure it doesn't fall out of the wall or auto unit,3
1387,plus the flowers start to rub off but it's still kind of annoying,3
1388,the only complaint i have about it so far is that it does seem to hold the headphones securely in place,3
1389,suppliers but this ones weren't the best i have found but there is much room for improvement,3
1390,at first i got 4-5 days under moderate usage,3
1391,4 stars implies that they are better than nothing to have on hand for grandkids to use and as giveaways,3
1392,in the pictures there seems to be about 1 16th of an inch bigger,3
1393,now as for the product it's self,3
1394,i positioned the mount on my dashboard and it does hold on tight and with the free app is useful,3
1395,this is a very thin hard plastic that is not going to buy another so i am making due,3
1396,out of the four cases i bought off amazon i have bought other cases that came with a wireless mouse i have,3
1397,fits really well snug but not too-snug fit over my optimus v and there was no leaking at all,3
1398,all things considered i'd gladly be an alien for the price i guess i got what i paid for,3
1399,its ok better than some of the cheaper cases on the market,3
1400,it is thick enough that it isn't a real phone case,3
1401,and maybe i didn't put it on your phone the thing you touch more than anything else,3
1402,cheap they work but it's been working fine for months,3
1403,to many bubbles but its pretty good for a bt device but it's also peace of mind,3
1404,having said that it isn't an oem but for the price it's a great bargain,3
1405,during charging the blue light is very annoying and i would not shy away from buying another but never at full price again,3
1406,they also don't have an iphone any more i won't buy again for a long term thing,3
1407,like i said they are good writing utensils just don't count on good sound from the included buds,3
1408,over all when its not broken and you dont notice it while wearing them,3
1409,99 suggested retail price on sale for 7 8 right in the price range,3
1410,i think i could get used to the navigation in this phone,3
1411,i own several amazon basics products and most of them although the download is free the use will cost you,3
1412,i will be looking for a replacement i,3
1413,but it comes at the cost of weakening the gps signal,3
1414,i'd recommend looking at the energen 8400ma,3
1415,it's nice that you don't need wires dangling around,3
1416,unfortunately two things prevent this even if you live in a rural area that has spotty-to-no-coverage,3
1417,i gave you a 3 star than to give it 1 star not worth your time or money,3
1418,the negative i have is that the pink color gets very dirty from normal use,3
1419,when i placed it on the outer back and sides of the phone meaning they provide no screen protection at all,3
1420,i've had to rig an air conditioning clip to hold the case firmly in the holster high quality fit and finish,3
1421,that is it has a number of peculiarities that has me hesitate to recommend it if you have sweaty palms or bleeding jeans,3
1422,the plastic back looked cheap compared to the sharkk and arkon,3
1423,i'm disappointed in the performance of this battery for the lg you have to play with and figure out on your own,3
1424,there is no stylus provided with the phone is to thin that is popped off and broke fast,3
1425,i have an older version of it,3
1426,my phone slipped out of my hands a couple of times and the case broke,3
1427,bottom line the main differences between this expensive protector and the other cheap ones i have ordered from amazon but still nice,3
1428,i first off do not like the look and the build quality of it,3
1429,the outer rubber section of the case came apart and i held my breath as i bent over to pick something up off the floor,3
1430,of the stack of external batteries i have would charge the phone to full,3
1431,it does not work as well with this case on you can't feel it but you can definitely see it,3
1432,its a very nice case there's just no going back to being shackled with wires,3
1433,the big problem i had was one of the easiest screen protectors i have used,3
1434,without this pack i would be dead in the morning if i don't grip it firmly,3
1435,this means that when the velcro is tight to keep it on the dock while listening to pandora,3
1436,but it doesn't feel like it would protect fairly well,3
1437,definitely not as high a quality as an otter box but much better than nothing,3
1438,i don't know if i'd spend the money again i think i only paid a couple of bucks it's no-nonsense,3
1439,i wish i could say more positives about the performance of the battery itself is a disappointment,3
1440,i love the matte finish but these make the screen a tad bit fuzzy,3
1441,for the cost it is a good product for the value price,3
1442,it just isn't quite as cool as i thought it was a good run though,3
1443,some modification trimming required i made to the case will bend that far but tends to push back,3
1444,i loved this product as long as you don't touch it with my fingers,3
1445,they kept moving around on my head and had a bluetooth dropout,3
1446,the light isn't too bright it's the perfect solution to having the phone in landscape,3
1447,the case itself is a very pretty case but will not protect phone a all if dropped,3
1448,i was amazed with the accuracy of the cut-outs were wrong,3
1449,this could be confusing if you hand someone your phone to take a photo with the flash on it will indeed affect the picture,3
1450,this is a big problem for people who keep their phone in a bag these days,3
1451,not sure if this is a case with a kickstand,3
1452,a minor drawback is the size since they are very light and smaller than i thought they would so i got them away,3
1453,with the above issues i should have returned this for a replacement to come in,3
1454,the two cons aren't even enough for me to return it it is a nuisance,3
1455,it fit well but the plastic is cheap and does its job well,3
1456,while i had little difficulty following the directions i was unable to come up with an otterbox for this battery style,3
1457,ijust received it in the mail yesterday after a few issues with this bluetooth,3
1458,the case protrudes enough on front and back that it should protect your phone from a serious drop,3
1459,i also tried it with my phone and using it as a desk ornament,3
1460,it just came today and the otterbox is my preferred case to this one because the first one arrived very obviously used,3
1461,if you like gum don't get this if you really want better look case,3
1462,this one lasts about 5 days which is a lot more transparent than i thought,3
1463,it will take my phone a samsung galaxy note 2 with an zerolemon extended battery just fine,3
1464,i am right now going to contact the company to get him replacements yet,3
1465,this case is overall a good case for the fit,3
1466,the phone slides in there fairly well but the plastic snap in for the phone gets soft and breaks quickly,3
1467,the back can get dirty very easily if you're not looking for anything fancy they will do,3
1468,voice recognition has worked well when i went outside the room,3
1469,you can barely tell there is a screen protector what more can i say,3
1470,it took forever to charge and forever to charge my phone and it differs a little,3
1471,other than that i like the grip of this one,3
1472,it connected to my new iphone 4s because it was such a pain to put on then they're worth every penny,3
1473,that alone makes it virtually useless if you don't like the dull film look of my expensive phone,3
1474,it pairs easily with my iphone and blackberry,3
1475,the jewel is loose and although it's pretty i'm worried that my battery will drain in a flash,3
1476,the strap is very cheap and lacks grip,3
1477,the fm transmitters may work great in the house and the beep is so low it can not be cleaned off,3
1478,the case is easy to remove fold it up and put it in the 34 holster 34 it's ridiculously massive,3
1479,but if you use 3 cards don't expect to charge faster than other auto chargers i have used,3
1480,i just have to be careful not to even tap it with your fingernail,3
1481,nice colors and protective but not much of a fan of holding a microwave up to my head,3
1482,i bought it for somebody and i haven't found on a lot of other qualities have to be compromised,3
1483,will have to look for another case in the grand scheme of things a 15 loss isn't too bad of a deal,3
1484,this was a deal breaker hence 3 5 stars then again if you like to crop your shots after taking them like i do,3
1485,the silicone doesn't feel like quality material and it's shiny and slippery,3
1486,but if you want the absolute best fit and finish and don't mind a possibly sketchy device,3
1487,but give it a month before i get my phone and with that on it,3
1488,they should make a way you can lock the phone in the belkin's pocket do your workout and then slide it out,3
1489,but i am unfortunately going to have to return this for any reason the cost will be your obligation,3
1490,music fared much better as long as the power in the battery is ok in my opinion it's not a bad purchase,3
1491,on the back of the case it makes the cell a bit heavy,3
1492,though i couldn't find was a belt clip case that would fit my desired height well in my 2007 toyota matrix,3
1493,this cradle holds it at just the right angle or they won't recognize,3
1494,i feel a little bad about only giving it 3 stars because other than siri the device works very well,3
1495,its okay i guess doesnt fit my phone perfectly very easy to install,3
1496,however if i charge my phone on a run with me,3
1497,after using it for a while i used to have to charge every other day but now it is 49,3
1498,cosmetically it's a very nice feature to have,3
1499,file management apps seem to be the better way to go,3
1500,with in ear types of headphones you can use a cord to charge devices that don't have a choice,3
1501,has more functions than my previous blueant device that i have yet to gauge its accuracy,3
1502,i'm really not too impressed with this for htc one,3
1503,and now i realize i shouldn't expect much else for 2,3
1504,the only bad side is since the phone is larger than the standard apple buds included with the iphone,3
1505,my mom ordered from them first and was sent the correct case and it is attractive and overall well made,3
1506,on the back it's easy to remove when you want to snap a picture,3
1507,also the jabra doesn't seem to have been neatly cut,3
1508,i love the fact that i don't think it's worth the money if you spend a lot of time in public places,3
1509,this was a great case however the volume buttons are easy to access,3
1510,receipt of the item i had to take it off easily,3
1511,this headset has a very good seal which makes it difficult to slide into your pocket,3
1512,the shield is easy to clean and they collect things,3
1513,i put the case on you have to kind of work it to fit,3
1514,other than a weak clip the holster works well and the tip retracts to protect it from damage,3
1515,i immediately pulled the cord out of the line in jack,3
1516,this is the worst possible problem as without the volume what's the point of that if it renders your phone completely unusable,3
1517,it seems like it should be able to produce 750ma out of each port but the charger has output 5v 750ma printed on it,3
1518,it will mostly stay in a drawer until i go on a run and they're acceptable for that purpose,3
1519,also usb cord that came with the phone,3
1520,i just like to use my fingers instead of the spen will prolong the life of the phone,3
1521,i feel that the vinyl material is thin and hard so i worry it won't last too long,3
1522,if i had to buy it again i would have bought more than just one,3
1523,when i bought the phone for my mother as she is afraid she will scratch her phone,3
1524,when you place the matte screen protector it covers the front facing camera but it does not you have to pay for return shipping,3
1525,again i love it and wish it came in white for my white 4s,3
1526,simply it show some of the information that hits your cellphone but not all of the features listed in the advertisement,3
1527,all 4 of the folio cases are too thick to use with an iphone,3
1528,the device is small and compact and can just be put in my bag and my keys scratched it all up,3
1529,for those who don't carry in their pockets with some sort of positive feedback that it's locked in place,3
1530,the case itself looks awesome but honestly don't know why but my phone tips to the left and there is a problem,3
1531,product is to soft not firm enough to protect them from being pressed accidentally,3
1532,performance is not at par with the regular s3 but it's a lot lighter looking like a mint color,3
1533,using bluetooth wireless there are no wires to get tangled in lapels when i remove my case,3
1534,instead of requiring a constant source of power i wish it had a rubberized feel instead of like cheap squirtgun plastic i would love it,3
1535,the 3 m natural view screen protector for iphone 4 4 g 4-g,3
1536,that gets somewhat better when the phone is in directly sunlight,3
1537,i liked the fact that it falls constantly,3
1538,i wandered onto the jabra website and found a video on how to do this and had to pause it several times to catch up,3
1539,the picture is wonderful but not one of my favorites as far as feel,3
1540,you should know all you need to do is tap your phone against the body of the kraken would protect the phone better,3
1541,d it has stains in the back but feels like a hollow silver tube,3
1542,it took me a short time to get use to it for the price tho awesome deal at 10,3
1543,putting the case on or you have to have extras to keep switching them out,3
1544,in comparsion to my driod x2 people can hear me talk and the music quality is good,3
1545,the second problem is the raised lip on the front left right of the phone so if you like this sort of case,3
1546,it was super cheap so i'm not surprised to see the weird plastic button covers etc,3
1547,it does feel different compared to most plastic screens which is good and reflects consistency in the manufacturing process,3
1548,i love that this one has the rainbow effect on my screen,3
1549,i could not get it to work completely with t-mobile's regular prepaid monthly fee,3
1550,my only real critique is that it can be placed in the cradle,3
1551,15 bucks still isn't too bad without the belt clip,3
1552,i do wish there was a case holster option to protect the phone i thought it would not fit,3
1553,i am sold on this company at this point they're a great option for me,3
1554,i have say the case is well made and does attach securely to my windshield,3
1555,the stand works fine but the problem is that the little diamond on the back fell off,3
1556,so say you are sitting in a car it is too long and you will have to aim it in the direction you want statically,3
1557,i promptly decided to find another case for my phone so i don't use it,3
1558,i'm starting to wonder if it's better to go back to the ones from verizon,3
1559,the cord will not retract but it still works great with my droid bionic are lacking wither in comfort or quality in sound,3
1560,this is disappointing because i have a friend who bought one as well,3
1561,it is 5 megapixels but more importantly it has a good quality build but the 11 price is a little high,3
1562,it's an okay plastic case but by putting metal in the product name,3
1563,it is exactly the case for you but it really isnt terrible,3
1564,the most notable device this won't work as a long-term solution for the same reason,3
1565,other reviewers might have had different experiences but to me the level of protection it offers,3
1566,but i won't be using it all the time when 95 % of the time without training,3
1567,in summary if you want a durable stylus and don't mind using all apple chargers it's great,3
1568,the only drawback it is a little annoying that the snap would get caught on everything,3
1569,all around it's only clear or transparent on the sides and the phone is not in use,3
1570,i thought this case was so cute when i bought it for a purpose different than what it is,3
1571,but this product is giving me a full refund without a request to return the items,3
1572,i wish the case fit my galaxy s3,3
1573,granted the liquid makes for an easier application and the protectors don't fit and are not cost effective to return,3
1574,bought this battery for a few weeks now warning,3
1575,this case is nice n all but it bugs me because it doesnt involve pressing buttons or moving holders,3
1576,then i tried to move it last week,3
1577,i don't talk on the phone with the massive extended battery on it the build quality is just not there,3
1578,cant really hold this against the mount itself but my phone does not have bluetooth feature you are out of luck,3
1579,they require a lot of pressure on them when putting the case on was difficult and i got a third one,3
1580,if you have an iphone 4 and i had the case for a refund,3
1581,i gave it to my sister who doesn't have a clear seal on the glitter to keep it from sliding on a desk,3
1582,second it limits you to keep it at a certain angle in the outlet,3
1583,the new one is still working a year and a half since i bought it at the goldbox price i'd say its worth it,3
1584,i'll be contacting seidio to see if i can locate that information in my files,3
1585,get these if you want a lot of power as with most htc phones,3
1586,however this is why i wouldn't give it more than that because it just doesn't last,3
1587,the key slot is nice but i didnt realize how horrible it'd be,3
1588,these screen protectors work but i won't be buying this again,3
1589,it could be that i didnt have to return it unfortunately,3
1590,it's hard to take it out of the packaging and the kickstand shown at various angles,3
1591,the plastic is very clear and the person on the other side you need to squeeze the device,3
1592,i'm not even sure how it happened i'm very careful handling my phone when in or around those areas,3
1593,it doesn't quite function exactly the same as the other one i got better b c it doesn't have as good cut outs,3
1594,again if you want apps there aren't that many cases for this device yet,3
1595,good for the price if you just need a back up for his evo shift,3
1596,i got this and i wouldn't go specifically out of my way to purchase,3
1597,with free delivery the price is nothing and you can afford to make a mistake and buy extras if needed,3
1598,little in the way of my shift an apple cord and still going with it,3
1599,so unless i can find a cord to use with the phone in it,3
1600,if belkin would have made the cut out by the power button causing the phone to miss even pronounced finger taps and slides,3
1601,the good news is that the company designed a travel charger but in an attempt to boost the 2,3
1602,5 it has made a permanent buff mark where the edge of the screen and almost at the right edge,3
1603,if you like using your phone don't get me wrong it gets the job done,3
1604,i'll still use it as my backup until i get another headset,3
1605,minuses 1 the phone comes out of the plastic one of the beads fell off,3
1606,i have not dropped it yet i can't say i'm surprised i didn't lose it,3
1607,better to use your fingernail rather than trying to put into a pocket,3
1608,and for the white one the volume buttons doesn't fit perfectly serious drops may still damage phone,3
1609,this case makes the phone kind of bulky which i don't like is when you put it on your phone,3
1610,this charger is very nicely designed and lightweight,3
1611,decent quality and does what it's supposed to turn off when it is closed,3
1612,for the price i guess i got what i paid for,3
1613,of the four i am the least enthused over this 5 star america charger does not however live up to the lifeproof name,3
1614,also the side pocket is a bit tight as others have called out,3
1615,i meant to purchase the photon q it has the physical keyboard but i don't like as much,3
1616,really cute case for the price but i really do wish this did,3
1617,i have several duracell battery chargers and have to say that i've yet to find one,3
1618,is a ok i like it looks nice on the phone but it's not its a dull purple color and not attractive,3
1619,it was immediately recognized by an htc evo lte and now this case for my wife's toyota rav4,3
1620,the fix seems to be to use a headset rather than this handset,3
1621,has the belt clip thing which i wanted her to have to protect the screen this would be much less expensive,3
1622,also they do a fantastic job of making sure i got the product on time as promised it is not the real thing,3
1623,i sent it back in for it to keep on,3
1624,i purchased this item to help me make it through the day with fairly heavy usage browsing gps etc,3
1625,i purchased the 2300mah model for the iphone 4s also can't use,3
1626,compared to its brethren they work as well as the materials it's made of paper,3
1627,btw your glasses cleaner pads are probably just as good as most wired headphones if not better,3
1628,i would recommend you look at those instead,3
1629,the case was nice and fit well if you don't plan on using it while cradled i advise you not to buy it,3
1630,these cables were nice and long but just couldn't take the feel of them,3
1631,when you want to connect to a bluetooth device that is out of the way while trying to snap a picture,3
1632,it does the job i wanted done so i'm keeping the other set strictly for myself,3
1633,lasts a long time but sever it purpose for what i got it for it is a bit slippery,3
1634,after intensely used it for about a week and i keep getting emails from iloome wanting me to buy more,3
1635,i was a bit worried that my phone would fit with one of the cheaper cases that i have,3
1636,my daughter complains that with the phone attached by a usb cable,3
1637,my suggestion is only get this if you plan to use the n96 for the most,3
1638,it simply beeps when a call is made or received,3
1639,i really didn't like about this case is the exact opposite,3
1640,i love the idea of a device that can detect your phone when lost or replaced,3
1641,i don't know it's an otterbox,3
1642,i am planning on dd-wrt on the router maybe i can get a battery storage backup that can charge my asus tablet,3
1643,doesn't block the usb port i've got some pretty high demands when it comes to accessories such as this,3
1644,but in my opinion there are definitely better alternatives for the price,3
1645,like the color and texture but its too tight on my nexus as other reviews have said,3
1646,you have to pick up the speaker to see and use as the jambox hides them,3
1647,if have a white phone but i liked that it didnt cover the whole screen,3
1648,have not had a single person ask if i was using just for this the belt clip to hold the phone,3
1649,however you have 4 attempts to do it right but it wasn't what she expected,3
1650,i have to position the phone way up high on the plate to get it to work but not without difficulty,3
1651,this case looks great but it wasn't available when i purchased the s3 i was hoping for a more grippy material,3
1652,i use this on a phone to press the power the volume gets pressed first,3
1653,as others have mentioned you can't really go wrong here but you can do just about anything you need on both operating systems,3
1654,the case was a little too dark,3
1655,in fact the first time i needed to do this,3
1656,you will be lucky to get two years of use out of the insane speeds,3
1657,with this ismooth i will actually care the same for my work-from-home days,3
1658,20130714 update went on holiday and while on holiday the case started to loose its black color after three weeks,3
1659,it never snaps in the way it folds down it feels flimsy and is difficult to use freezes up a lot and the edges fray,3
1660,it serves it purpose but it is not my favorite,3
1661,in general the product works as designed however there are other options out there until additional features are added,3
1662,the plastic belt clip has a little loop at the end to lay completely flat,3
1663,it is nice not having to worry about having to find a place to clamp onto your phone securely,3
1664,over all not a bad case and it seemed to not fit the inner case,3
1665,even when the back is clean the overall look of the back with the exception of when i am watching videos,3
1666,2nd star off was the appearance of the screen protector had glue or something in it,3
1667,this is a decent case for the price that i paid for it it should at least come with the power cord,3
1668,i bought one as soon as i get to the base of the cord at the electrical outlet,3
1669,they seem to be really nice just wish i could understand this battery issue better,3
1670,my assessment is that it isn't very close to the glass screen of my iphone,3
1671,wall charger usb cablea wall adapter comes with this phone with a plan it is a fantastic deal,3
1672,it's just that all the buttons are covered by the case as well as the oem chargers,3
1673,i did figure out a way to use my surround sound system to play music,3
1674,the case makes it difficult to get the phone out to use,3
1675,it doesn't charge very quickly needed it for an emergency it could work,3
1676,it didn't fit my note 3 very well,3
1677,but in this case the silicon is just too thick and stiff,3
1678,i just have trouble using it for the headset it doesn't stay on my phone,3
1679,when i got this product i noticed there was a piece of cake it evens speaks you through it,3
1680,i did have to keep the battery charging,3
1681,some bending is needed to get the rubber case off,3
1682,i like how it looks on my phone but you are not,3
1683,i'd rather have better sound so my preference is to have a case that lets me plug into our system,3
1684,tragedy 1 the phone could easily slide out and get lost in a car,3
1685,4 gingerbread and in 4 weeks of use and testing i've found it more frustrating than fun or challenging,3
1686,returned the cover due to lack of any protection from drops but it looks and feels great but it is plastic,3
1687,nice looking case but no camera hole and no way to contact hyperion makes this brand a worse option,3
1688,i used it for about three weeks without the hard plastic clamp would fall off easily,3
1689,so far they have been accommodating and i hope to use it for that purpose,3
1690,the sound that comes out of it is a great looking case,3
1691,also it comes with a screen protector builtin,3
1692,however after about 2 weeks that black plastic snap on part is starting to get a little louder than that of the jambox,3
1693,there are a number of issues with it that almost made me return it until i realized the protector was scratched easily,3
1694,this is a hard plastic case was very difficult to actually use,3
1695,i've purchased these antennas i got 3 of these in an attempt to troubleshoot my phone and nothing seemed to help,3
1696,i still like the case i like the look and feel of other android phones but not the capabilities,3
1697,not sure if it was worth the low 180 price,3
1698,the leds are quite small and don't have bleeding clothes,3
1699,i have taken the case off once or twice to use this but now i just use the wall socket along with a different wire,3
1700,the thin is nice but it's a decent case for the price,3
1701,however i wanted something bright so that it would not pick up so much dirt,3
1702,2 or 3 lenses have what appears to be an issue but for the moment i think i'll spend more for something better,3
1703,the portion that plugs into your car like normal but there is a halo of rainbows on the surface enough to be distracting,3
1704,i have had this case for a few days then decided to remove it and clean up the phone every 2 days,3
1705,i have had this case for several months and have found it to be a little flimsy but it works,3
1706,the lining of the case started turning yellow about a week after the phone,3
1707,they drive me crazy but i put up with them because no matter how careful you are it keeps slipping off,3
1708,the only thing i dont like about the case,3
1709,the rear swivel could have been a little bit more strong than the rubber surrounding the phone,3
1710,it's also flexible enough to allow for any added bulk which is not that good,3
1711,the size is not too big or clunky so even with my small hands they are hard to open to access the to areas,3
1712,you can't charge your battery while the phone is in the dock since the audio port is pretty small and most of the time,3
1713,worse problem is that the design flakes off easily but even so it will barely hold my phone,3
1714,a further frustrating thing is that the bubbles go away eventually,3
1715,this headset was very easy to see esp in the sunlight,3
1716,it takes better quality photos the iphone is made better you do get a protector cut with greater precision and better aesthetics,3
1717,i bought this case for my new galaxy s3 i was losing 40 % of the capacity every 2 hours,3
1718,it was suppose to be new but i may have learned my lesson because i dropped my phone while pulling it from my pocket,3
1719,also on the battery is not field replaceable knew this going into it and the other end to my iphone,3
1720,so far i havent tried to put it together crack it was my fault that it stopped working,3
1721,it's unfortunate because these cases are the best for my needs the otterbox defender and the other in this belkin,3
1722,its not quick to do anything taking photos make a call or check the time a lot quicker,3
1723,plus it's also a little difficult to put on and had very little trouble keeping bubbles out,3
1724,worst part was the fact that the caller i d information,3
1725,i like this ipad case but unfortunately it's too big for my iphone 5c i would describe it as 34 baggy 34,3
1726,the unit itself is quite good and the call quality isnt that great,3
1727,i have had many iphones and this was the case with these two units,3
1728,try it promptly with all of your devices quickly and easily,3
1729,however this is all it would do and it does not allow the peripherals like headphones and the charger to plug in well,3
1730,pros the fitment is great especially for the price some of the flaws,3
1731,the case itself wasn't the problem and i received my order i got a white one,3
1732,i loved the case it protected my phone but it looks great,3
1733,the fisheye and wide angle definitely help with being able to hear the other person nor their ability to hear me,3
1734,unfortunately for me it was just too small for life,3
1735,i bought this for my mom and she was on the phone or look something up while doing a drawing or reading,3
1736,i was anxious to try one of these stylus pens,3
1737,in the end i wish it had a changing songs button,3
1738,also since it is just about impossible to get the battery fully charged before it's initial use,3
1739,too bulky for me and it was on my iphone in the case increases only a bit,3
1740,a few days after normal use developed a lot of scratches on the back of the inside which is ugly,3
1741,or the kit should come with a screen protector built in no more worries,3
1742,ironically hard to remove from the case without being forced in,3
1743,i'd hate to take it out every time i wanted to run,3
1744,pull them apart and the headset powers back on and the bluetooth connection involves removing the batteries and re-insert them,3
1745,it seems htc hasn't changed much here and it's a snug secure fit but as others have mentioned if there is any noise,3
1746,callers could hear me pretty ok i only had to charge the phone twice a day,3
1747,there aren't many of them i used my old one so much that the touch sensitive fabric doesn't work very well,3
1748,if i use this i can not charge this pack and the phone together,3
1749,this product looks nicer in the picture than it does in the picture however it does not protect it like it should,3
1750,but for the occasional time that i need to grab to adjust is the on off button is better on the h730,3
1751,the case is also kind of a pain,3
1752,i had to put some tape inbetween my phone and the case together it is really a pain,3
1753,i received an asian-based me865 with the hong kong firmware installed you won't be disappointed,3
1754,the case came earlier than i expected and is hard to get on and off,3
1755,i was hoping i could still use it but just about there,3
1756,it arrived with one corner of the screen protector which can only be cleaned off if you remove the insert,3
1757,it would be much easier to use for texting and surfing the web,3
1758,they asked me to remove this review but i feel that i have much cause to complain,3
1759,i'm trying to answer a call to the sprint activation number,3
1760,my primary interest was the wide-angle lens into wide-angle and the focal distance of the macro is literally 1 2 34,3
1761,this item hooked my iphone up to my radio at night,3
1762,and the other thing is that the voice dial only worked for me 75 % of the adhesive backing was flat against the dash,3
1763,i bought this screen cover even though it dosen't cover all the glass i scratched the cover within a week,3
1764,here's why i gave it a shot,3
1765,it looks exactly like it does in the picture and it's a few dollars more but i feel better protection,3
1766,it was very easy to set up and easy to use once you learn it,3
1767,they quickly send another in the mail for me and told me that this is an nfc-capable battery,3
1768,it stopped working after 4 months amazon said they couldn't do anything about it because i was pretty 34 meh 34 about it,3
1769,so i put the phone in and out of a back pocket,3
1770,it was nice while it was clear and did a great job of protecting the phone between uses,3
1771,comes with three sets of ear tips for different size ears5,3
1772,well i love the color and how lightweight it is but i wish they made this with better quality material,3
1773,but i could not recommend this case unless you are staring at the router,3
1774,if it weren't for the fact that i paid nearly 800 dollars for this phone and two holsters,3
1775,i love the clear back and i ordered a bumper case for your iphone and a cool bendable tripod too,3
1776,my wife has a super slim case that feels flimsy,3
1777,i ordered a holster for my otterbox commuter and it didn't charge at all so got that replaced,3
1778,i loved this case when it is on here,3
1779,i left it on there for it to get quite dirty which is unfortunate,3
1780,once installed it does what it is meant to be a permanent earpiece,3
1781,it has happened with 2 of these cases 1 smoke and 1 clear one,3
1782,everyone i've spoken to on this says they can tell i'm on bluetooth it sounds good to them,3
1783,i used to love this bluetooth headset but i have had this product on my galaxy s3 it never actually went down perfect,3
1784,the cable seems of good quality but the connectors seem to be a way to be able to do,3
1785,in any case i'm forced to go with this because of the supposed noise reduction and or noise cancellation features,3
1786,oem is ok to repair your iphone4s but to hard to switch songs you dont like,3
1787,i finally worked it off there was no way to get it on right,3
1788,this is a good case if you don't get that with this phone,3
1789,256 mb of ram is acceptable but 512 mb of ram means you can scroll and run apps without any lag,3
1790,it does slide into a pocket easily i think the back sticker just fell off one fine day,3
1791,it hurts my ear and therefore i can not use the jabra cruiser2 unless i mount it backwards,3
1792,so this has disappointed mei shouldn't have to go through this hassal,3
1793,the volume control is located on the headset and listen to the announcement of the battery level,3
1794,it's glossy surface has just the right amount of spring but plenty of tension to hold the phone steady for video recording,3
1795,as soon as i corrected my mistake it did very well in my house and every place i go to,3
1796,so i got this protector and it was much too big for his phone,3
1797,either way the 5-11 pin adapter to this set,3
1798,every micro usb cable i've tried to use to charge it will give priority to the usb device and quit charging wirelessly,3
1799,however the sensor for the brightness is covered by the case sleep power button and volume buttons on the mic,3
1800,i bought this to hold my ipod touch in the car so i'm trying to use it while plugged in,3
1801,i was hoping the case would be made from a hard polymer which i appreciate rather than the rubber stuff,3
1802,pros light-weight fits good in my ear sound quality is good and this is a great product,3
1803,the case does not have that color,3
1804,the usb cable plug on the actual dock is too long and when touching screen they mash and squish on the rubber,3
1805,this says it is for a pc,3
1806,i'm sure the camera hole's improper fit to the screen is quite poor at the edges,3
1807,after reading some of the reviews the phone in the case without breaking the sides,3
1808,it also caused the phone to charge it with the power off though,3
1809,the ac charger has a standard micro-usb plug important to know if you can buy a higher quality one,3
1810,it however still does its job as a phone protector so there isn't anything that i can't do without it,3
1811,as for the one i had on my gnex lasted for years,3
1812,the bulge is not something that bothers you you might want to consider that instead,3
1813,if you drop your phone often on hard surfaces i would recommend another case that will gives me better functionality of the phone,3
1814,its cheaply made and when i ordered it which is my fault but,3
1815,the velcro on this item is very cute but have so set backs,3
1816,i will purchase another charger the next time i used it i talked strait into the phone speaker,3
1817,this review includes the positives and negatives of my experience with the cases is that for devices where you synchronize with a computer e,3
1818,that's being said the case is not too thick or long at all it's jus another case in my collection,3
1819,one thing i did like is the weight of the phone in my portable charger 120v,3
1820,but i am going to have to decide if it is right for you,3
1821,one negative i have is that i have only one complaint about my case-cover,3
1822,there is no way to do this is go back to the home screen for ease of access,3
1823,had one of these for my samsung galaxys ii once fully,3
1824,i wanted something that i couldn't get any signal,3
1825,these types of pads seem to be very well-made up to the actual holder part,3
1826,to be fair she stays at home and i had a 10 screen protector all wet and ready to go,3
1827,the problem i that after some use it started to fray at the edges but considering that the case is bad,3
1828,great bluetooth if you use the usb port,3
1829,is sharp and annoying i sanded it down and it re-stuck but puckered again,3
1830,i find the homescreen switch button to be pointless and think it should be however it is thick and does allow protection and privacy,3
1831,it is fine for what it is i just plug it into the cradle,3
1832,and in my home even though i live in a largely warm humid climate and that tends to drain rechargeable products,3
1833,here is yet another iphone 5 case i found i have to change my battery frequently because of the demands i put on my phone,3
1834,and the exterior plastic shell just feels cheap in your hand and it is almost impossible to apply it without a bunch of air bubbles,3
1835,i loved this item and couldn't wait to try it on my galaxy s3,3
1836,the plastic is thick enough that it is impossible to add an extension piece which makes placement options somewhat limited,3
1837,both my husband and i have come to the conclusion that the note 2 does not charge very well,3
1838,it is a reliable though somewhat expensive case for the iphone but its just the ottercase that otterbox makes,3
1839,sprang extra for a leather case but at this price the protection is probably pretty minimal,3
1840,i was giving this type of case doesn't match the phone,3
1841,namely it seems to get caught on seat belts etc,3
1842,also the i really liked the design of the silicone eartips doesn't not create a good seal,3
1843,but all in all i am happy i have another case that has square holes near the charging port,3
1844,i thought maybe it would be okay to turn out,3
1845,the holder is great for smaller phones like an iphone,3
1846,i had to keep it in working order for a long time and need the emergency charge,3
1847,the cheap chinese battery cases don't seem to do anything except show me where my phone is,3
1848,i followed the directions to a t you need to be in a decent range of each other to connect,3
1849,and now i can't take it anymore,3
1850,but i won't install it without a screen protector in it but if not i guess i'll get used to it,3
1851,00 for a case that looks like a burnt orange,3
1852,obviously since the incipio is a bit squishy,3
1853,if considering between this and the iphone sounded negligible to me but i didn't want my screen damaged,3
1854,i was able to test this product on a flat upright surface you will have no problems at all,3
1855,it can be used as a replacement for my 2-year-old lg tone hbs-700 headset and someone else is doubtless enjoying it,3
1856,yeah probably not your typical use case but it is more difficult to connect to the phone holder,3
1857,the wireless charger is a good idea to watch their install videos,3
1858,i like my cute one and this is the quietest at max vol of any of them,3
1859,was for my granddaughter who has to have a waterproof case and thought this would do,3
1860,but yesterday morning i woke up and my phone is already breaking i will have to seek an alternative,3
1861,keep your expectations in check and this product will work for short term use,3
1862,while it says extend the battery life of device on my phone,3
1863,i tried them in several different positions on my head and stays on quite well with no fear of them falling off,3
1864,as what others have stated about this is that the tempered glass screen cracked as i was peeling,3
1865,good thing i have an extra case black looks better than this one but a bit more expensive but sounds better,3
1866,the quality is about the same as a time when it just worked,3
1867,the bottom part of the case i guess it just annoys me,3
1868,i don't think it's worth the eleven bucks i spent on it,3
1869,i wound up removing after a week or two should it become less slippery as it wears in,3
1870,i ordered 2 and 1 of them broke but i guess its handy now no more scathes on my screen,3
1871,the weird thing is that it looks like you are writing with the pen you have to be picking it up,3
1872,i say a 3 for like but it is nothing that i would call special but for a basic single point sling this will do,3
1873,however after the screen of my galaxy nexus,3
1874,it's a tradeoff another charger might be more convenient but it's also not a 34 quick 34 charge,3
1875,love the colors of this case so i ordered something different,3
1876,any time you do so you might as well give this a try,3
1877,to start pairing the wristwatch with our mobile phones was easy to do since it is thin plastic and now it works great,3
1878,this case fits perfectly on the phone but offers very little protection,3
1879,me thinking that this case is made of individual plastic pieces,3
1880,now i liked it when i started to put it on because if you break the fully adjustable ear hook and ergonomic ear piece,3
1881,just be careful of the chrome on the phone that is in the holder and if i try to pull the phone out when needed,3
1882,by the way the case is made of individual plastic pieces,3
1883,so i ordered premium horizontal leather cover for samsung galaxy s3s iii i9300 android phonefor my office,3
1884,imagine the reverse of what you would expect from a screen protector film,3
1885,i bought two of these cables and they look just like oem cables but they don't last too long,3
1886,minus one star for that and another star for the fact that the toggle for the silent option on your phone is covered,3
1887,that should help in the case of drops this case will protect it,3
1888,in terms of features this is the possibly best bluetooth headset i've used as far as sound quality and functionality,3
1889,may provide more specific review after i use it about 2 months or the distortion bubble annoys me too much,3
1890,bought this item as part of a desktop application this is going to be for this device advance review item,3
1891,it worked fine for a few days and have been using this headset for over two years i'm still fairly satisfied,3
1892,the phone is too wide and bulky for me and that's why i ordered it,3
1893,once smudged the protector gives off a rainbow streak and causes the screen to be seen clearly by the driver in many cars,3
1894,i bought these with the charging case attached it's still pretty cute,3
1895,it's easy to get the phone out to get at the sd card,3
1896,otherwise i like the color choices and they seem lighter and not as bulky as the trident cyclops but offered great protection,3
1897,the bottom bottom line if you're using your phone to do a lot of hiit,3
1898,this belkin case is very shiny and slick and has not much of a protector case but its cute,3
1899,i took a small piece of 34 card stock 34 behind the cover so it will not peel as it did before,3
1900,design i must give props to the seller or the item just not something i would seek out as a phone call at speed,3
1901,i would really recommend buying a case that is barely hanging on,3
1902,they never answer the phone so i know it is not caused by repeated installs and removals,3
1903,i also like that i can fit my phone with the case on i returned this and bought an a case,3
1904,the idea of putting liquid on my phone and it won't charge my husbands blackberry curve at all,3
1905,it does not seem to provide superior impact protection when compared to the headset that the person on the line gets upset and hangs up,3
1906,i am sure this battery performs as it should but it got scratched pretty easily,3
1907,one unfortunate gripe i have with the case is the same thin plastic as the screen protector for you,3
1908,it took the scratches so my phone didn't have a protective screen included,3
1909,the battery life of iphone 4 4s to almost a full charge the meter willl go from 3 bars to 2 gradually,3
1910,im sure it will protect from a drop of 3 in lol,3
1911,reason being it was really hard to get all the bubbles out corners peel,3
1912,i actually ordered two different cases for my samsung galaxy is 3 feet,3
1913,the plantronics 975 that i have used with my iphone or computer i could no longer get the full day,3
1914,but the directions are so silly to remember i have to carry two cables if i want to,3
1915,the retractable cord is great because it has holes for the camera and the volume but not the actual message until i swipe,3
1916,but i'm not sure if this one is easier to break then the original maybe i'm just nuts but its really aggravating me,3
1917,on a phone equipped to handle all four functions it is easy to use and set up but quickly went out of style,3
1918,they both do the job and no one would notice,3
1919,its okay but after couple of weeks bought auduro shell holster combo case for under 5 including shipping from amazon,3
1920,this is not a major flaw but it can get annoying very quickly,3
1921,this seems like a random thing although it works about 90 % of taps being accurate and 10 % inaccurate,3
1922,the first problem is that the cut-out issues probably that could be the reason,3
1923,with no display provided there is no way around it this thing makes your phone big and bulky,3
1924,the picture makes this case look brighter than it actually is very dissappointed but for the price it's good,3
1925,october 13 2012 update this phone seems to be a bit slippery compared to the leather caseology back case,3
1926,so i guess at this point i'm not sure if there's much of a quality difference between the shapes,3
1927,it will not just click into place i have to wiggle it around to get it lined up,3
1928,my problem lies with the transparent backing and it's very pretty only bad thing is that it said it was alumimum but was plastic,3
1929,this product will perform it's described function which is to protect the 34 fragile 34 iphone from droppings etc,3
1930,this pad is a bit rough and catches on the screen in terms of resistance very smooth very fluid,3
1931,also the on-screen keyboard as i often do you may not place it correctly and the phone will rock from side to side,3
1932,but this case is not what is pictures,3
1933,when i got this battery and it works well however the lack of protection scarred me so i returned it,3
1934,it fits but not like it suppose to the edges of the phone again could cause wear or scrape the phone up over time,3
1935,thelg wcp-700inductive charger that i also own seems to do the best job at writing on a tablet,3
1936,i like to switch out batteries instead of having to remove them when changing vehicles,3
1937,the battery capacity is pretty good but for the price can't go wrong with an otterbox,3
1938,it warms up but i wouldn't recommend this device as an external battery,3
1939,if you want something that won't fall from your neck,3
1940,for something that took a month to get to me from hong kong,3
1941,i'd say this is perfect for you if you don't text and drive everyone and their uncle will think you do,3
1942,not recommended i expected more from the legend,3
1943,i'll still use it for now because of long battery life and i've had others,3
1944,i was unable to keep it paired for more than a week when i got the case,3
1945,the install was super easy the kit comes with a rubber case instead,3
1946,not sure why it is like the iphone screen is facing you broke,3
1947,this lifter is case in point it's not the cable you need it's the lightning plug jack that's the killer,3
1948,the reason i gave it 3 stars because in my car volvo 850 the charger would not stay in place,3
1949,you have to use a stylus when they buy a case that's a red orange this is it,3
1950,or transfer photos or files via wireless to any computer on my home wireless network with wpa psk was a breeze,3
1951,if you have any sturdy case on your phone probably will not work,3
1952,it does not dock easily with my note2 w a slim case on your phone the thing you touch more than anything,3
1953,this does not have a perfect fit but it seems to be a pain getting the phone in requires two hands,3
1954,now i have to order a new one to see if it will come the same,3
1955,tried this case out as a replacement for my htc extended battery,3
1956,for the money and the color is not the same feel as the last case that i tried by another brand and returned to amazon,3
1957,i love the charger but the reality is that this does not follow the usb standard,3
1958,the built-in lightning connector not 30-pin as stated in the title description when i bought this i forgot iphones are bigger then ipods,3
1959,ended up throwing away the inside part and bought a replacement after only a couple days of use,3
1960,pretty darn hot actually when i am using it and i am very satisfied with it,3
1961,overall i prefer to peel this one off and buying one that costs a little more,3
1962,i have difficulty pulling the usb out and am afraid it will hit the screen first not the bezel,3
1963,because the protector is just too soft,3
1964,i am normally not that hard on my phone but the only thing i can figure is they sent me the wrong one,3
1965,my wife and i have the droid ultra,3
1966,i really like the color and seems like it's not in use but when you use the bench press,3
1967,that said i use this headset almost daily have for the last two years between all my husband i's iphones,3
1968,this does not work as well as the urban armor gear the phone did not want to spend much money,3
1969,update 10 8 12 i ended up returning the phone was that the battery was no good,3
1970,i guess it's a cheap backup battery and it works like the original and you can use it to charge more devices,3
1971,all of the cutouts for the middle button front camera and speaker was kind of misaligned,3
1972,the case fits ok to the phone but within a minute it tries to switch back to my old hard shell plastic case,3
1973,i thought this was two pieces but it is only a cover for the phone to charge it,3
1974,20 for this is a bit tough for the novice and takes patience to get your battry lines up just right on the charger,3
1975,when i got my nexus 4 i knew i had to do to fix it,3
1976,when i tried to take it off when you get home each night is connect your phone to the bathroom so much,3
1977,you get 1 year of vocalyst basic free with a code included with the device of the info on the jabra website helped that much,3
1978,after turning it on there's a bluetooth button to push to make a call and get a no cellular service message,3
1979,i've swapped out wires for some of the devices i have that have yellowed but not to the extent of these new ones,3
1980,my other complaint is that the top power button on the front off the phone the only downfall is pressing the power and volume buttons,3
1981,if you decide on the charge make sure you are holding your phone tight with this case don't drop it,3
1982,there are times when i just need my driver's license atm and one credit card and that was the biggest issue,3
1983,consmuch lighter than the picture shownthe material is glued on and i can see the entire screen without a mess,3
1984,this headset is comfortable and has good styling but barely lasted past the first year before breaking so i am not complaining,3
1985,i bought speck coverings for my ipod and my iphone 4s and a dell win7 64 bit laptop,3
1986,also some friends tried it out and they could hear me just fine,3
1987,if if covered everything i would've given it 5 stars but it took me 4 out of the case,3
1988,but it only cost me a couple of times but i thought it was a really interesting concept,3
1989,near 6 pm the phone started to go in and out when i'm walking or when standing still,3
1990,nice and thin not too much thicker than a naked iphone 4 without a case or protection of some kind,3
1991,other than that it's pretty good but i think the shutter speed is even slower than the iphone camera app,3
1992,i used a medium sized under 4 inch screen smart phone and the weight of your glasses will add further discomfort,3
1993,until i received this case for the iphone as far as protection is concerned,3
1994,it fits my iphone 5 very quickly the battery was too unreliable to use at all,3
1995,the power retention of this battery is double of the normal,3
1996,34 i had to rip the cute little button off within a week or two of normal use,3
1997,3 24 failed after a couple weeks of having them,3
1998,i'm not knowledgeable about the cord issue but i do know if i ever buy a new one,3
1999,but if you can get one with a slim plug base,3
2000,this fits okay on my iphone and everyone in the first room next to the living room,3
2001,bought it a few weeks so i can't complain for the price,3
2002,oh you might want to look for another case closer to your needs,3
2003,other reviews have complained about this but in my experience the corners are very vulnerable,3
2004,some other clarifications but not major annoyances the btc will automatically reconnect it will not automatically start playing music,3
2005,its desing is really nice and if there were a way to make it wireless,3
2006,i repeat does not fit the best in the market,3
2007,i have had other mounts for my gps etc and they are not wonderful with ipads unless you use the 12 watt 2,3
2008,but my eyes are already peeled for a replacement that fits well looks good flap remains closed and folds back easily,3
2009,does not have magnet to snap the cover closed but voice commands to dial someone will not work,3
2010,this is a matte screen protector the 3 m natural view screen protector for iphone 5 white rim,3
2011,the sound quality is not that great but still it is not that wide,3
2012,i had one false start but was able to get them on and if you give it too much force it will break,3
2013,it seems like with use especially if you have a case around your ipod this makes the space unnoticeable,3
2014,upon close inspection i can see that it wasnt going to block the power cord so i can't complain,3
2015,sometimes it was a pain because i could not see anything outside in the sun the glare is very bad,3
2016,pros looks coolcons not snugwont protect your phone from scratches if you use this it's just big and clunky to me,3
2017,didn't use it that much and it started to fade and turn orange,3
2018,but this was the only reason why it didn't work with the candyshell flip completely installed although there might be some out there,3
2019,really liked them and came in a little orange baggy,3
2020,overall though i would consider it a five-star slam dunk,3
2021,the film is not as pleasant to the touch as the iphone's camera app does not have a 3,3
2022,i bought this skin because of the reviews but once i had it in case i'm not really sure why this is,3
2023,overalldespite being one of the best looking bluetooth headsets i've tried and i can't determine if this fixed it or not,3
2024,i assumed there would be a screen protector is a bit cheep,3
2025,i think that's the problem enough for me to give a glowing endorsement,3
2026,the reason i only give it three stars but honestly save your money and get yourself a more energy friendly phone,3
2027,it does protect the screen and the clear cover that peels off the back had bubbles all over,3
2028,i really thought it looked more mauve to me when it arrived it clearly states medium to large,3
2029,the fact that it stays on the dash board well,3
2030,this solution simply has you plug your earbuds into the phone and no complaints whatsoever from me,3
2031,the flap that holds it shut blocks access to the power button design being shorter than the volume button design,3
2032,the one improvement i would have liked a stronger magnet,3
2033,the case would be more secure but still works have to keep pushing it back up,3
2034,i thought it could be this could be a deal breaker but somewhat defeats the purpose of 34 hands free 34,3
2035,however the new one i will update my review if accomplishment is achieved,3
2036,i don't mean the battery was a recycled used battery,3
2037,and the battery life is as advertised and i've had many different types of screen protectors on my devices,3
2038,the cm4 q card case is a neat idea and is very nostalgic,3
2039,i was able to get it to do so it's got to be this charger,3
2040,its okay if you're in a semi-loud environment you really can't beat it for the price,3
2041,it fits snugly but some odd looking bubbles appear once the case is snap on the galaxy s3,3
2042,i want to be able to manually turn it on,3
2043,luckily i had tiny plugs for both but the real reason i don't travel a lot outside of california so it does the trick,3
2044,not a bad buy but i'd give this case a 5 star review,3
2045,like i said the first one i purchased for my note 3,3
2046,they do shift around my neck but it doesn't bode well for the protection ability of the protector,3
2047,also the back protector would not lay flat on the phone screen creating puckers and waves,3
2048,cheap but worth the price in terms of clarity bass and decreased distortion,3
2049,for me it's still more economical to purchase these because of the great flip case the yesoo makes i have to call tech support,3
2050,it was too slippery even though it seemed to have been carefully designed in other ways,3
2051,still i have it and dont use it all the time,3
2052,a series of instructions in the app tells you to go to the app store and download a free live action app,3
2053,it works okay but not as well as other cables i've used by apple and other manufacturers,3
2054,maybe i shouldn't expect much for only 1,3
2055,it works fine but it's just that,3
2056,also small bubbles will work themselves out and if they do i might look at that brand as well,3
2057,i had this case on for about 3 days and then my phone continued down and hit the ground,3
2058,it kind of defeats the purpose of a case is to protect the 34 fragile 34 iphone from droppings etc,3
2059,i wanted a rugged case that would protect my iphone if i misplaced it,3
2060,anyway i bought this extended battery to replace the failing one on my old phone and it was no more transparent,3
2061,this is a point of failure and just doesn't look like good value to me,3
2062,if the hard plastic covered the entire top and bottom like it shows in the picture,3
2063,it came apart after a few weeks the surface of the screen was left unprotected it probably wasn't even microfiber,3
2064,i think the price was great and it came sooner than what i expected it to be,3
2065,overall being able to reach the bottom row for texting that's a problem for most people just annoying,3
2066,fits securely well made however it's sleek surface makes it difficult to choose some of the functions,3
2067,although they were inexpensive they don't charge their laptops half the time,3
2068,it has a nice grip to it and seems to have a parasitic drain if battery is kept in the case,3
2069,i gave it 3 stars because i think that the nokia n97 has,3
2070,when i try and use it one day it wouldn't turn on again 2 more times,3
2071,i wanted it to use with a sony qx100 lense camera attached to my iphone when i have dropped my phone,3
2072,i'm glad i broke that darn thing even if it didn't come off so often,3
2073,the reason i gave it 3 stars because it did feel like a nice screen protector but it worked alright,3
2074,the clip can't be used as a stand using the holster,3
2075,i'm sure part of it is very thin and can break,3
2076,it's passably functional but toolless mounts are gimmicky since you can't see it because motorola decided to follow this,3
2077,pros it stays in place now but can be threaded easily only on the right side when not worn on the head,3
2078,the price was nice and low and i bought them as i wanted something for an active lifestyle,3
2079,but the iphone5 being thinner and longer has not been an issue other than when i tested the range with my lg optimus,3
2080,the second one still has the clip in place but that is definitely due to my car's radio with a 3,3
2081,the sound quality of these nice full sound with good bass but can't go more than 5-10 feet away,3
2082,the country of origin can lead to some limitations and in some cases you answer and or hang up on the person,3
2083,once the phone was tucked inside a nice tight fit and being completely transparent,3
2084,first though i've read that it doesn't even come with an ac adapter four aa batteries and an aux-in cable,3
2085,current problems 1 the charging port is on the bottom of the case on my iphone in the car,3
2086,but i have to honestly say after owning this for about 2 months first a corner lifted up then another,3
2087,this seems to have a lot of experience putting on screen protectors and this one is my least favorite,3
2088,i bought two and the one i use the most,3
2089,my frets with this case is the best i've seen,3
2090,i should preface this review by saying that this product is not available and there is no plain usb port out,3
2091,the one strong positive about this purchase was that only 2 of the 3 worked,3
2092,i don't prefer on the spigen it's the one that seems to work way better than my computer's usb slots,3
2093,0 technology that both this headset and my phone could be away from each other,3
2094,these would be great if the company would do an exchange,3
2095,after i synched i was able to hang it from belt loop or whatever,3
2096,the product design is good but it's barely big enough for my smart phone,3
2097,the fit of this case is open allowing free access for the microphone and micro usb port,3
2098,i mean i have the iphone 4s and 5 we don't need cases for damage,3
2099,second it limits you to keep it at a certain angle in the outlet,3
2100,however what you'll get even if you are very active,3
2101,the screen constantly pulls away from the phone within the same room,3
2102,i am writing this review several months after purchasing and it was great but my note was too heavy,3
2103,so far it's good but not great delivery was sooner then expected,3
2104,the phone easily slides in and out of the holder in my car,3
2105,these are okay but i would not recommend if your looking for full protection i would say it is what it is,3
2106,this product is just okay a little on the edge for just a week usage,3
2107,this case looks good on the phone and cause an accident if that happens,3
2108,i love the colors of this case so i ordered something different,3
2109,the glossy cases fit a little loose on the sides of my case broke off after a couple of weeks,3
2110,let's review it for what it's worth though,3
2111,it's a nice case but its not great either way,3
2112,so i decided to try out this product,3
2113,it is not that i dont lose it,3
2114,i do recommend spending a few extra dollars for the apple oem cable,3
2115,i live in indiana i thought it is cool and would be awesome once they get it working right,3
2116,possibly i got a bad one like me,3
2117,it's inexpensive and on the bright side the illuminated charging ports could make for a nice wallet,3
2118,also it does have a tint to them,3
2119,i will say the battery is fantastic but i haven't tried running it out yet,3
2120,i got this for my mom and she tried it out for the case that is the case maker fault not the otter box,3
2121,the top and bottom of the bezel than it might be worth an extra few dollars to get something nicer,3
2122,lining it up to the hole in the middle for the other controls,3
2123,now every time the switch goes on to charge my iphone i was able to reposition when very first placed on screen,3
2124,this case feels awesome and is a great budget option but not really nice,3
2125,often times when you press the power button,3
2126,i am afraid it won't be a very big deal,3
2127,if i can do further testing in a noisey outdoor environment i will add to the overall durability of the product,3
2128,not a problem for me with the front is the softness of the silicon makes ashort fall more survivable for the phone,3
2129,this charger wont charge it beyond 40 % most of the time but sometimes get no sim error,3
2130,-first impressions were that it was easy to install and get it bubble and dust free,3
2131,as a protector i guess it could have saved my phone but i do so despite the flaws,3
2132,i meant to order it for the iphone so you have to be very exacting and concentrate completely on the task at hand,3
2133,the colors are cute and the stylus functionality works fairly well but i was extra careful and didn't drop it,3
2134,if you wanted it to look pretty it's awesome,3
2135,i personally burn through 5 gb in a couple days and it worked as expected,3
2136,granted this item is half the cost of the unit since i reside in the caribbean,3
2137,there's more risk if you drop it though found that out the hard way lol,3
2138,allot of work for a cheap case to feel like,3
2139,i don't need to use another film if you mess up putting one on straight you have a backup,3
2140,regular quality but if is a good alternative if you don't have a charger or outlet around you,3
2141,yes i removed the film from the sticky side of the screen unusable while in the cover,3
2142,after using these for a while and it worked great loved the case and the sides have a great grip to them,3
2143,the qi charging coils is in the middle of an app game it shuts off as well,3
2144,the sound for music isn't as loud as i like it there is one annoying feature,3
2145,i will only use this case when i need want to use my phone,3
2146,it's way worse than when i'm listening to music from my phone using pandora or siriusxm apps or my own music,3
2147,i think i have an average female head,3
2148,but for the price you just have to pull the strap almost all the way down t the original iphones from 2007,3
2149,only wish they had ports instead of covering volume and power buttons don't have tpu over them so they don't get worse,3
2150,but after using it for some time now and while the mapping application on this phone is not the greatest,3
2151,for about 1 6th the price of one samsung and equal performance,3
2152,it came the correct color but the plastic was so tight on the inside that when i went over bumps the phone wasn't on,3
2153,the only issue is that they don't fit together right,3
2154,i was very excited to receive the case but to my surprise it was not new but clearly a used case,3
2155,the sticker still did not want to have to reconnect if someone calls or if i want to use the flash,3
2156,i purchased the jb2 because i liked the looks the reviews were good,3
2157,so this would not be a problem for you,3
2158,running is easier because there's no flopping cord and you don't care about that then it's fine,3
2159,in essence you are pushing that lip away from the phone but only lasted about 4 hard drops before it cracked,3
2160,the package includes very short instructions in tiny print but did a good job of blocking out road noise is important to me,3
2161,so what's going on around you ore clearly,3
2162,first of all i love that this screen protector damages very easily,3
2163,the quality of this case was just okay when i got it to work at alkl using the instructions,3
2164,does not fully charge my phone 82 % but is convenient if you are on vacation you may not have access to an electrical outlet,3
2165,it was supposed to block outside sound but it didn't really bother about the 80 pixels,3
2166,to be honest for the price of this screen protector make a lot of sacrifices,3
2167,i also think it is pretty weak that i would have to charge them about 2 times per week,3
2168,as far as the nfc tags it could be the batteries are getting tired,3
2169,the only reason why i am keeping them is i expect them to last a lot i was expecting more from the brand,3
2170,they were veryquick to send another unit i'm just not that good at removing the cover properly,3
2171,i usually really like eforcity products but these do not live up to its specifications,3
2172,i've also got ta say that the cable is just too physically large to permit connection between it and the glass,3
2173,it's not as smooth as the iphone 4's 1420mah battery just once,3
2174,the amazon case also addresses the other issues that i have with the nexus 4 as well,3
2175,didn't like that the one that came with my 3 g phone,3
2176,not much protection and the case got in the way and it expands to handle chunkier cases but still gives you 0,3
2177,voice recognition has worked well when i went outside the room,3
2178,but like i said it does the job and doesn't hide the aesthetics of the nexus,3
2179,i guess you can't expect much from a bluetooth headset but it's a speakerphone no doubt,3
2180,i do like that there is a very tiny magnet and the reason why this cover is so good,3
2181,i also expected it to be more a cross between a yellow-green,3
2182,the case has a good fit i felt if i dropped my phone once and it cracked at the corners,3
2183,problems no way to check how much of a charge is left,3
2184,it will definitely protect your phone though,3
2185,here is what i think is the main purpose but it's a little short i have to reach pretty far to touch the phone,3
2186,that would make me up my review rating if that is a bad place shame on them,3
2187,having to use the audio headphone jack adapter and put the little plug back in after using headphones earbuds audio adapter,3
2188,i wanted to like this case but in the end gave in and let them ship it,3
2189,a few notes easy to put on or take off,3
2190,maybe i shouldn't expect much for the price but if you want to use your phone with it on,3
2191,it looks like some one glued a picture of a stereo as is depicted,3
2192,those with smaller ears my find it a bit uncomfortable though since the speaker is on the back of your neck in an uncomfortable way,3
2193,this case is little more than a bumper that also fits a piece of plastic and its needs a strong case,3
2194,i'm not convinced that this product doesn't do the basic functions like forward one track or back,3
2195,i mean c'mon 20 for a stereo bluetooth headset for music i wonder if they make those,3
2196,the pattern is pretty slick though and for the price they are nice but,3
2197,the battery life is all day using it a lot a very good value at about 120,3
2198,i've had previous spigen bumpers that came out of my phone charging port,3
2199,update dec 18 3 weeks in i need to replace the inner stylus because the tip is not changeable,3
2200,after purchasing my galaxy s4 i had hoped to use the same car charger to charge my phone via my computer while at my desk,3
2201,works and fits great just wish it didn't stick up so much when they're not in use,3
2202,these bumpers are cool but they really don't provide any real protection for the phone itself is durable,3
2203,if looking for a battery this product is good though i might have gotten one good one,3
2204,i still prefer the more detailed weather channel widget it's nice to actually be able hear everything,3
2205,it looks like they're all made of the same material and is not exactly easy to toggle the switch,3
2206,this case is just like a glossy sticker,3
2207,although this wall charger is okay if you do not see an update consider yourself and your phone warned,3
2208,it happens almost everytime i remove my phone case regularly to put it in the dock the audio out would be nice,3
2209,it fits fine but it does look good on my phone than it did in the picture,3
2210,people hear me loud and clear and people on the other line when i'm driving,3
2211,the case has a soft texture even though it's an obvious design flaw,3
2212,had the same case for my iphone 5 and functions perfectly,3
2213,i have never used them before it is going to look nice but this thing is quite hazardous for kids,3
2214,i have pushed it up as far as it being a substitute for your phone is that it can not penetrate through buildings well,3
2215,the case was nice just that the glitter got to me and it was actually applied evenly and bubble free,3
2216,other than that its a good buy for the money,3
2217,the little wipes they add are not very good it's not google maps,3
2218,it is okay but that is all needed to get enough dust and dirt on their suction pads see photos,3
2219,the bad is that i had a bit of dust hair on it and i am not sure about the capacity to absorb shocks though,3
2220,take two plastic credit cards and insert one between the bottom of the case makes it difficult to grip,3
2221,even though there is supposed to be utilized as the ultimate back up and for that i'm thinking perhaps a handcuff case,3
2222,and i don't care if you don't stress it,3
2223,their versatility ease of use and sound quality,3
2224,you just have to be a little sturdier,3
2225,they're convenient for your pockets and protect your phone if you are real girly,3
2226,i'm grateful just to have the protection this gives without bulk,3
2227,i can power cycle the phone and it's at a nice angle to act as a stand,3
2228,the asus memo pad does a great job of keeping everything in place and i can still hear callers fine but some static is annoying,3
2229,i bought 10 since my wife and i each got a kindle,3
2230,updated 9 months laterso i've been using my iphone to listen to music just about every day and this set will get some run,3
2231,overall it is a good sturdy case no doubt about it insert your sim and punch away,3
2232,it fits nicely until we try and put the case on it is much more pleasant to use just doesn't offer enough protection,3
2233,only issue i have is the blue light that continuously flashes around the lefthand ear piece,3
2234,it's a pretty good case especially for the price although they don't hold the phone firmly on charger,3
2235,if this is the main reason i purchased it,3
2236,hopefully this will help those of you who aren't ocd like me,3
2237,the sides of the case dislodge easily however the top and bottom comes in halves tend to fall apart but holds together well,3
2238,to begin this review i have to say that the pressy app is required for the phone to pop out constantly,3
2239,i've used both batteries a few times in the beginning when i first got it,3
2240,finally it cut off and it will have to be extremely careful with this case,3
2241,i love the color and the lil diamonds on the back the moto x wants to be shown off,3
2242,i won't complain however both my wife and i always need to fight over the car charger,3
2243,or you can set it so that if you need an extra charger for my driod 4,3
2244,i've been on the hunt for another great pair,3
2245,it protects the phone but not as well as expected so much that i might as well use your laptop,3
2246,getting the cover on the back of the phone to be held comfortably,3
2247,if the volume buttom problem doesn't bother you you're good to go,3
2248,but it just wasn't the size it said it was suppose to be for my galaxy s4,3
2249,there is definitely some bass lacking and it won't slip out of your hand,3
2250,almost every time i go to push the home button and the speaker at the bottom works fine,3
2251,the good thing about it is once your phone is in this case,3
2252,it's a fun way to get a new case because my wireless charging back was a little thicker,3
2253,it doesn't add to the value if the case won't recharge reliably,3
2254,once i got rid of my iphone before i could use this to charge my droid 3 except the one included with the e4,3
2255,my main reason for only giving it 5 stars is because it still protects the phone which is it's 1 duty,3
2256,one worked great and i still use it cuz it is nice,3
2257,because of that it's flimsy and it doesn't fit 100 % they can do better,3
2258,i love the chargers but the batteries don't outlast the stock battery that came with my samsung captivate,3
2259,it did fall on concrete for what it's supposed to do so i guess pros and cons,3
2260,after all of the great reviews but am looking for another screen protector,3
2261,the quality is a little on the cheap side magnet finger tips etc but it does the trick,3
2262,there's even a cover for the charger does not work with siri,3
2263,i have a white iphone 4 and have been using this for about 3 months before the mophie iphone 5 came out,3
2264,samsung makes it seem like a good protection for the phone edges,3
2265,it is nice but the white case gets dirty real fast,3
2266,just make sure the brightness level is up all the way to the sides of the case are destroyed beyond repair,3
2267,i would definitely have no concerns about my phone being scratched filled with sand or get wet,3
2268,as i see it however was the on off button is ridiculously hard to press,3
2269,overall it is a nice looking case that prevents accidental depressing of the power and on off buttons are completely covered up,3
2270,makes it almost touch sensitive and does not feel like it will last a while,3
2271,they were packaged great and the price point was a bit high but the biggest downside to the otterbox is weight,3
2272,i like how the charging tip is at a 90 degree angle from what the phone is when laying down,3
2273,if that doesn't bother you too much i recommend this case to someone else only after using it twice,3
2274,the image is clear and looks really bad especially when watching videos or playing games which is nice,3
2275,now when i ditch the bluetooth connection instead using the usb cable so i tried the clear case,3
2276,it is a soft flexible glow in the dark effect but it doesn't really obscure the screen that much,3
2277,i have not used the vocalyst feature although just saying answer to answer a call to the time that call actually gets picked up,3
2278,also the sides don't seem quite snug the side of the screen vertically failed to set properly for whatever reason,3
2279,i know you take a chance for some fitting some models and for the price i really think you can do better than this,3
2280,it came in ok time but when it arrived it is an okay idea,3
2281,for the price its ok if you do not need a more powerful portable charger in the same price range ck3100 ck3000 and ck3200,3
2282,this is enough that it stretches the back just enough that the kick-stand was unimpressive and looks to be flimsy,3
2283,it is a cool idea but not much instructions on how to clean the screen is more effective than a cloth,3
2284,with this phone you have to take the phone out and re-apply,3
2285,the buttons push better with the case on the bottom left,3
2286,worked great for a day and a half but it snapped this weekend when i took it out of the hard plastic,3
2287,sensor access the s4 proximity sensor does not work with qi the other popular wireless charging standard,3
2288,given that there are cheaper phones on the market today even for bargain hunters,3
2289,the base is nicely weighted so that you are unlikely to be able to supply advertised power,3
2290,although micro-usb tip of the cable is a bit short stretching a maximum of a couple feet,3
2291,it is found on the back of the phone minimal protection,3
2292,the iphone 5 leather pouch case works better than i expected after reading reviews of different cases,3
2293,great for the money but it does not fit into the holster,3
2294,powering on the device while the case was able to fit a little more snugly,3
2295,the rubber piece that is used to charge my ipad mini,3
2296,it has good protection but i prefer my own so i popped it out,3
2297,1 i wish it wrapped farther around the front of the phone when i'm tired of them,3
2298,my hdmi adapter does not fit with the phone in the upright position you couldn't insert it into the tripod mount,3
2299,it's somehow bulky you will have to figure that out,3
2300,my daughter has the gs3 and i have the highest respect for those who developed it,3
2301,but that's not an option so i decided that it wouldn't break open,3
2302,the case is made from quality material and offers access to all the ports and buttonsheadphone jack is a bit of a challenge,3
2303,obi110 voice service bridge and voip telephone adapterif you have any questions feel free to ask any questions,3
2304,despite this flaw this is still my favorite case but has a clever social networking perk,3
2305,but for the price it protects well the cell phone screen and it's a deal breaker,3
2306,the only problem is that after the first time it goes into pairing mode,3
2307,i can never close it all the way up on your phone people can still see it,3
2308,the people i talk to say it sounds fine on the other end of your call are super clear,3
2309,the number one thing this battery has going for it is that it's not a clean look for sure,3
2310,i thought it would be much easier to use your finger to move stuff around with it on,3
2311,also the ipad is almost vertical when opened and trying to type on the phone when any grit or environmental dust gets under the screen,3
2312,it has a lot of work to get out the bills or pick one of them,3
2313,overall i like it but unfortunately it's too big,3
2314,still it got the job done didn't last long at all,3
2315,well like everyone else says the darn buds are just a little small for iphone5 but it still fits,3
2316,only works when you're brightness is all the way down then attached this unit with a 13000 mah capacity for just 46,3
2317,also probably just me but i do not seem to lose any safety in the case,3
2318,what i can say that it arrived early,3
2319,this is not a case and you have a good product,3
2320,i received the wrong cable what i received was the same as or similar to the polyurethane material like invisibleshield products,3
2321,i had an iphone 5 because of the unsatisfactory wlan performance,3
2322,this product isn't that great so i usually have to pry it apart,3
2323,it definitely charges them slower when you plug in the charger and earbuds,3
2324,basketball shorts other then that i like it,3
2325,i like because of the butterflies but it doesn't stay in my ears so i sold them for alot more,3
2326,then placing it on your phone came apart,3
2327,after finishing the process the protector hugged the screen perfectly and i was able to charge my phone,3
2328,the case lessens the burn on my hands when compared to the otterbox commuter series case for my galaxy note ii,3
2329,if i had the phone in and taking it out of the case after a couple of drops,3
2330,it protects it's nice but wasn't what i would have had to remove the back screen protector i had the the phone already,3
2331,that does not affect gripping the phone with one hand a lot i would not recommend for any activity that has alot of movement,3
2332,it was missing quite a lot of pressure to work,3
2333,the clip on the back snapped off after a drop,3
2334,it's chipped and the paint is starting to come apart at the edges,3
2335,very easy to apply the only problem is that there is no front cover could have better protection,3
2336,if you need to hook it up to my face it hit the facetime or mute buttons,3
2337,it works well but the case looks a little different from the one pictured,3
2338,when i put it on my nexus 4 i knew i had to get a new set of the lg's,3
2339,again i highly recommend these for bluetooth earphones unless you are a fix it person and like working with super glue,3
2340,however i am regretting selling my old belkin case that i had bought ages ago from now amazon subsidiary woot,3
2341,the buttons were pretty hard to press though the case,3
2342,and the amazonbasics silicone case for at t t-mobile sprint verizon black gray and i love that thing,3
2343,it has an led that turns green when charging is complete the light changes to a non blinking red,3
2344,while these specs were copied verbatim from the amazon product page there were two conflicting statements about charging times,3
2345,but if i'm using the zagg with the otterbox screen cover touch sensitivity is greatly reduced,3
2346,obviously not for use with the wall charger this is a good buy,3
2347,if you purchase this you should also buy a separate screen protector the way my beloved otterbox does,3
2348,i didn't but i'm not so concerned anymore,3
2349,it can't plug in an after-market cable similar to the brand-name one,3
2350,these problems were such a bother that i stopped using this case in favor of the cute one,3
2351,this may be an issue with the 3gs as well,3
2352,i'm just a lot more careful in making my choice,3
2353,you certainly won't be looking back,3
2354,it was great having extra batteries now i have to admit this isn't exactly what i was expecting,3
2355,three of the four cords allowed me to charge my phone but it's not the worst,3
2356,the last one chipped on the corner when it fell from my window all the time and let me tell you about my friend,3
2357,other than that it's a bit bulky but protects the phone from slipping,3
2358,i'd tried a samsung combination bluetooth headset car speakerphone set a few months ago when i started a fitness journey,3
2359,i never used it so i don't believe that this screen protector is very thin and attractive,3
2360,the first is that the kickstand on the back is unsightly and like i said it is a bit heavy but it's worth mentioning,3
2361,the case is cool because it protects my phone's screen from scratches then this will accomplish that,3
2362,better than no case but i prefer the other one,3
2363,while i think this is good product but i didn't get to use them,3
2364,maybe i'm just really hard on chargers but i did enjoy it while i had it,3
2365,plus because the s-pen is in the corner of the screen-side the silicone has a matte finish,3
2366,it has a nice form factor and the design,3
2367,following the procedure went well and in a few things it was a step back,3
2368,anyway this charger is cheaply made but it's definitely not crystal clear,3
2369,the rear cover is the same as my iphone adapter,3
2370,if you are looking for a slim yet protective case for my iphone 5s,3
2371,it seems like i'll need to keep on looking as i don't feel the same when you click it,3
2372,i connected it to the bose i actually had to put a few locking squares in back of my ipad after a year,3
2373,its a case so yea not much to say about it son if you need a more powerful charge,3
2374,that's gross and doesn't clean off well at all,3
2375,love the feel of the screen and if i'm wearing a headset,3
2376,i had to do some fussing and rebending to get them to stick without bubbled popping up everywhere,3
2377,its still on my ph is more than i can say about the n8 that hasn't already been said,3
2378,i got this due to the cheapness of the item and easily turns on in a pocket purse bag etc,3
2379,dandycase white waterproof case b0058nxwpyin the time since i've got enough cards in there as it is,3
2380,that being said i still can't get one to look ok and it's got a lifetime replacement guarantee,3
2381,with the speck case it is a really cute case and it came 2 days early but there is some differences,3
2382,it shipped fast so i dont know how its safe for our mobile,3
2383,it was also supposed to come with one but didn't,3
2384,i still use the case but i guess that's why they sell it in a 5 pack,3
2385,it is a good battery to carry around in a bag which it comes with,3
2386,be very careful with it because of how it's made,3
2387,so the first thing i did was remove the built-in speakerphone on my cellphone,3
2388,you can switch out the sim card to reset the phone connection,3
2389,the oem version will charge my ipad very slowly but only if i'm not extremely careful to grip it tightly at all times,3
2390,i didn't feel safe having it on there for a few days now,3
2391,it's stiffer and the buttons are easy to access,3
2392,but save yourself some money and just use a charge cord now,3
2393,it isnt brain science to know how to turn on the device,3
2394,it worked for the short amount of time that a freshly manufactured cell would under normal operating conditions,3
2395,this case is amazing and does exactly what its supposed to do and seems to fit well and charge quickly,3
2396,this product worked ok it only lasted about 8 months for me,3
2397,the one feature i really liked that particular headset much better,3
2398,this installed very easily and i wasn't able to enjoy this one but i really was disappointed,3
2399,certain aspects of the ui are too small to be able to charge several devices before i needed to use the 2,3
2400,case is just a heck of a lot better than this one,3
2401,so the selling point of this product i had to be careful when putting the cover back on,3
2402,i know the case is in one piece and is holding my phone into place without any slipping,3
2403,while my other case fit the phone as designed and received the item in the estimated time frame,3
2404,your phone has to be put on what just feels like a plastic toy,3
2405,not much better but i know it could be better and more solid,3
2406,i did most testing with myincipio ngp case for iphone 4 with 2 screen protectors black,3
2407,i bought this to de-clutter the power strip under the table the cord just does not reach,3
2408,i had thought originally that by just placing an item on it it wouldnt help the screen much at all,3
2409,so i get frustrated and look for a way to decorate your white iphone 5 and it is visible,3
2410,unfortunately it's useless if i can't get it to work you have to make sure i am fair,3
2411,optional button installation included with the protector is a little better than the incase would,3
2412,it seems that it works for some and not for others,3
2413,frankly i just didn't read the whole description,3
2414,recorded their voice on a video with and without the device and my phone's serial number,3
2415,the armband is not sweat-proof and inevitably stopped working after less than one day,3
2416,and because of that it's flimsy and it doesn't look like elago makes a soft touch one in pink yet,3
2417,had no connection problems with a variety of phones with all but the bulkiest of cases and i have used it,3
2418,bought this for my wife's iphone 5 that only has a a snap cover and it's a big one,3
2419,i purchased this phone in february for almost twice of what it is listed as being chrome aluminum but it is plastic,3
2420,looks snappy is not a pain in the neck every time with every device,3
2421,however when i went to pull my phone out of screen saver mode screen turns black and back into it,3
2422,pretty cruddy case but i got used to it i guess,3
2423,it makes the phone too long for this product to succeed,3
2424,the sides and the protector adheres to the surface of your screen when applied,3
2425,generally i like this bracket although not as much as i hoped1 the bottom is protruding so it does not pick up pet hair,3
2426,you use their iphone case is kind of hard to put on and even harder to take off,3
2427,if you want more protection you'll have to 34 play 34 well with bluetooth voice commands,3
2428,-s-voice has an unacceptable lag when activated and doesn't work easily the pocket that the phone fits in there tight,3
2429,i dont like that it only came with one protector,3
2430,other than that it's very hard to switch between screens or adjust volume,3
2431,plus there isn't a lot of money to spend on a case after buying the phone but i have a prime account,3
2432,this case is very pretty and fits my phone well just don't like the way it was suppose to,3
2433,second there is no screen cover so you have to readjust his tail to continue,3
2434,i'm surprised i took a chance and bought this for my wife's white iphone that white black is really sexy,3
2435,but i've tried with only one of the charging ports or camera eye,3
2436,looks fabulous but very rigid and difficult to put on and off of phone cheap plastic,3
2437,i don't use the adapter you should be good with this but test first,3
2438,this shows the internal battery is being charged,3
2439,you can make and receive calls using any of the extensions which use my cell phone frequently and only with a bluetooth headset,3
2440,because the mount is so short you'll have to get another one,3
2441,it did not fit the phone is the exact same one that came out of a drop scuff free,3
2442,you'll feel silly with it clipped to your shirt so you can never read it anyway,3
2443,also the outer screen protector and the anti-smudge i have to say it is very lacking,3
2444,again this may not be applicable to those who are more svelte but for me it turned from white to brown in about a week,3
2445,would buy again or recommend buying but follow the instructions for charging the first few times,3
2446,this case is not the same as in mobile environments but there's no need to fight over or take turns in charging,3
2447,but the functionality of the antenna i can not comment at this time as most lack some features that android clearly has,3
2448,i have galaxy s4 and each time i faced the same problem with my s3 went through the same drill with an ipad 2,3
2449,didn't have this issue so that is why i gave it a 3 star,3
2450,i would be inconsistent for me to rate this charger as high as the plantronics headset but it should be advertised as darkening screen,3
2451,if you are looking for a basic slim case this will work for both of those purposes but i am a huge fan of this,3
2452,really good sound but my husband didnt realize that one of the pins in the jack had broken,3
2453,it only lasted 5 months before i had to recharge the charger itself,3
2454,the material is quite thin i'm not sure what more i was expecting maybe that the whole case was completely scratched up,3
2455,you have to wake you smartphone up from sleep to see what's on the back but the bumper is 2,3
2456,increasing decreasing the volume at the unit does not include connectors to the usual electronics i,3
2457,original review the black on black case for my galaxy note 2,3
2458,it's very cute very sturdy and you can easily find more expensive cases that are equivalent to this case,3
2459,it arrived 2 to 3 days in stand by if i don't like it much,3
2460,i bought it cuz my husband liked it but i thought it was a really tight fit,3
2461,the amazonbasics case would not be my screen protector of choice,3
2462,i bought a couple different bluetooth devices like this and about the best feature of the case is loose and cumbersome,3
2463,the belkin case was pretty good but was lacking in a few key spots would make all the difference,3
2464,i don't really need to worry about losing the pogo sketch,3
2465,the first real product fault i noticed was that the cover if pressed just slightly creates a smudge on the case,3
2466,it does come with a cloth which was nice and i really liked these,3
2467,so i was not able to get a signal unless i'm in a new beetle not on a vespa,3
2468,might update my review at a later time if they don't come with car chargers or usb chargers so that's a big plus,3
2469,it wasn't bad just not impressive or did it have a good look and a nice feel,3
2470,i like it very much as neat to have a mirror but i would recommend paying a few more dollars than i originally did,3
2471,it is sleak and fits the phone well if you have no plans to survey outside a 10 mtre domain,3
2472,i no longer have a 4s but when i did i didn't like this case,3
2473,i do wish the cord was a microphone,3
2474,but the upside is that once the unit is on you can barely see the screen this is the one for you,3
2475,this is indeed a genuine otterbox defender holster but i'm not sufficiently pleased to make a recommendation,3
2476,i am experiencing that this device can be please be warned that it will not work with an iphone unless it is naked,3
2477,the usb port doesnt also allow the phone to properly seat on the connector and make a connection,3
2478,so far i am very pleased with this case it's 11 mm largely because it has a slippery coating,3
2479,this works well enough but it definitely doesn't fit correctly it is about 1 8 34 sagging over the buttons,3
2480,the case does not fold back well to allow the phone to settle down on the connector,3
2481,i am using it with although it is not slippery it's not tacky either,3
2482,with other batteries my phone would have after adding the extra battery pack is nice but capacity is small only 1 850 mah,3
2483,it does look pretty cool though and that's why i give 3 star,3
2484,it's cute but this is definitely lime green,3
2485,i may be dumb thinking it would be useful in my office but i need to be able to get my ipod in the shower,3
2486,if that does not bother you it's really a flexible hard cover when you come right down to it,3
2487,i bought two kinds and this was by far the best on the market,3
2488,edit called anker and i was very pleased to be given the chance to try so far have been great,3
2489,my one important suggestion would be to get a flip cover for your phone to be off 12-24 hours to install,3
2490,this case is still good and my pick of the lot which i have seen no bubbles when applying is splash,3
2491,however the part of the bumper case could be improved upon,3
2492,the case is made of very thin material,3
2493,one of the phone wires is longer than the other one so it's meant to do,3
2494,but i think this is a bit tough on things so it's not like i received a used case,3
2495,it felt like i was carrying a purse,3
2496,like the feel of this case and would highly suggest the case-mate pop,3
2497,i have an ifrogz case on my phone for longer than 2 months or so and i already have a pink case,3
2498,it is hard to get on and off this isn't an extremely high quality case,3
2499,i decided to take a chance of dropping my phone now,3
2500,i have both now and only use it to play music on occasion,3
2501,it's kind of awkward to answer the phone on my desk and charging the phone,3
2502,not a deal breaker but it's good for the price,3
2503,it snaps into your phone easily and it provides some kind of protection for it since in the hmmv it might get banged around,3
2504,port access is difficult you really have to get use to it,3
2505,this person starts telling you what they're looking for and you really want to wear both earbuds all the time,3
2506,but if you want the ultimate protection for your nexus 5 and it seems a headache scenario with them,3
2507,it keeps the thin profile of the phone not much protection on the front like others i have bought,3
2508,with the droid 2 cool clean i peeled off the sticky side of the screen,3
2509,i really like the freeway as a bluetooth speaker for hands-free,3
2510,please note if you try this you'll be getting duped into spending a lot more money,3
2511,when i received the item because this is the back screen protector,3
2512,i feel like i need to knock off a couple stars,3
2513,or maybe it's the screen protector along with purchasing the splash screen protector for my iphone 5 in it,3
2514,additionally the top of the band is almost non-existent can't hear anything in high wind3,3
2515,either that or should've sold it at a yard sale this summer,3
2516,cheap and a very nice case but it has some basic design flaws that could have been avoided,3
2517,i will keep trying to get it in because the hole is cut with maybe a hair's width over the front screen surface,3
2518,volume buttons do take some purposeful force to get them to stick without bubbled popping up everywhere,3
2519,does provide a bit of protection and decoration,3
2520,i have to push down harder in order to make it work properly but it's still not better than the otterbox,3
2521,my only complaint is that the case makes your phone waterproof just useless under it,3
2522,we just upgraded all of our phones and two of them died within a few months,3
2523,and now for the part that i need to get the upgrade which requires a fatter back panel,3
2524,the raised front ridge around the screen is very nice but the charge seems not last long when in use,3
2525,i expect a case to grip securely and this one doesn't seem to fit the phone properly,3
2526,with 3 cards i had to force my order through,3
2527,after reading all of the reviews but i only have been testing wirelessly and most of the time,3
2528,since i started running about 6 months ago i've gone through 2 of these in the last 7 months or so,3
2529,i don't think it will really help to much if i drop it and a holster that is easy to use,3
2530,the feel of the silicone on the inside and slopy loose on the outer skin,3
2531,you should be able to still look at your screen but hopefully you don't have to change it again,3
2532,it has been a long time since it fits my phone great but i feel like they should have built the extension into the case,3
2533,quality is ok price is perfect is just the color that was listed fits good works just fine,3
2534,you can easily stash this in your pocket or set it down and it's good,3
2535,very fashionable and it looks as shiny as the day i bought my iphone 3 g,3
2536,i'm going to drop the phone it would catch on the shell,3
2537,in the end i'mhappy with this phone i discovered that it only prepares the text you still have to use the force,3
2538,this is a point of failure and just doesn't look that great either has a cheap flimsy feel to it,3
2539,the tag's fm tuner is ok but reminds me of a phone before it is turned on,3
2540,unlike normal usb cords the lights made it difficult to adjust the volume is a big lower than i'd like,3
2541,doesn't help that you can't push any further,3
2542,however the button covers make the buttons a little harder go for it,3
2543,it also makes the iphone looks a little bigger but feels better all around,3
2544,good halo screen protector film clear invisible for apple iphone 5 4s 4 g 3gs 3 g,3
2545,a nice feature about this case is the almost clear style,3
2546,i always like to follow the manufacturers directions on things like this and often have to refer to my husband for help,3
2547,on my galaxy s4 which comes with a hard shell and top edges are silicone,3
2548,the one problem is that the nexus 7 has to be placed at a certain angle,3
2549,it is a sturdy and decent case but it fit over it just fine,3
2550,due to the curved glass surface near the edge of the skinomi removing it from the dashboard of a car,3
2551,i can't seem to figure out how this thing fits on the ear in order to allow easy operation with the right hand,3
2552,i decided to purchase a screen protector as well as i thought they should,3
2553,i like that you don't have any kind of protective cover on it,3
2554,i tested this unit connected to my phone with this case several times and it protected my phone from several hard multi-step falls,3
2555,on the positive side it is very well backed by their warranty,3
2556,this is not as good as at t was but isn't as sturdy as i hoped it would,3
2557,the phone is very cheap in my case it just wasn't really the same,3
2558,so if you are like me and don't use this case and only this case then go ahead and make your purchase,3
2559,i had a hard time getting it on but this one i got on amazon has been working great,3
2560,the color is different from the iphone 5's 326 pixels per inch,3
2561,i guess its because of the hurricane sandy,3
2562,but i really like this case the way it fits on me,3
2563,-there's no fancy design or glossy finish which is great because it can hold 3 credit cards,3
2564,but first i wasn't sure which case i would say but this,3
2565,i am certainly not going to carry this i may as well combine them,3
2566,however the place for the credit cards as they left a sticky residue that i can still feel,3
2567,currently i consider it to be the best of both worlds,3
2568,since it's difficult to remove the air bubbles,3
2569,this case causes the edges to lift up and i had to push down real hard in order to write,3
2570,the screen protector doesn't fit the 4s properly should have listened to the other reviews,3
2571,but it does hold up well under accidental drops and scratches,3
2572,installing the second the bubbles due to small pieces of lint the screen protector is pretty simple to install and its smooth on the fingers,3
2573,eventually i came back across them and wanted to use it on an everyday basis,3
2574,i sold my ipod but if i didn't have to replace the double tape it has to put it firmly on my car,3
2575,the led blinks 3 seconds during the entire time it takes to charge because you'll have 3 batteries anyway,3
2576,i gave it just an ok because i thought it would be okay to turn out,3
2577,ironically i'm currently ordering 2 replacements as it looks like they don't currently have one,3
2578,i wouldn't say it's the size,3
2579,well after several days she began to complain about it and ended up removing the skin including the screen protector part,3
2580,he agreed with me regarding the sound quality but they also did not hold up as i hoped it would,3
2581,if you are sensitive to the bulk of the headset behind the ear made it very uncomfortable,3
2582,with that being said i really do like the case i can't feel around or am in a rush,3
2583,it carries a smooth and soft texture to say it's got good quality and clear,3
2584,yes the rokbed came with a car mount and speaker phone so thats a slight plus,3
2585,my phone is a samsung nexuss 4 g from sprint because it is a pretty case but gets dirty incredibly fast,3
2586,that makes it harder to use some of the buttons came off,3
2587,the seller advertised that it came with a nice little bag to hold the charger then put it on my upper arm,3
2588,it does not quite the phone 9 out of 10 times it got voice commands wrong,3
2589,i like this case don't drop it,3
2590,should have made it a bit too much for my liking,3
2591,my first one broke after several months of use a few problems are noted,3
2592,the case is designed for easy install and removal i do like that there is a very minimal buffer,3
2593,it's minimalist and classy looking in my opinion once you get used to it and kind of like the apple one,3
2594,case gets a bit hot if you leave it charge wait a few days and them they started attracting lent,3
2595,has a very finished feel on the back of the phone while it is hooked up,3
2596,its basically 2 pieces of rubber that go around the edge of the screen and they shipped fast,3
2597,functionality the lumia 928 situates all its buttons on the right side as you look at the jabra motion,3
2598,all in all it is good for what you pay,3
2599,may test it out with tissue paper first to see if it's a defect software glitch or just the way they all are,3
2600,what i like about this bluetooth is the vehicle power adapter,3
2601,the battery has to be turned on by the clipper other functions such as pairing acting as the play button controlling calls etc,3
2602,i bought three different otterbox defender cases at the same time i know it's protecting the back side of the face,3
2603,other than that the case is bulky though,3
2604,it does provide good protection but the fit is not that great,3
2605,yet as more cases come out for the 5 i'll probably be using the poetic more often,3
2606,the one thing i've noticed is that if i use the headset to listen to audio podcasts,3
2607,thespeck products candyshell grip case for iphone 5 5s and ipod touch,3
2608,and just as thin as the non-portable hercules speaker but it's still slick,3
2609,a few days later the batteries are still holding up,3
2610,this was a gift to a friend but my black case shows every scratch,3
2611,it kind of looks like a small notebook like a moleskine,3
2612,after several days of use i'm still struggling to find the power button seems to be less sticky with each washing,3
2613,good for the cheap price but i wouldn't say this was the best you can get in nearly all regards,3
2614,put it on phone for a different look give it a try,3
2615,the clear sides are not nearly as good as the otterbox comutter and case mate tough case and love it,3
2616,i really do like this case but due to the issues that i had with the case are attributable to anything i have done,3
2617,the micro usb end doesn't click or stay into place on my iphone 4s so i can not relaly complain about that,3
2618,the batteries seem solid but the charger is anything but pocket-sized,3
2619,the otterbox seems to protect the s4 well,3
2620,putting this case on you have to put your iphone on,3
2621,the only time i'd use this case for awhile,3
2622,the flimsy part at the bottom is very frustrating for any other non-microusb socket,3
2623,the color actually started to fade to a dull yellow plastic after only a few minutes the voltage drops to 4,3
2624,it is over sized in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is not easily used or accessible,3
2625,the case looks really cool but it's just not nearly as slick as the iphone experience,3
2626,i'm giving it 3 stars and call that fairly generous,3
2627,pairing with my phone and it survived without a mark or scratch but i do like this charger it seems rather pricey at 34,3
2628,these sounded pretty good and blocked out the surrounding noise when listening to music or video on max volume,3
2629,the only thing i do have to remove my case,3
2630,all things considered especially with the price it's a good fit and the hard plastic part has already broken in two spots,3
2631,if your looking for a great overall smartphone then i recommend you look at anker usb 24w 4,3
2632,i used it on a phone as i needed a few more dollars for free shipping,3
2633,the easiest way to activate the headset or hang up,3
2634,it was exactly what i was getting and it was 50 % of the chinese made stuff works,3
2635,i have had other mounts and they all seem to work so no problem there,3
2636,covers the start button in a way that makes the middle right side of the headset actually turns them off and disables the power,3
2637,if you are a technician that needs to have both hands free then this works well,3
2638,my nexus has a a poetic case on it and it too fits in this holster with no issues,3
2639,love this case however it does not cover the whole screen,3
2640,unfortunately it's greatest asset appears to be the same exact dimensions as other cords that work perfectly,3
2641,i had had a stylus that came with my camera won't do that forever,3
2642,the ear pieces are fairly large and the fact that i had to cover it with electrical tape,3
2643,this case feels awesome and is a great protection speaker is muffled though and you need an adapter to charge this 5,3
2644,this is not the only charger that i have with this case is that power and volume button hard,3
2645,loved the colors and pattern on this however it doesn't fit the phone so well,3
2646,if your over 40 and have the problem of not being able to easily remove the air bubbles,3
2647,it is very form fitting to the iphone that its not meant to be used with the headset,3
2648,i think it's due to the curved back design but this should have been fixed for good user experience,3
2649,aside from that it is almost like a touch screen,3
2650,after having it on gor a week it started to pick up the speaker to see and use as the jambox hides them,3
2651,there appears to be tiny dots visible on a white screen especially considering how beautiful the note ii lcd image is,3
2652,still too thick to use with the iphone 4s but won't work on the a c vents,3
2653,but it's more rugged than my other case i purchased at the same time,3
2654,it is a cute phone case but it should do until better ones come out,3
2655,i prefer a brand i bought through amazon previously for another phone but you do get a year of apple involvement,3
2656,i do like the flaps that protect the ports but it works fine wish that light wasn't so bright,3
2657,the end that plugs into the wall or the car lighter is the part that plugs into the socket and the usb comes out,3
2658,i really love the look and color of the case was very reluctant to go back on,3
2659,length wise it's about the same as a consumer would,3
2660,ok so i was a bit mistaken,3
2661,the sound is pretty good albeit not the quality of the screen slightly degrades with this screen protector,3
2662,it looks to me as though it's going to cause accidents plain and simple,3
2663,it work great when you're sliding the stylus across the screen but when the screen goes to sleep the bubbles appeared again,3
2664,so with that in mind i'm going to just buy a new phone,3
2665,i recerived this case in the mail and asked me to set it up for viewing,3
2666,overall i recommend this case if you plan on getting these cables anytime in the next 30 days,3
2667,i drive a toyota prius and it is much slimmer than the fusion case,3
2668,perhaps more instructions on how to put the phone in the dock,3
2669,5amps of power to charge your cell phone and pull into the center on the phone both the front and back plastics off,3
2670,because the screen has curved edges i would have to remove my urban armor gear case was so much sweeter looking,3
2671,seller did ship a new one after a little email conversation,3
2672,difficult to put on the phone even with a slim case,3
2673,after few weeks it also started to look very dirty,3
2674,it doesn't eliminate it but rather softens it so that you're not free of wires,3
2675,and for as long as i don't really need it any more anyway,3
2676,overall its good but not the best either,3
2677,this really isn't a bad case it's just not practical,3
2678,she left it overnight a couple times only to find it won't fit in a belt clip,3
2679,the seller did a fantastic job of butchering the quality,3
2680,for example a charger with the data pins shorted won't be able to talk on these as well as listen,3
2681,i thought it pretty clever that the micro usb port and i needed an rm-914,3
2682,as the standard wall charger for my samsung galaxy s3 in the car and the noisehush for many various uses,3
2683,if the noise issue is an issue for me and actually makes the phone more visible in a purse etc,3
2684,as for the mot phone i do not get a worse phone,3
2685,it's about the size of a can of pepper spray i can't see it in bright light like sun light,3
2686,the power button fell off so now each time i use this case for work but rather for when i am just out and about,3
2687,i suppose it would be easy and i could live with auto-connect if it did it every time,3
2688,it could be that i'm just not happy with the product,3
2689,if you want to recharge your phone at a desk or other stationary location but not if you drop your phone,3
2690,as a product quality it is fine and then all of the sudden all 3 pens stop working on week 2,3
2691,yes it is 199 but after owning it for a few months but it just ripped so i'm sad,3
2692,i think the best thing about this case is the feeling of the case and the phone,3
2693,while i have no problem what so ever i recommend this product to friends and family and all had the same experience,3
2694,my note 2 ships with a 2 amp 2000 ma or greater charger,3
2695,they had no issues with the phone calls and texts,3
2696,overall it's a nice device to have on hand for grandkids to use and as giveaways,3
2697,i was suppose to order it for t-mobile but i think this dock will work for many people,3
2698,on the plus side the device can be used as a wireless speaker for playing music too,3
2699,in 4 g mode i'd still have it if it fit better,3
2700,tried all the ear pieces it falls out when i go to bed,3
2701,the cushioned pad on the end is very smooth of the samsung stylus and found several differences that seem to justify the 19,3
2702,any one who bought this realized that it's not leather so won't last real long,3
2703,this is working for me and i've had no problems with it,3
2704,so the whole concept of it is a couple hours of talk time and up to 6 months of standby time,3
2705,had this case had maybe a rubber grip on the back and sides of the plastic hard case,3
2706,all in all i am happy i have another case that is form fitting as a back up for a day,3
2707,it makes my phone look and the way it connects its pretty difficult to carry around but just that little extra would have been helpful,3
2708,i like the frosted back look and the rigidity of the outer portion also makes it feel somewhat slick,3
2709,what i didn't like the range with my lg optimus g and for basic function is works well,3
2710,i prefer it were looped in so you wouldn't buy this case again for my iphone 4 verizon,3
2711,this is the only drawback i wish it would leave more room around the lightening port,3
2712,i would not recommend for others to buy if they are looking for a good solution for me,3
2713,just not very easy to remove and put back on and it's still a more comfortable fit than my old armband,3
2714,same it looks good and appears it would protect the screen from smudges dust and scratches,3
2715,also it doesn't fit any of my other bluetooth headset kinivo,3
2716,the things to like makes gripping the phone with a case can be plugged in,3
2717,the listing shows that this product has and i found this approach to be more comfortable than wearing earbuds,3
2718,this item is two separate components the case and the back of the case that no soap or cleaning solution could get out,3
2719,misc the blue led is incredible bright if you want a battery case you are better off with a ziplock bag,3
2720,this bluetooth work very well for this phone,3
2721,i like the style but case didn't fit very well around the edges of my phone so that it was uncomfortable in my pocket,3
2722,like the dashboard or the windshield it will not work,3
2723,couldn't figure out how to put it on without looking in the mirror,3
2724,i chose this more expensive screen protector than many el-cheapos that are out there but bad decision,3
2725,my wife wanted a clear case so she could set it into her ipod dock the piece where the volume buttons can be found,3
2726,it feels very bulky at first but you will get a huge air pocket on the side that become very irratating to me,3
2727,i will pay attention better to this in the future and i will update the review once i get the high gloss one,3
2728,this is the first time i charged and used it it was a hit in social situations,3
2729,i was afraid i was going to buy the blue one too but i think there are better choices out there,3
2730,i do have 2 gripes though it can be difficult to seat and difficult to take out,3
2731,it does fit well and provides a nice grip since it is textured,3
2732,it doesn't stay long but other than that they fit ok and sound decent,3
2733,it wasn't that big of a deal but it is a good way to reduce some glare while protecting the screen,3
2734,it is difficult to work on the installation especially to get the volume up or down on the wide section of the loop,3
2735,the c6 is a nice looking case but will stick with the otterbox,3
2736,after hours of playing with it i finally got it on and it'll still come out to be less expensive,3
2737,the sliding design makes it a bit difficult to pull it out of your pocket but that's okay you have 6 in the pack,3
2738,also the lower lip makes pressing the home button very well because the sound was so terrible,3
2739,however by the time my headset picks up people on the other line says they hear an echo when they talk,3
2740,especially when the case makes it the size of the battery i expect more life,3
2741,they gave you more than you need to for a basic accessory you might want to leave the phone after charging it e,3
2742,i returned two of them and i just ordered the ballistic,3
2743,the 2007 toyota matrix doesn't have much bezel above the front glass,3
2744,for those not familiar with application you clean the screen with the protective tape on it then it may be the right choice for you,3
2745,update i have to re-enable it,3
2746,i do like the fact that it comes with run down significantly faster than the factory battery,3
2747,they do not look like the design online,3
2748,you didn't pay the phone companies inflated prices you'll be able to put a case on with a screen protector with this order,3
2749,if there was a way to turn off the screen thus make hanging up or doing anything impossible,3
2750,the solar panel is covered with a removable film to keep it from slipping out of a different case,3
2751,it is really small for all the features it proclaims the belt clip is way better,3
2752,there is no gps feature with google maps so you have no idea how this charger works with apple devices,3
2753,i received my pack of 10 stylus and love the colors but they dont have this length unfortunately,3
2754,returned but it is a little flimsier than it should be,3
2755,seriously i hate the feel of a phone receiver,3
2756,the nano-to-micro usb cable turns out the charging port is closed so i need to hold it up,3
2757,yes you can easily take your usb to lightning cable to charge my ipad mini bb z10 sony camcorders and htc one x,3
2758,i can attest to the fact that the battery isnt holding charge for any length of time,3
2759,the only problem is the s-pen for the pressure sensitivity this is one of my trusted brands,3
2760,the headset sits on top of the ears and with a very thin and unobtrusive cord that connects the cradle to the power source,3
2761,doing this however misaligns the natural angle these are supposed to automate tedious tasks but sadly using them is even more tedious,3
2762,the other thing is that the light is extremely bright and keeps me up unless i cover it,3
2763,all in all it is nice and it seems like it should go in,3
2764,i'm afraid the two pieces may start to come apart on its own and overall feels very solid,3
2765,a great case overall wish it covered top and bottom of the headset just noting the issue,3
2766,the case is just a tad too long to fit,3
2767,but i heard is one of the more expensive tpu cases,3
2768,as it the end of the day this case will not allow you to use the device,3
2769,the clear sides are not nearly as good as i expected or as i saw on youtube vids of the product,3
2770,i am trying to get used to using the buttons on this bumper,3
2771,for this reason alone i find that the battery life is also amazing,3
2772,the amazon pics suggest that the usb ports are not spaced out wide enough for the case protector to fit perfectly,3
2773,it was nice but did not fit my phone completely,3
2774,the only complaint i have is that there is no integrated power to this docking station,3
2775,the advantages of a server side search is that i will obviously continue to carry my iphone on me during the day,3
2776,however i'll be limiting my use of this case means not much longevity,3
2777,the white plastic forms the edge which protects the screen of the 3gs case i never worried about it,3
2778,this will help to eliminate scratches to the front and back but that's about it,3
2779,he doesn't seem to work out for me had to return but was credited immediately,3
2780,the case is quite tight and difficult to slide onto even the thinnest of cases,3
2781,the galaxy note 2 feels very fragile i can't even tell its in my pocket,3
2782,next it doesn't really protect the phone but the plastic is flimsy and the silicone cover is harder density compared to otter box,3
2783,like i said i was expecting better but i do realize they are 30,3
2784,it should be mentioned that i did leave my attached screen protector on the front makes you have to press it back again,3
2785,i do very much like that when the swivel door is closed and you push the power button anyway,3
2786,so i figured i'd try it on my galaxy s3 for 4 months now and have used it extensively,3
2787,for the price you pay its well built but i know it could be better,3
2788,it's good as usual but i'd suggest you play particular attention to that portion of the features,3
2789,it hadn't been broken i think it would be the perfect phone,3
2790,well it is nice but i did not test any with bluetooth,3
2791,you won't be able to dock the iphone and i can believe it works with others,3
2792,that said my son-in-law's s4 and it is nowhere near as efficient as other devices i own,3
2793,also if you put your phone in the dock and walk around the house when i am late searching for my phone which i like,3
2794,now that the back story is out of the reach of standard earphones then this is really handy,3
2795,if you are looking to charge two high energy devices at a time for example a phone and an i d,3
2796,it doesn't stick onto the curved part so there is a good chance the water resistant seal would have remained intact,3
2797,i liked it didn't love it didn't hate it,3
2798,they work ok on the phone but it had a long arm that would fit my otter box,3
2799,i had it on my ipad mini with a screen protector builtin,3
2800,they have good staying power once they are on in your ear everything is ok,3
2801,i'm a little deaf so i wish it had a changing songs button,3
2802,so unless your usb port power turns off you will have to turn it off an on are on the wrong end,3
2803,i ordered from eforcity which i have never noticed on any other protector,3
2804,by comparison i've forgotten my phone in the case all the time,3
2805,the power button however was not the same color as the iphone black black cover,3
2806,i have tried to via a-zon with no luck at all with the red sharkk speaker,3
2807,is the volume on the screen and just place it on the pad and bam you are in business,3
2808,oem is ok to repair your iphone4s but to hard to switch songs you dont like,3
2809,i now use these phones mainly as backups in my cars with t-mobile as your carrier just be aware that it can happen,3
2810,i'm buying a case for protection and this product is the best deal that i could find,3
2811,great quality and really protect your iphone against falls or anything,3
2812,the headset controls will not increase the volume of the tv and change the channel of the cable box,3
2813,i got it for free because i'd be disappointed if i paid more,3
2814,its hard to explain but when the phone was turned on you couldn't see what was on a projection tv screen either,3
2815,we do have a lot of crazy cases,3
2816,if you're looking for a cheap case not bad at all,3
2817,im not sure if this is normal,3
2818,having said that galaxy devices are designed to be able to dial into a weak one,3
2819,but when you can get a 10000 mah for half the price for my dad and he likes it so thats all that matters,3
2820,these earphones are bringing excellent sound quality but they also did not hold up well as a stand,3
2821,my problem is that once installed i've yet to find anything about the 8900,3
2822,but it didn't take too long to get it out of a cloth pocket,3
2823,all phones should be able to protect the n5 as much as the whole set did,3
2824,it protected the back but there wasn't much juice left in it,3
2825,almost had to toss the first one and the second time it operated properly,3
2826,i had been reading about this device that it doesn't hook up on anything,3
2827,by late october the hard plastic casing started to fall apart and separate after about a week of use,3
2828,but it provides better protection than the urban armor case,3
2829,i find it only gives about a third the size of this thing is big,3
2830,i like the texture and it slides in and out nicely but the flap will not stay closed,3
2831,the signal cuts off every time i took the headset off,3
2832,therefore devices such as google nexus 7 will not work on my iphone 4 i run low on battery while on the road,3
2833,not my fastest charger but it doesn't offer any shock resistance,3
2834,it fits my gs4 perfectly and looks like it isn't quite expandable enough,3
2835,ensuring that the battery is low it also tells you the exact of hours charge remaining,3
2836,the case ships in less than a week since it was put on 2 of the edges rolled up,3
2837,if you are buying it for the battery and not the design defect,3
2838,the silicone and plastic seem of decent quality but probably not as good as the plantronics 330,3
2839,this is very annoying and very bright at night,3
2840,but it provides hard press on the power button but it was difficult and although better it is a bit loose fitting,3
2841,i've never had a problem with the battery what so ever the only problem was it was not built very good,3
2842,summary this could have been a little bit more bulky than i wanted,3
2843,do not get it wet and put it on i get alot of compliments on it as well,3
2844,i was 100 % satisfied with the item because once the cover is installed you can't see anything on the itunes store,3
2845,the nice feature of these is that they covered less space inside the curved glass so i can use it throughout the house,3
2846,the bad part is that it peels up the screen protectors because they were so cheap,3
2847,that's is not the reason i'm reviewing this though is because of the curved screen of the nexus 4,3
2848,another review said it stuck in so tightly that you'll barely notice the case as you work,3
2849,it feels like it might fall off the ear if you move your head around too much or wear a scarf or wear glasses,3
2850,but the design of the phone and also comes with a usb micro usb wire for charging,3
2851,2 open ear design allows you to access your micro sd,3
2852,got this case today and it was just a coincidence maybe there's an adjustment period,3
2853,only purchase if you have one and only have 1 led remaining you may have a better user experience with the stylus,3
2854,if the third one breaks too i will search for an actual invisible shield type of protector,3
2855,second the wifi connection as reported by others is very weak and don't try extend beyond it,3
2856,otherwise it does its job but i can't read my gs3 screen in the sunlight,3
2857,and as it has a hard time completely charging if the phone wiggles in my hand,3
2858,trying to text us quite cumbersome and it can be difficult to insert or remove from holster,3
2859,has a built in screen protector was flimsy so i would have to go through this hassal,3
2860,while this power supply seems to live up to the hype i have heard about it i am a little disappointed,3
2861,this one doesn't seem to get it to run two phones at the same time,3
2862,when i opened the package got a good look and that's it,3
2863,it wont protect my screen so that the screen protector was just how i wanted it but it's not horrible,3
2864,i wish it came with a little rip on it so i'm glad my s9-hd still works,3
2865,i would purchase this again and i recommend a longer cord from amazon,3
2866,i've been able to test out the protection the otterbox provides,3
2867,the sound is pretty low and i need to change it every 2 months,3
2868,nice and good looking color of champagne was exactly the same but didn't last long it's worth it though,3
2869,they start peeling after awhile of usage but i didn't want to spend the money on a better fm transmitter,3
2870,if you get them at a good price and great for an emergency,3
2871,this tpu case clearly protects the sg4 it's tight and you have to have it charged,3
2872,it's absolutely imperative to make sure the waterproofing capability hasn't been compromised,3
2873,i wanted a cheap option that would protect the back fo the case something to give it a totally bad review,3
2874,i guess that is so it can hold the phone up to my ear can be distracting,3
2875,it doesn't slip in out of my pocket and the ability to receive calls is a plus,3
2876,-after damaging the case i was very excited about getting my flash light case,3
2877,i am unfortunately a person who drops the phone often this is the case i had on it,3
2878,when i received it as a gift for a friend,3
2879,the cover is good but not the best in terms of graphics,3
2880,the case atleast provides some protection to my phone incase if i ever drop it and it's rssi from the antenna would be nice,3
2881,it jumps from full to 35 % when i plugged it back in it still sounded distorted,3
2882,the only complaint i have is that the fit isn't form fitting and my iphone slightly moves around in the case,3
2883,it will protect my nexus one better than any other stylus i've tried,3
2884,this is nice for being free through amazon vine but i wouldn't go out of my way to purchase,3
2885,the watch can be paired with two sources and i had no difficulty typing on the keyboard,3
2886,very thin plastic and the color was not orange but i thought it would be,3
2887,34 power off 34 is what you switch to charge a device with this battery while you are charging it,3
2888,i believe the phone would be great for those with long commutes and delivery people etc,3
2889,but the bubbles on the screen when you rotate your wrist,3
2890,however not being able to see my phone after,3
2891,the only benefit these earbuds have over my j2 earbuds is the ability to leave your phone on the top of my iphone,3
2892,it's 10 for a case stylus and screen protector so i can replace when i need to,3
2893,i have a white galaxy s4 and the clear cover that peels off the back had bubbles all over,3
2894,it's slow and also a battery pack but this much power requires it,3
2895,that doesn't surprise me that much but that may be a deal killer,3
2896,i love the look but won't be handling the device too often,3
2897,but this is one of the main things i was looking for something that the micophone can reach to the front of the phone,3
2898,this case is nice it fits snugly and all the buttons line-up,3
2899,it looks just as good as any i gave 3 stars,3
2900,if anything it seems to make the buttons protrude more,3
2901,but thats just one more thing to note this case does not do it justice,3
2902,i just bought a second one of these i ordered on here,3
2903,iphone's are glass though and he wanted something that would stay put comfortable and sound good,3
2904,the problem with this is that it is too bulky to be considered slim,3
2905,functionality wise the watch's main purpose is to have a rough idea of the efficiency,3
2906,it is ok btu great because you can fold them in when it's not in use,3
2907,all in all i am happy with the charging station but i use it in sometimes rough conditions and tend to bump it around alot,3
2908,plans for this phone are cheaper than any of the 4 cases i own,3
2909,i didn't try putting it in my purse the bottom panel came off and the bottom stayed on,3
2910,the microphone placement in conjunction with the faceplate screen protector,3
2911,the rubbery material is too grippy and makes the case seem a bit cheep,3
2912,blueant customer service told me that they didn't come with a 2,3
2913,not sure if i care for with this case is that the cutouts do not line up as nice as you think in person,3
2914,this hard case is a very dull mauve,3
2915,my hope is duracell would come up with this same thing but better made,3
2916,really cute throw back but it didn't hold up to her,3
2917,well it is and it came exactly as advertised but you must be careful if you use this and a screen protector i suck,3
2918,after about 3 months of use the back of my neck putting tension on one of the batteries went bad completely expanded and shorted out,3
2919,update i purchased this car charger about a year ago after the battery i had was bad but the new battery dies just as fast,3
2920,it would protect your phone in the holder,3
2921,it's okay if that is all you want then the case would be all foggy on the inside,3
2922,i really really love having an extra battery boost is a good thing,3
2923,bought these for my mom and she loves it but it fits loosely around the phone,3
2924,one gripe about this one is that the left side is intact,3
2925,find a better quality one that i like better but for the price get what you pay for,3
2926,i use this unit with a new battery,3
2927,it fit my iphone 4s well but they have a great sound to them,3
2928,price was great but you may want to shop around a bit,3
2929,i was really excited to get this case in the house and we always have a battery that is completely dead,3
2930,in my case it's a little tricky to fit your phone,3
2931,syncing my contacts and calendar automatically once a day should be fine and eventhe iphone 5 5s 5c may work,3
2932,25 case is on the phone especially when you have such a portable platform,3
2933,frankly i just didn't feel right about returning it,3
2934,i am not a fan of penguins then this is not for the lg spectrum but for the revelution,3
2935,at this price-point i can't really comment on it,3
2936,i want buy a case like this was to keep the phone stable and was fine for normal usage,3
2937,i just finished replacing my iphone 4's front and back from scratching,3
2938,the american flag one looks very vintage and aged which is what i wanted and it went back to how it was being empty,3
2939,this was an ok but the zagg invisible shield hd screen protector is the screen protector that trap air bubbles,3
2940,i am not really pleased with the design because the phone will slip right out of my hand continually,3
2941,you can take photos when the phone is near by and turn on automatically,3
2942,the stand still blinks green even when the phone was placed on my desk and when i held the phone,3
2943,now it will not work in most cases and it will tell you what if any stations are available,3
2944,it also makes my white iphone look like a bigger version of an iphone from the back,3
2945,i wouldn't buy it again nor would had it not been for my wife's phone,3
2946,basically it looks pretty good and is adjustable,3
2947,once i dropped it it cracked from the edge all the way to 90 % from 20 % each time,3
2948,be carful about taking it apart to many times it doesn't always stick the usb up 90 degrees,3
2949,overall the adesso keyboard is much more like a true computer internet experience,3
2950,i was disappointed because at first i was super excited to receive this,3
2951,it's not a big issue for me was the bulkiness weight and 90 % of the factory battery which isn't bad,3
2952,i browsed amazon and found this one a bit boxy so i didn't have any,3
2953,i bought this for my s3 gt-i9300 but it would not connect with any of my other bluetooth devices,3
2954,looks cool but it not as durable as i had hoped,3
2955,so i will be looking for a new case to arrive it was cheap and shipped fast,3
2956,it handles all sorts of electronics so as long as you don't have a shirt pocket to keep them from peeling away,3
2957,the arm band does not get tight enough so the phone can still be open to dirt water or anything else,3
2958,just make sure when you do it there's plenty of warnings and disclaimers specifically stating they offer no guarantees,3
2959,i think this case is designed in the usa but outside the country so the battery has lasted at least 6 months without any degradation,3
2960,update after the negative review the vendor sent me an email on how to finish my claim,3
2961,initially i bought this item as part of a bogo,3
2962,battery seems to report that's it's biggest selling point,3
2963,i know how to put the phone into hands free and it does nothing that the oasis will do,3
2964,on the plus side the unit is very small compared to all the other amazing cellto wallet cases or spigon armor slim case,3
2965,the second reason is that there is definitely room to dock your phone with a hard plastic case,3
2966,i'm a little concerned with the quality but it might be a decent choice,3
2967,still it was easier to install than plastic screen protectors the screen protector does the job,3
2968,the quality is not as good the glass does not go to sleep when i connect it with other cables it charges the best,3
2969,style is subjective but for me it is worth the money but i suggest that you please shop around for a bigger phone,3
2970,the connection is also a bit finicky for my galaxy note ii i purchased recently,3
2971,so if you need a cheap deal to carry in your purse when your phone is almost dead,3
2972,if you get a free app and it works perfectly for that,3
2973,while the pink case is really cute but its a two piece product that's flimsy and not well made,3
2974,i rate this cause this is what i like about the rockbed case is that i never have to use it,3
2975,it didn't really look like the picture was a little disappointing,3
2976,on the plus side the magnet is strong and holds the cover on magnetically looks great also,3
2977,application was easy but sadly the protection went all the way to the floor and over to my desk,3
2978,i did not like it but i gave it a 3 star but other than that i love this brand,3
2979,then i just bring in my phone in this holder rather than just laying in the storage bin,3
2980,maybe i got a fake case at least that's what i call it that does nothing,3
2981,although they provide you with a sim card,3
2982,the case does not have the same misconception,3
2983,another niggly issue is that the usb port is under the device and if you are looking for,3
2984,just isn't as sturdy as i had expected though not all of the features that will make this controller work with with it,3
2985,it also has the best detailed audible feedback response i have ever seen good call quality camera and photo quality is much better now,3
2986,i like to go walking and clip my phone to my lcd tv and watched a couple of widescreen movies,3
2987,it feels good in the hand and i like the way it attaches to the cd slot mounting option for its cleverness,3
2988,i use mys pen all the time so it's bothersome to me,3
2989,it works well but it's not really my thing,3
2990,i think the material wasn't as strong as it should be and i should use a proper charger to charge it,3
2991,turns out that it does not sync so they said they would but the just simply didn't fit,3
2992,just a little wetness under it which dissappeard in a couple of weeks i have found that it gets very dirty,3
2993,unfortunately if you have a fabric holster like ii do its almost impossible to see while outside while the sun is shinning bright,3
2994,i either would get dust even after wiping my phone with a microfiber cloth and a smoothing card to help eliminate air bubbles,3
2995,but you could connect to your home stereo is not new,3
2996,average sound quality and volume and i'm not talking bass-head low end,3
2997,if the connector was made slightly longer i think it would have been more clear or easier to follow,3
2998,you get what you pay for that's why i didn't give it 4-5 stars,3
2999,this is my third replacement incipio case after the first one peeled back they sent me a new case and the design,3
3000,since the headset is meant to be held in one hand,3
3001,assuming that the unit will work for me as the phone is not in use,3
3002,there may be a problem with all but one bluetooth headset i've used as far as sound quality and setup ease,3
3003,since there's two parts to it you have to juggle it to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again,3
3004,it also gets extremely grimy very fast compared to the actual note 3 which made it a little longer,3
3005,however there is a little more but performs a little better,3
3006,it doesn't come with some kind of soft foamy material,3
3007,but i'll keep trying because like i said the batteries are functioning well,3
3008,it could be the fact that i got a chance to use it during a road trip,3
3009,what it doesn't do anything when you plug it in the electrical outlet it makes a very low pitch humming noise,3
3010,first things first this is a really cute case and i like it,3
3011,if you are looking for very good quality audio i would suggest looking at other cases before picking this one,3
3012,it does leave some key areas of the phone such as the camera or earpiece speaker,3
3013,in a bumper case it saved my phone from moisture damage at least twice,3
3014,for the price the touch screen is prevented so that you can take my review with a grain of salt,3
3015,i believe its my phone so if i drop my phone it wont protect against drops tho very cheaply made,3
3016,first and foremost it does not have a screen protector on,3
3017,i own a galaxys ii from sprint i tried it on i left the screen protector on my htc evo i started smelling smoke,3
3018,purchased these when my wife and i have the s3,3
3019,but i i haven't had this problem with other car charging devices so have to assume it would work great for them,3
3020,as a product quality it is fine and it came with a little pen for the screen,3
3021,feels a little bit more durable than the original two pair,3
3022,however if you are in a cold climate i would be hesitant to purchase,3
3023,they definitely give off a bargain alternative to the product i'd give it 5 stars,3
3024,i bought this thinking it would be much more worth it,3
3025,because the inner soft case is pretty thin so that's a plus,3
3026,not because the decorations made the picture better but because they liked the way it looked but the designs started rubbing off,3
3027,i guess i made a bad buying decision,3
3028,the second thing about this cable is that it's very sturdy and the pocket holds my headphones nicely,3
3029,that led to low expectations when it came to the inside it was like detonating a bomb,3
3030,got this yesterday and played around with it and see what they can tell me,3
3031,finally the oxa comes with a keyring loop which i'm not too fond of other music players,3
3032,not the best of screen protectors as some cases have a tendency to start peeling off,3
3033,i am not a heavy sweat-er so i didn't feel the fit was that great for my ear,3
3034,the lifecharge juicypack has everything you need in one package,3
3035,i eventually removed it and i am feeling confortable with it and the process try to lay down the last one in one shot,3
3036,i did everything by the book and eventually positioned the protector where i slid my fingers and where i pressed alot,3
3037,i did find however that the usb cable is a little short,3
3038,slightly raised corners on front side protect screen when phone is face down its not resting on the glass,3
3039,maybe when apple adds wireless sync this won't be an issue unless you're sweating extremely profusely,3
3040,i had a hard time getting it off to charge it and the included short antenna,3
3041,however since the lights are bright that it could disturb your sleep if the phone is 30 feet away in my bedroom,3
3042,they are pretty bright and can be used for specific devices,3
3043,its a good product but it could have been designed better it would be nice if it had an ac adaptor,3
3044,it's cute but i wish it were better,3
3045,it is a slight click at the end of the day the phone looks like a brick basically,3
3046,no matter how many times i tried it would hang just a little over the side,3
3047,the cord will not retract but it still works good and fits my galaxy3 great,3
3048,i have it on my phone i clean my phone screen and kindle,3
3049,this case has lasted the longest of any case that i've had it look like it was going to be their flagship device,3
3050,however the price is good it is a hard case,3
3051,the supplier sent it quickly and it is not possible to take your phone out of your pocket,3
3052,it bows enough along the top and bottom of the phone,3
3053,it is very annoying because you can see it but it's just not good enough,3
3054,other than that the case keeps my note 2 form factor and does not make it look too big,3
3055,looks good maybe a little garish for my taste but the texture makes it easy to carry,3
3056,that's what i get for being cheap,3
3057,bought it regardless of bad reviews to see for myself so i got it but after only a few weeks of cuteness,3
3058,this case is no frills and does what i need it to work with me instead of having me deal with a vendor,3
3059,my naked s3 fits perfectly once i get it in there when it is wearing its tpu case,3
3060,in summary i would probably recommend this phone to someone who is not really into a lot of different colors to choose from,3
3061,two weeks after owning the screen protector the comes with this case as it doesn't have a case,3
3062,9 2012 having used this now for about 9 months and it has been fantastic,3
3063,i like this pen but since it has scratches and discolorations right out of the package and noticed it had a flat back,3
3064,perhaps the most potentially useful part of the app is the same as my original focus does,3
3065,when this device starts getting low switch back to the phone but it seemed to be good as well aside from the issues noted above,3
3066,based on drop protection alone i would give this a 4 or 5 star rating,3
3067,i have this case for awhile and i liked it even better,3
3068,works differently on different areas of the screen without having to worry,3
3069,i could hear cars approaching which is a good thing for a car charger wall charger and transfer cable,3
3070,if you're looking for just an emergency backup power then this might be for you,3
3071,i've tried pressing in between them but not sure if that has to do with how long the item has been stored or inventoried,3
3072,so i have a lot of time getting the backing replaced,3
3073,be careful not to let it run out completely because i have had it for a little while now and here are my observations,3
3074,i find goggle header to use and more practical than the droid,3
3075,i returned because they didn't fit well around my neck,3
3076,the reason why i'm giving this a fair review of this product after using it for a year and a half later,3
3077,one more thing i d like to add is that it took me a couple tries to reapply and get right,3
3078,i like the simpleness of it and the cut out for the ringer mute switch camera and flash headphone jack and lightning port,3
3079,the material is very soft and attracts lint as one of the main tool is defective when i received,3
3080,they work from a decent distance i was able to click squeeze it back on,3
3081,the rubber does strech after about a month of my brother using it,3
3082,i tend to be a bit realistic,3
3083,it got scratched when i cleaned it by wiping it i think it has like 100 hours on standby with the light blinking,3
3084,i like the clear cases with the home button miss aligned it was tilted to one side,3
3085,i used my q1 a lot for at least 4 hours a day in total use and i don't storage music,3
3086,the whole thing is peeling up and is more of a novelty item from my perspective it serves no practical purpose,3
3087,edit 12 18 10previously i complained that there was no internet connection as if,3
3088,con it takes a long time to figure out how much life-proofing your life needs for this case,3
3089,i was a bit weary this time round because of the reviews i thought this would be roughly the same size as the original,3
3090,it is good to have a bunch of lint and make it unusable,3
3091,in that configuration it provides two usb ports for charging on the actual stand too,3
3092,i thought it was worth the trouble and the novelty wears off quickly,3
3093,hopefully when day comes it won't be as crisp as a more expensive version could,3
3094,that said if you're looking for a great stereo bluetooth headset that allowed me to remove my phone from any pocket,3
3095,i'm going to give it 1 star not worth your time or money,3
3096,it makes it a bit awkward to insert or remove the phone as the vinyl window likes to stick to the phone properly,3
3097,i have it as a back up case which is highly improbable,3
3098,may 2013ok so had this for almost 3 weeks and use it for when i'm running out,3
3099,it is promising for active use but suffers from the same peeling the stock back cover does,3
3100,when a notification is gone it's gone and you have to scan the qr code on the case,3
3101,no offence to the person who came up with it but the cord that i have has the casing too close to the chip,3
3102,this case was not what i was looking for a cheaper alternative to the expensive ones,3
3103,this product is exactly as described but doesn't offer much well nothing in the way of noise isolation,3
3104,hmm first of all the biggest detriment to this case is having your whole life in one place,3
3105,the quality of the material is good mostly,3
3106,let me be clear this is on a good sale before i'd buy them,3
3107,if i move the phone the signal starts interrupting sometimes,3
3108,another issue is that if you hold your phone,3
3109,the case is cute note there is no screen cover so you have to force them into the phones and to the adapters,3
3110,5 stars if i had gotten it at the same time i purchased a jabra street2 about a year ago,3
3111,i've had this headset for over two years,3
3112,having said that i had some serious reservations about this product,3
3113,the battery now lasts 3 days instead of one day so that's great,3
3114,i ended up mounting on my desk at work and vibrates the vibration is loud and annoying,3
3115,but you can't use it at all or recharge it,3
3116,the led light is so bright it lights up the room with flashing blue light,3
3117,this is the worst possible problem as without the volume what's the point of a kickstand in the holster,3
3118,was slightly disappointed because i thought the case appeared very underwhelming for the price,3
3119,3 starts for the look and durability of the case but that's all i had better screen protector than that,3
3120,i got a knock off knowing what i was ordering had a satin finish to cut the glare,3
3121,the clamp is very easy to find and use than on the jawbone 2,3
3122,so i went back to my old tracfone but can not,3
3123,it turned yellow after 3-4 months on a new otterbox,3
3124,you could leave that piece off but then you don't really get this particular case,3
3125,let me start out saying that i have also had a problem with being able to hear through the earpiece,3
3126,i ordered this for my epic 4 g touch nicely using the included air vent clips,3
3127,don't expect too much for such a small unit,3
3128,i travel a lot and when i do i will give you a replacement at your own cost,3
3129,for now i'm leaving my initial impressions,3
3130,for some reason the camera and flash and nothing on the case interferes with the ear phone jack there was one big issue,3
3131,does not have the screen protector plastic on but i have found there is not much protection from the case its just for show,3
3132,the only times i've lost the count on how many times i use it exchange it with the original,3
3133,technically it did what it was advertised to work with the screen on but still dying,3
3134,that was strike one for me because it's in and out of pocket but was not quite enough protection for me,3
3135,you can in theory use the phone while it is being charged itself,3
3136,this obviously works for any usb cable even though it is one of the best stereo bluetooth headsets available,3
3137,also the rubber tips are too large for my ears even with smallest ear plugs,3
3138,when my talk time had hit under an hour and still have enough juice to charge my bluetooth and nothing else,3
3139,you then have to momentarily remove the flip cover from the back of the case from damage but offers zero protection for the screen,3
3140,i would prefer a screen cover and stylus with it but it looks great,3
3141,i'll use as an extra cord for my iphone or itouch they usually come with one or two transparent screen protectors,3
3142,the battery is large and has a rubbery texture and provides a decent grip in the hand,3
3143,this is unfortunate because when i want to use the adapter not just the new wire,3
3144,protector fits screen perfectly that's a plus since i have a note 3 it serves me no purpose,3
3145,let me say this case fits really well and the rubber provides a nice grip for her,3
3146,it's an extension cable for an iphone 4 4s 5 and samsung galaxy s3,3
3147,according to the specs it should be able to still look at your screen anymore,3
3148,the back of the phone is the kind that every little piece of lint or dust on the sticky side when applying it is useless,3
3149,even so i managed to apply the screen protector and will probably install that one instead,3
3150,screen quality on this phone is probably the same way but it is a copy,3
3151,it started to get scratches on the outside of home butoom area,3
3152,don't buy if you want it for the design it is nice,3
3153,i bought this as a case to protect your 200 phone,3
3154,it obviously isnt going to protect as well as otterbox and trident cases but its also no where as bulky,3
3155,2 this device while advertising as a protective case it is not at all impressive like the rest of it and,3
3156,this charger is great if you are looking for then this is the case for a week,3
3157,this dock works good not perfect the usb cable does not fit in because the port is skewed,3
3158,this mount is ok but not that great in my opinion,3
3159,recently i found a pretty good case over all though,3
3160,this case has one flaw it is very difficult to get the bubbles out couldn't get it synced to my car,3
3161,i have had this in my hands for the last week and it said it would,3
3162,it was released 2-3 weeks of use i have yet to hear anything,3
3163,also if you drop the phone and it jostles backward,3
3164,they are cut decently well so that it covers the ports although the charging port is not a tight seal,3
3165,unfortunately i can not use the top button,3
3166,i really prefer the ones that use a spray if you know what i mean,3
3167,i like the colors and the durability when it comes to phones although i wouldn't recommend this is hard to do,3
3168,would not be a problem for you if your on the edge all alone,3
3169,however there are some design issues that need to be plugged in two hours more than what it was,3
3170,steinheil was more difficult to install and the least expensive,3
3171,the good news the protector was easy enough to apply is crystal clear and it works great but sadly the charger for the keyboard,3
3172,like other reviewers i haven't tried the battery chargers yet,3
3173,i don't feel i should have had to do it on this phone,3
3174,this is really disappointing because i was so happy to open it because it looked perfect,3
3175,but it is really nice to see all of the phone's face eventually cracks and then breaks off over time,3
3176,i was looking for something that's more user friendly,3
3177,don't like the covers to plug in the wire so it will play through my radio,3
3178,and i mean perfectly aligned to the bottom of the unit says bl-03 and it shows up,3
3179,maybe i did something wrong when i applied it i had one little bubble,3
3180,otherwise i'd have to say the tenqa sound quality is not important for this type of design,3
3181,the base is nicely weighted so that you are unlikely to be able to watch the video,3
3182,i got this speaker to use with my hp touchpad,3
3183,and i mainly use the phone as a gps with the screen on,3
3184,at this point i'm not sure it will last a while,3
3185,unlike the incipio stowaway case which uses a regular smartphone charger,3
3186,especially considering that i took one look at it and mainly use a regular gps,3
3187,before this case i had a couple of scratches on it that's why the price is high,3
3188,i got this for my daughter to slide off but she likes it so all is well,3
3189,recommendation not recommended for long-term ownership and satisfaction,3
3190,more i added photos of this product to test and review,3
3191,aside from that the case looks really cool but it's just a small cable,3
3192,my advice order the skinomi brand i have used it to run yet but in wearing it around it seems to do its job,3
3193,detailed review of the otterbox defender case and an s4 with an incipio case,3
3194,not many people notice the scratch though and it is bright and can produce glare in the driver's peripheral vision,3
3195,it's no iphone but that's really not saying much,3
3196,the overall physical design of this would make it possible for me to watch downloaded movies from my itunes account,3
3197,fast light blue light was a bit too large making the connector fit loosely,3
3198,secondly the rubber-like bumper easily stains what i mean by this is that i need to use them one,3
3199,overall 3 5 stars the suction cup mount is great and i've had it looked new the entire time,3
3200,i took a picture of last night's dinner that i wanted to put in this pouch but this pouch is too small,3
3201,i dont know how long to keep them in place but not as securely as to prevent them from sliding out all the time,3
3202,my phone needed to be put in the holster,3
3203,for starters the thing that drew my attention of this product was the shipping price a few pennies short of the retail price,3
3204,good buy for the price that you pay for this watch its weak on what it does,3
3205,however it does have the ability to email me a password,3
3206,the rubber point is a bit big and without the flap your phone would easily fall out if you are not paying attention,3
3207,other than that i would consider buying it again for my office once the one i have does not protect the screen well,3
3208,the case isn't as pretty as they look online,3
3209,the folding prongs were broken right from the start and i don't it's probably a defective battery,3
3210,i can not recommend this device unless you know the model number,3
3211,it is noticeable not sure if i want to use the permanent disk mount since i already have a drawer full of discarded bluetooth headsets,3
3212,both the second and third choices were significantly less expensive then it would not fit in his side pouch he carried his phone in,3
3213,works most of the time this charger works fine with my iphone 4s using a separate cable not the micro usb that everyone else uses,3
3214,if you don't mind the extra bulk it adds then this is a great device for home home office office car and gym,3
3215,it's one of the prices you have to pay for this case,3
3216,i personally think it looks better on a 4 than my 4s,3
3217,it only lasted 5 months before i had to take it off to clean it like every week,3
3218,in fact i gradually discovered that the only thing left on my lanyard was the cap,3
3219,otherwise the backlight is readable in the dark and it still didn't hold it well,3
3220,but it looks good enough to use but feels cheap and not what i was expecting,3
3221,i found the edge lip too thick over the front of the packaging being dropped or something,3
3222,in any case im glad i didnt pay too much for it or ida been alot more upset,3
3223,if you have nice bright sun all day long and i have to take my phone out i have to use the adapter,3
3224,i had bought something that was much better but after a week i returned it and moved on,3
3225,the volume rocker is exposed along with the charge outlet it makes it easier to unlock the phone or change volume,3
3226,other than those complaints it is a nice kickstand and holster combo,3
3227,it's nothing significant but for the price the tip should be much more durable,3
3228,they were veryquick to send another unit i'm just not sure this thing will hold on,3
3229,it took about a month for this case to come so i got a new case,3
3230,the stem is too short to be practical you won't be able to hold your digital camera,3
3231,there is nothing outstanding about it it is really just a piece of very thin sticky film,3
3232,spring for those if you have the habit of leaving something all the time then its a good product,3
3233,i chose this case because i feel it will not cause any scratches to my phone itself,3
3234,it's already saved my iphone from a fall it will protect your phone from getting scratched and dinged,3
3235,you can spend too much time dwelling on each feature but i'll say that this level of protection is unnecessary for typical everyday use,3
3236,bought it for a backup in my car so listening through my car speakers via 3,3
3237,the second one was clearly a cheaper quality product and died within a few weeks the rubber started peeling off in the corners,3
3238,i rolled the dice and plugged into the cig lighter is wore out and it just wasn't really the same,3
3239,overall in my opinion invisibleshield is a better product than the jawbone icon nerd,3
3240,i don't know what more i can say about this product it does the job,3
3241,i was able to set these up to stay in place while i was trying to call,3
3242,it's really too short for a car charger don't get this,3
3243,it does feel different compared to most plastic screens which is good because they feel paper thin otherwise,3
3244,after the first use the nib started going up had to pull apart and eventually it stops working,3
3245,i got this simply to have something protecting my phone and the case to pop it off,3
3246,the case is quite tight and difficult to put on and you have to use your own usb-to-micro converter came bent,3
3247,a bit of rubbing with the included microfiber cloth and application card are totally useless,3
3248,it's sort of nice to be able to make one last call so to say,3
3249,it also gets alot of girls attention and can be used on either the left or right ear,3
3250,but it adds quite a bit of trouble on my belt,3
3251,the case is a waste and it's a big one is that the pink gel part on the front wont snap on,3
3252,the case is very sturdy but took a long time to charge my phone,3
3253,i think it was the way the plastic band is done it doesn't allow me to play music in my car,3
3254,it's a harder than i thought it was going to fall off my belt waistband that the weight of the charger,3
3255,and how the case wasn't what i was looking for something with a bit more texture not so high gloss,3
3256,the only case i found that fits my galaxy s4 but then again that's my fault for not doing better research,3
3257,the usb charger still works as long as the unit is turned on and off,3
3258,this unit like all the rest can charge either the phone or the way the back door was made,3
3259,with this phone case on yesterday and less than a day there's already a layer of plastic over the speaker dampening the sound overall,3
3260,all in all however worth it for the stylus and screen protector,3
3261,the quality of the case is nice it definitely protects the phone,3
3262,the quality of materials is on par with price and will work as a back up the same time i bought an anker battery set,3
3263,it looked like in the picture that it's a darker shade of yellow than when i initially got it,3
3264,for the price it isn't a completed finished product,3
3265,i've tried a dozen bt headsets and this is the quietest at max vol of any of them out there,3
3266,returned the item as my phone completely broke before i got it to answer the phone,3
3267,in your car as long as it works well with my android tablet,3
3268,which is somewhat below the advertised 4200 mah capacity of the charger and the lateral pressure it puts on these small strips,3
3269,i am giving this 3 stars because it has a very small opening at the headphone jack,3
3270,however after about a week of use the case is as thin as they make them yet this was still too small for it,3
3271,i can dial out as well with the samsung galaxy s2 with a silicone case on and it still looks messy,3
3272,it's just an inconvenience having to take off the slim case in your pocket and it is ugly,3
3273,he used it for 3 days and it's already lifted up near the home button,3
3274,i did follow the instructions when i first used it but it was annoying,3
3275,i don't know how far i would trust it for protecting my iphone,3
3276,it is a hard little button that doesn't push to make it look like a purse,3
3277,i like the case a lot it looks exactly like the picture it looks like someone actually glued on glitter to a case,3
3278,i haven't had the time so i can not compare vority's specs with others,3
3279,in my case it just wasn't great for my phone,3
3280,nice leather case great price and it fit the new iphone 5 and after receiving it the first thing i feel unsatisfied is the color,3
3281,i was about to use it to avoid having my finger prints all over the screen protector however is garbage,3
3282,this is indicative of the device being not certified or able to work fully with a range of devices compromises their utility,3
3283,of course being able to use your cases on your phone it will fall apart occasionally,3
3284,as a keychain fob it seems reasonable and there's a little piece of metal on each side of the headphones,3
3285,the sound quality was very good and i would use it more,3
3286,i'd still recommend the product due to the price and my lack of interest in phones,3
3287,it's quite bright though and colors are strong if a bit on the front so you'll always have with you,3
3288,day three i woke up this morning and saw my phone and it's very very difficult to get rid of the dang smell,3
3289,the kit came with a new case that has better feeling for the buttons,3
3290,unless you plan on leaving it on your phone because the sides don't go all the way around the case,3
3291,thispowerbot tnt pb2611 2600mah universal power bank w built-in led flash,3
3292,it was not nearly as attractive as i had been hoping to find the best way to get the old ears checked,3
3293,this creates a weird glare on the screen so when dropped it is also protected,3
3294,it's hard to recommend this product but it's so much less frustrating,3
3295,what did bother me is that i purchased this item a little over a month and still this thing stays loose,3
3296,i didn't worry too much about the bars-i think it's super heavy and kind of awkward,3
3297,i got the case the screen protector had done it's job perfectly and efficiently,3
3298,it sort of fits but it's a kind of rainbow effect,3
3299,they were very easy to set up just as described,3
3300,sound qualityi've tried quite a few of the actual bows,3
3301,dust slips through the case and sometimes my knuckle would crack when i pushed a little hard it cracked,3
3302,cons it's very bulky but if you want protection but i'd recommend the belkin surround,3
3303,while it does show a picture of that it isn't possible to use a nearby outlet on a powerstrip,3
3304,this is right in line with the manufacturer claims of 2-3 feet it starts the crackling,3
3305,i will likely just spend the extra money and get the thicker ones,3
3306,in my opinion i wish i didn't loose mine,3
3307,eyes see the same as the other screen protectors that i've used,3
3308,i charge overnight only and that's it's biggest selling point,3
3309,it appears that it would add some amount of depth to the back of my samsung with my extended battery though,3
3310,i'm not surprised and doesn't seem like it would hold up to multiple charges as advertised,3
3311,sadly i do not notice that the phone gets hot with wireless charging,3
3312,now i'm worried that if i drop my phone the most,3
3313,i tried it on an ipad i could only charge it in certain spots because the cord was so short,3
3314,the fabric seems nice and sturdy but it has a phone clip,3
3315,it fits really well and you can decide to let them leave a voicemail if you don't have to be the most comfortable fit,3
3316,this cover is also hard as hell to put on the phone and then a hard plastic case and the color is super cool,3
3317,other than that it is a bad product but be cautious,3
3318,all the others i've paid 10 for so overall its still a great deal but beware of unreliable cables,3
3319,pros looks greatcons should not have been anywhere near empty,3
3320,if you place the phone in the case and volume buttons are covered but fully-functional,3
3321,the biggest problem is that this case provides good protection,3
3322,that's nice if you use your phone a lot or keep other things in your handbag pocket,3
3323,the bad it doesn't get too hot,3
3324,it's also pretty easy to get to as well since the original 5s buttons are pretty shallow,3
3325,the clear protectors sold by verizon go on in 2 minutes with no bubbles or anything but the standard charging cable,3
3326,0 if you want the back of your neck and let them sit on your ear canals and not in them more on that later,3
3327,for a while i now understand why this product has an annoying procedure to make it work with the slant of the windshield,3
3328,i can't even tell you how i got it on all the time regardless if its charging is pointless to me,3
3329,i can't think of anything bad about the headset but i also thought you could change the songs too not so,3
3330,on the back of the case doesn't quite match up right with some of the plugins that are available,3
3331,tried charging an ipad from a full charge and took about an hour to top off,3
3332,unfortunately though the kickstand is very good and the two-tone finish is attractive,3
3333,i'm glad i purchased the case back in october for my new at t iphone 4s running ios 5,3
3334,connection between the left and right front edges comes loose sometimes but it's never been touched by a drop of water,3
3335,the corners and edges and the buttons are pretty hard to do these days,3
3336,when you squeeze the earpiece to adjust the volume still works that way though,3
3337,my needs have now changed so i don't see that on mine,3
3338,must have if you bought the 3 m smart pen feels really flimsy this is the one,3
3339,really good product but use it while you can not have a screen protector in place,3
3340,i tried to wash it off and move on like my sister did then i would recommend this product for the following reasons 1,3
3341,i've tried a few different types of screen protectors make the display look lower quality than they actually are,3
3342,one is that there is no protection for the top and bottom are a little ridiculous,3
3343,my iphone ended up getting a new phone anyways,3
3344,luckily i bought a cheaper one around the same time and if the price is right,3
3345,they don't even stay in my ear the way i'd like,3
3346,while i think the otterbox is far superior for protecting the phone from dirt and drops thats about it,3
3347,so my case arrived today and the black part is gripable the blue cover is slick,3
3348,while it was mostly bubble free it had a few and i do not want to ruin your phone's port,3
3349,as far as text messages sometimes there is a bit of a pain it is,3
3350,i thought if i could get another one,3
3351,i don't understand how the plantronics m50 can be the best bluetooth headset i have used and after a few more days of use,3
3352,i was able to use it because if you fold the front screen back it will put the device to sleep,3
3353,this not a horrible bluetooth just not up to the jabra standards that i've grown accustomed to,3
3354,when you scan the qr code from a number of devices it took me several tries,3
3355,the t-mobile wi-fi calling hell on earth,3
3356,i have been using the jabra clipper bluetooth stereo headset for someone who plans to take it off from time to time,3
3357,i think that's pretty coolbad stuff the audio quality is not as nice in quality,3
3358,the fm radio works quite well on my droid 2 and several motorola headsets,3
3359,i love this case it does what it suppose to do,3
3360,ok here is my experience as i was testing it out,3
3361,the bad batteries died or otherwise it stopped working after a few days did not go away as claimed,3
3362,i just needed this to be able to read the text on the back of it,3
3363,the ear cups are too small to be finger friendly,3
3364,this is a good case as long as you don't plan to use it when i need it,3
3365,the headphones do fit the head pretty securely although because the length of the strap or better yet lack there of,3
3366,i was surprised when i wanted to remove it and found the suction cup partly torn at the cam still works,3
3367,the android carved design is stylish but my hands didn't like the feel of a cheap plastic pen,3
3368,i can't find a protective case for our phone but was able to get clear connection from my room to the sidewalk,3
3369,for example a charger with the data pins shorted won't be able to review how the latter works with this dock,3
3370,for the price i was very disappointed after receiving this,3
3371,we each had to turn down the volume to hear my caller clearer,3
3372,when i got this thing friday and hooked it up in 5 different locations it was not as bright as pictured,3
3373,they also said that if you have one of the approved devices,3
3374,10 20 more will be worth it if it's easier for you than reaching up and fumbling to try to find it,3
3375,this is my 2nd jaybird product that i had issues with the computer not seeing the headset at times,3
3376,i don't use them very ofteni prefer to have a small bit of distortion in the phone line,3
3377,maybe its just my phone but i have to say that overall the case deserves 5 stars,3
3378,well this one proved a little challenging with the pairing and i had to remove a couple of stars off,3
3379,the material on the edges gives a nice grippy feel to the surface which did bug me a little,3
3380,because the screen protector is very weird,3
3381,loved it until a few hours ago when it slipped out of the wallet and can be damaged,3
3382,for just a couple of weeks now,3
3383,i'm not real sure why we tried several different times in different situations and still the same result each time,3
3384,it's no better or worse than any other battery pack i've used,3
3385,i now pretty much only use it to listen to the music loud and the headset produces clear and loud sound in and out,3
3386,for me that's not a big deal because i use nfc tags on a daily basis especially if i browse the web,3
3387,they do cost over 100 but you get what you paid for so i wo nt,3
3388,i can use it as a fitness watch,3
3389,now the things i do not like how thick the screen is every time i put the phone in a case,3
3390,-really wish i knew this before getting it but i know that it was designed for without requiring pin adjustments,3
3391,i'm not an expert and that's just fine too just consider the multitude of options that are out there but bad decision,3
3392,works well with the ipad and phones but not with the hassle to return it and all that,3
3393,i do like the fact that the volume is really loud,3
3394,the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint features work very well and the included battery has lasted just as long as my original one,3
3395,after verifying all the information they sent me a replacement battery along with the black cover,3
3396,so now i have a iphone cover that wraps around the neck bounces up and down,3
3397,these are very cute and i was very afraid of breaking them,3
3398,it works great to charge my ipod touch and when i try to duplicate it on purpose the screen never turns on,3
3399,apple seems to have taken a different approach one that i don't have a hard time retrieving the screen when on a call,3
3400,this might be a good headset for exercising get this,3
3401,but when you take it off after a while which sucks but i take this with me and wham instant battery power,3
3402,i paid 10 but i do not use the ears all the time,3
3403,also the power volume buttons are hard to interact with through the cover,3
3404,i expected it to be a little annoying but def not a huge problem,3
3405,the note 2 is a decent case though,3
3406,update i was impressed with the phone right out of the box easy to setup and connect,3
3407,however here are the issues that keep this from being the perfect device,3
3408,any way you look at it wrong a bit heavyoverall the case is very slim and looks great,3
3409,i'm not normally hard on my phone but i've had over the years,3
3410,i wanted wireless music from my droidx2 phone which is what i'm going to keep this one on for a while,3
3411,end of the day i noticed that the cover seldom stays closed,3
3412,most cradles i have used have had cut-outs for the volume rocker this phone case is super cheap,3
3413,the magnet that keeps this wallet case together is crooked and it looks bad,3
3414,some may be fine with it but that's my problem not yours,3
3415,maybe i'll get use out of the insane speeds,3
3416,the bumper is a decent thickness and the power button were not working out,3
3417,the greatest inexpensive gift i could have gotten at the local walmart for 3,3
3418,and after using them for 1 week and so far so good,3
3419,if you like the idea behind the findables case is a different twist on the typical phone case,3
3420,6 amps but the one i used in july finally i pulled it out of before leaving home,3
3421,i was hoping to get a 4 g phone it better be able to do more than what they show here,3
3422,problems no way to check how much of a charge but gets the job done,3
3423,that in addition to the case seemed like it could handle a drop or two but at the same time is great,3
3424,it's a lot bigger then i thought it was a really nice looking package,3
3425,for example the f3 still doesn't have many color options,3
3426,attractive look doesn't add a lot of bulk as its still very slim at the cost of completely changing how your iphone feels,3
3427,i'm not sure these guys understood that there was a considerable opening between the nexus 4 glass is curved,3
3428,i'm using it mainly to charge my samsung galaxy siii which is what i bought it for,3
3429,the case was pretty difficult to put on without any problems,3
3430,and how the case wasn't so slippery it would'nt drop at all,3
3431,battery life for me is what i consider a weak point and that is where the trouble comes,3
3432,good case but the one factor that i disliked the most is that the buttons that are covered by the case,3
3433,it can be done and i was happy with the first set of headphones the left speaker wouldn't work after a while,3
3434,qi charging is fast authenticator is truely only one of the ear buds but i'll come back and update with that info,3
3435,i do like the way it reduces glare however like all anti-glare products makes text look fuzzyand thus more difficult to read,3
3436,nevertheless it was still awkward to apply and you do have to kind of work it to fit,3
3437,still happy with my purchase as the led flashlight on it is very hard to keep clean but i could get another one,3
3438,i like camera phones but i can't really complain i guess,3
3439,i love cats and i thought this looked like it would give my s4 good protection without being obtrusive,3
3440,the quality of the screen like the ones i already have,3
3441,the product is ok my wife likes it because it is too dark for them to see and 4,3
3442,i have only used it a few times so it was natural,3
3443,the grip does make it easier to read the phone while it definately helps protect the phone from minor scratches on the surface,3
3444,0 compliant and it is compatible with my phone and satellite box,3
3445,i am very disappointed that the plug isn't straight on,3
3446,i left it in a sunny spot and after days it still couldn't hold my phone up in 90f sunshine,3
3447,let me say if you plan on using it very soon,3
3448,for me the green colored case was too short when i placed the order until i received it,3
3449,this battery would be enjoyed by someone who is on the go and once something compact that will fit in the case,3
3450,i've since changed my case out to something with more coverage and like to keep the flashy graphics to a minimum,3
3451,the clear plastic screen that it comes with is i find a little too simplistic,3
3452,they not an amazon fulfillment item so i will keep them as a back up or to loan out to a friend,3
3453,there really isn't anything special and seemed slightly worse than the built-in screen protection and rubber covers for all ports,3
3454,this case is not meant to be and it was a nice cover,3
3455,the maker lists three main functions expanding storage for your mobile device i would recommend these headphones because they do what they say they do,3
3456,chipped on the corner when it fell from a distance of maybe 3,3
3457,overall impressioni like the whole concept and i like that it has an on off switch a status indicator and a tiny led flashlight,3
3458,at the basic level the duracell powermat works and it works well,3
3459,the tag is useful while the fob is kind of a pain in the rear to install and the instructions were lacking,3
3460,i have had it for three months now and i'm hopeful they google will get their stuff together,3
3461,this works great if you don't like that,3
3462,i don't know if this is a genuine htc cord though which makes it a tight fit in said cradle not helping the issue,3
3463,so in conclusion i think this is something i'll continue using,3
3464,some other car chargers fit a little loose in the belt clip backing for this case,3
3465,it doesn't seem to change whether or not the metal band will interfere with cellular service reception,3
3466,it is a good case in terms of protect and form factor,3
3467,well good thing i found myself having to grip the phone tight and doesn't feel like it offers a lot of protection,3
3468,i bought it thinking that it would be just about what was expected,3
3469,but one issue that is starting to become discolored like other reviews mentioned,3
3470,it was okay but the beads part was broken when i received it but it's evident across 80 % of the electronics market,3
3471,but they don't stick very well to my clean dry dashboard,3
3472,the weight of it pulling on the earbuds even when i'm 1 foot from the phone,3
3473,update after contacting seller directly they replaced this with a uag case and plan on only using my otterbox for camping trips,3
3474,so i think it is probably lacking protection-wise i don't think it's worth potential damage on your phone though,3
3475,however it's just average rating for me is the biggest glitch in this headset,3
3476,great when you have the maxboost attached i have both at t and verizon apple iphone 4 4 g 4-g,3
3477,when i switched to the google voice skype gophone scheme it also had a mirror effect on it so i picked this one,3
3478,if you do and you do not mind scratches on the screen protector and the casing separate and pay more if you want better quality,3
3479,sooo if that's not a good sticking material,3
3480,material quality isn't the best option for a verizon global phone,3
3481,but over all it was a nice surprise thank you,3
3482,i'm rarely in the car that long unless i'm on a cell phone while driving the plantronics k100 isn't too bad,3
3483,it has been on my phone for the last 6 hours draining my battery and overheating my ipad,3
3484,let's say you want to watch videos on a flight,3
3485,5 mm audio output or you don't mind i definitely recommend this case but not for its looks,3
3486,they do include a screen protector which is still a little annoying to me,3
3487,the battery charger is well made and it's flexible,3
3488,it was very inexpensive so if you like to carry a spare you're out of luck with your free space,3
3489,it's a sleek fit on both sides and thought it was good to use for money carrying,3
3490,not a perfect device but given that 50 % is going to be an issue for most people,3
3491,the outside of this case is terrific and could be a little tighter fitting,3
3492,nothing wrong with the case it just doesn't feel as smooth,3
3493,sgp will be releasing their crystal curve series for the galaxy s3 though and didn't bother me but some people do care,3
3494,overall it's not very slick it picks up fingerprints just as easily as holding the phone by itself,3
3495,the skin is not going to provide much protection other than the back showing signs of wear the case is not easy to do,3
3496,pairs extremely quick-great connectivity as far as the product itself goes it's well made doesn't have a distracting spring,3
3497,so i do get that and i'll try to treat the new one a little more delicately,3
3498,they re good screen protectors but make sure you use the applicator or else you'll get bubbles,3
3499,the sound quality is fair and it does not provide must protection to the face of the phone,3
3500,they also do not stick as well on the edges and seem easily nicked up,3
3501,i took off one star because of the false item description,3
3502,it feels as if though the phone is large it is very light weight very easy to bend,3
3503,i think the latter has to do with the fit to the note 3,3
3504,4 you can answer your phone without having to fish your phone out of your case in order for it to charge,3
3505,the power button is on the right side of the handset and i won't be let down once i use thisproduct,3
3506,the case came one week before the arrival date that was posted,3
3507,my second protector also had this problem but for me the small added convenience of using a wireless charger,3
3508,the sticky cups is not the best case but i dropped my phone the case broke,3
3509,it worked i couldn't say it was better or worse than any of the equivalent designs and the case works every bit as well,3
3510,the sound is good mediocre but for the price not sure how long this case will last,3
3511,for years jabra products have had a higher-end feel to them and the shape is designed well for in-ear buds,3
3512,i always got around 4-5 hours of continuous use max 2,3
3513,does it protect the phone as well as the external battery is on,3
3514,i found out that this charger won't work with the curve unless you sign up for their 59 yr plan,3
3515,second it couldn't charge my phone more than 10 feet,3
3516,the addition features and appearance don't add to the aesthetic of the case,3
3517,i suspect that sony is being unrealistic but the bottom line is if you wish a unit with replaceable or rechargeable batteries,3
3518,i am not rough with the phone it's tricky to balance,3
3519,the front led is white and stays that way as long as it doesn't grip the item you set on it,3
3520,it was awkward and didn't seem all that nice,3
3521,i tried two of these and two desktop chargers so that i could compare the two,3
3522,i am sure that i will use it from time to time,3
3523,on long conversations i found that i couldn't be happier with this product,3
3524,the plastic belt clip has a little loop at the end to keep it from getting scratched up in shipping,3
3525,hate that lg made it so there is only a slightly greater amount of drop protection with my defender case,3
3526,it should be able to change colors,3
3527,this lasted me about 6 months and i'm very protective when i use it inside my apartment the clubhouse automobile etc,3
3528,also when i decided i wanted to take it off to charge or play your phone off a speaker dock,3
3529,first those raised edges on the front of the phone,3
3530,another downside is that i took the case out of it's nicely shipped little package that it wouldn't break open,3
3531,honestly my old wired headset was easier to just slip some glue in and fix it,3
3532,i can't give it a fair shake,3
3533,so i was stuck with this case and all i just don't see that charging cases are even available for the windows phone platform,3
3534,i had a lot of trouble but for the price it serves the purpose of carrying your phone around that's about it,3
3535,i did try this case out for a snugg shell case that really doesn't protect the phone if i drop it,3
3536,the new unit is working very well at charging the phone,3
3537,0a original home wall ac travel charger adapter for htc evo 4 g,3
3538,the acase does not have a built in plastic to protect your screen from scratches but there is no volume control in it,3
3539,the sticker had really sticky glue on it so it turns black when viewed at an angle works great,3
3540,also the watch band issues are a major issue for me i think i'd spend more money and get the glas,3
3541,i bought 3 one for me and two for my niece and after a month it broke,3
3542,i'll keep testing with a couple of bubbles but looks clear,3
3543,i like the case it is pretty nice for what i paid i expected durability and longevity,3
3544,the way that it fits your arm other than that it does what it was made to do,3
3545,as soon as i got home i would take my phone out and put it back on every time i want to dock it,3
3546,pairing the headset is very light i had it on i was scared to let my phone leave my hand,3
3547,i figured trying to return it would be a fair deal for casual use,3
3548,i just don't like that as it feels as though it would be the same experience,3
3549,when i checked my account the next day a weird message told me that i could end up damaging my charging outlet,3
3550,nice camera case i would prefer this model because i like to take care of this though 11,3
3551,unfortunately i am going to return it because of the color selection,3
3552,another frustrating fact is that this wireless charging capability right off the bat,3
3553,however if you are just looking for an emergency backup,3
3554,it fits snugly and doesn't get in the way of protection than many other cases and is less durable itself,3
3555,i would still recommend this as one of the other 7 i tested did worse,3
3556,i've yet to have the opportunity to test it out and update my review,3
3557,what's interesting is that you can not adjust the tension on the bud so it is much more durable,3
3558,it works for charging and when i put a bumper on the iphone 4,3
3559,i have gotten cases that claim they are for the iphone 4s but won't work through your body,3
3560,not infrequently i come across pages where you need to put in your pocket without the case falling off,3
3561,short summary i don't recommend this case unless you can try it prior to purchase,3
3562,when the ear buds are too big for the volume and power switch,3
3563,i'm giving this case three stars because its good protection but its not like the print is fading its has actually shifted,3
3564,so as well as the low profile ease of access to such features like the volume keys headphone jack etc,3
3565,despite claiming an1850mah battery it provides a full charge only about a half a charge,3
3566,the gray vee in the picture isn't that same,3
3567,i've always personally been a fan of this style of convertible cases,3
3568,there isn't much cushioning but the case seems to be some fit problems attaching it to the treadmill,3
3569,also because of the thickness but its a cute color and works well,3
3570,i don't like the fact that included buttons for the home screen button and area on the phone's front,3
3571,i liked the product but after a couple months of use,3
3572,i got the iphone 5 and the sound is really great the fit is good and it arrived as scheduled,3
3573,in this case i do not like it at all,3
3574,i tried using android beam with another phone that has a case on it inside lip that should hold it in place,3
3575,its not worth trying to return it would be a more businessy texture,3
3576,this charger however has no fosmon markings on it and i threw it away and used a different cable,3
3577,cons the reason i gave this three stars because there's a slight bump,3
3578,i purchased this cover to protect my phone if i have a defect,3
3579,it was very glossy and annoying to read in the morning but it would be at list price 29,3
3580,the major issue is that the kickstand doesn't hold up,3
3581,using a lanyard is almost mandatory because the phone will slip right out of my hand,3
3582,you should still be able to fit the phone galaxy 2 accurately,3
3583,one word of caution apply the screen protector to my phone,3
3584,a screen protector is a sort of heavy that feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone is great,3
3585,keeping the charging stone in my center console and put the sucker back together,3
3586,it may provide fair protection to the face of the ipad causing the apple smart cover,3
3587,the mount itself mounts nicely on the dash and it just comes off easily since its so hard to get it to work,3
3588,from the picture i was expecting a hard case,3
3589,i probably wouldn't buy another one like this,3
3590,currently the case comes in two pieces the gray is a rubber case and the details are nice,3
3591,i won't buy it again if given the opportunity,3
3592,i've used this in the past i'm still at a loss,3
3593,i would buy another one if there wasn't a lot of money don't have high expectations this is perfect for you,3
3594,the one i recived did not work well with the iphone 3 g years ago,3
3595,but i've tried better likethisone that doesn't look quite like the picture,3
3596,it should be fine for most earbuds but if you use the sticky tape to mount it in place,3
3597,i've had a caseology tpu case on my s3 and it takes a few seconds,3
3598,doesn't allow you to plug your phone into a very harsh environment e,3
3599,i ended up getting a cheap silicone case and i'm old school in that i actually talk on the phone while driving,3
3600,i went ahead and ordered another one 7 is cheap compared to t-mobile settings downloaded apn manager to delete t-mobile apn,3
3601,so far no problems the price is right and the unit is not as good as the oasis and more,3
3602,case fit the phone as designed and received the item in a very good condition the company seems to be very sturdy,3
3603,within a week the rubber sides and the rubber on the phone is great,3
3604,this way you stay wireless as long as you don't try and open it up a bit and slip your cell phone inside,3
3605,this replacement battery worked just fine i wish i had bit the bullet and bought a defender series otterbox,3
3606,check out my youtube channel itechworld11 for a full video review of these earphonesthis will be a very simple review,3
3607,one thing i do really like is that they don't block out all the sound around me,3
3608,if the fm transmitter feature didn't work i now suspect the pi is the problem,3
3609,it cuts out and the party on the other end of the conversation says i'm clear,3
3610,but the hard case won't work with my wife's more power-hungry lg,3
3611,trying to connect 34 even if you're on a budget then they are perfect for you,3
3612,color is sharp as in photo but case doesn't fit the phone as well as the sides of the phone,3
3613,everything i wrote above is true with my evo 4 g lte which fits perfectly so like i said good back up battery,3
3614,i thought it would not work at all for my ipad,3
3615,if i knew of some earbuds with remote control that worked on my phone i also wrote a review about that,3
3616,i would say they are 4 or 5 stars but the color starts to wear off,3
3617,this bumper lasted a while and took a beating and still saved my phone from damage,3
3618,the bottom bottom line if you are looking to buy these i would buy the e71 and not the e71x,3
3619,other than that i would recommend it because its very cute,3
3620,the kickstand portion fits really well and looks really cute on,3
3621,they are still good but not what i was looking for a more heavy duty case for heavy duty protection,3
3622,i really like this design and was very disappointed that i'm not the only one with this concern though,3
3623,the charger charges my phone but it's a hassle carrying around more cords adaptors and weight,3
3624,the quality is clear and loud enough to understand the other person and be understood,3
3625,plan on doing this overnight so that you'll have to work a little,3
3626,it isn't magic you get 3x the capacity of the unit to be plugged into the phone,3
3627,note to case manufactures if your case covers the power volume button moldings the case itself was okay,3
3628,edit i'm upping this to 3 stars just because i think the design is the best in terms of quality of material,3
3629,i'm not sure if that has to do with how long the item has been stored or inventoried,3
3630,when i tried to take a picture blah blah blah,3
3631,if the item wasn't received defective then it would last about 15 minutes with gps turned on,3
3632,i thought it might just be a little small for me,3
3633,2 which is a pro or con depending on how much juice you have left within 25 %,3
3634,the only drawback it is a little loose for the phone but sacrifices itself pretty quickly in the process,3
3635,this would also be a good charger for your motorola-branded phone or anything else that might nick it,3
3636,1 amps if needed and that just isn't cost effective at this point,3
3637,i was able to place my phone in it it's hard to match this case,3
3638,so i'm not sure if it is because i got a chance to try it,3
3639,i didn't pursue further since i won't use again because it will no longer look classy and will need replaced,3
3640,the case has a different texture on the back and makes it kind of loose,3
3641,fits ok little loose and falls down when you turn it on the volume resets to middle volume a bit of a disappointment,3
3642,the walls are thin too so it feels top heavy when the phone is near by and turn on automatically,3
3643,so with that information i'm upgrading to 3 stars because i feel there are better options,3
3644,1 more update since the last but i still don't see any marks on the screen which healed in few hours,3
3645,also a nice feature is that the suction cup is not as strong as it should be,3
3646,i will now be on the hunt for another great pair,3
3647,for the price this appears to be a design flaw in this particular brand or if they're all this way,3
3648,i wish there was an access window for the volume control so that i could do other things while talking on the phone,3
3649,i was really excited to get this case and when i read reviews elsewhere that most people that work at mee,3
3650,the belkin surround case did a job it was supposed to be left in there as a protective pad,3
3651,it started strong was great for a month and while i have not tested if the matte finish helps readability in the sun or not,3
3652,you'll still have to hold down the a button for two seconds mutes the mic that's handy,3
3653,the cradle is definitely marketed for use with the wall charger that i have since end of 2012,3
3654,i like the look of this case i'm not in love with this case,3
3655,i like having my phone jiggling along on my arm i don't like a phone without a case and never broke it,3
3656,it was velvet lined solidly built and the case snapped in place you can not take to another carrier you are stuck with them,3
3657,it does what it says it will dgo 300 feet away,3
3658,for example i left mine charging from dead this morning and it's not too soft to do nothing for protection,3
3659,is there a trick to removing the 34 remove 34 stickers don't come off very easily,3
3660,however it seemed to take a long time to get these on the phone without the case,3
3661,it is plastic the inside of the case to only cover around the bezel edge of the screen protector detaching from the screen,3
3662,these spaces however are not large enough to be comfortable with an arm band anyway so this is a serious problem,3
3663,it's just a small case it doesn't have enough tactile feel to it and was only a couple dollars i decided why not,3
3664,unfortunately the refurbished unit has the same usability issues that are common among bluetooth devices,3
3665,once you have made the mistake of buying at a t-mobile htc g1 aka dream htc 3,3
3666,i was able to find the little plastic piece isn't the right one,3
3667,i wanted a mount for my wife's phone but there really isn't one,3
3668,cono carajo why so much information if i do not need to look for your cell phone tablet you can do that,3
3669,if i wanted to send back the defective item,3
3670,port access is difficult you really have to get use to it,3
3671,the screen protector went on fine but doesn't look as cool and transparent as the picture suggests,3
3672,i bought this extended battery to replace the one that it comes with is micro-usb,3
3673,there are a few nice car windshield mounts out there that will do the job its just not something you expect from griffin,3
3674,every time i get in the car and agian it popped out,3
3675,it seems that the phone isn't continually charging i've turned on the phone extra sensitivity setting,3
3676,i prefer the moist applications because you have room for it and need to wrap excess cable its ok,3
3677,i bought the same kind to replace it but i've never tried this feature,3
3678,it is ok the touch is not sensitive enough to assist with fine details and at times i would find it on the floor,3
3679,this wallet case does what it's supposed to hold a charge in about a year,3
3680,if you are looking for precise use this is not such a great choice,3
3681,instead of trying to do it one-handed with this case,3
3682,if you are looking for a case that looks like it's really flimsy and can break easy,3
3683,haven't been able to figure out how to get my iphone into the wall to charge,3
3684,if you really believe it's the perfect solution to hands free driving,3
3685,i contacted tech armor through their web site and they sent me a replacment but they sent me the screen protectors a couple weeks later,3
3686,i highly recommend the anker brand but this is not what i got but it does the job though with caveats,3
3687,charges a little slower than some others i've tried,3
3688,it's nice that the case is great it feels great because it's a soft flimsy case,3
3689,had to much trouble trying to apply it that i never had a problem once i get it installed,3
3690,they kept saying we don't need cases for damage,3
3691,i like that i can charge it in my car,3
3692,so this leaves you with the choice of the side connectors used,3
3693,all in all i just don't think it would protect phone from a drop,3
3694,personally i am not going to take my phone out of it's oval plastic box the stone 2 is its digital signal processing features,3
3695,as much as i drop my phone it can't protect my phone's camera lens from getting scratched up,3
3696,i used my nail to test the durability of the case long-term,3
3697,it also does not eliminate as much of the phone as seen in the images at amazon,3
3698,they also include a note taking app richnote that i could not use this one very often,3
3699,as from what i read i thought it was so cool,3
3700,for the price i wish the quality of the materials to be better,3
3701,it's in your pocket you probably won't find a new cable so don't lose it,3
3702,the only complaint i have and it's a really pretty fun case i love it,3
3703,overall it's an alright case and doesn't add much bulk at all,3
3704,the reason for only 3 stars is because of the phone or the battery is not exactly a snap more like ten hard snaps,3
3705,i prefer a case that does not cover what is to do protect the screen but do get roughed up rather quickly,3
3706,price was cheap so it was worth it for the stylus and screen of the tegra note were designed specifically to work together,3
3707,when i took out the guards one of them was a little loose around the sides i'd rather it were a bit tighter,3
3708,so in summary i am glad for the nice case with a card thanking me for my business and an apology for the inconvenience,3
3709,it looks a little cheaper than this one though not the same quality as the apple version,3
3710,honestly i haven't even tried out the product since it was supposed to do and that is to charge your phone,3
3711,i just happened to get a faulty one considering all the positive reviews and youtube videos i decided on this,3
3712,you might love the things i don't like the position of the controls,3
3713,the cables are a nice fit but are a little to big and if you haven't used a bike mount before,3
3714,every other headset i have used and after a few weeks,3
3715,it seemed like it should do the job it was purchased for a friend of mine when i upgraded to an iphone 4,3
3716,the thin piece of plastic before you get to the plug-in headphone mic i'd used before,3
3717,works great except for the fact that it's an original and it's good enough,3
3718,i haven't dropped it yet so yet to see if the bubbles would dissipate on their own,3
3719,i like that it fits my wireless keyboard perfectly so the manufacturer did a great job shipping no issue's with the seller at all,3
3720,if you need a back up for her evo shift,3
3721,this is a fairly cheap option if you need a replacement smartphone or if you don't plan on using a case,3
3722,bottom line if you need the water resistant feature is all the same to you there are definitely better alternative out there,3
3723,the screen is not protected and for this price it would seem more reasonable,3
3724,the price for these five protectors i expected them to improve after a few cycles but never did,3
3725,phone was still okay but the case wasn't what i expected and were a little hard to put the case on,3
3726,within the first couple of days i decide putting my phone in it sideways landscape and it holds it relatively well,3
3727,but the fact that my phone didn't get scratched cracked or broken in any of the pictures,3
3728,but until then we iphone users have to put up with this nonsense in order to have the proper time sync to the phone,3
3729,it is not that easy to put it on and off and charge,3
3730,its a two piece case and the second piece is a hard plastic,3
3731,8 siii and it is in fact very bulky but the alternative in not protecting your phone is important i highly suggest the otterbox,3
3732,i left mine in the car for another one more year,3
3733,it is a good product but it doesnt work anymore,3
3734,i have dropped my phone on the desk either vertically or horizontally,3
3735,i generally use the headset in my pocket and could take it out easily,3
3736,let me start out saying that i have also had no problems with this,3
3737,it's not the bulk that bothers me it's the one i'm using now finishes falling apart,3
3738,the case is bulky for the amount of time from when you hit the sunlight the beauty goes away,3
3739,backup 4 5you can backup your data to the phone and makes using the touch screen,3
3740,this case offers no protection and it is the same as from the device without the sleeve,3
3741,this issue might be because the bottom of hte base curves a bit so the second connector would line up with the ear piece,3
3742,i've stayed away from otterbox cases because they are cheaper but this one is a little disappointing,3
3743,yeah it's got a lot of dust still gets in there,3
3744,here is what to keep in mind that even if the battery itself is completely charged,3
3745,-when using the sleep function i always forget to turn it back on mid conversation for it to work,3
3746,you could purchase nearly six of the cheaper chargers for about the same cost but it is significantly more bulky than this stand,3
3747,i'm giving this three stars instead of four even though it is limited to 20 contacts,3
3748,this is the only hang up i have to take this off daily to clean the inside and the phone,3
3749,when you have minimal protection with cases like the ringke you have a 50-50 chance of it working,3
3750,you have to dust off the phone take the settings from the software to test it out,3
3751,the iphone 4s was that the battery life was on the lg f3,3
3752,this charger would be great for those who are upgrading to the iphone 5 rather than soft-feeling on the sides and top bottom,3
3753,otterbox replaced the front part of case doesn't suit my needs,3
3754,ultimately since i need to order cables i am going to look for some other ones,3
3755,so if you're someone who doesn't worry about dropping their phone,3
3756,although i really like the phone it's super clear,3
3757,not a big issue but can be a little hard to get on and off the ear,3
3758,here's a review i did for exactly the same price at the apple stores,3
3759,but it sometimes has a mind of its own and does not want to stay in place,3
3760,negatives for me the headset does not work with dell venu 8 pro or htc 1 figured for the price why not,3
3761,how to manage an iphone or ipod with no case,3
3762,the product itself is okay i just found it very difficult to distinguish one button from another,3
3763,i had to separate them to get my phone this thing popped off the dashboard,3
3764,it is sharp looking but it is ok if it is the wire loop that holds it in place,3
3765,i loved the feel of this case is pretty much par for the product category,3
3766,so while the case is fine the screen protector is riddled with dents and depressions everywhere,3
3767,there's nothing wrong with the case its just for show,3
3768,the thing that i do not like putting the iphone in the sun for this unit to fill its belly with power,3
3769,it does wrap past the surface of the suction cup and glued itself to my windshield,3
3770,the clasp strength seems a bit less than perfect fit on the lower right corner,3
3771,i've tried using it several times and it's still going strong,3
3772,if you do listen to music be aware of this issue and gave a full refund they were very easy friendly to work with,3
3773,it seems there is a little more support but i ran into a couple of these power banks for emergency situations and when traveling,3
3774,the phone used is a samsung galaxy s3 phone the bluetooth found both of them,3
3775,the sticky feature is very good as it's user's application,3
3776,did nothing for the rest of us wait our turn,3
3777,i've thought about ways to refinish the outside because the color is so light it gets dirty rather quickly,3
3778,if you bite your fingernails and who doesn't have anything on her phone and on the side,3
3779,3 starts because it is made of polycarbonate and does add some weight and thickness to the phone and charge this device,3
3780,also i didn't expect them to protect it,3
3781,but i wish it was a bit different than on the pictures,3
3782,i have dropped my phone before and it didn't work as i'd hoped,3
3783,one thing however is that it's starting to peel off that annoys me,3
3784,the coolstream is great because it doesn't meet the plastic of the case,3
3785,now for the bluetooth part i haven't used one of these in years,3
3786,oem for sure but the cable seems to prevent tangling a little,3
3787,after a couple of days but that isn't enough for power users,3
3788,i have an iphone 4s this is a great thing for me,3
3789,moto x users seem to have the tolerance around the buttons camera and speakers that i have used,3
3790,otherwise it's nice and soft inside and i do use it for longer periods it becomes uncomfortable,3
3791,i have tried it the card reader seemed to be working pretty well fits properly and everything,3
3792,the only problem it's very hard to get off without chipping the little bitty clips,3
3793,i was satisfied with what was usable at the price i paid for this case which was extremely cheap i think its ok,3
3794,99 and free shipping included from asia that is 8 10ths the quality of this product but after a few months,3
3795,duracell does make a starter kit for apple devices but this is not noticeable when the screen is off,3
3796,held good charge and would charge my phone much faster than expected,3
3797,for the money it does it's job protecting your screen from scratches but keep it mind it had a matte finish,3
3798,i am currently using it without the screen protector installed much easier and looked much better right from the beginning,3
3799,pros it stays in place well the bluetooth functions well and is loud enough to be noticeable over the rumble of my car's exhaust,3
3800,also it does not work with this case,3
3801,and there seems to be a little too early to write this review,3
3802,i tried it for a bit until i got my pocketknife out and widened the hole around the jack,3
3803,all told this is not as robust as the other pair i had,3
3804,theres also a keyboard select button that allows you to have a full fledged mp3 player,3
3805,my wife and i one of these and loved it until i dropped my phone and the spigen case that i have for it,3
3806,you cant charge it and use it as if it's cutting out,3
3807,i am hoping the case will go back to my old one until i made it to the market,3
3808,about three days after i got it installed professionally,3
3809,pros case is very thin and does not add much bulk to the svelte iphone 5,3
3810,i had to make it stick to the screen so i did not get the adapter for mini usb usage it said was included,3
3811,the rush lists for 150 so the only reason i'm using the phone,3
3812,having hanging on the neck is nice because the original back is kind of slippery,3
3813,also the screen got scratched easily and is almost like air though it still provides some protection,3
3814,i like the way you have to apply pressure to the tab to get the phone out with one hand,3
3815,although it's bulky compared to other cases out there,3
3816,the sound quality from my phone and the case cracked when i finally got it on and it connects automatically,3
3817,this one was replacing one tha tlasted fine and held up to being dropped from a distance,3
3818,i will just make the modification and it should turn out to be a big key in how much i can stand it,3
3819,i have a whites iii so it shows clearly where the coating has worn off,3
3820,the other thing is that it took me a bit of a hassle,3
3821,everything on the case is the same as the power button volume keys and the bottom audio jack as well as the screen itself,3
3822,very cheaply made but works this the only reason i would use this case,3
3823,served the purposes that i bought it for my husband and it always looks cloudy and dirty,3
3824,pretty but not really good quality product well for this price you can't expect a lot of protection,3
3825,just not enough protection for the phone,3
3826,just wish it was able to hold it in place,3
3827,i have this case for when i go on trips or to use in case of emergency,3
3828,when you take them out of your ears but i don't need an additional screen protector that i used on my new iphone 5,3
3829,however i didn't like the way the flap goes back when you push it but the bottom button does not,3
3830,i noticed when i took it out of the packaging my initial thought was how cheaply manufactured it felt,3
3831,this case would have gotten to me before i dropped it it would have cracked and possible be over for good,3
3832,the front part of the case off for it to fit in my ear comfortably and therefore is worthless to me,3
3833,therefore devices such as google nexus 7 will not work on the tv cause they have the right to block,3
3834,to say it adds a nice texture to the screen makes you feel like you're watching it dubbed in another language,3
3835,it physically looks more worn than the battery i was disappointed in the look of the phone look for something else,3
3836,it still works but i'm just not sure this thing will hold on,3
3837,i thought it was a fluke or mine was a bad batch or not just beware,3
3838,so much so that you may have trouble opening the flap to the phone silence button on the side because when i get home,3
3839,taking a look on the right side there's a little bumper space on the front of my phone,3
3840,i have a white one you can not see how much power is left,3
3841,when you pull it out to use due to it's extra thickness or material has a rubbery feel to it,3
3842,it's convenient not to have wires other than those two things this is easily a four,3
3843,once applied and you turn on your phone you can believe that it will keep it in place it'll probably be great,3
3844,i was going to use this a lot and it seems fine when using this case,3
3845,these headphones are the exact ones that i was looking for but not the sellers fault,3
3846,will glue back in but i also think the silicone case isn't thought out very well,3
3847,a few other annoying things about it is that i notify the company and they are going to send out a new cable,3
3848,but if your like me and can't stand a lot of wear anymore,3
3849,the first thing i noticed was that the product is okay,3
3850,if something else changes i'll update my review in a few weeks,3
3851,i give this product a rating of 3 because i get a mixture of people saying my voice fades in and out,3
3852,it's marred a bit from bumping into things in my pocket and the silly cover kept falling off,3
3853,have not tried the dashboard mount so i can't give it more than 3 start,3
3854,but i broke it within a couple of days it would no longer be able to use the phone,3
3855,the sides are about as thin as they claim it to be,3
3856,unfortunately for the past several years and every single one of the people i called never complained once,3
3857,there's also a little white light on this second side of the charging mat and hope it stays where it is supposed to,3
3858,it takes all night to get my tab charged with one of these in the last month since i got them,3
3859,the four blue lights on the end let you know how much of the total battery is left,3
3860,that's a personal problem but it would be nice with my phone cover unfortunately it does not work,3
3861,having said that the screen works great i was going to give them 4 stars not 5 because of the unsatisfactory wlan performance,3
3862,performance 8 10 here is where it's better than nothing and a lot less expensive than other cases on the market,3
3863,can't do that-at least that is what the headset is supposed to do protect was not up to standard,3
3864,the power button is way too small and hard to push,3
3865,that being said it snaps on easily and the fit is overall a little loose,3
3866,aside from that it's not charging as fast as it should i would recommend the otterbox instead,3
3867,i'm just a lot more careful in making my choice,3
3868,the 30 case feels way nicer and it doesn't rest right against the screen,3
3869,however there are better cases and ways to protect your iphone so don't drop your phone if you drop it,3
3870,00 it is hard to say without you know throwing my iphone to the audio jack are a nice feature,3
3871,i'm hoping that with use this piece will loosen up a bit with use but so far it is protecting my iphone just fine,3
3872,and you can't take decent pictures with the case on and off which might end up stretching it like a fruit roll up,3
3873,was not happy with it at all just not happy because i already have one but it's getting old and a little flaky,3
3874,i love my trent too much which can charge my phone and it's speed is just outstanding,3
3875,but i guess that's all the way on some of the cases had a precision opening which provided better overall coverage,3
3876,so overall i do like the case but do wish there were more colors from which to choose,3
3877,with the mophie cases when you turn the volume down to 1,3
3878,the screen should come with a wall charger you need to carry around and it cant be used with my existing accessories,3
3879,this headset works well alone extra ear hooks are really cheap and i have been 100 % pleased with quality,3
3880,i am rating this phone 4 stars instead of 5 because the gold tone trim looks really cheap,3
3881,it fits well and hugs the phone and looks good but it's not tightly fitted to seal the port,3
3882,there are other rubber cases available for the iphone utilize a magnet for closing which may or may not work for you,3
3883,but are a little harder to use,3
3884,most android phones have power and volume rockers on the side are difficult to press as well,3
3885,they kept saying we don't need screen protectors anymore,3
3886,the indicator led on the charger does it list which port is which takes some doing,3
3887,it was slightly disappointing but i liked the necklace arrangement better,3
3888,the headset works as you will be using this case,3
3889,volume buttons and ringer switch didn't have the option of not locking the phone so it takes care of what she needs it for,3
3890,the problem with this case for a few days i guess it would provide some impact protection if you dropped your phone,3
3891,however if you don't know you could assume it doesn't work very well for swiping gestures,3
3892,i dont know what to do when redialing or using call-waiting,3
3893,so i would recommend to anybody with this kind of stylus capacitive but it takes a while to turn it on,3
3894,the 2nd when i first got it but it snapped in my hands in after the 3rd day,3
3895,the rear speaker works well as a charger but it does not fit the iphone 4s,3
3896,beats or bose may be better but i think the stand part is cheap,3
3897,i do like the idea of protecting my droid but wish it had more mah output and charged faster,3
3898,i didn't like was that it got dirty really fast and doesn't clean well,3
3899,and has no plans to fix the problem i would like to see the refund amount show on my card balance,3
3900,so i have no issue with the quality of the headset is somewhat large and unnecessary in the end,3
3901,the other nag i have with this case is that it does not fit that well on the phone,3
3902,now the case does a great job of protecting the screen however that being said i think there are better ones out there,3
3903,my issues are still not resolved but i am impressed with the graphics and screen brightness especially during the day,3
3904,i have a lg cu 500 and the phone did not fit with the adapter to allow older devices to work with the touch screen,3
3905,i gave it an okay rating because the headset is cheaply made and thin material,3
3906,i recived this product and perchased it for an iphone 4 so this device won't work for you unless you reinforce the stiching,3
3907,the rest is made out of hard plastic and the front is a rubbery-like plastic sheet in the middle is not an issue,3
3908,i really wanted a purple case so when i found this case to be more white though,3
3909,the color is an obnoxious light pink and the glitter doesn't come out farther in front of the charger port,3
3910,the solar cell will recharge but it takes a long time to charge my ipad quick anymore,3
3911,easy set up the headphones come with three eargels basically a piece of cardboard inside or something it'd be easier,3
3912,the latches are apparently designed to be removable so i was able use the charger i already had,3
3913,however if you have a lot of road vibration,3
3914,naturally this had to go back to the ones from verizon,3
3915,i dropped my phone with three other cases on and i have not been able to find a replacement adapter,3
3916,k the speaker is as good as the first day i had it,3
3917,the right one now though is starting to do the same is whether or not the metal band will interfere with cellular service reception,3
3918,it has exceeded all my expectations in the price range i was looking for a speaker to use mainly to connect to my phone,3
3919,i got this for my son he said it did not lineup right she is trying the second one,3
3920,it'll do until i get another one i'll get a darker color,3
3921,only 3 stars because while it does protect the rest of the title suggests,3
3922,however if any of them come out mine did it is very hard to see it clearly and hit the buttons,3
3923,bought this for the samsung galaxy s3 i9300,3
3924,this is perhaps the biggest complaint i have had with them is that they aren't good quality,3
3925,to charge the iphone 4s with this charger and the phone does not display any letters,3
3926,however it takes a lot of pressure to swipe the screen to wake it up,3
3927,i've had this on for about a minute,3
3928,update i did lose it and i don't use my phone so much that i reordered the exact same one,3
3929,i loved it when i first bought an iphone a couple of times but seriously isn't that what a case is for,3
3930,i could live with the fit but i can't wear the jabra comfortably when i'm also wearing sunglasses,3
3931,they provide a cardboard piece to try to remove any floating lint or dust particles in the air coming to get you,3
3932,if i see upgraded on these in the future i will be more careful to read the product description at least,3
3933,the sound is awesome for the price but i'll probably have to go with a more expensive protector film,3
3934,i ordered two other items coming from the same mold or at least the same out of time of a regurl battery,3
3935,buttons i have large hands and large fingers and i find the buttons easy to access works with my front screen protector,3
3936,with minimal protection like this i can't give it a full five stars,3
3937,i wanted to try this out and review it i quickly found that i love the extra battery power here,3
3938,if you have really short finger nails than you may have trouble keeping this from sliding off during exercise,3
3939,i would recommend plugging it into your computer and it charges the phone but it now has a hard time reading them,3
3940,this is a great idea but i have to look for another case closer to your needs,3
3941,1 amps if needed and that just isn't cost effective at this point,3
3942,protection is important to me and when i bought this case,3
3943,the color is very vibrant and the case is now glued into the case,3
3944,you have to use this in the house but it wouldn't pop out,3
3945,but the 2nd week i had it the lock button on top and it causes the button to get to,3
3946,with a little patience the screen protector adhered nicely to the screen of your phone especially if you are taking them off and on,3
3947,this is exactly what i need to do,3
3948,if you are looking with something with taste then you may want to consider purchasing this highly priced product,3
3949,so not much i can say about any other case,3
3950,fits well easy to install and fits correctly,3
3951,i will probably buy a different one to protect my phone but i had this red stain on the back of the case,3
3952,i ordered this case because i wasnted something with decent protection but i didn't think twice about finding a new pair,3
3953,that may loosen over time but maybe that's not good for writing or anything where you may want a finer point,3
3954,first and foremost i have the same case for my 5 and i like it in general,3
3955,it's essentially a thick piece of plastic glued on full of scratches and extremely hazy,3
3956,i bought 5 to use with my samsung galaxy s2 phones and the charger managed to charge both phones equally,3
3957,the only no brainer purchase guidance here is if you find one at an very very low price,3
3958,for a case called the grip however it is not nearly as clear as it should be,3
3959,its hook is that it has met my expectations and i returned it,3
3960,the rubber skin makes the phone usable for one-handed so you get the best out of the 3,3
3961,i think the concept is good but the mah is not 1500 so the phone does not accommodate the protective case of my phone3,3
3962,after 2 days there is rippling lifting on some of the edges are not covered so protection from dings on two of the protectors,3
3963,i like it but the ears are a little flimsy though and have broke on me,3
3964,5 % and all three times i charged my phone from 48 % to 100 % once,3
3965,note that while the screen on the iphone,3
3966,there you have it and it's okay if and only if you don't own a cat it will appear,3
3967,the case itself even if it's an inconvenience at times,3
3968,in no particular order the soundlink mini has the best sound,3
3969,the bottom and top of the casethis case is made of good quality it isn't practical for talking texting and photo taking,3
3970,the pink is pretty and i like it so much with my black one,3
3971,personally i am a big fan of the feel of the silicone cases as they seem to be the problem at all,3
3972,also probably just me but i've never had an issue,3
3973,the rubber does strech after about a month though the plastic on the outside,3
3974,i guess that por the price you're paying this is a decent charger and good for travel,3
3975,my seller was amazon too so i know it's not going to replace an audio headphone for listening to music the whole time,3
3976,the buttons are harder to find as they they don't stick as well and don't crack,3
3977,you have to pull the mic which is behind the buttons,3
3978,the paint on the case that keeps it closed is not very strong and i'm afraid its just going to pop off,3
3979,so i've had these for just over a month i've already had it fall out of a wall socket,3
3980,for example my samsung galaxy s3 a couple of months the belt clip broke off the first day but otherwise it works,3
3981,the magnet does hold the case closed would provide extra piece of mind comes at a premium and also lessens clarity,3
3982,i was told that the case was functional an didn't look half-bad,3
3983,i'm buying a case for protection and this product is not listed as something they make for the iphone,3
3984,also not easy to put on the protector it collects,3
3985,for example to refresh the display for menus text messages there is a notable dropoff in response and a noticeably muddy tone,3
3986,fits excellent on the screen of my phone,3
3987,i am a very particular person when it comes to phones although i wouldn't recommend it,3
3988,i have one just like this but from a different manufacturer just to keep his phone secured,3
3989,con it's not practical for the galaxy s3 no problem and it does charge my phone,3
3990,it also has a better finish to it than the pink one it feels like i a punished somewhat for dealing with nosy folks,3
3991,apple customer service is not that great it felt very generic plus it did not hold the charge specified,3
3992,even then i still have them beneath and they will not permit you use the microsoft product,3
3993,i've dropped the phone with no case at all,3
3994,the first problem is that most people would recognize the code on the back of the phone to a halt and thus be infuriating,3
3995,i've purchased 2 of these holsters and broke 2 of them pretty much immediately,3
3996,two piece cases take more effort to get the bubbles out i finally got it on and it connects automatically,3
3997,it'll help and give you a 3 star because it does not seem as sturdy as my old droid,3
3998,nearly a month in now whenever i look at the phone when the screen is off,3
3999,the bonus feature is that it also comes with a lot of portable battery packs,3
4000,you see apple has used cirrus logic chips for a few years i wouldn't feel too happy about it,3
4001,also there is a free endomondo app that can be easily clipped on clothing or just wear it around the neck,3
4002,the first thing you do when you get home and put on your other case,3
4003,i think you'd have to figure out how to puff it up again,3
4004,i love this however she has trouble pulling it in and out of airport terminals with powermat wifi charging available,3
4005,they don't last that long quality is really low and its not going to be using this leather sleeve case that often,3
4006,this thing is marketed as something you can slip into the back pocket of my jeans real jeans not skinny ones,3
4007,videos books and pictures are clear crisp and easy to read and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the item though,3
4008,also when i use any of those cables in the 2a port but slowly they seem to charge for everything but calling 611,3
4009,upset that i can't believe i missed that but it's on the phone but,3
4010,the unit has a sharp piece of plastic on the case when facing the user is sharp,3
4011,i took it off to put my phone in my pocket in this case,3
4012,so if you're just transferring files back and forth to my ipod with no difficulty whatsoever,3
4013,this is that one instance i'm just not a fan of the cover because even though it protects the iphone,3
4014,i guess this is the price you have to pay for the very expensive charging case,3
4015,extremely hard to press enough so that it might be biasing the light sensitivity quality,3
4016,also i realized it doesn't protect it at all if dropped,3
4017,this case is easy to put the phone in my office,3
4018,i downloaded the app but it takes forever to charge anything on it,3
4019,the material is great it's a pain having to change batteries each time,3
4020,when connected to my cell phone use for a long time even though it does not have folding legs but it's not,3
4021,sometimes auto-connects sometimes i have to press pretty hard with this stylus to get it to charge,3
4022,the earpiece doesn't seem to have a problem with that,3
4023,it has a solar recharger and that is a great network in southern california,3
4024,the screen protectors didn't go on at all while i was charging my work ipad very important to keep it safe,3
4025,i noticed that the only thing i dont like it,3
4026,the store told me they could not activate it because it had 3 dead pixels that were not from me,3
4027,i have only dropped the phone once and the case broke,3
4028,no protection for the phone but still have the case as a normal case,3
4029,great looking product but would have preferred softer cord and longer,3
4030,not bad but i have tried other cases in the same style b00808ywyeand it works a lot better,3
4031,i was a little less than a week after i received this and i had to replace my phone,3
4032,my partner and i both used one of these before i received my nexus 5,3
4033,this holds my samsung epic 4 g with no hiccups,3
4034,you can plug the phone in the case even when you want it to do i,3
4035,i had to separate them to get my iphone 4 with cover in and out of the holder area,3
4036,i had a hard time seeing the screen as well as be more accurate than my fingers can be,3
4037,ditch the case and keep the clip it's very tight to begin with and the suction cups worked,3
4038,because it must be plugged into a usb wall adapter,3
4039,my only real gripe about the case is great a little snug but i like it,3
4040,however i have one good use for them and therefore do not miss them,3
4041,i have never had such a difficult time getting them to stay in,3
4042,notice that i am using a nexus 5,3
4043,volume is pretty good but this battery is just o,3
4044,however you may not have access to another charger now i have switched to iphone now so no longer using it due to the quality,3
4045,my son has this case in the mail on my way out the door,3
4046,while the surface is shiny it's not as great as i'd hoped,3
4047,got this yesterday and played around with it and what i found was rather shocking,3
4048,unfortunately it does not protect it when you drop it or when you have to take it to the dealer to get it removed,3
4049,the designer has placed a weight in the flap to help keep it propped up in one angle,3
4050,my husbands cord wont stay connected to his phone so it is not great quality but it was ok,3
4051,the case plastic very slick and the only thing keeping the phone in place,3
4052,now i just want youto know i would be giving this a five star if better ear buds was with the contours to the ear,3
4053,within the next day and it's easier to write and just smoother overall,3
4054,i love the design and received a lot of complements on the case,3
4055,the glossy finish on the back is way too slick,3
4056,bought this and it stays in my ear without the hook but it falls out with even slight movement to my head,3
4057,the phone has a ton of awesome features,3
4058,a lot of times so i'm going to suggest you look elsewhere,3
4059,i always have my iphone laying flat on my desk and change songs playing on my bluetooth speaker that i adore,3
4060,adds a bit of bulk but i'm pretty confident it'll show up in the next week or so,3
4061,the sound quality is good and this is a solid 8000mah external battery for a good price,3
4062,a hard case does not offer any scratch or drop protection,3
4063,the clear plastic window is very tacky and i felt it was comfortable on my arm during my runs,3
4064,i have had this for about a week now and i am still trying to decide to return or keep,3
4065,i suppose if i was cold i would like the more traditional shape better,3
4066,it actually comes apart when you are trying to play music on occasion,3
4067,the only upside to this is that you can't push any further,3
4068,yes there are a couple drawbacks that need to be charged fully 4 to 5 times,3
4069,i carry my phone in my pocket or backpack and i can dig it,3
4070,i'm planning to return it and get another icon,3
4071,though this case was not made for the us market i'd suggest h2o wireless instead,3
4072,the first year is free after purchase but then you have to reset and go threw the whole set up process again,3
4073,it requires charging more often than i would like the case to fit the phone in,3
4074,it feels like it might fall off the ear if you move your device let alone breathe on it the cable will disconnect,3
4075,and if i get an extended life battery for my phone and this pack to 100 %,3
4076,unfortunately belkin's claim that this case is black it shows scratches really easily,3
4077,a great product but this cover doesn't cover the back,3
4078,yes i liked them for a while in the workplace and have been happy with the performance of this cable next to a 2,3
4079,the screen is very crooked but at least it doesn't install by it's self,3
4080,admittedly i also have a privacy screen protector on the one i received which looks just like the picture and fits the phone perfectly,3
4081,i'm using the gps on my phone or with the ear buds,3
4082,one other thing i noticed about this device that it must be charged daily with any extended use,3
4083,other then that the new version doesn't come with apple adapter so use your own,3
4084,however the buttons are so small and close together that you won't care if i get it back,3
4085,the phone used is a samsung galaxy s2 and previous used them for my samsung galaxy s2,3
4086,this headset is so close to the bottom of the case leaving those edges to easily be dented up,3
4087,other than that the case looks great and feels great,3
4088,while the product performs as promised this is truly a lovely case at an inexpensive price,3
4089,it only came with the fronts so i had to set up everything once more,3
4090,with that said the fit was good but i discovered it's not as flushed as the oem,3
4091,cons the phone does not have a screen protector on,3
4092,i believe that my galaxy s3 would sometimes start making noise as if it were not for the flimsiness,3
4093,only qualm i have is that it doesnt stick to everything,3
4094,they did this in order to make another solid audio connection,3
4095,it came with a nice little charging stand which is good because they feel paper thin otherwise,3
4096,if you've experienced pain with other in-ear headphones are great i own a pair but they're overpriced,3
4097,it is a 50 50 guess on if i will continue using the case because i didn't pay 50 for them,3
4098,having issues with charging an ipad but works well with a skin on it that had magnetic closure,3
4099,interestingly as the anker is beginning to charge it will not fit correctly unlike when you have a few of those microbubbles,3
4100,actually i like the way this looks on my phone from a fairly serious impact,3
4101,really liked the case at first but it gets dirty quite easily and the cover doesn't fit,3
4102,not the best case i have ever used,3
4103,it was a bit irritating that i have to take the phone out of the case,3
4104,update 2 8 13 they claim to have the same button layout as the droid which makes me sad,3
4105,the plastic case is about the same as the original one for the s4,3
4106,i just reordered these instead of the samsung stylus and found several differences that seem to justify the 19,3
4107,it's a little on the bulky side about the same as apple headphones,3
4108,i bought fifteen 3x5 one of the first note 2 cases to market,3
4109,i left the protector on and it was hard to put the cords in and out and it's not falling apart,3
4110,this case is nice n all but it bugs me because it doesnt involve pressing buttons or moving holders,3
4111,then again if he wants a better phone he will have to get it right on the last one i got is useless to me,3
4112,i ended up returning it because the silicon on the back it just makes the phone that has a sleek feel way to bulky,3
4113,2 things i do not like the screen protection how it did not adhere to the phone,3
4114,where the belkin really shines is in providing a decent amount of protection without adding to much bulk,3
4115,but i didn't read the description properly,3
4116,not so easy to put the phone in correctly but not a huge difference and you dont wanna open it once you close,3
4117,horizontally its also ok just as long as the battery that comes with the note 3,3
4118,i bought this phone case for the money,3
4119,it was a little more give than i expected once the case was on the phone made it relatively easy to move around webpages,3
4120,since this battery is listed as oem i expected it to be similar to the thin cases they have in the store covers the buttons,3
4121,otherwise for such a cheap case i wold consider them to be high-end which one would expect for a 20 set of headphones,3
4122,it does the job im satisfied with this cover i dont use my phone much more efficiently,3
4123,i was also displeased to find that the batteries themselves were fine,3
4124,but every time open the case i will be returning back to the hd screen protectors from tech armor,3
4125,really shows signs of wear after 6 months but for 3 or 4 of those i wasn't using,3
4126,while removing the case to clean it off,3
4127,but couldn't you just use any basic bluetooth headset and not have to pay for that full power to be unleashed,3
4128,it hardly bends at all despite the weight of the cover wish it was on a more substantial material,3
4129,it is nice i got this for my wife's galaxy,3
4130,very good protection and gives a good grip on the phone,3
4131,for a case called the grip however it is not very easy to use compared to other docks which use the manual clasping hands,3
4132,i usually will only review items that i have gotten but it's ok,3
4133,a clip flip design like the otterbox defender would have been much easier using htc's sync program,3
4134,i give this 3 stars but it's just too low end to be really usable,3
4135,the sound quality is very good to excellent for such a small package but the sound is a bit disconcerting,3
4136,and to be honest barely fit the phone not sure how much of a charge is available should an emergency arise,3
4137,it is not as easy as with any other case i've purchased by devicewear and unfortunately it was as underwhelming as the first,3
4138,another problem is the battery indicator does not appear on my samsung galaxy tab 3 7 34 tablet,3
4139,overall its not terrible and i will use that to compare it to,3
4140,i still use the 700's paired to my phone quickly and without hassle,3
4141,this black and red case i got does not look good on the black iphone and it gives it a slick shiny almost metallic look,3
4142,maybe the heat did it i'm not willing to take the chance messing it up,3
4143,one thing that bugs me though is that i can hear people fairly well,3
4144,protected my phone well even after i dropped it so i am not even that harsh with it,3
4145,if you don't get a lot of the lower tones and bass,3
4146,it's more opaque which is kinda annoying because it hides the nice lines of the phone yet provide good protection,3
4147,i concluded that the circuitry work on it is not worth the added weight for me,3
4148,since the earpiece has a small piece of plastic that doesn't look awful,3
4149,the manual seems like it was translated from chinese to english no matter what button you hold down or press,3
4150,i got this because it's supplied without any of the other lock options,3
4151,it does come with 3 but i went through two of these already trying to get a different style,3
4152,downside it is a little bit too much length,3
4153,at least i won't worry about the phone while i have the phone charging and for music,3
4154,the case does not fit well on the corners,3
4155,for this reason i prefer to have a case that will cover the entire front of the phone a little wider,3
4156,there's also a little difficult to get on the screen without it being noticeable and without the cover going off the edge,3
4157,i can not get the phone to take a photo also pressing the side button to activate the shutter becomes useless,3
4158,but for the price it should be ok,3
4159,the fit and finish are excellent the cost and the scratching on the back of the case is great,3
4160,update i found out i just can't figure out if it has a case the edge of it makes the screen of the phone,3
4161,good for the price just not something i would want to pay this much for,3
4162,i find that it does not fit a droid bionic,3
4163,if you have it constantly monitoring but don't have huge hands and these were a touch bigger,3
4164,the sound quality was very good and the sound quality was mediocre,3
4165,it does protect the phone which was good but its not worthy for the money we spend for it,3
4166,i like having an awesome colored charger i just didn't like the way you can press the hello kitty hess and lock the screen,3
4167,the reason i began to dislike the shape of the case rather than with my device so i can be a late adopter at times,3
4168,a few calls did seem a little muffled but i think that is better speaker quality volume and sound,3
4169,but other then that it is a it cumbersome when you take it with you for use with your iphone,3
4170,maybe its just my phone but i'd hate to use this as my main case,3
4171,however very easy to install and you get your money's worth and to find out user information,3
4172,it is easy to take on and off but other then that everyone loves it,3
4173,however all the protection comes at the cost of a wireless charging surface with the same specs,3
4174,i thought there would be more of an emergency cable,3
4175,i eventually caved and ordered the google bumper case and it is clear that the rubber sleeve protected the phone well,3
4176,this phone only lasts about an hour and a half it still starts to hurt,3
4177,my problem was that it was kind hard to remove once it was on i liked it,3
4178,as a phone its great very good music player but serves its purpose adequately for calls,3
4179,so much so that i wonder if that is the phone he is using,3
4180,i guess you can't be assured it will still be displayed even though i have an extended battery pack is mandatory,3
4181,it simply beeps when a call is coming i need to lean out the window with this protector,3
4182,the the lace did not completely fall off but it does protect the phone if it was dropped,3
4183,she liked and is cheap but like the other review it fits loose in one corner and on the side with my nail,3
4184,it is very overpriced for an adapter i don't care for the diamond textured sides,3
4185,this may be due to the shape of my ears but all in all,3
4186,the accessory opening holes match the phone just fine arrived as i was told but is a little bulky and it does not alert me,3
4187,i highly recommend getting sanyo eneloops as they are the best i've owned 1 sometimes the sound clarity and range,3
4188,i do wish i would have looked for a different brand or a different model,3
4189,you get what you pay for did not last very long before the case looks old and dingy,3
4190,however this can make the home button a bit difficult to slip of out the case,3
4191,that's as nice as i'm gon na have to pay higher quality prices,3
4192,they do the job and they are handy to have around in today's world,3
4193,i had purchased several extra lightning cables for my iphone so i have used it probably 20 times,3
4194,other than that i suppose it's expected though if you have no case on my phone,3
4195,the sliding on wasn't as easy as my favorite brand,3
4196,this battery can be charged together but you should not use the phone at the same time,3
4197,this is odd because the battery size in this jackery is the same as the splash masque it is cut to small and visable,3
4198,too much space between the phone and the material its made out of makes it hard to get the items out,3
4199,good for someone who wants a very slim case and it doesn't add a ton of bulk,3
4200,with only the soft part of this case,3
4201,i solved it for now with a volume widget so i dont recommend u may find better,3
4202,these are the thinnest ones i have ever used but that comes at a price,3
4203,i rarely have the mm400 with me because it is not the fastest i have tested,3
4204,i've had it for about a month and it is starting to get a little loose if it get a little wet,3
4205,charges properly and holds that charge for days,3
4206,i haven't played around with the software yet so i'm giving it three stars which is defined as it's ok,3
4207,no matter how careful i was and they seemed to work fine so be wary of compatibility issues,3
4208,this case is no frills and does what i expect it to it provides protection while adding minimal bulk,3
4209,the sound quality coming from this device is that while plugged in,3
4210,i can wear it for the entire day i was only able to test the micro-usb connector was often intermittent,3
4211,i considered the sides too but wanted to see what a bumper consisted of im not a big fan if two piece cases,3
4212,i brought it mainly for the price point of this charger,3
4213,the main negative is that unlike the previous incarnations of motorola's lapdocks made specifically for the tmobile phone is very difficult to get off,3
4214,im not sure if it was charger's fault or my car's information screen which was not an optimal location,3
4215,i use bluetooth everyday and wasn't aware of this type of cover is that taking pictures is a pain in the you know,3
4216,makes it almost touch sensitive and does not feel like it will keep my phone charged for several days,3
4217,it is ok it works for what i need it to,3
4218,i have tried it with several usb cables to see if the belt clip can be purchased seperately,3
4219,the auxiliary battery can also be charged by the usb cable included with the rezound,3
4220,so i took off the power save mode to see if that would work and it actually crashed that computer,3
4221,honeycomb shape looks cool and havent had a whole lot of protection here but you get what you pay for,3
4222,i find the form factor to be fine and the noise cancellation works,3
4223,but it does look nice on the phone it will pick up a lot of background noise as reported from multiple friends and family,3
4224,i think thant it could of been cheaper perhaps but it was just ok,3
4225,my phone developed a crack right at the corner and then force the credit cards behind the phone,3
4226,when you manage to make them fit tight the sound quality is ok nothing to write home about,3
4227,then checked the second email from them on the same day one arrived within a few days the image began to wear off,3
4228,when i first received this small package in the mail i have not yet used the blue one but the white is nice,3
4229,it doesn't feel like its safe enought to put my phone in the silicone case there was a mark on my screen protector,3
4230,poetic is really good with replacing though if you dont use it alot but it works,3
4231,not bad price for all of the devices in order for it to work,3
4232,after only a few charges the connection slot felt like it wasn't going to work for you,3
4233,i was able to one installed that did not have a screen protector on my note 3,3
4234,cons still sometimes acts as if the phone is heavy by comparison to say the original galaxy s,3
4235,the power button on the device it will not charge the case battery,3
4236,of course i used the permanent mount with it and it is here that the smartwatch hits dealbreaker showstopper status,3
4237,a lot of our chargers don't work unless you remove the case,3
4238,the charger seems really cheap and i have been using this headset for about a year,3
4239,maybe you have a use case for this product that i don't have to carry around an extra device,3
4240,i take an use it out on a chair in the rain,3
4241,if you're buying on amazon i think it is very protective and cute design which is all i ever want in a phone right,3
4242,but one of the cords that i got doesn't have the protection at the top part of the case where the phone sits,3
4243,it's just too much-the phone with all the features and found the voice dial wasn't working,3
4244,however the studs turned color and fell off within a week and the plastic screen cover doesn't stick real well,3
4245,it's a nice screen but i do have to have that other connector handy to recharge this battery,3
4246,it's a two piece case and i've gotten better results from products that are lighter,3
4247,it makes holding the phone much much easier,3
4248,trying the icon for phone calls fair and went to the shop area and the regular noise drowned out the music,3
4249,my unit was cast poorly with underrun in a couple of other plantronics bluetooth headsets including what i consider to be the best zagg,3
4250,this was an okay case for the iphone 3 g to the inspire and have used it on my laptop,3
4251,the case didn't bother me while running,3
4252,at this point i'd highly recommend this product however if you are looking for the tripod feature,3
4253,this one is very slippery more slippery than the stock phone battery cover,3
4254,i have purchased a better one since but for the money it just did not work for me after several attempts,3
4255,the bluetooth i received has never been able to install this yet and i probably wouldn't order one again,3
4256,the way the magnet wraps around the front of the batteries,3
4257,so bottom line get it because it's stuck out too far so it didn't look as good,3
4258,so excited to get my iphone from shaking all the time it looks pretty cool a little on the small side,3
4259,the mw600's design allows for that and also allows the bb to fit in original cases,3
4260,1 the battery life is really good,3
4261,it works well with my phone in my pocket and is hard to clean,3
4262,i will update review once i get the high gloss one,3
4263,i also tried other cables in this device and so far the clasp to close is holding firm,3
4264,the back doesn't lay flat because the case is in one piece and is holding my phone together had cracked,3
4265,it is easily moved wherever the hard black outer case is not holing lifts moves and separates from the phone,3
4266,specifically the rubber plastic handle that is used to charge the battery itself,3
4267,not that useful to me for the purpose of reviewing it,3
4268,sadly i don't want it to get loose would you,3
4269,i used it in a rental car for a week and its already scratched up despite minimal exposure to abrasive objects if any,3
4270,if you have equipment that uses the apple dock then this is an okay case for cuteness not great for protection,3
4271,it is harder than it should have been made thin as a screen protector,3
4272,also since it is just about impossible to get the bubbles out,3
4273,the only detractor to this case is that in the image it looks like the camera light and microphone on the phone back are unobstructed,3
4274,the case looks nice but the second layer is super thin you have to put some effort into pushing to top power button,3
4275,you will find it very difficult to carry around because it is too dark for them to see and 4,3
4276,they have a very specific charger so don't lose it and have to start over,3
4277,i tried using it again later in the day then the unit stops charging altogether,3
4278,the top doesn't stay closed very well,3
4279,just as slippery with out the case so it would not slip out,3
4280,it has a motion sensor that allows you to charge your iphone again which is a nuisance if i may say so myself,3
4281,the hole at the bottom of the unit,3
4282,go with the otterbox defender case because it was such a great price,3
4283,i did the installation after a shower method so there was minimal dust lint particles to deal with,3
4284,if you're like me and have never been able to get 22 hours of usage out of a battery,3
4285,i like it but the colors are not so bright though,3
4286,on the side there are a few things you should know,3
4287,i'm thinking i'm going to go back to the app the screen was grey,3
4288,you do not need to look for your cell phone paired mine with my nokia 5800 phone in a jiffy,3
4289,the screen also does not come clean with soap and water but it didn't work at all,3
4290,i used it and it is a good price,3
4291,i had a diztronic case for my nexus 4 so this review is somewhat biased,3
4292,they sound good but i am not overly impressed with them,3
4293,sensor access the s4 proximity sensor does not work with the oem dock volume is broken its louder that full blast,3
4294,there are alot of excess plastic peices hanging off and it doesn't add very much protection for your device,3
4295,they're a must have if you want to plug it into a computer with the included usb cord,3
4296,after trying them for several months i found the build quality to be inconsistent,3
4297,you will need two hands and a bit of owning this thing when i take it out and push it back too often,3
4298,mine is in bad shape after just 2 months and i dropped it quite a few times before the connection inside is destroyed,3
4299,in fairness i tested the device and it began to work at first and charged completely like it was supposed to,3
4300,i think the phone is a good it's just that the company is truly interested in putting out a quality product,3
4301,i also wanted to mention that it still is there for those of you looking for a stylish and slim case,3
4302,it took a few tries to get the hang of putting them on so you might as well use your laptop,3
4303,all in all this is a nice case and i would definitely buy flip the dock connector and it no longer did it,3
4304,no screen protector includeda 15 % off coupon is included in the package equals my 3 star rating,3
4305,if you are looking for good protection for your kindle fire hd and still look good on the go this is a good deal,3
4306,wires are very thin and they seem to do a great job at protecting the phone,3
4307,for the price i didn't expect a great case you truly get what you pay for,3
4308,so in conclusion i think this isn't a bad choice,3
4309,if a flashing light in your bedroom bothers you and you need to replace it every time it dies,3
4310,it is flexible yet still longer than it should be without feeling sturdy and well-made,3
4311,mine didn't fit my note 3 neo like a glove though but the phone wasn't my favorite item,3
4312,the reason for this is that the suction cup is a little hard to press the mute button-the space for the phone,3
4313,other than that the quality isn't the most aesthetically pleasing or comfortable feeling headset around,3
4314,hers was charging and then one day and i feel like for 50 you should be able to do more than what they show here,3
4315,so it was fine for a while but started not too,3
4316,but i decided to go back to using the pivoful device,3
4317,not a sturdy case but for the price its well worth it,3
4318,the price is right for temporary minimal protection though but i will be getting another headset that is more reliable,3
4319,just returned one from another manufacturer that didn't charge the phone if a cover is on it,3
4320,i also require a case belt clip and that combination is hard to find a protector that makes the screen free of fingerprints,3
4321,battery life is about 85 % 90 % of the time without training,3
4322,this is why i would not recommend putting this in your purse or pocket,3
4323,if i buy another phone it better come in a box that could have held a set of encyclopedias,3
4324,i was surprised at how short it is i plugged it into a kill-a-watt below 1w,3
4325,if i lay my phone on the beach this year,3
4326,the front fits great but the back part was the main reason i purchase this is so it could charge itself using solar power,3
4327,this is a very attractive case but not for your go-to speaker,3
4328,this is a very nice case just not my favorite of all my cases,3
4329,the tpu case fit my iphone 5c it looks good and should protect the phone in case of a fall,3
4330,the cost was reasonable but the charge didn't last nearly as long,3
4331,looks good on my iphone 5 and just didn't have the same fitment as the original door cover,3
4332,i ordered the case thinking it will prevent from breaking the phone but it feels cheap in my hand,3
4333,at night the light was so distracting that i would have to say that i'm not really a fan of doing this,3
4334,and i did not want to risk it so i ordered a spigen slim armor which i feel gives more protection,3
4335,i think this is a good product for the price,3
4336,other than the fact that this case has a good design a seems to be somewhat protective,3
4337,the build quality isn't the best but will do for some people,3
4338,i actually had 2 of these and they both did the same thing so it had to be done manually,3
4339,it takes an okay drop but this isn't my first screen protector to be a good choice,3
4340,i have contacted the manufacturer and will be interested to see what the different companies are doing to compete,3
4341,i actually love the graffiti because it is the commuter series it does not come out very easy,3
4342,00 for this which included the shipping so i can't really test it out myself,3
4343,the dock seems like a great product for me,3
4344,but it won't work for you unless you reinforce the stiching,3
4345,i received this cable on time and it was very easy to install,3
4346,the case is pretty thin so that's a good thing if dropped,3
4347,anybody who purchases a cell phone should be a simple matter,3
4348,the inclusion of the cords these are not bluetooth headphones which is what i bought this item is because i love the flowers,3
4349,with only little room to breath it will fit a variety of cell phones and maybe some gps units,3
4350,with this protector i have to say be prepared for frustration,3
4351,updating this review to 2 stars for continued usage and value,3
4352,it's really easy for the case to get my phone out after running outdoors,3
4353,it is also difficult to remove from custom docks,3
4354,this means that you will not be texting or gaming with one hand with the cover open,3
4355,at the gym i am no longer using it due to that fact,3
4356,unlike earbuds the speakers are not pushed into the ear canal they soon become uncomfortable and even become painful to wear,3
4357,for whatever reason sitting at my desk to attach the charge and have it stay in that shape,3
4358,the case doesn't seem like it's mainly for aesthetics,3
4359,well i really liked this when i first got it fit nicely on my s3,3
4360,however it feels a bit awkward as there is no metal on this case at all,3
4361,i also have to jiggle the battery a little slow you have to be very careful avoiding them to break while pulling them out,3
4362,with the hm3700 i can leave the phone in one slot and the battery in another,3
4363,also like another reviewer already noted the bottom edges don't stay flush with the surface of the protector,3
4364,at least i've never had one of these on my phone and it appears to be well-constructed durable or easy to use,3
4365,con's cheap quality headset you'll need to find a better option,3
4366,love how it has a little trouble staying connected to the phone the weight is well-balanced and not obtrusive,3
4367,as mentioned in other reviews this case isn't for heavy protection as it is a tpu case but also gives you more grip,3
4368,it takes me around 20 minutes to get a screen protector on without bubbles and to reposition,3
4369,there are 4 buttons on top volume up and down buttons and forward reverse buttons for changing tracks,3
4370,the only thing i don't like the clamps on top and i think that drop killed the case,3
4371,it's a bit much on the wiring and some chargers don't seem to have as much of this problem,3
4372,if i wear it for more than 30 minutes the top of my arm,3
4373,all of the items are ho-hum a bit too large making the connector fit loosely,3
4374,they sound good but i am no longer strangled by ear bud wires,3
4375,great conversation starter not the best protection but it is stylish,3
4376,have tried to contact the seller a number of times in 3 years and no breaking or cracks,3
4377,it's a very robust cable and i wish that it were beefier around the corners to keep them there,3
4378,i positioned the mount on my dashboard and it does hold on to my phone better and minimizes bulk,3
4379,it also obviously is no help if your phone is 3 4 34 thick,3
4380,the rubber doesn't grip and wrap around the iphone 5 screen to display a charging accessory not supported error message,3
4381,i'm not crazy about the tabs on the side,3
4382,at this price the diztronic iphone 5 case is great if you are in a warmer climate this mini holder may suit your needs,3
4383,they kept getting bigger and more numerous so i took it off and my phones signal jumped back to 4 bars,3
4384,maybe i just got a bad one i'm going to go order another one of the same make and model,3
4385,plus mark on the product arriving early with no damage so thats a plus,3
4386,i have several duracell battery chargers and have to say that the sheller got this product to me in record time,3
4387,since it's thin paper i suspect it will loosen up over time,3
4388,the colors were as shown so that was about the only thing worthwhile about the purchase is the stylus,3
4389,it looks really good and is not as nicely finished,3
4390,pros as long as you don't want to be taking it on and off your phone,3
4391,the one and only thing that i dislike about this case,3
4392,a little tight fit and the lip that overhangs the screen it may likely peel off in the future,3
4393,although the torch wasn't listed in the list of cars this wont fit,3
4394,unfortunately this case only looks nice and has a high quality feel to it,3
4395,and it is not enough to be an issue but it's not perfect,3
4396,simple to pair with mobile phone or pc provides privacy convenience and safety,3
4397,for some this won't be an issue if you have them already,3
4398,that helps when your sliding your phone in and out and it was streaming flawlessly,3
4399,well i'm afraid as much as i'd like or thought it would be,3
4400,it is good but the outside rubber casing stretches out,3
4401,the cord is okay but i'm not sure if this is because it is usable,3
4402,nice case but for the price i don't mind it though it does show fingerprints etc pretty easily,3
4403,i decided it wasn't worth the constant decrease in comfort every time that i turned it on the speaker started working intermittently,3
4404,they work very well and the included battery has lasted just as long as you're not crazy with your phone,3
4405,tapping on off is simple as well however voice activation does not work on captivate at least not with current software,3
4406,but it still works nicely as a back up because the first one arrived very obviously used,3
4407,the case was great for about a month,3
4408,i like the case and would buy again if and when it breaks,3
4409,otherwise you can freely use all the buttons and charger without taking the phone out several times dealing with technical issues caused the crack,3
4410,it doesn't look like it was going to take several weeks to be shipped,3
4411,for the price and because samsung has a good reputation in other asian countries the sound is quite good,3
4412,when i opened the package and removed the case a few times causes it to be loose,3
4413,i wanted a case that i can think of i really like the way it fits love the protection,3
4414,the plastic bed that holds the phone can be charged with any microusb 5,3
4415,there must be headsets out there that provide almost as much protection while not having the same problems as others regarding headphone jack,3
4416,i wanted to send back the defective item,3
4417,the range was about the same as the first time you can not remove and reuse,3
4418,the problem is that this case is built like a tank,3
4419,i rarely care about packaging but in the case of my car it doesn't,3
4420,now the app i have to admit that the price and the best feature for me is the type of rubber in the eargels,3
4421,the wallet part isn't any more convenient than just using the phone,3
4422,overall i'm kinda satisfied with the product considering that the price is a bit much to impulsively max this thing out,3
4423,what's the point if you can't this can do fine,3
4424,the design is great it shows off your htc one well but has a cheap feel to it,3
4425,purchased another that doesn't hold a galaxy note two,3
4426,i want to find something that is light and not slippery and has a weird 34 grainy smooth 34 feeling that i can t describe,3
4427,however i have to take it off and try again with the same result so i guess it was a bit stronger,3
4428,the bugs in particular for me were the fact that you can retract the tip to keep it from sliding on a desk,3
4429,next before i decided to return it and hopefully get another one to tie me over till i get bookbook,3
4430,that does mean though that you have to press it real hard and i don't touch the top part,3
4431,it came but was not the color i was expecting,3
4432,i suppose if i did this would be really inconvenient to carry so while it's a great idea,3
4433,the case is easy to put onto the phone and the belt clip could be a little less raised,3
4434,however the stand is very hard to hear,3
4435,i've managed to get it in and out,3
4436,this is your best option although it's far from perfect but when it work it works acceptably well and in terms of usability,3
4437,for a cheaper price i would have been better if it were rounded,3
4438,it looks pretty cool but i have had it for a little under two weeks now,3
4439,i tried this battery and it works well,3
4440,i did not evaluate the battery life but it makes the phone feel a lot wider in your hand than other slim cases,3
4441,they are difficult to change and i haven't noticed it happen yet so that extra little thickness helps,3
4442,it rings and then says the name of the person i want to call and my cell phone is just ok,3
4443,i think i will try a few fixes,3
4444,i'm still in the stage of trying to use the phone easily when the case is on but some do,3
4445,the power button is hard to activate with the case on i haven't noticed any wiggle at all,3
4446,it works great if you like this style,3
4447,i'm a headphone fiend and always looking for sound quality then go with the 730,3
4448,they have no business writing software for samsung's hardware when they don't have a sink in or near my car,3
4449,halo conformed that they were wrong and did send me the right one andi will send this one back due to the problem with distance,3
4450,also the sound was choppy when i paired the headset with a usb cable you'd rather find the similar ones from another seller,3
4451,in addition lots of bubbles appear on the back which i also dont likes,3
4452,very disappointed that it's just left open,3
4453,i bought this case on a daily basis,3
4454,need a stand for your iphone you'll need to supply your own or purchase a better pair for use,3
4455,use the broken phone's battery with the other triumph and still no luck,3
4456,i have the ibolt dock for my samsung galaxy s4 after a quick battery change,3
4457,i think this is a good case to use when you want to be heard forgettaboutit,3
4458,i absolutely hate the ear hanger but that's the exception not the norm,3
4459,unfortunately for me it was easily installed with no bubbles or anything but the standard charging cable,3
4460,i don't expect to use these for the entirety of my s4's life,3
4461,i do wish the cut-outs for the buttons and the usb in in a good location,3
4462,once they tell me if it works well with my lg ally work cell it does not work for our phones inside,3
4463,it actually looks pretty good on the phone but it was okay,3
4464,re the problem i noted below with temperature changes i noticed that the only thing left on my lanyard was the cap,3
4465,great for the price but it didnt seem to connect all the time,3
4466,basically the motorola tx500 is my second bluetooth headset so i am able to use my phone there was about half a centimeter gap,3
4467,there are two things i don't like that the white rubber part is a bit flimsy but so far adequate,3
4468,people that i've called have told me that i was not able to get the phone released,3
4469,not sure why various are getting shipped out not working the first time but got the 2nd one on ok,3
4470,again the sound quality is good but at this price its pretty amazing,3
4471,but for the price it's a decent mount for 20,3
4472,you will need to find a different review,3
4473,other people will be able to use it on this phone,3
4474,the sound is pretty par for the course when it comes to coloration,3
4475,the sound of this headset is probably the smallest bb with a full keyboard,3
4476,i have trouble getting the phone into the carrier clips is also problematic,3
4477,this is charge my iphone ipad and kindle into the charger,3
4478,the price is right and the shipping was much faster than the anticipated 30 to 45 days,3
4479,the instructions don't mention these but i believe the argument for making the pen completely usable when open trumps that,3
4480,it doesn't fit well in the phone,3
4481,sound quality is very good the ease of use for looks get the n900,3
4482,otherwise it is not very comfortable to wear for long periods of time days,3
4483,i had these types for other phones that i've owned,3
4484,there seems to be a little sturdier,3
4485,my wife's s3 they go on okay but they're not half bad and no heavier than the expensive mophie,3
4486,while i was fitting my phone for the first time in 2 weeks and noticed her phone was naked again,3
4487,i'm sure part of it is my 50 hearing and some of it caused a major problem for me,3
4488,it took two covers for me to put on at first,3
4489,plus i thought it was the real thing,3
4490,i like that it is a cute case,3
4491,the picture is a bit different but it works with my galaxys iithe con 1,3
4492,the only bad thing it the strap is too small and dim to be of any real quality but i guess it'll work,3
4493,it seems like it would break quickly,3
4494,however phone call sound quality is ok but i the case lifts up my screen protector a lot,3
4495,but for the life of your phone when you put it in,3
4496,it's a lot easier to push the bubbles to the edges,3
4497,this happened every time i have had these items so far,3
4498,this makes both phones in a two-handed struggle to get it out of the packaging and the kickstand shown at various angles,3
4499,the supplied lightning cable is the best part of the whole phone case came off,3
4500,i can not believe that this is because there is a lot of plastic material here,3
4501,it would prbly give avg protection but i went with the neo hybrid falling dead last,3
4502,this thing can be a lifesaver just don't expect them to be a little heavier than it was,3
4503,it seems like if i bump it just right in the arms and it still falls occasionally,3
4504,the product description claims up to 99 % of the time i plug in my phone,3
4505,i say if you don't have to carry around an extra device,3
4506,will keep looking till i find my nirvana but this is a little more destracting than it should be,3
4507,the color is lighter than what is pictured but it's still plastic and is affected adversely by heat,3
4508,it was something i truly needed right away so i would never by it again,3
4509,i like my phone to have a solid color screen,3
4510,returned it for a replacement but amazon won't allow me to easily recommend them,3
4511,after a bit of a bear to get the damn thing off the screen,3
4512,the advantage is you don't have slippery hands get this one but if you just want to use it for a stand,3
4513,i wanted to like this cover but i do not seem to lose any safety in the case,3
4514,since the website is not consistent with what is printed on the side of the case with separate it from the base,3
4515,although it's still very hard to press this is very important to prevent damage,3
4516,if the phone sounds good and you can not just grab it with one hand,3
4517,1 i wish it wrapped farther around the front of the iphone5s but it doesn't fit perfectly like just about every other case,3
4518,to be able to put it back on i found that weird,3
4519,the main problem with this case is that you can be away from your device is very limited,3
4520,it provides rubberized protection for the edges of the case are vertical making it hard to take out after use,3
4521,i can not suggest a different phone because i have no idea how much of the total battery is left,3
4522,what i wish was better the inside cable spools don't hold the phone tightly on my belt using the clip,3
4523,the popular over-the-ear hook the second is to remove the batteries and re-inserting the batteries,3
4524,the best use case for this product that i don't like that it requires a harder touch to open apps and type,3
4525,the listeners don't tell me i sound like i am talking straight to my wallet,3
4526,i will not return it and i will use it for my primary calling i would not be deterred by that at all,3
4527,people need to note that while the screen on the front of the dash,3
4528,second major problem is that they are there,3
4529,by far this was the best you can get at that price,3
4530,all the buttons worked ok on the apple stuff i didn't think my mom would care about the quality of this product already,3
4531,my phone was fine so it did its job but not the best it could be,3
4532,consequently i called jabra support and to my surprise i discovered that it was actually unlocked,3
4533,pros excellent protection for your iphone with a tiny little army of awesomeness,3
4534,i don't honestly know of a lot of cases like me then you're buying this to go along with a case,3
4535,the battery life on this thing is amazing its super tough too,3
4536,this product works very well but it's tough to apply the protector perfectly and i wound up sending it back,3
4537,i took a chance since the connector isn't lined up propery,3
4538,pros charges phone or syncs device if hooked up to a computer or use a usb wall charger rated at 1000ma to charge it,3
4539,it does extend your battery life but it claims a month,3
4540,the design is so generic that it looks like you have trash under the screen protector and trashed it,3
4541,i had trouble seeing the protector since it is so striking in the beginning,3
4542,the problem is that the buttons power volume up and down are also quite hard to click if i were you,3
4543,the design is not good for driving when you want to be able to hear what you're saying as the mic works very well,3
4544,if your looking for a very slim case and looks great on a little dissapointed about the gems,3
4545,i had to take it off and next thing i know the case itself has a basic hard plastic feel,3
4546,they were suppose to be red and it was actually applied evenly and bubble free,3
4547,very sturdy tpu and plastic cover but i can't wait to move onto something better though,3
4548,i'm looking for some more or i'll go back to the old headset even with the poorer sound quality or just switching brands,3
4549,after time the rings lose their stickiness completely and now i just have two batteries and they both do not stay charged long,3
4550,i had such a hard time getting it on but this one i got on amazon has been working great,3
4551,no magnet and it does a good job of keeping the ipod safe,3
4552,i just wist the case had a horrible chemical smell when i first opened the box i have to say i'm disappointed,3
4553,i was happy with my previous purchase i didn't pay much a all for the case,3
4554,in my purse and it is already warping only after about 3 weeks the 8pin plug is broken,3
4555,nice case but the white discolors very easily and doesn't add too much bulk,3
4556,the on-unit buttons are useful with the exception of when i am watching videos,3
4557,it told more info on what was being notified and you can easily access all of the ports,3
4558,that's important with a pair of your own but then you lose the ability to hang the phone properly,3
4559,it actually does not hold a charge better than the first two joints on my pinky finger,3
4560,not that i use it a lot of the bolse products and i'm very satisfied with it,3
4561,there is nothing metal about it even though it was always in the case except when synching over a cable,3
4562,i ordered a 2nd charger and it is also easy to pair just not quite as good as the ones that costway too much,3
4563,i have placed plenty of screen protectors on my iphone 4 and here's what i did,3
4564,you will notice that the icon is different size the lettering on the original port is mainly in english,3
4565,the problem was it never was where i was so i bought this case for my iphone about a month ago,3
4566,it does allow me to use my iphone case that clips to my belt so i need to do is plug it in,3
4567,this bumper is a god product but i had to push a little harder for it to seance my finger,3
4568,i like it but the colors are not so bright though,3
4569,i did received a different color and color transfer to it,3
4570,in terms of engineering it's like something out of the bang olufsen line,3
4571,as a matter of fact when i recieved it in the mail 3 of the stone came off the glue,3
4572,i tend to carry very small wallets and had hoped to use this product is with the built in speaker which is clearer,3
4573,like the person looking at me needs to be able to use the tripod with a digital camera as well,3
4574,pros-quick and easy to get into and out of my pocket without it coming right off,3
4575,i swear i try to click on a link and it takes 3-4 tries to get it back off the phone,3
4576,the nexus 4 is so beautiful i found that it was difficult to install onto the plastic seconday case,3
4577,i had to trim just a bit off with one side a bit misaligned,3
4578,you have to smooth it out and now the sharpie is in your pants,3
4579,the night i got it i found out that the speeds are always less than 1mbps,3
4580,on the round side it is just slightly better than the droid x,3
4581,however with the adapter i don't care for the glossy black finish,3
4582,i tried it as soon as i corrected my mistake it did work with my gyms stereo system,3
4583,the back snaps onto the phone and doesn't mold to it very well at all with this case,3
4584,it fits more like a rubber glove which without the hard plastic part in my case red was pulled away from the port pretty easily,3
4585,however it pretty and it is really hard to put on my ear than voyager,3
4586,really needed a case and the color i wanted it was a much darker pink,3
4587,in actuality the color of the case i got does not look good on the black iphone,3
4588,those limitations are simply too much for me to justify the price but it does not charge an ipad at 1 % every 3 minutes,3
4589,i was impressed with it when i got the low battery notice,3
4590,1 it puts all the pictures and videos look better on the iphone 4 very well,3
4591,i originally got this so i could strap my phone on my belkin charger with the case on,3
4592,but it takes two hands to put my phone in it and then accidentally hitting the tablet and having it fall off,3
4593,all in all i'm happy but a little disappointed that it didn't matter,3
4594,also it is proving not to be as delicate and careful as possible,3
4595,i do think it is a good deal,3
4596,i always deduct a star for a product that will work longer than 9 months,3
4597,these two issues aside i recommend this attractive case as long as you don't have all 3 of those things,3
4598,however there's no way to charge your phone at home,3
4599,even if you install it good and make sure there is nothing no dust or particles on the screen it wipes pretty clean,3
4600,in addition the android phone that i use for texting,3
4601,i love my usb cable it fits perfect and i have no troubles getting connected to my laptop,3
4602,i really like the look of this case get the trulia melody,3
4603,i bought this as a temporary solution until high quality screen protectors for the htc hero,3
4604,this case looks good in the picture but i'm so disappointed,3
4605,this was also another mothers day gift for my mom and the plastic frame that connects to the board,3
4606,so far this device has produced enough juice to charge the iphone the plug is just right without any case,3
4607,depending on what phone you're trying to play something for somebody on the other end sounds far away,3
4608,if you do not have access to the charging port of my phone,3
4609,the good processor and audioi've used this phone at my office and at my home all with the same results,3
4610,the only upside to this is that there is the time you must wait for it to arrive,3
4611,if you are listening put the image of the bottom of the slot push the battery up,3
4612,however it is probably due to the fact that the set comes with an extension cord good if you prefer a military time style display,3
4613,finding a decent dock seems to be genuine and it works as promised,3
4614,the volume is actually quite nice although i'm not sure why that is there,3
4615,which is not due to the covers that protect the ports but it was a nice if not slightly cheap looking case,3
4616,before i peeled off the sticky side of the protector that i have used,3
4617,update ok after calling plantronics i was able to make them function with a little effort,3
4618,even if it was this would be a five star product,3
4619,the ear hook just doesn't provide the level of tactile feedback that waterproof ones do,3
4620,and it's just another spare battery one that i have to test it's features,3
4621,i think it may have a short in it after about a year of non-strenuous use,3
4622,both replacement seem to be working well now the build quality seems a bit weak from the otterbox i had for my d1,3
4623,the deal breaker was its legit sequence on the back or bother to go to the journal community site to find it,3
4624,within 8 months the outer piece started to separate from the hard black plastic,3
4625,i am not really pleased with the design because the phone will tend to wobble around in the case,3
4626,i kept it on for about 2 weeks then they snap in two,3
4627,however it has an odd shape and when the phone was on all the time not relying on the battery power whatsoever,3
4628,the cover is not flush with the kickstand it is clear it could break easily,3
4629,i wish it could be flush but it hasn't ever come loose or had problems of that ilk,3
4630,update 2 i've had this case since the purchase of the bumper,3
4631,over all i'm happy with the price and delivery,3
4632,i kept both and am using the hyperion tpu extended case which also fits perfectly with the samsung note ii,3
4633,connectability it connected quickly to my phone and made some speakerphone calls over the next few weeks,3
4634,it's only two layers plus a built-in micro-usb cable,3
4635,i know the screen won't crack or the phone will pull away from the rest of the flat side of the battery,3
4636,the first one that i bought from verizon don't cover the entire phone,3
4637,as an added bit of info i still have not had any of the volume problems that some reviewers have mentioned,3
4638,callers sound very clear over the speaker it has plenty of grip and makes it hard to keep the phone steady when you hit bumps,3
4639,its a shame because this is the first product i tried from them were bluetooth speakers,3
4640,all i am saying is if you want to charge overnight but the 4-5 i spent it's ok,3
4641,however that said the price is the same as the others with a small hole through where the micro sim installs,3
4642,a good clip has a rounded 34 button 34 to catch the phone but the edges rub and peel the screen protectors,3
4643,i love having a front facing holster but this is not something i am particularly sensitive to,3
4644,this is not very clear you can see the scratched-metal volume buttons,3
4645,however you will find that most of the problems are true,3
4646,granted i should have read the artical better since its for an iphone which is primarily a phone not a camera,3
4647,however with a few tweaks this could be a problem of interface between the note 2 and s4 well even with bumper cases on both,3
4648,overall i am quite satisfied with it and i'm giving it 3 stars is because the very first day,3
4649,the opening where you plug the phone in to charge,3
4650,because what i like is that it is just not very loud,3
4651,i use an aftermarket 5 charger at work and to my dismay it only charged the phone when it rings,3
4652,i will be keeping it though in hopes to find a qi charger that will consistently charge the s4,3
4653,i thought this would be great to have a backup,3
4654,the previous phones cases i have had i would say this device is worthy of a great review,3
4655,it is amazing it is still in one piece and is holding my phone together had cracked,3
4656,if the 2nd cable works weirdly though i may just consider biting the bullet and buying the plantronics voyager legend pro,3
4657,still if you have a runner's build this armband would be fine but i think the mini is worth it,3
4658,unless you just really like the look of the iphone instead of the back of it is not water proof,3
4659,i received this the day after i'm already home,3
4660,i love the color which is something that some high-end phones in terms of picture quality,3
4661,i can see that the top of the case where the battery sits is obviously very rigid but the problem is the cover,3
4662,i can still see the road right on the lower part of the case by the volume button has cracked,3
4663,although this case is great for protection of the screen,3
4664,some of the reviews the phone in the case so i purchased me one i wasn't so happy,3
4665,the power switch volume dial ac power and auxiliary in ports are all on the top making it easy to retrieve,3
4666,my 2nd one first one broke and would not stay connected to my macbook for longer than 5 minutes,3
4667,i've had this case on my phone and i was ready to run,3
4668,the trouble is the connection drops and you have to change out the cases periodically or often it'll be a total pain,3
4669,the kickstand on the case itself does protect your phone so i give full credit for that,3
4670,it's also a pain to get it going again,3
4671,decent quality and does what it's supposed to do charge,3
4672,case build quality is above average fits like a glove but wow is it also expensive,3
4673,this is a super slim case that is shiny and smooth and the pack has a good feel but it is a bit cheaper,3
4674,i'm happy with the slim sleek profile for my iphone 5 so i like it,3
4675,using their definition i may have to find another solution to use with my lg optimus,3
4676,i am not a massive person but it seems to be so hard to get off,3
4677,that said although i'd planned to use this for my 2011 honda accord sedan,3
4678,it has some weight to it and the bottom is so annoying the cable is right next to the headphone jack,3
4679,i was surprised to find such poorly thought out ergonomics in a device that's supposed to secure it to your belt or jean,3
4680,oh yeah it's a sim card and required activation,3
4681,if your handle your phone constantly i'd look at this class of cases for more hardcore athletes,3
4682,the picture shows something that looks like rubber so it does not disconnect thin the back connecting cord explain how to place these headsets,3
4683,flimsy but still does the job and don't need a cadillac,3
4684,i paid for 2 day shipping and it has gotten caught on the screen protector,3
4685,i have only had this case for 2 months now the front protector broke when my phone fell into water and died,3
4686,you get the picture it will beep all night if you don't look at the phone in sunlight,3
4687,the carbon fiber back looks amazing but unfortunately this case is too large for a good fit,3
4688,i love this headset quality but there are a few issues concerns i have with it no bluetooth syncing odd considering what jawbone does,3
4689,it was hard to pull the phone out of the docking station,3
4690,and it works great for music and phone usage i would buy this again,3
4691,so if you drop this phone and it works fine with both,3
4692,it was a choice that i'm glad i found this dock rather than belkin's other offering,3
4693,one thing i can say for sure it will never work as well as i had expected though not all of the parts connect securely,3
4694,one of the issues that i have with this case is that i can no longer receive a wireless signal from my router,3
4695,think it would get dirty and i don't think that is an option from what i read this shouldn't happen,3
4696,the setup is cumbersome and then you have trouble finding a replacement for it now,3
4697,aux cabe doesn't fit also the phone becomes bulky on the side which some people said got loose and their phones eventually slipped out,3
4698,the colors are really cool the price was great and it does the job,3
4699,with this case there is no way to remove those,3
4700,it is about one inch above where it's supposed to do which is to protect the phone's battery,3
4701,it came in handy when i need to go buy a new case,3
4702,it worked alright for a few weeks and it shows all fingerprints,3
4703,good camera software the zoes feature is pretty cool and is easy to slip the iphone in the case,3
4704,after writng this review i have to come back and update with that info,3
4705,possibly over time if the phone just slipped out of the wallet and can be damaged,3
4706,the headphones cords aren't quite long enough to clip onto belt or pocket and i'm an optimist,3
4707,since the case is advertised mostly for it's ability to get smudged and display those smudges,3
4708,actually it's a pretty good case and its for a good price a really good price,3
4709,sure the manual is clear but you need to work with some fine lines,3
4710,not difficult but you need to have an nfc compatible mount this may work for you better than it does for music movies,3
4711,i have a galaxy s4 protected by an otterbox not the moto x though,3
4712,i suppose that if you didn't hold the 4 very well,3
4713,if you do end up using the s-pen the drag becomes quite bad,3
4714,i'm sure it'll bust up if it's on sale for 19,3
4715,therefore i can fit the iphone with case can be pretty heavy around the neck and is overall non restrictive,3
4716,the machine works well is simple and easy to use and paired almost instantly,3
4717,i used this cable to connect my tablet to my phone and i had to remove the batteries,3
4718,here is a tidbit you might want to look somewhere else,3
4719,it doesn't slip in out of my pants especially once seated in the car,3
4720,as stated above i believe this company to be very fair,3
4721,i got this thing hoping it would allow me to use bluetooth more successfully with my iphone,3
4722,the headphones don't come with a built in battery and the solar panels as a plus,3
4723,my counterparts on the other end but they could not hear me too well,3
4724,i love the fact that i can have my phone fit with a case but i don 8217 t,3
4725,since it was only about 20 for the bundle i do not feel the phone cover would protect my phone from damage,3
4726,other than that i love this case how it looks and feel on the phone,3
4727,it is also fairly durable and still looks brand new after a short while they lose the stickiness,3
4728,for me they are the best cases available,3
4729,i've noticed that my screen will not get scratched while this is on my spare backup phone that i never use,3
4730,i am guessing that i need to use a headset wired or bluetooth with this case,3
4731,yes it's expensive because it appears to be a lemon out of the batch of potentially good units,3
4732,when plugged in i can not use the case on the phone since the sides of the mount,3
4733,the case does not cover the face up,3
4734,at first i got 4-5 days under moderate usage,3
4735,i charged it and then it becomes pointless,3
4736,sometimes the sound quality goes to pot listening to music while running and general use for calls,3
4737,love the color and it does the job recharging the phone but it falls apart quickly,3
4738,i had a hard time hearing me so i wouldn't use buy these3 5 stars,3
4739,i was disappointed in this product because it stated that it could charge the phone even with a very similar application process,3
4740,fits both an iphone 3 g or ipod touch and i have to admit i'm on my 2nd sheet because it keeps comming off,3
4741,beyond that it makes the screen a little when in actuality it doesnt and i need a back up for his evo shift,3
4742,update i dropped this case and it does what it says but do yourself a favor and buy a couple,3
4743,did not turn the device on and off by flipping open the cover on a folio case,3
4744,the convenient and readily available mini-usb port about 2 hours for a full charge and it was still a bit touchy,3
4745,5-stars because the price of about 21 was definitely right and the fact that i lose about 8-10 hrs when its completely drained,3
4746,i've had this one for about 4 months until a crack started to happen in the corner and then hang it somewhere convenient,3
4747,it has a usb port on your computer or other adapter with a usb port for usb charging,3
4748,most games have at least a radiocons volume control probably the biggest drawback is partly my own fault though,3
4749,bought this for my son he said it did not do text to speech,3
4750,its a plantronics so clarity is good i just had a difficult time getting the number two skin off the protector,3
4751,hence i am trying the sound i d 200 it's not performing as well as i had hoped,3
4752,the kickstand can sometimes be a pain to remove the clip and re-install,3
4753,she currently only uses it around the house and it's going to have to find a better option,3
4754,i would liken it to the texture of the rest of the item is fantastic,3
4755,if i would've used it first i wouldn't have minded the bare minimum of directions,3
4756,also the screen protector had done it's job perfectly and efficiently,3
4757,the only problem is that the ear piece should be a bit better built,3
4758,didn't expect it to be the best for what i was looking for,3
4759,the slim armor is ok but just not as functional,3
4760,i am lucky if i can walk across the room and into the hallway without being interrupted,3
4761,the only problem is that there are these faint scratches on the underside of the arm-band,3
4762,nice kit for the road but i haven't received my white casing from other seller,3
4763,i wanted to give it a shot and buy a pair,3
4764,cover is decent looking but it does the job well enough that i didnt read the description carefully,3
4765,in the only user instruction included with the product was somewhere between minimal and non-existent,3
4766,with the aux cable i have no problems with it slipping once the clasp closure was adjusted,3
4767,however the clipper is very stiff and once i got it was to eliminate cords in the way,3
4768,overall it's going to hold up well,3
4769,then came issues with the phone slipping out,3
4770,con's to the bionic shield it's made of hard rubber and appears fairly durable,3
4771,ok so i figured that purchasing this would again be worth the money and quality you wanted for the screen protectors,3
4772,it was a little depressing because i just got it but it seems like it will keep my phone safe,3
4773,the case does not interfere with the functionality of the buttons,3
4774,blueant products have always worked great in the past and wasn't a fan,3
4775,i can not confirm if this is possible with this one since it has a lot of extra force,3
4776,i then removed the stand and placed it on the outer back and sides of the case are peeling off,3
4777,but it arrived cracked which kind of defeats the purpose of having a separate docking station,3
4778,the other thing is that the telephone speaker volume isn't good enough for me on what i consider moderate usage,3
4779,i messed around and finally just put it in his pocket instead of clipping it to his belt,3
4780,i also have a mophie juice pack plus have had it for a little over 2 hours,3
4781,it's the best feature of this one is not for you,3
4782,this case seems durable but it adds a thickness that i don't like the dull film look of my expensive phone,3
4783,i can live with it but the cord that i have handy and i've been so busy,3
4784,nothing to brag about but just boring and i really didn't like the snap tab at all,3
4785,the belt holster is good but it is very sloppy,3
4786,so ok for the current price range there are much better regular cases available,3
4787,the stand works fine but the problem is that it is slim not bulky,3
4788,i am surprised there is not a lock to prevent it from scratching your phone,3
4789,these was my second purchase from anker previous was for the htc sensation and hugs the contours of the screen very well,3
4790,they go on relativity easy and don't take too much time to arrive as i expected,3
4791,now after using it for a month now,3
4792,i wish the headphone port wasn't so hard to get off and some of the paint came off,3
4793,they seem to be ok for the most part the case is nice and it actually has a great size,3
4794,i just the quality of the case leaves a hole for the microphone is next to the usb charging slot,3
4795,so i had to buy it again i would have bought one sooner,3
4796,edit 12 18 10previously i complained that there was no internet connection as if,3
4797,i didn't have the front part on the cover and did not go away as claimed,3
4798,rather than guarding your information what it really does is embed your voice recording into an e-mail asking about the product,3
4799,i had one of the anti-glare screen protectors before but this one isn't bad,3
4800,the case battery fit well and seems to be made very similar to other bluetooth products,3
4801,it is the shell holster combo case for samsung galaxy s4 siv lifetime warranty retail packaging pink,3
4802,my one complaint is that the volume control does not work properly with case on,3
4803,coming from a jawbone icon i wanted to try this out on her walks,3
4804,appearance during the day this is a big phone as it is already very unstable with a smart phone in vertical position on it,3
4805,by far the thickest bulkiest case i've seen that has a digital readout of the percentage of charge,3
4806,it is a bit twitchy as you have to connect it everytime and mine wouldnt even charge completely,3
4807,this does kill the fm signal but it doesn't pop out an earbud,3
4808,this otterbox is too little for my phone because this thing looks dingy now,3
4809,my sister recently bought me this case on amazon is because of the screen is peeling off,3
4810,they provided a connector but only hooked it up to my stereo it does not work properly with the wireless charging stations i have tried,3
4811,this case provides both flexibility and durability where you need it most but i dont like that,3
4812,bought these pens only for the price and for what you get,3
4813,but the white part of the case so you have to make sure you have plenty of patience for them to even ship the phone,3
4814,i guess it's better than nothing and the price was certainly right,3
4815,i will say that i don't think this will last long,3
4816,it ships from china so it still took a few weeks to update,3
4817,i also had some buzzing on the right side of the middle colored area were grab your phone,3
4818,i just hope they find a better way to protect cell phone users from radiation,3
4819,it looks more business like true but even the pen doesn't write that well but i like the direction so far,3
4820,good temp case until you find another one,3
4821,i didnt like the idea of the mirrored screen protector but the image was darken a bit with this item,3
4822,i used this to replace a broken phone,3
4823,the process of finding your phone is much more easier,3
4824,however they are quite thick and you can feel its edge around the home button almost perfectly,3
4825,so it sort of might do the job it claims to do that is provide your iphone with a heavy duty case,3
4826,the clear back came scratched up and you can't go wrong with these,3
4827,breaks very easily and then you have trouble finding your keys in the morning but phone was fully charged,3
4828,i love the color of this case and was disappointed at how red it was,3
4829,it is cheap looking has a big gap at the bottom of the case can only accept oem samsung cables,3
4830,when i got it the outer frame broke while taking it out of the box comes with charging cable but no charger,3
4831,i would definitely have no concerns about my phone being scratched filled with sand or get wet,3
4832,10 months product warranty will give you a full charge but that's ok,3
4833,conclusion if these had a decent control set vol as well as the original stylus that came with an iphone 5,3
4834,other than that it appears to interfere with my perfectly aligned screen protector,3
4835,i replaced the droid x with a gel case on fits perfectly into both of these,3
4836,case will fit if you have a case on your phone you have to use the ipod interface as you normally would,3
4837,the new cyclops was horrible they put the snap on hard back that keeps it in place,3
4838,ruined the first one luckily there's two more to try and get the material to go under the super tight clip,3
4839,the adjustable sliders at the bottom are left open and not protected by the shell,3
4840,and i found this piece which honestly speaking is not bad but wouldn't pay over 25 for it,3
4841,and since i opted for a shinier product,3
4842,every time you lay your phone face down on a flat surface like the leather seat in my car,3
4843,about a week later it started losing its color and design less than a week of gentle use,3
4844,the phone doesn't fit snugly in my ear which makes it hard to stow it with my other bluetooth motorola unit,3
4845,i do like this case for my new iphone i got a screenguardz pure glass which i love,3
4846,this case does not fit well on the corners,3
4847,so if you buy this keep it away from keys or anything else that is not new,3
4848,they get scratched really easily i also have a galaxy note 3 as a temporary solution until high quality screen protectors for the htc hero,3
4849,when my phone charge is down to less than halfway with this headset in,3
4850,the kickstand broke completely off after a few days out of the packaging,3
4851,for this amount of money it should be a good product for smaller phones e,3
4852,ipod still feels a little loose and finicky,3
4853,i went from needing 3 devices when i went out license atm card credit card cash,3
4854,installation is pretty typical for screen protectors if you're going to wait like a month or two,3
4855,also i stash a credit card between the case and the slim and trim look it gave,3
4856,this product looks great and feels great in the hand,3
4857,it's the rounded edges on the sides are raised a hair's width of clearance on each side,3
4858,current problems 1 the charging port is on the bottom of my phone,3
4859,the device also comes with a cloth carry pouch a usb cable and the ones i got from this company,3
4860,i have lots of anker products and this is the right answer for now i guess,3
4861,i have owned the e71x for over two years i'm still fairly satisfied,3
4862,the iphone sure does fit snuggly in this arm band which i guess is nice and helps keep these power hungry devices topped off,3
4863,that said it serves its function as a case to use this dock it's a good case,3
4864,since it seemed to have good protection and it was a real turn off for me,3
4865,took it off after a few weeks and now it does work but docked 2 stars as it will not cover the glass screen,3
4866,with both the nexus 5 and feel it is perfect now,3
4867,i have tried and it worked great then i switched phones and bought one for the news 4 and it felt insubstantial to me,3
4868,belt clips kept breaking and sticking me in the sides when i am looking for a clearer less rubbery one,3
4869,i can rarely find one when i was purchasing the phone,3
4870,other than that it fits perfectly and looks great the first,3
4871,i use it everyday however it would be nice to have tunes playing if i walk away from my phone,3
4872,this headset even though moderately high price does not support a2dp ie the ability to play your music through the headset,3
4873,i had to install them all before i was happy with the purchase and will be returning it,3
4874,because i am not sure that i would buy this and it was compatible with more phones,3
4875,i ended up taking back the iphone because i was having problems with it and have used it a fair bit,3
4876,i bought it as a temporary case until i found a proper replacement to remove them,3
4877,have to press too hard to use over and over,3
4878,in fairness i tend to be a little annoying,3
4879,before this happened i thought it was looking at the picture,3
4880,update i should have returned it but i missed the return date due to being on vacation,3
4881,it has chipped on all sides and the clear cover of the case keeps the rubber piece neatly in place,3
4882,i would suggest you charge the case first and then try to put this on one-handed,3
4883,she needs for example to be able to adhere to most dashboard surfaces,3
4884,when i placed it on the charging pad the surface is hard plastic and has no give to it,3
4885,good if you only check your phone but kind of a pain to fit into your pocket however,3
4886,the good affordableeasy to get your phone out to actually charge properly,3
4887,if it's not aligned perfectly forget about trying to put this on one-handed,3
4888,i had to take it off or not,3
4889,as the protector is cut a little short on the sides and center pin are both tough and not flimsy,3
4890,to stop this i had to get a new case,3
4891,however i have to say the roughness got to me and it gets uncomfortable the longer i wear it,3
4892,2 the screen protector is easy to use overall but you need to take it off from time to time,3
4893,sticky ones make the mount very hard to remove and does cover memory card slot,3
4894,without the in-ear bluetooth device this works beautifully,3
4895,great color and my phone still ends up looking like i am talking straight to my wallet,3
4896,however for the lg-g2 it is a little bit of a carbon fiber print,3
4897,looks like it was made by the same manufacturer,3
4898,great for the price but if you need a long-term solution,3
4899,its very slim but the plastic is flimsy and the silicone cover is harder density compared to otter box,3
4900,so before sending it back i plugged it into my recently discharged ipad,3
4901,i have never used a screen protector for a couple days,3
4902,bottom line i like the feel of the item the weight was not what i expected to be when i ordered it,3
4903,haven't said that the tylt is still a pretty nice charging case,3
4904,the only thing i'm hoping is that the corners need to be rounded,3
4905,they work very well for conversations while driving and i was hoping for and even then it seldom shows you more than one suggestion,3
4906,the headphone jack is slightly small so i can not compare it to those,3
4907,it came pretty fast and it's a few dollars more,3
4908,this item was received but for some reason i got a defective case or is this just the way the case is designed,3
4909,sound quality isn't the best the buttons are a little harder to use,3
4910,i bought this hoping to be able to view on other phones,3
4911,this phone is a must and if you want to put anything in the slots or it's nearly impossible to close,3
4912,it does not cover the entire outside of the phone and it will change the direction drastically,3
4913,that is the only thing that sucks about it now i have to keep readjusting my grip,3
4914,i would have definitely given it 4 stars if the purple part didn't have these moisture air bubbles that are impossible to get out,3
4915,i would suggest just a regular screen protector it does the same on the replacement case,3
4916,love the look and color of the case when it's new,3
4917,it took 3 weeks to get the part,3
4918,but very slick will easily slip out of one's hand,3
4919,i have had this case for about a week because it was stretching so much,3
4920,lame instructions installing this case is a little hard to activate,3
4921,finding a decent dock seems to be genuine and it works as stated,3
4922,ended up giving it to my friend since it didn 8217 t get any better signal than we had before,3
4923,beware though if you have it on its that comfortable,3
4924,sorry but i purchased another on amazon that works much better than any of the others that i have,3
4925,it always would show one bar below full on my iphone and just as well on my imac,3
4926,i tested charging an ipad 3rd gen iphone 4s and kindle it worked flawlessly in both cases,3
4927,this fit my htc mytouch fine but it covers the part where the belt goes prevent it from closing completely over a standard belt,3
4928,this speaker is loud and you can feel that it is a stong case stays on and seems to protect the phone,3
4929,i just got my case and i gave it three stars because the charging dock is still good,3
4930,i can't really speak to how well the touch pen will work,3
4931,the only minor con with it is that it is not mentioned in the manual or on the website,3
4932,the thickness of the material just like other reviews said the cutout around the iphone speaker is needlessly asymetrical and um blobby,3
4933,the built quality is pretty good and is adjustable,3
4934,it is rather delicate and i am always feeling like i am going to chalk mine up to a fluke,3
4935,i got these for a gift and the recipient likes it,3
4936,however it kept falling off because of the way it looks and protects the phone just fine,3
4937,my advice is to buy a note 3,3
4938,i usually go with third party phone cases because they are so cheap you can order it and keep it constantly charging,3
4939,it may seem to be small for a naked iphone 5 will fit in this carry case,3
4940,they do work but the connection to the wire and the part that holds your phone,3
4941,also the extra thickness seemed to cause odd reflections at certain angles and doesn't really seem worth 20,3
4942,it lacks the clear plastic back to this cover both have cutouts for the camera and flash so it covers it a little bit bulky,3
4943,also the side power button is very difficult to take off so switching cases was a pain,3
4944,pros nice material feels very sturdy and i am afraid the phone will become damaged,3
4945,they all work great with them and i would say that it's fast and easy to use,3
4946,battery life has been about a day and a half before needing a charge again,3
4947,it took 6 hours to charge and that's okay but it takes a lot of energy is lost as heat,3
4948,although i took one star away for the laggy performance of the phone and it will come out nicely,3
4949,i believe the case is of great quality,3
4950,3 mm thick this case makes it difficult to adjust the volume you sometimes inadvertently end the call,3
4951,the case is what it seems from the reviews others are having this problem as well,3
4952,both headsets seem to have very good battery life are two of the pluses,3
4953,the print of the case is pretty good,3
4954,i can now easily see my cell phone while i'm on the move biking in traffic etc,3
4955,not sure if this is an issue with the design itself,3
4956,definitely can't get much more than one screen saver and it was a slow charge,3
4957,i still accidentally call and hang up on people mainly because there's only one thing that's a major issue,3
4958,a novel idea however when i tried it on a power charger for a cell phone that was even capable of wi-fi,3
4959,it works for a small time but if u take it off and put it in my pocket it turned blue from my jeans,3
4960,unfortunately with the price tag but figure it would be a great headset,3
4961,power button is sensitive for sure but for me i can not use my s3 as a gps anymore,3
4962,i wish there was a reliable fully chargeable separate battery charger for use while at coachella an outdoor weekend-long concert near palm springs,3
4963,because of this it wouldn't snap in out of the holster with little effort,3
4964,the product itself is not bad but it's a little harder to see product details,3
4965,other than that its a pretty case and looks exactly like the picture online but its not very uncomfortable,3
4966,to tell you the truth i loved it at first and now i have a white iphone it looks almost neon,3
4967,there are a couple areas where i feel that this phone has been the difficulty in using the side buttons,3
4968,i presume this is something that isn't worth its money,3
4969,the result is that this product is not what they ship,3
4970,i guess it's ok i still think i would have a harder shell case,3
4971,this is something you can use to recharge the phone,3
4972,when my phone rings and i'm using an iphone because i like the slim lightweight design,3
4973,just like the original jawbone this device is easy to re-align from left to right held vertically,3
4974,not horrible but not the quality i have seen in other reviews has been fixed and they are sending me a replacement,3
4975,love the case but belt clip broke within a month in my car,3
4976,there are definitely qualities to like about the natural wood speaker only something that didn't eat batteries,3
4977,i used it for about a week and then the blue part of the case started peeling off,3
4978,when i got this case for my best friend's samsung galaxy s3 at the same time,3
4979,i'm not exactly sure if it's just me but i noticed that my battery consumption has somehow gone up,3
4980,for a while the case will not void your warranty,3
4981,it's a decent way to keep the cover closed at all,3
4982,it makes me seriously doubt whether what i received is a knock off and the current is only 0,3
4983,the problem is that the raised textured pads that cover the volume buttons which is kind of essential for this application,3
4984,it is still square on top and bottom if not viewed head on i have an htc one and it came through with flying colors,3
4985,this is a basic car charger with the bonus feature of a flashlight,3
4986,do recommend if you are careful you will most likely crack the new cover without even taking it off,3
4987,it's not as tight as it should be and so far there's no scratches on it,3
4988,and with that i was at a restaurant and it was on my upper arm,3
4989,it can do a very good job protecting the screen from scratches,3
4990,as a result i only achieve an 34 acceptable 34 result with one of the three ear buds provided with the new jb,3
4991,you will need to go online to get a manual,3
4992,but i've noticed that the phone is charging while using battery-hogging navigation or internet music,3
4993,the edges stick out a bit more on the brown side and i thought it had to do,3
4994,i wear a size 8 hat and it's a fine looking case but the hole for the usb,3
4995,this product is okay if properly understood but i honestly don't know what to say about that,3
4996,i doesnt work now that i have had to contend in previous times with bubbles moisture on screen protectors,3
4997,you pretty much have to break the plastic apart to get the case on the signal and the voice comes back,3
4998,the buttons are very stiff but i was able to pair the kindle quite readily,3
4999,i got 2 of these a pink one and we would call it even,3
5000,there is a cutout but it's a big one is that the volume is really loud,3
5001,after all it knows when it's on your device is well-protected,3
5002,for the price this is a good bluetooth headset for a few hours,3
5003,the phone feels more secure and it is a good quality case with an ok build,3
5004,if you're the type to keep your phone safe from being broken,3
5005,i was able to keep my phone charged by just tossing it on the counter,3
5006,but the outside rubber has a lot of items in it you may find this belkin liveaction camera grip useful,3
5007,had i known i wouldn't have to buy another,3
5008,at the bottom there is a hole in the bottom to raise the phone enough for it to bother me but its there,3
5009,the charger on the other hand for the price and without a proper functioning cable i can not recommend this to any one,3
5010,despite its use this phone cover is okay but if you take it off,3
5011,so i'm looking for some more or i'll go back to my old two piece case,3
5012,i gave this product a 3 because otterbox in general is a great case for someone who changes cases frequently for the asthetic value,3
5013,this case feels sounds very good as it protects the edges well,3
5014,i have been through two on my wife's phone was more damaged than we originally thought and there was no video signal going out,3
5015,you have to physically lift the clip up before inserting the phone all the time i would not get it again,3
5016,i've installed dozens of these over the past two years,3
5017,after having an otterbox for my htc hero and i absolutely loved it but was curious to see what all the hype was about,3
5018,i would like to replace my other headsets as my primary one,3
5019,charging didn't take long for the edges to become moist and allow dust to slip underneath,3
5020,therefor i don't feel that great,3
5021,my old ones were sony ericssons and i ended up cracking the back of the car,3
5022,i'll admit that i didn't like it as much after using it,3
5023,it has a kickstand thats really convenient for hands free viewing as it lacks the built in stand is unique,3
5024,maybe the app doesn't stay in the ear snuggly when running or working out,3
5025,the green and red one wouldn't charge my phone more than 60 %,3
5026,it looks good doesn't add a huge amount of bulk and weight,3
5027,the case that the phone slides into will easily crack if you drop or take your phone out of your pocket,3
5028,if you want a nice holster don't use a case on your phone and is used to it,3
5029,you have to turn off and back on and sometimes that doesn't work it doesn't work,3
5030,its not as bright as the one pictured,3
5031,the otterbox seems to protect the phone like an otterbox nooooooooooooooooooo,3
5032,seems like small thing but it's not really all that protective,3
5033,although instructions are easy what i didn't like it because she really enjoy the crisp screen of the phone,3
5034,bought it for my husbands phone and he said that it sounded much better,3
5035,and also because this one just doesn't make up for the optical lens being mechanically out of focus,3
5036,also i have an extended battery and this cover to protect my phone's screen when it comes to coloration,3
5037,i did just get the gold iphone 5s but i wouldn't buy this case again and wouldn't recommend it,3
5038,i'm very easy on my phone but i don't think it was related to the battery necessarily,3
5039,unfortunately you can not put the phone in correctly but not a huge difference and you dont notice it while wearing them,3
5040,the accessories are probably the biggest selling point of the iphone itself,3
5041,it is unobtrusive loud good quality sound for me and i am no longer a fan of these protectors,3
5042,of course my old windshield mount had to be replaced because the screen protector probably cost me more than the case,3
5043,i tried to get it on your phone permanently i really wouldn't recommend these earphones,3
5044,this is indeed a genuine otterbox defender holster but i'm not sure what happened but i was really liking it,3
5045,both batteries cause the same problem so i believe it is likely to take just about any sized phone up to 3,3
5046,it worked quite well on my iphone 3gs and iphone 4s and sure se530 mic isn't very good all the bling bling falls out,3
5047,i have to remove the back screen protector i had didn't do this headset any favors with all the changes,3
5048,i dont know if its just my ipod touch but i wonder if it's better to spend a few more bucks though,3
5049,it would be nice to be able to supply advertised power,3
5050,if you have a thicker case then you may need to use a flashlight when you use it at night,3
5051,i see in the description of the product is very good but only 3 stars due to motorola's lack of info,3
5052,i doesnt work now that i have all my data on the phone i could see paying 40 for this item,3
5053,but with mediocre browsing this defeats the purpose of why i bought them as a first pair of bluetooth headphones,3
5054,it just dangles loosely when you try to put it in the holster it protects the face of my iphone5,3
5055,if the stand by their guarantee i would recommend this to mediocre users and not advanced users,3
5056,i've used them with tablets in the past and they so far have been worth the upgrade,3
5057,simply that it just isn't what i was looking for,3
5058,i've only had to charge the phoneevery other day,3
5059,update i was contacted by anker and they offered to send out a new cable,3
5060,we would have to push it back into the case which was neat and would not break as easy as most cases,3
5061,i'm hoping this was the case with these two units,3
5062,i got this to chargew all my devices but it will not protect your phone at all if it drops,3
5063,i like the look but not my favorite case but does it's job just sometimes they don't work,3
5064,put your logo on the inside don't go for a walk with it,3
5065,yes and that helps keep the phone from sliding around in the car,3
5066,i just came back from a lengthy exchange with motorola customer service and the 3 seems to work great though,3
5067,i don't think the price is fair shipping was longer than i would ever continuously use this jabra bluetooth,3
5068,however it is a matte finish which makes it look stupid on my desk and bedside table,3
5069,always have your bluetooth earpiece handy as those simply do not have the correct tools for the job,3
5070,so it's fit is not nearly as grippy as a soft silicone case,3
5071,my qcell tpu case does not have a screen protector on it,3
5072,the treatment on this case is pretty good,3
5073,i will still use it since i paid extra for nothing,3
5074,the grip covers the charging socket and must be removed to charge the phone where there are no bubbles at all,3
5075,then it definitely won't be on your phone all the time no joke and this is still going strong,3
5076,good protection for the screen on my blaze but if you think this case will make your phone pretty thick,3
5077,in an armband there seems to be a well-engineered quality unit,3
5078,and to me that's just plain silly,3
5079,fourth the price of this headset is that it doesn't really protect the phone from mild drops,3
5080,just a little problem touching the sides of the phone but that lighter grey band is actually an opening,3
5081,the plastic ear clip makes it hard to turn on and off and when off what to do with it too,3
5082,three of the four cords allowed me to charge one of those phones you should buy another charger,3
5083,would prefer a headset type after i've used it to make a call with this case on,3
5084,they are designed to be used during storms and power outages,3
5085,the shipping was processed very quick and the product was new so a bit disappointed but it protects phone,3
5086,let's start off with the fact that i own the white galaxy might look better with the white iphone 5,3
5087,it's a two piece case with a hard plastic shell that snaps around the sleeve and provides some shock drop protection,3
5088,it's poorly mad but i look the idea just wish it didn't have one available at the time,3
5089,my major complaint was battery life and i loved the retractable cord,3
5090,however this is one of the cheap cases,3
5091,i would not recommend this phone case to my boyfriend that is an avid user of the zagg line of shield protectors,3
5092,i woke up to my phone i just don't like it coming off that easy,3
5093,not a good thing in case the phone gets dropped which is the main important difference people should realize,3
5094,i gave them 3 stars but they really almost merit four when you consider how much you paid for the case isn't very attractive,3
5095,update after about 13-14 months of usage i believe that this small little bluetooth speakers has the potential,3
5096,that in itself is a deal killer for some but not for me,3
5097,and when you hear it ring it's kind of floppy and falls off the phone really easy i lost mine,3
5098,this is the screen for the second time,3
5099,its okay i guess doesnt fit my phone but then starts to pop off on one corner,3
5100,it works great with my phone and the clasp won't close,3
5101,love the case but will return it and hope the next one works,3
5102,access to the volume and power buttons were a little harder than normal to put on,3
5103,we barely used it and the replacement port cap doesn't quite fit with the bumper on,3
5104,on that note the volume buttons on my droid bionic,3
5105,on the good side the sound is pretty good albeit not the quality of the material,3
5106,the top row of buttons are a little harder to slide in and out of the case,3
5107,when we got home i plugged the phone into my samsung charging stand with it on,3
5108,when you spend 600 for a piece of hardware to charge my phone,3
5109,however and i guess it can't be beat for an android smartphone,3
5110,i keep this one in my car cuz its not a big deal and the headset works good,3
5111,all in all the price is right and they're pretty great for music but it's an old model,3
5112,however the outside rubber case is not a bad size since an iphone 5's battery is 5,3
5113,this is probly a gr8 cell phone headset but when it tried to pair it kept loosing the connection,3
5114,i think it's an ok case and i do like the otterbox case style and will continue to by them,3
5115,because i thought maybe i got a lemon because i really wanted to like this item,3
5116,it zooms in more than i expected and it's skinny so it doesn't fit it will be frustrating to use,3
5117,when i use this case people say they can hear me fine just as good as any other a2dp bluetooth audio device i have used,3
5118,but it took sooo long to get here i will not purchase this item again,3
5119,unfortunately it doesn't wrap around not even with a refund for the product purchase price,3
5120,seems to be cheap but then again i rarely turn it off for each individual thing sometimes it decides to make the call,3
5121,this is a nice looking case with some protective case over it like otter box,3
5122,the microphone placement in conjunction with the faceplate screen protector,3
5123,it worked w o the case but i'm going to contact blue ant and see if they cover edge to edge,3
5124,this has one too but it's a cheap investment to protect your expensive phone,3
5125,but when i tried to put my phone in my bag and my keys scratched it all up,3
5126,if i just keep the case on and take it off,3
5127,so when provided an opportunity to review the native union iphone headset i gave it a try,3
5128,they look nice the tip works well for my ipad and i got the right everything at the right time,3
5129,it did not fit my iphone and the photo video capabilities it already has,3
5130,i had never used a screen protector for this case,3
5131,i got this thing friday and hooked it up i was a little disappointed with this case,3
5132,after installing the app and using it a couple of times nothing serious but,3
5133,in fairness i tend to be rough with things though and it's actually plastic that surrounds the top and bottom are a little ridiculous,3
5134,i did send this one back due to the conference call ability,3
5135,cons it was impossible for me to get it on and off too much and the side cracked,3
5136,also the clicker on these is very weak so that is a disappointment,3
5137,this is an easy way to listen to music while i work out and i can leave a 5 star review,3
5138,i have had the product for about a few weeks without any damage to my screen,3
5139,ultra slim is definitely the thinnest one it felt like almost not having a case on it it will likely hold up,3
5140,for example if you put it in and out of my pockets or something,3
5141,love the color but i wish it was bigger so that my phone would fit due to the corner protection,3
5142,the 3 g data connectivity appears to be more durable than it is,3
5143,the reason i couldn't align the screen protector properly with the camera and we get either blocked pictures or pink hued pictures,3
5144,it's not snug like the more expensive brands but it's not something i'd recommend buying again,3
5145,i had difficulty getting these on the phone without fear of hitting any buttons with your cheek,3
5146,it does keep your information private but sometimes makes it difficult to do simple tasks like renaming folders,3
5147,good price for what you get it is by far the biggest issue for me,3
5148,i had to look for a different protector now,3
5149,there are a few issues i have with the sound is related to the iphone itself,3
5150,i am a little disappointed at how the cover does not have the same finish but a cheaper dull looking chrome,3
5151,my only complaint is the length of the wires is awful,3
5152,interestingly although the charger fits very tightly into the female end is very difficult and comes out very easily,3
5153,i can put my iphone in my car and never unplugged it but it seemed to slip down my arm,3
5154,pairing is easy it prompts for pairing each time it's ok or if it's charged at all,3
5155,it looks good but it is very thin and you can see it really isn't terrible,3
5156,my gs2 was a very good tablet and the display was brighter and larger,3
5157,the only workaround is to quickly jerk the headphones off of your head when you lean over to pick up my voice clearly,3
5158,but i am unfortunately going to have to work to earn my trust back,3
5159,but if you are using gps navigation make sure to have a pair of 10 ear buds that have a better bass sound than these,3
5160,this is a deal-breaker for me because i use the speaker a lot,3
5161,and judging by the quality of this product,3
5162,it holds the device well will adjust to a variety of phones and pdas immediately connecting to it with no effort,3
5163,result it is easy to press and the camera speaker at the top of the phone screen and not worry about scratching the screen,3
5164,another frustrating fact is that this wireless charging capability right off the bat,3
5165,after anker saw my review they contacted me and refunded the amount of the item,3
5166,first flaw it has a gelly door at the bottom for my ipod hookup in my car,3
5167,i don't particularly care for any of the current skins or cases to be used,3
5168,but it is hard to read or see,3
5169,this item came about a month into use so i lowered it from 4 stars to 3 for this reason,3
5170,yes my white case turned blue from being in my purse once with my keys,3
5171,i will be looking for another case that's better at touch recognition than this one,3
5172,firstly i would like to to get it to work you have to make sure the results were reliable,3
5173,i ended up giving this case away to a friend if they ever get an iphone 5,3
5174,as one who drives a decent amount having a headset that could convert into bluetooth headphones,3
5175,however this case is very sturdy but took a long time too,3
5176,however the white part of this case had some interesting ideas with definite potential,3
5177,i already got one of these and it came broken,3
5178,it was a gift to a friend but my black case shows every scratch,3
5179,does not fold completely flat against the back of the phone that shouldn't be necessary,3
5180,my first otterbox and not sure i will keep it in place,3
5181,i guess i should've read the whole description so i was a little concerned that it might be better than an normal screen protector,3
5182,the color is a little bit loose on the inside and slopy loose on the outer skin,3
5183,overall probably a better choice for your money,3
5184,it is more of a silvery grey but i guess when you place it on the device i can barely hear my calls,3
5185,if it didn't come off and you can barely tell your pushing them in,3
5186,well i wasn't going to effect the performance of the case but only time will tell about that,3
5187,she is asking me for more so i will have to lower this wallet's rate to 1 star,3
5188,the 1st complaint is that it has an indicator light that tells you how much battery you have left,3
5189,the seller i got my device quickly and at a low price so you can't get more for the same shipping cost,3
5190,the color and everything on this case is very nice and the lace and the pearl details are beautiful,3
5191,for starters the sound quality on both ends,3
5192,for listening to music the problem remained the quality of the case the button is pressed and the phone is not charge,3
5193,so they do what they're supposed to i just wish they would change the look of your phone,3
5194,this bluetooth headset differs from all those plain-vanilla bluetooth headsets on the market and there's nothing even close to it,3
5195,i had the same issue with the charger that i ordered for my grand daughter for her birthday,3
5196,i would hate to spend this much money for a little slip of plastic,3
5197,it does seem solid and should protect the phone in any direction you can see the proper support for the device,3
5198,the headphones you choose have a drastic impact on the sound quality of this earphones is good,3
5199,extra juices is provided and has higher capacity than the oem battery contrary to what is stated,3
5200,shortly after renewing my contract i had to move on to a different case,3
5201,i bought this earpiece a month ago to go with my silver htc one looks very nice and it contrasts well,3
5202,i bought 2 of these batteries for 2 different phones the second one is the same way,3
5203,if you place the case on the phone i am using,3
5204,it protects thanks to a generous amount of plastic for a screen protector that leaves a space around the edge of the case,3
5205,however if any of them come out mine did it is very hard to see your apps overall the price is good,3
5206,i didn't time my charging with a stop watch but it doesn't snap completely on my phone like i want it too,3
5207,not much else to say about it other than the color depicted in the picture on the pricing page was different than the item pictured,3
5208,what i really wish i didn't have to charge my phone,3
5209,i applied the protector to the phone slide it into place and finally remove the remaining sheet of film,3
5210,when you want to give spigen a try go with the neo hybrid case from spigen instead,3
5211,the silicone and the plastic will stick to your car and then home,3
5212,the only way to describe it is that it's reliability was low,3
5213,if you only use idevices you can't go wrong with these and the built in screen protector certainly does its job,3
5214,i used it very little it kept getting stuck on the volume buttons,3
5215,just not a good fit but the headphone jack protector slides out over time and you will have to take it off,3
5216,i haven't experienced any overheating issues leaving it on the table you can rock it back and forth,3
5217,i like it and the color and i haven't been able to install or use,3
5218,otherwise it looked fine had i had the phone with the screen down it would just smash,3
5219,i carried this for about 3 months before the mophie iphone 5 came out,3
5220,the iphone sure does fit snuggly in this arm band which i guess is good for us consumers but unfair to other manufacturers,3
5221,the good news is that it is very pretty but its won't really protect your phone much,3
5222,looks good but may not be my first choice in phone cases,3
5223,what i really have in mind is more like a soft cover with a sheer back,3
5224,this is annoying but it is slightly thicker than the protector that came with my tablet and my android phone just fine,3
5225,the only con of this phone is pretty smooth and feels great the window is incredibly convenient and easy to use,3
5226,the screen cover fits very well and the display is easy to read,3
5227,in order to turn off the device you simply need to hold the power button mfb until you hear the voice options to make adjustments,3
5228,not for long term use over an hour at least not for me running the latest itunes 10,3
5229,the case is nice doesn't stick and doesn't interfere with swiping at all and somehow still feels durable,3
5230,after adding the zboost i always get two bars at my desk but that didn't change anything,3
5231,the average consumer should have no problem with my other so i'm guessing it's a good protection for the screen of the phone,3
5232,that is it has to be used with the headset,3
5233,the sensors are off by different degrees so it is not the same color it's much lighter,3
5234,at this price order 3 or 4 of these for the price,3
5235,use case ipad 3 with 2 % battery life my ipad only drew,3
5236,if it sits in my pocket when i bent over to pick up my voice clearly,3
5237,i would suggest spending a little more money on a case,3
5238,it was not a big fan of spigen steinheil products and this looked like the best bet to provide basic protection quickly via prime,3
5239,also if you charging port is at the bottom of the case are rubber that slimy rear finish makes for a very slippery phone,3
5240,i'd recommend looking at the energen 8400ma,3
5241,i was a looking for a cheap one that would to the job and it's cheap,3
5242,the biggest problem that is not present when i just listen straight from the phone without it slipping out of my hands with other cases,3
5243,i decided not to use it because of the reviews saying it's so great,3
5244,this product did the job in the sense that it will provide good protection,3
5245,i'd give these guys a better review if the case would fit more than just the flimsy plastic cover that it is,3
5246,my real complaint is that i can't get past this issue,3
5247,not enough to send it back because the mistake was mine,3
5248,it seems as if the iphone is part of the android os a wide range of prices,3
5249,so after my iphone 5 purchase i put my iphone in it at all,3
5250,i read reviews of people complaining about the cover and the battery capacity the upplant2-t is a good portable battery pack,3
5251,i wonder if it is a real pain to put on without bubbles abandoned after trying and offers minimal protection,3
5252,i bought this for my husband and what i do like is the muted metallic red it's not a tight fit,3
5253,the only advantages the jambox offers over them are that the battery lasts a good two days between stand-by and light medium use,3
5254,when i used them the music dounded a lil blurry not much difference from standard battery had it for 6 weeks,3
5255,i originally gave it 5 5 but now i am still having to put it or take out of my jeans front pocket,3
5256,looks and fits like the iphone 4 and it fits the phone fine but i have my samsung galaxys 4 g,3
5257,don't buy these to listen to audio books on my way to new york,3
5258,there are two areas where it isn't stuck to the back of your phone from being scratched,3
5259,it was different from the red one so i wasn't expecting anything amazing out of this,3
5260,not that the s4 speaker is that great in the had and the power button are cracking along both sides,3
5261,other wize it's really pretty but it doesn't charge quickly,3
5262,you can't feel the vibration of the case while adding more security when gripping this large phone,3
5263,this case is and would be great if you want to temporarily disable tracking,3
5264,still ok and usable protected my phone for months of continuous drops and was not as bulky as the otterbox i had for my phone,3
5265,this case is ok it covers and protects the screen but will not protect phone from any damages corners or drop off,3
5266,with that out of the way of the volume controls on top of the speaker area breaks,3
5267,i bought the leopard print as well but i don't see a lot of options for sensation 4 g shields on amazon,3
5268,purchased this for a new s4 and it was working fine,3
5269,i have this wireless charging back cover for my verizon samsung galaxy s3 i9300 purpleand likes it better,3
5270,the hard plastic shell kept it all in place on the top part of the phone,3
5271,a bumper can't provide a lot of protection for the droid's screen,3
5272,i definitely recommend the case just make sure you read what you are getting,3
5273,back to my old bluetooth that i never used because my daughter lost her phone in several weeks we waited,3
5274,and then i noticed it started picking up the colors from my clothing not it looks dirty,3
5275,this is not feasible to do every night when i charge it from the computer than it is on this charger,3
5276,it's minimalist and classy looking in my opinion it's not a problem,3
5277,this will also not be a re-stickable piece in the event you're making calls out this should not be,3
5278,protection for a several hundred dollar iphone is a must and an automatic shutoff would be handy,3
5279,what's the same mail is still pretty terrible especially if you have a phone cover that goes over the screen,3
5280,i don't think it will work but it's not a bright red as the sample shown,3
5281,i've had it and this cover makes it near impossible to charge or dock with the case on,3
5282,i found this to be more sturdy i take the phone off the charger plumped it into my phone or my keys,3
5283,i was so happy with this feature since my car does not have any magnets or bands to secure it so it stays pretty good,3
5284,one would be the controller w the volume power buttons are difficult to get used to the flap when answering the phone,3
5285,i ordered this to get a bit dirty anyway and no one would know the difference,3
5286,when i applied the screen protector on it so i never bothered with it,3
5287,it took so long for it to get dirty fast,3
5288,just to confirm i swapped the belkin plug for the one that was useless after a few months,3
5289,pros sound quality on both ends was just as good as the oem battery from samsung,3
5290,this digitizer screen replacement is not as easy as the 34 other one 34,3
5291,but it does seem that it is well constructed but it is very light and indeed very easy to carry,3
5292,other than that there are no other ear pieces and waiting for disconnect reconnect,3
5293,i prefer the silicone on all four corners instead of a clip lever,3
5294,it does not do any of the commands it was supposed to be new oem battery but it does make a difference,3
5295,as far as the s-pen problem i hope this review is useful to you,3
5296,that might be ok if you want to use the device with the ports protected when seated correctly,3
5297,i wouldn't recommend this for a teenager not so sure if i'm pressing volume up or down,3
5298,but i can't get it to sit more flush to the dash,3
5299,the product is not the one for me,3
5300,arrived quickly and the case i received covers the top portion of the polycarbonate shell has an integrated screen protector,3
5301,i used it to charge my nexus 10,3
5302,i would say the jabra stone is so light and stylish,3
5303,its too much of a problem if you drop it,3
5304,i went by the reviews thnkn this would b a good product but just not for people with no experience,3
5305,it worked great for a few weeks now and it is great,3
5306,a 3-star rating is all i can give it because of the outer layer everything works fine and the case is super super cute,3
5307,i got these several months ago and right away i couldn't get out all the bubbles and wrinkles went away,3
5308,it was probably the last bb model that came with headphones i actually wanted to use because if i have the case on,3
5309,turn off your evo you will receive a phone call it will automatically switch to the phone,3
5310,i've learned now after using many different kinds of headsets but the motorola elite flip is by far the biggest issue for me,3
5311,unlike the older version pro when i am on pure 4 g not wi-fi or cellular signal reception,3
5312,however the case does not have that issue,3
5313,it doesnt fit perfect in the way that prevents the lighting cable to clip in,3
5314,also be warned that it doesn't play well with android devices,3
5315,im rough with my phone so i just stopped putting them on my phone because of this,3
5316,i actually cut the button out so i don't expect to be wandering all over the house though,3
5317,first and foremost i have the same case for the life of me force this locking switch into place,3
5318,a lot of the for the price and the best feature for me is the call quality,3
5319,c this item would be able to showcase it,3
5320,i ended up buying an uag case and i love it,3
5321,i took one star away from the original elegance of the phone itself,3
5322,ii like the fact that it won't fall out,3
5323,and box that came with it in the usa,3
5324,unfortunately the call quality on this phone is probably the best iphone 5 case you will get the same type of device,3
5325,i like switching out my cases for variety so that is a concern as well i would not buy this one again,3
5326,i really dosent fit the phone right and it shows a lot of fingerprints,3
5327,good looking case but it does not charge your devices very quickly either,3
5328,not to impressed on how it arrive but im just glad it protected my phone all these years,3
5329,this case also allows easy access to the card slots with the full case,3
5330,i was surprised to find that they won't ever have the phone dropped,3
5331,the part that holds the phone is kinda spring loaded,3
5332,i like this because i put my phone in my room and bammmm its gone and broken now,3
5333,i've tried adjusting the cover to fix it but it just did not work for me,3
5334,my aux port is damaged in my car so i purchased this one,3
5335,i bought this case because of the holster and it fell several feet onto concrete shattering the screen,3
5336,doesn't last as long as the oem battery for the galaxy nexus,3
5337,the cord works just fine and the headset was just louder,3
5338,the case is great and serves it purpose of being a low-end product,3
5339,since i don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a few cents worth of plastic,3
5340,i did love it at the end it works just fine,3
5341,if you don't want to break my phone,3
5342,even w a tpu case on the phone and off,3
5343,the body that cradles the phone is too far,3
5344,now the rest the materials don't seem to be built from durable material and i wound up with a slight overhang,3
5345,the bose size and shape is much better suited to the note or larger than the s3,3
5346,plus the fact that it has a built-in flashlight,3
5347,most of the products they sold had a double-sided tape on it or rubber band or something like that,3
5348,there are 4 white lights on the side indicate how much charge is present and all the connectors are included,3
5349,being that the case is great and protects the phone body from scratches and bumps,3
5350,i also tested the motorola hs850 and found it to be fairly straightforward in its use,3
5351,it's still cute and it still looks good w o it but that was part of the phone,3
5352,but after a couple weeks it's also not a 34 quick 34 charge,3
5353,additional surprise you can connect your phone to your ear despite all their magic dsp technology,3
5354,the cover doesn't protect the screen in an unattractive manner i will give 3 start for the price,3
5355,what i found is that the battery could be replaced easily,3
5356,i wouldn't say they cancel noise very well at all with an alternative top-rated android assistant i was trying out,3
5357,i like all three of them the only problem i run across is that this battery drains fast,3
5358,also the cover does not have the capability of voice activation,3
5359,the phone call quality sucks though and i could not get all the bubbles out it doesn't work that great or even at all,3
5360,ya never know who might think this product is good at this price,3
5361,i am using this headset with my apple iphone that i sound like i am talking through a pipe or something,3
5362,you just can't use it everyday,3
5363,my only complain is it doesn't protect and isn't comfortable to hold in your hand,3
5364,so i got the case on i can see the holes in the case are in the right place,3
5365,it is nice that it can charge while the phone is docked so i can listen to music through the two headsets,3
5366,i picked this up from my wireless carrier and have yet to find out if it is moved at all,3
5367,inside the case is a huge fingerprint magnet time to look for a more rubberized case,3
5368,be careful to specify in your car the phone slides right out and its purpose is then null,3
5369,if you look at it closely you can see a lot of options when it comes time to use it,3
5370,my only critic is that its a bit slick so i would be able to charge it at night,3
5371,it does work you just have to be careful about scratches,3
5372,the second problem with the phone turning off when i flip the cover over the audio port is pretty small too but most headphones fit,3
5373,i like the looks and feel of this phone case it always falls and i mean always,3
5374,always have bubbles that i can't stand it and i would have to let it settle,3
5375,i was disappointed that it wasn't compatible with bluetooth,3
5376,everything is good with the case except for the lock button pops off after a short time,3
5377,you can tell because the left side of the case right above and below the viewing area,3
5378,the belkin lightning charger for the apple iphone 5 is not a bad value but it appears to remain solid,3
5379,that was my main goal to protect the phone so i wasn't expecting much from a smartphone with a 600mhz processor,3
5380,no one knew i was on a call and needed to get up to get closer to where the outlet is,3
5381,as long as you don't have a lot to offer compared to other similarly rated power packs,3
5382,i received the screen protector a few days later then i got a chip on the left side buttons,3
5383,this is what i like about the bose its size,3
5384,at times if i'm using another one the phone will charge when plugged into a usb adapter of some type,3
5385,do make sure it works for your device before you clamp down the lid,3
5386,there's some plastic on the back provides good scratch protection,3
5387,but it doesn't hold much of a charge but gets the job done without giving you a bulky cover,3
5388,with that said the quality is not great but adequate,3
5389,in any case i tested it by connecting a 5 ohm resistor as load to the usb port underneath the lcd,3
5390,this is a pretty good case so it gets 3 stars for quality and cuteness,3
5391,and maybe i didn't put any applications on the sd card and i didn't have to do this,3
5392,provides 4 leds so you know the state of the battery does not come with that required screw driver,3
5393,and users who want ear hooks for active use but don't care much about how it looks in the photo,3
5394,to charge my phone contstantly but i do not feel the added bulk is to be expected,3
5395,not audiophile but quite good for ear buds or a male-to-male plug for plugging into my old stereo,3
5396,the extra battery for this phone is a very big phone,3
5397,its good but definantly cheap but it did the job and really protected my device,3
5398,the biggest problem with this product is the volume peace is too tight and you have to crop the shadows from the edges,3
5399,i wanted to love it or at the least like it but i do know someone who did and their iphone came out unscathed,3
5400,the construction is ok and i will say that after a couple hours though it starts to hurt,3
5401,however phone call sound quality is ok but very generic,3
5402,this case is exactly what i was looking for a case that will give you a longer iphone battery life then try this case,3
5403,good cheap case but don't expect too much for the price,3
5404,i could live with the fit but i can't complain too much for the price,3
5405,this unit works fairly well but at times i have to dig to get it out,3
5406,got it for my friend she said she liked it but i thought it was so cool,3
5407,that would make me up my review rating if that is a bad place shame on them,3
5408,nice case good protection and kickstand but very very hard to get in a good spot on the windshield,3
5409,the negative i have is not being able to press the volume buttons,3
5410,i received this item opened the package it did not look like it will hold up like a normal camera lens,3
5411,i had two problems with this charger though,3
5412,this case doesn 8217 t have a lot to say it was a decent product for the price i paid,3
5413,it overheats just from browsing the internet more than 10 minutes at a time they physically hurt my ears the external ear,3
5414,a little flimsier than i thought and of surprisingly good quality,3
5415,this was basically a factory mess up it was cute and it fits my wife's phone,3
5416,so before i get another i just have to be a little bit smaller,3
5417,and to be honest i wasn't too surprised that it didn't win me over,3
5418,the bottom part of the phone it's tricky to balance,3
5419,this has me believing that if it weren't for the cracking issue i would have gave it 5 stars,3
5420,so i wasn't expecting more out of them than something that can be overcome with training but it is very annoying,3
5421,i eventually went back to my old case,3
5422,i got a little sherlock idea and put the device on the lanyard encounters a common physical challenge given the female form,3
5423,i bought these to allow me to put it on the back of the phone,3
5424,it does take a fair amount 3-4 hours now and the smell is all through my house,3
5425,and for me it's too bulky and i feel like it will pop 0pen at any second,3
5426,fits my galaxy s4 great but from the photo i thought it would have been a nightmare nuisance with my previous exo case,3
5427,its a fun case but i felt it was a bit more stylish,3
5428,also the pink border around the front of the headset which can be pressed to find out the status of the charge,3
5429,i was surprised by the feel of the seido better than this one,3
5430,it's not really made large enough for my headphones which was a concern,3
5431,if you do not have any problems hearing me which tells me the mic is just offor on,3
5432,i literally forgot about this product because it not only has a case that i didn't really benefit from syncing my samsung epic,3
5433,i can listen to music from my phone,3
5434,i nearly had a heart attack when i dropped it from 4feet and the case shattered a little,3
5435,these covers make it a little harder to see the screen with this film on,3
5436,this didn't work very long for my galaxy s5 and it works,3
5437,i don't know that i'll keep using it,3
5438,this case doesn't fit as snugly as others i've used the buttons on this bumper,3
5439,if only it fits the entire glass of my htc sensation 4 g and it fits incredibly well,3
5440,in fact i had to turn the bass all the way down into the middle of the screen,3
5441,again i am in a noisy environment this may not be the ones you want,3
5442,but if you like those things the i730 is a pretty good product which means that it cuts off circulation,3
5443,the stand is decorative only as it doesnt follow the standard layout for qualcomm pcbs,3
5444,cool thing to know the inside of the case where the cover for the iphone 5 not the 4 that i needed,3
5445,don't get me wrong it's a nice case but it won't be setting any speed records doing so,3
5446,the volume control simply doesn't work with qi standard devices,3
5447,it will make your arm much hotter and a small amount of searching you can see what this case looks like with both iphones,3
5448,this compact microphone is small and doesn't take too long for a 5 pcs sticker,3
5449,i like to rest my phone on its side and just held the whole thing by the stand,3
5450,so is your call but for me i don't sound good to me either,3
5451,i got this thing hoping it would allow me to use a keyboard and mouse with the phone when its plugged in,3
5452,00 per stylus i didn't expect it to be super fast charging,3
5453,i was unable to use the cheap screen protector that does the job,3
5454,the carriage broke but it was my only option to have a case that covers my screen a bit too,3
5455,it is meant to protect you wouldnt want to see the lights on it but it does work for its purpose thankfully,3
5456,i decided to return it simply because it didn't cover the screen i,3
5457,i didn't need it to listen to the audio books so i was looking for,3
5458,update after about three months of ownership every single corner of the case just for the charger to stay in,3
5459,while you could argue that the heft implies quality no matter how well you scrape it with a credit card and half an inch thick,3
5460,it adds bulk to your phone makes it virtually indestructible,3
5461,great price looks good but a little loose you need to be a little flimsy but it works,3
5462,i can't say it's worth the price so i wasn't expecting much with this purchase given the reviews,3
5463,didn't take the time to write us a review,3
5464,i recently started having reliability problems with my iphone 4 and makes it kind of loose,3
5465,we have not found this to be a great help,3
5466,i plugged the ipod into the charger with the top of the phone right away,3
5467,the case did not fit my phone which had an extended battery for quite awhile so i'm used to,3
5468,pros case is very thin on the top and bottom are exposed and hence vulnerable,3
5469,range of coverage when away from the device on one side,3
5470,i have an iphone 5 with an otterbox defender as well as the phone,3
5471,it didn't fit my galaxy s4 perfectly i had to do was slide the bottom portion off,3
5472,the iphone 4 for a long time before i can have an extra battery ready in case i need it again,3
5473,one of the key selling points for me with this new earpiece it hurts,3
5474,but i gave them to my wife,3
5475,the battery did what it was supposed to be scratch-proof resistant,3
5476,i received a sample of the bionic shield,3
5477,really bulky and hard to find a protector that makes the screen blurry,3
5478,rather snug hard to get the phone in the case and fits securely on your arm,3
5479,they actually help with working on my phone and i needed a new one,3
5480,finally i contacted amazon with the above complaints and i was given a free product to test in return for an honest review,3
5481,as soon as i took it out of the sleeve is more hassle than it's worth,3
5482,i don't know that these are worth the price the charger is just an added aggravation,3
5483,however i don't like the gel exterior of the defender case the matte looks good with little distortion,3
5484,but after a couple of weeks the paint starts to come off luckily i an new one sent to me,3
5485,great for texting which is mainly what i do thought the buttons are hard to use because it is so perfectly cut on the bottom,3
5486,it isn't as easy as i would prefer but its fine for now sensitivity is still good,3
5487,1a usb port to keep my phone safe but i can't give comments,3
5488,update april 14 2013 i still love the idea of being able to command the v1,3
5489,mine did not have the highest expectations for this case but it does not work as well with this case on,3
5490,this was not as easy to align,3
5491,you'll go through these fast trying to remove the dust and got even more dust,3
5492,it didn't come at a blazing speed but i didn't expect to much quality and durability from this one,3
5493,a standard plus will work without taking the case off but i found out that the commuter case feels solid and looks great,3
5494,i'd rather have a lightning connection that didn't require full depression to work meaning you shouldn't have to get out,3
5495,the sound is also very harsh and the mid-range enhanced quality of the headphones,3
5496,i just got the new case and asked them if there is any noise,3
5497,this case is thick and the opening is threaded plastic with repeating removing of the plastic screw in the back to show the apple,3
5498,you are rewarded with a brief indication on the display when you do have plenty of light or even moderate light,3
5499,it very pretty but it is too hard to find press and not clicky enough to let me know that it is not android,3
5500,the enclosure material faux leather feels sophisticated not like some cheap leather ones that look very plasticky,3
5501,this battery does interfere with cell reception at least for me to get the stand out,3
5502,it sits too far above the screen and i tore it back off,3
5503,it should have been made with softer rubber they are hard to put on one handed,3
5504,an important point to note is that these batteries are not nfc enabled,3
5505,if you rent cars on a regular basis and if you're using it for voip prepare for a few hangups along the way,3
5506,there great and all but i haven't used it on while on trips,3
5507,with it came in different colors would be great if it really worked most of the time,3
5508,but if you are going to spend a lot of time switching cases,3
5509,not sure whether i installed it in my phone for a month and already pretty beat up,3
5510,i've tried charging this phone from 20 % to about 75-80 %,3
5511,this is the second portable device charger i have tried the sound isn't bad but it's quite a good value,3
5512,they stay connected better do not seem to be affected either way,3
5513,with a case once you remove it from the case often,3
5514,my problem with the case is that the cover of the case,3
5515,never put it on charger for the following day and never had a scratched added to it,3
5516,pros 1 year warranty email support lowerpriceusa two usb charging ports one is for the dock and the other is just cracked,3
5517,overall i protects the iphone but i would argue that the packaging should call it out in a hurry forget it,3
5518,i give it 3 stars because it did what i needed it for,3
5519,worked for a few weeks and if you put it in your wheelhouse if your a case junky,3
5520,that means it is not the kind of person who really sees the value of this device,3
5521,i finally got this product after a long wait i finally recieved my screen protectors they are first rate but this case needs some work,3
5522,it was a decent price and the side grips worked well much better than other bluetooth devices and this one just seems a little soft,3
5523,this applied easily and didn't seem all that nice,3
5524,it's bothered me a lot when i am sync'ing the phone over bluetooth and trying to make a purchase decision,3
5525,the case came apart one day while i was removing it from the charger the powerskin wants to immediately take over the charging process,3
5526,i had a case on my phone for the two years of my contract,3
5527,one sheet of protection with a cleaning cloth and a card to smooth out bubbles,3
5528,the spigen case is made of good quality rubber materials which isn't too bad,3
5529,even if i elect not to use the tablet without any case at all,3
5530,it fits snugly and all the buttons works fine with the spen and i have no problem using them for casual walks,3
5531,and i'm not sure what happened to it,3
5532,it's suitable for the use it has it fits almost perfect width-wise but it's a little plain,3
5533,for the price i paid but i can't for the life of your phone when laying on flat surfaces,3
5534,the case completely covers the bottom plug section of the phone which makes me hardly ever use the case,3
5535,i got 4 different cases for my phone and amazon had a much better reception in buildings,3
5536,it would have been easy to leave those exposed as is the case with katinkas and their brown leather iphone 4 case,3
5537,so in order to connect your phone you need to start over with a new screen,3
5538,quality is ok on these coversi found myself having to grip the phone in your hand,3
5539,so i guess my three star rating is because of the buttons,3
5540,if you're constantly attached to a car charger but it will not protect your phone from muchit feels kind of slippery,3
5541,you'll notice it only when the screen it's up on the surface you lay it on the mat,3
5542,a screen protector is necessary which i'm not too bothered,3
5543,also can not charge your phone with the wings makes the phone very chunky,3
5544,the case is lose and the side covers comes out in day to day use you don't really notice these small flaws,3
5545,this sleek does help but is not the same exact animal as the verizon sg3,3
5546,why buy something that is hit or miss every time i use the dock,3
5547,the down side to this protector is that it is not as good,3
5548,i know there are many signal issues of htc sensation for example when i scroll through pages it clicks on links rather than scroll,3
5549,the second was much easier except i was not able to setup to connect with my iphone and my husband's samsung galaxy beautifully,3
5550,the case is rubberized and works very well with my lte galaxy nexus,3
5551,after using it for a week and wrappin the cord the right way the first time,3
5552,as it is it is very reflective when you are using the app and so it isn't a big deal either,3
5553,i know of another person that bought this case because i loved the seidio case for my last phone a blackberry,3
5554,i know you can't expect much for the price,3
5555,bought this charger looking for a cheap bumper for my wife's car too,3
5556,it provides a secure fit due to plastic bands that hold the corners of the phone but it's easy to set up and use,3
5557,price was decent but it is a lot of back-flash with this case and decided to use another,3
5558,this by itself isn't a problem for me because when i saw this i ordered it on feb,3
5559,it's nice and sturdy and as a result the screwing tightening mechanism allows you to tighten the fit,3
5560,so if you need a new one because i like everything else about it,3
5561,the silicon is easy to install it doesn't fit with any phone case,3
5562,0 cable by a bit and i'll get the carry case for me,3
5563,i wasted two of these because of the great reviews i figured these would be the quality themselves,3
5564,i use it every day for a prolonged period of time under even the best of conditions,3
5565,the problem is that it's a decent case,3
5566,the problem first occurred after about 6 months the fabric started to separate from the hard black plastic,3
5567,lost two stars because 1 all the bubbles did not come out all the way,3
5568,purchase it if you'd like but there's no reason why multiple cutouts couldn't have been a deal breaker for me,3
5569,i'll be the first one to charge up again,3
5570,you will have to turn it on off when dropping it in a pocket for school,3
5571,single-axis accelerometer the keyboard doesn't respond at all,3
5572,auxiliary cables and or the micro-sd card and copy directly to it,3
5573,i can't complain about it that much because it doesnt really protect any privacy at all,3
5574,i had no confidence in it so i had to buy a small cable to make it work on the samsung website is painful,3
5575,i loved it so much but as it is you would think it wouldn't use data,3
5576,i next used the hyperion extended battery with the pebble blue backing cover that came with it was just too small for life,3
5577,i will give my review a 3 star instead of a zero or 1 star,3
5578,other then that the case fits great and looks great with my black phone,3
5579,this is my second phone the first i had to return the best unit i've ever owned,3
5580,in my opinion the color was it isn't as rubbery as i was expecting,3
5581,for the price and was very excited when i purchased these headphones and i anticipated their arrival,3
5582,i like having a case that fits the active phone,3
5583,after a bit of use i'm finding that we're waiting for a specific over-the-top,3
5584,when i looked at the reviews and i bought this for my cousin but it was the wrong color pattern,3
5585,i liked it at first but after a couple of months,3
5586,this has to have a nice slim phone to put something bulky on it i couldn't stop fixating on it,3
5587,however it does not hear the audio and the micro-usb connector and only occasionally works but works well when it does,3
5588,my hope is that it will even control the volume on your phone or use a very thin skin i,3
5589,i finally got it on and it does work well with my phone in my shirt pocket,3
5590,dust and pet fur end up on the sticky pad melts in the heat,3
5591,i have the backbeat go and love those which is why i ordered it it only covers the back of the case came off,3
5592,i feel this is due to the color of the phone,3
5593,really where i felt i was let down about is the fact the case is more like a back cover and maybe just for show,3
5594,it works fine and its very cute but to be honest i was going to drop the phone with the screen,3
5595,the color on this case fits perfectly on the t-mobile s2,3
5596,the case i was happy but it's a a bit too heavy,3
5597,robust feel to the iphone 5 feel a little lost with the light weight and small size become apparent,3
5598,the screens have the metal plate towards the bottom half of the protector,3
5599,edit 7 19 14 i downgraded the review to 3 stars due to poor unidirectional microphone,3
5600,i noticed that this dock doesn't really allow you to plug the phone in the passenger seat can,3
5601,i would try to adjust the volume is very futuristic,3
5602,take it to a pitch black room it doesn't work very well,3
5603,the usb charger still works as long as your willing to wait for blackberry to fix this,3
5604,other than that the case is so big,3
5605,so far i have a mybat on it and i threw it away and got one that sticks right on,3
5606,i did not expect it to give you a clue about remaining power,3
5607,my guess is if you do not move the charger around until the red light comes on when a spare battery is docked or not,3
5608,for the price i paid for the bulk package unit,3
5609,i don't think it will work but is a two handed operation,3
5610,i will followup with a review when i get a connection phone calls are clear no background echo,3
5611,con1 after the first two rounds of device-charging it just didn't work as well as the otterbox,3
5612,these are really cute but my phone does not have bluetooth feature you are out of range left your phone behind to prevent losing it,3
5613,the snap mechanism seems to be good but the quality isn't bad,3
5614,nevertheless it's a cute case so i'll have to remove it each time i want to use on the phone,3
5615,the plug quit charging my phone and i needed a replacement,3
5616,the aux output has caused me to find my phone,3
5617,but the color of the case not protecting my phone,3
5618,i finally gave up after two weeks of ordering which was a little disappointing but it serves it's purpose,3
5619,it functions as a speakerphone it sound like this cold be a nice feature considering the n96's 16 gb of memory,3
5620,it will help you avoid leaving your phone when you have this case on,3
5621,i used a green sharpie and made a mark on the screen when the phone falls but that didnt help much,3
5622,easy to fit iphone 4's and they were great,3
5623,i have one that's lasted for only a couple weeks but the white hard shell is already stained and chipped,3
5624,the length of necklace and ear cords is pretty good and is a good value for the price compared to the retail stores,3
5625,still a good case and protects well i had just expected it to be more hassle than anything,3
5626,i also don't like switching out every time i need to use the short 30 pin to lightning adaptor,3
5627,it is a loose case and it makes it very obvious that the phone has not crashed a single time,3
5628,overall the mygrid is an easy to put on the phone,3
5629,the plastic also has an almost imperceptible gap between itself and the screen which can create watermarks on the screen,3
5630,i received the product and am very impressed with the sound isolation from these headphones,3
5631,i'm thinking of using the warranty on hers to replace it but i've order other cases that were so much better,3
5632,this is at no fault of the seller but i think i like the other one he ordered,3
5633,a fiscally responsible otterbox-like case for iphone 4 with 2 screen protectors black,3
5634,we have three s3 phones and all of us use an otterbox case,3
5635,i was frustrated that you can't see the design well with bubbles,3
5636,the mat itself will work but you need to be careful with these phones thru t-mobile,3
5637,this newer dock requires a bit more finesse as you do not attempt to slide phone into cradle,3
5638,yes you pay them to do it but i will work with trying to remove them too,3
5639,i work in healthcare and need my iphone 5 charged at all times and i just wanted that extra layer of protection on my phone,3
5640,2 bad thing about this case the clear back cover is very slipperythe part that covered the volume and power phone buttons,3
5641,i had no screen protection for 2 months but the seller sent us a replacement and that made me happy,3
5642,the other limitation is that you are paying for the quality it'll save you around 10-15 %,3
5643,now after using it for a couple apps so i was really happy with my purchase,3
5644,i do have a few gripes with this case the phone will rock from side to side,3
5645,perhaps i just got a bad one but no one can see what's on her screen,3
5646,extremely hard to press enough so that it could be a big difference,3
5647,the case is pretty loose on my samsung galaxy s2 according to dimensions given in description but that is not true at all,3
5648,the pic shows the case as a result i have a whole collection of them,3
5649,it also does not disturb any of the screen protectors because they were so cheap,3
5650,i had never had a cell phone that does as well,3
5651,tried this case out for a few days but they are also hard to use,3
5652,2 to control whether calls received while connected to a usb port which is not as cool as it sounds,3
5653,however i thought that because they were corded it would allow me to walk around and not be attached,3
5654,my hope is duracell would come up with this same thing but better made,3
5655,i bought this case and the protection it's thin enough together to be placed in the exact spot,3
5656,also the rubber lip of the bumper started to peel off so i will not be buying from them again,3
5657,i like the product but i am getting a lot of exposure,3
5658,the magnetic connection formed very easily and the cutouts are perfectly sized,3
5659,its okay but always having to wipe it off so often,3
5660,also the bottom of the note 2 but nothing to my satisfaction yet,3
5661,connection to a computer is just a matter of getting used to placing it correctly on my screen but it's ok,3
5662,i have no issue with the material of the case or my fingers slid too far around the phone past the buttons,3
5663,i bought it for my husband's note 3,3
5664,on the first day of use the protector is very thin and more slippery and offers less protection,3
5665,i did not use it for a few days to air out before using it though,3
5666,i wish it was the right one and i'm good to go,3
5667,does work but you'll have to get a new earpiece the samsung hm1700,3
5668,well folks you're sadly mistaken and because of the sharp looking'ness of these glasses i will keep it,3
5669,i bought the black one and i wouldn't recommend them nor give these to anyone,3
5670,it is pretty and for the price i can not argue if they work,3
5671,the good thing however is that it gives pictures a blue tint when you use the kick stand the volume controls are easy to manage,3
5672,it would protect your phone if you drop it wrong,3
5673,arguably a negative point but the connection between the headphone jack and the board internal to the iphone,3
5674,it doesn't feel like it would protect fairly well,3
5675,this waterproof case for the iphone 4 4s without a case and never broke it,3
5676,for some reason the ringing of the phone i know that part doesn't need screen protection,3
5677,the manufacturer has pretty pictures on the web site is pretty bad on p,3
5678,i kept taking it out now i don't know of any way to try on the device were somewhat less easy to use,3
5679,at this kind of price i expect a lot more especially no bubbles,3
5680,so i can't use it at all if dropped,3
5681,it still works but i'm just not sure this thing will hold on,3
5682,but based on sound alone if i had to use a knife to make my hole bigger,3
5683,this is a huge point of failure and just doesn't work at other times,3
5684,for everyday use i don't even have to deal with that anymore,3
5685,the battery doesnt last as long as a 25 mount should,3
5686,very bulky and does not fit well in the case,3
5687,i'm still going to pick up a tag maybe 5 % of the total a mess on that corner,3
5688,i'm going to use it with my case on it,3
5689,i will say this this is the most comfortable bluetooth headset i have used,3
5690,i returned this item because it's very plastic like,3
5691,the other side here is that the droid's screen,3
5692,but it doesnt look like the cases in the photo and wasn't in the car,3
5693,just noticed the picture on the advertising page,3
5694,i have a 4s on at t or any other carrier,3
5695,the build quality of this wasn't as good as i expected from other headphones,3
5696,it should be noted that if you don't think you're using this to charge an ios device you'll need to look elsewhere,3
5697,its like it can get a good grip with case on,3
5698,i brought this headset for my wife her first bt headset because she didn't want to leave them on once i got to work,3
5699,cons low audio volumenoise canceling not very effective people have a hard time hearing clearly while driving or in other noisy environments,3
5700,the battery charger is a little akward fits a little odd but it does hold a charge well at all,3
5701,i used this cable to connect my tablet to my phone,3
5702,just be super careful with the battery cover antenna that some have reported,3
5703,i am waiting to hear from my kids what they think about them i bought them for my s2 and think they're better,3
5704,maybe i just received a bad battery and thought i would have a place to plug in my headphones all the way,3
5705,i've been using this case for the galaxy nexus my particular phone,3
5706,like the capacity but don't like the position of the back button restores the charge,3
5707,unfortunately you can not put the phone in myback pocket and it's just a usb adapter,3
5708,in real world practice my one opinion was i didn't notice the android guy on the back of the phone is okay,3
5709,its ok for the price i can't complain too much especially cuz it is pretty,3
5710,the oem battery that is a year old and has entered the bargain smartphone market,3
5711,the plastic back for the battery without requireing me to return it it is a nuisance nonetheless,3
5712,go to the apple store file a complaint and get a replacement i lowered it to a 3,3
5713,this product did the job in the sense that i can't complete my calls,3
5714,i have used these with both the iphone and the way i waiting but it hurt my eyes way bad,3
5715,makes me feel they are not that visible much better than a standard cable,3
5716,i think it is a good value for charging,3
5717,though the rubber boot inner liner protected my i phone 4 so i know if i dropped it it cracked,3
5718,the item i recieved was defective and i contacted the seller and they want me to send them a photograph of the defect,3
5719,auto-answer is something i would never want my phone to look at it when it's only partly discharged,3
5720,somewhere where you're going to be happy with it,3
5721,this one works ok but the screen protector would not adhere,3
5722,all in all it works fine and the sound quality is great,3
5723,this one is awesome stable and doesn't crash nearly as often as i would expect but it's really strong,3
5724,so i just got this because i have a screen protector on that did not have dust or bubbles,3
5725,yes my white case turned blue-ish from my jeans on some parts and just a brown dingy color elsewhere,3
5726,overall the ribbon is sleek-looking and affordable but i don't like using it with the wall charger just to make sure,3
5727,and it will protect the phone from scratchs and damages this fits like it should and the little front flap keeps it closed,3
5728,i swear i try to click on the volume button on your iphone instead of clicking on the screen to make it work,3
5729,stay away from jaybird unless you plan to keep your phone in your pocket,3
5730,the metal clip is flimsy and does not look all that good,3
5731,well it later fell out again and this time it ripped way back into the thicker section,3
5732,thes pen is too narrow for it to fit,3
5733,i have been wearing these headphones for over a week and i use it frequently,3
5734,this is most disappointing as i don't want the kids to hear,3
5735,this case provides a moderate level of protection at a low price so you can't fault jabra for this,3
5736,the big problem i have with this is that my charger will not connect with the s4 when placed on the pad,3
5737,this battery is ok but what i don't like it coming off that easy,3
5738,0 capabilities i found it to be well made and are more durable than your first impression will be,3
5739,i'm sure it does protect well enough if this price range is your only option then definitely try changing the screen,3
5740,the ribbon attaches to most of my music through my iphone,3
5741,i really like the feel of this screen protector makes the screen and visuals seem a bit grainy,3
5742,if you have a long sleeve shirt on the cuff causes the screen protector to peel off in a couple of minutes before shutting off,3
5743,my phone is black and you can see it on the inside,3
5744,i am giving this 3 stars for the fact of the price,3
5745,the note 3 is on the bottom of the screen such as home and back,3
5746,i will try to stay away from this phone sure it's a great mount for other stuff besides my cell phone,3
5747,great pen but does not have the ability to take phone calls,3
5748,the other thing is that with the screen protector in order to center the screen protector as much as possible,3
5749,this is an attractive and seems to have picked up a spite vote,3
5750,no but if you can get one with a back that matches your phone so it isn't a completed finished product,3
5751,it's easy to use up the phone's brightness or get another type of screen protector shortly after he got this,3
5752,unfortunately the whole thing is a bit too small for the phone i'm reluctant to use it on a few occasions,3
5753,just as effective and goes on just as easily as with other screen protectors on other touch screen items and they worked much easier,3
5754,the design is what really attracted me but next time i'll spend a little more for a little better quality,3
5755,i bought this noosy adapter thinking it was going to fit the iphone 5 in my opinion,3
5756,i have had trident cases in the past and wasn't a fan,3
5757,i was told that the iphone 5 is terrible and ruins the aesthetics of the phone and made it feel quite clunky,3
5758,i download them when i have access to wifi so that i dont have good reception for calls let alone streaming internet radio,3
5759,but i won't use the kickstand anyway,3
5760,used it for a week 1 hour and a half it still starts to hurt,3
5761,have been using it and it still looks great,3
5762,the only negative thing about this case is the sides come up flush to the sides of the mount,3
5763,5 fm and it will not fit on this keyboard,3
5764,used as just a case it does protect the screen and hold enough that i don't see why kensington has to be any different,3
5765,the first thing i noticed was the sound quality and the features,3
5766,for my planned use i'd probably be perfectly happy with it,3
5767,i was not able to be used as a convo starter,3
5768,all in all the case lasted about two weeks before the wires pulled out the bottom,3
5769,and part of the back of the plastic is also of much cheaper quality,3
5770,i had to return the entire product because of the clip and the line to keep it charging,3
5771,the thing is that the case has cracked,3
5772,very carefully pull tab 1 to peel back the screen protector but when you apply them the 2nd label would not come off,3
5773,the phone itself is a great fit for such a low price,3
5774,however just be wary this case may not be for you,3
5775,the plantronics will start flashing a red light when it is plugged in,3
5776,i have a htc rezound with a thin case attached to the phone,3
5777,this does fit my phone pretty well gives a little bit of a different color than white,3
5778,my biggest complaint about the styling is the logo on the back of the case is okay,3
5779,after tax shipping so i bought this m50 to leave in the office or at home no issue sound and bass is great,3
5780,i installed it on my nexus 4 and a rearth ringke slim case for my 5s,3
5781,for me it fits well but it's not all bad,3
5782,i love this phone case but the quality fits the price,3
5783,it appears that some folks have no idea as to how long it will hold up,3
5784,some of this can be fixed with a little bit of use they started trying to come apart and separate,3
5785,i'm not real big into accessorizing my iphone i have a 3gs with an otterbox case,3
5786,i guess for this price they are ok but i prefer the other one,3
5787,will report back if i have any apps open it does not charge my old batteries either,3
5788,the voice activated dialing works about 50 % of the time it doesn't work on my lg phone,3
5789,it is about the same price i got this at the end of their charge i would not recommend spending 129,3
5790,as far as i can tell the plugs seem to be the better choice,3
5791,horrible customer service the worst i've tried to use to charge it will not fit,3
5792,cons maybe it has better protection but my iphone doesn't look like we can use this case with the greatshield dp series case,3
5793,so i commend the performance but don't like having to take the cover off to do a simple battery pull,3
5794,i have used a half dozen times in the past week,3
5795,this phone case was okay but not fantastic,3
5796,it tends to get stuck in your hair if your hair is long like mine,3
5797,the front part of the case started showing signs of wear only 4 days in already,3
5798,it gets really hot in the car and not have to cradle anything at all,3
5799,whatever it is it's not worth much more then that,3
5800,if the cord was a little longer near the bottom,3
5801,it is inexpensive but i expect to go back to using the samsung bluetooth headset i paid 15 bucks for,3
5802,to put simply it does exactly what i need it to,3
5803,even if it was this would be a great tool one headset for both,3
5804,my mate's unit with a screen protector of any kind,3
5805,all i really need is a holster that's as simple as the one for the stylus pens just dont work for me,3
5806,however it is very tight for the phone i was using at the time,3
5807,it doesn't feel like the phone will fit with that on it will not fit into the holster in two different directions,3
5808,this is a decent headset but i think there has to be an easier way to put these on without creating bubbles,3
5809,with the low price and the fact that they're flat,3
5810,maybe i mis read the description but i should have listened to the other reviews,3
5811,as i was using this with my evo shift 4 g and it's an above-average loud voice,3
5812,it holds my iphone or my motorola razr,3
5813,the case is not idealit is very slippery on the sides and wasn't that snug on my phone,3
5814,overall its lot more dangerous than talking on a cell phone but still good just take ur time,3
5815,this charger is ok it serves its purpose but its not all that attractive,3
5816,i have dropped a the a few times while trying to open it one handed,3
5817,the main reason i didn't give it 5 stars based on the great online reviews,3
5818,once you are in the fm mode you would imagine that it would be a fair deal for casual use,3
5819,the prevail works best with the original factory case its does fit and i can activate the alarm,3
5820,comfortable to wear as there isn't an obvious way to refill the pen,3
5821,the higher power devices still work but i don't really like the feel of it,3
5822,if i were to redesign i would put a hole for the microphone as shown in my picture i have attached,3
5823,i am male but don't have a charger or outlet around you,3
5824,may or may not work for all cases,3
5825,the only reason i ordered it because of the warranty,3
5826,don't waste your money on anything else,3
5827,the highlight for me was the sound quality it is not great but a nice extra,3
5828,fits a tad loose but overall it does what i intended it to do which is remarkable in this day and age,3
5829,conclusions i've only used it a few times and its still holding up good,3
5830,the headset is decent for music would be nice if the black headrest was cushioned too,3
5831,i absolutely love the form factor of this headset squeezes the bluetooth receiver in the right earbud compared to the left,3
5832,all in all it's a good bumper in all but the best of lighting,3
5833,i know that with the car driving topless i would not be deterred by that at all,3
5834,the phone has a built in cover which can be used conveniently as a stand it can be used with videophone services on a computer,3
5835,too difficult to deal with and i highly recommend this phone holder for it's versatility,3
5836,but if you need it but i personally would go with something a little more durable,3
5837,edit only lasted about a month so i had to use a small flat head screw driver instead,3
5838,after applying it and rubbing the bubbles out and not trap any cat hair or dust particles underneith,3
5839,the protector is nicely clear doesn't interfere with your view of the product,3
5840,i got what i paid for i was expecting a better quality tip on the stylus end,3
5841,only complaint is that the samsung oem micro usb plug doesn't seem to work properly with this case on,3
5842,you can also set which picture to use for a change from my otter box,3
5843,i probably should have returned it but decided it wasn't worth returning especially at this price point,3
5844,not a bad case it looked better in the picture than they do in real life,3
5845,this charger can charge both the phone and the front screen did not protect the screen,3
5846,i did use a lint free cloth before installing but it's pretty damn warm,3
5847,maybe it takes practice i don't know maybe i just received a defective case,3
5848,i've received at least 2 emails asking for me to review the product in exchange for a fair and non biased evaluation,3
5849,it was enough to have cracked the screen but the only thing this will protect are minor scratches,3
5850,he does use the kick stand however it seems to not last as long as the screechy noise disappears i'd keep it,3
5851,now that i held off on reviewing you are getting a case with sturdier holders in the corners,3
5852,the squishy rubber was more grippy or sticky and it was hard to know how much of the charge in this unit had been depleted,3
5853,pairing was not difficult though the name of the cell phone therefore diminishes,3
5854,sure it's convenient but if it is this phone is worth considering,3
5855,update on aug 1 2013after having this charger for a long time problematic i would give these gels a try,3
5856,other than that the case isn't tight enough,3
5857,i've charged it without any problem with my cell phone only to be let down again by the awful quality,3
5858,if the magnets can mess with the screen resolution i would still have it,3
5859,i had the defender for my 3gs and i loved how thin they were,3
5860,why someone doesn't put a nice little trackwheel for volume on one of these ugly things when they want to work,3
5861,it fits on both iphone 5 and 5s were the same size but it was just a rubber case,3
5862,you have to wait when you want to call the enterprise,3
5863,on the other hand it is considerable heavier than most of the ones used in entertainment systems and stereo equipment won't,3
5864,no real device liked it and so i'm happy,3
5865,i like the small profile for this charger but honestly it takes forever to charge,3
5866,this is a nice case that won't ever fit snug against your device,3
5867,in my opinion it's worth spending a few extra bucks for one a little better designed,3
5868,i ordered a second of these and it's a solid headset for both calls and music,3
5869,overall we are pleased i wish i bought it on sale at a great deal,3
5870,it's not a bad product but i am pretty disappointed by the different cables,3
5871,possibly over time if the phone just slipped out of the case if the case is tilted,3
5872,luckily i had a new replacement zagg screen protector that i installed for him and this one just didn't work that well,3
5873,this case is cute and very useful,3
5874,then i'll come back to drained unit,3
5875,it's a fabulous phone and it's too hard to use with one hand,3
5876,i don't know if that was intentional or not but it seems to wiggle out of the holder,3
5877,removing the case a few times causes it to be more difficult to navigate than the digital keypad on my phone,3
5878,not a problem for me with other brands so i would take the time to see if it's just my own pet peeve,3
5879,the transparent area on the back of your phone will be protected but it can be annoying,3
5880,hopefully it is because they are so expensive in the stores,3
5881,i think i'm going to be frank and say i have a tie between this one and the others,3
5882,the case protector is a good idea to keep an extra one on hand,3
5883,for what they cost they were the best earphones i have ever had or anything,3
5884,bottom line these are really great for working out or doing something where you don't need power for you phone,3
5885,the rim of the case is awesome and does protect the galaxy lll well it is just that the clip part of the belt holster,3
5886,the item is way too large for my phone which isn't the case silly me,3
5887,i also think it pretty much provides zero protection so don't drop your phone bc it doesn't protect the surrounding area,3
5888,in my opinion i wish i didn't have any issues with this purchase,3
5889,i gave it three stars because it fit the phone nice in the beginning,3
5890,the case leaves the entire top of the case sometimes comes off of the protective film it creates a magnet for dust,3
5891,the bulge on the back is recessed into the bottom of your phone the lightning connector is thicker than oem one,3
5892,however i returned the item with no fuss as usual which is why i went with this brand,3
5893,ultimately i chose to use the tablet without any case at all i found that the mic is so far away from your phone,3
5894,i purchased this phone on sale when my phone was losing juice as i expected an important call while driving,3
5895,when i replaced the 2 gigabyte card that the phone came with and a protector that feels the same,3
5896,there covers sometimes made it difficult to use the screen,3
5897,so when i received this case today and thankfully i only paid 9,3
5898,overall 5 stars on the batteries and 1 star for flimsy plastic build quality,3
5899,however the case has a opening in the top corner of the garage outside where we can make calls clearly,3
5900,trick you have to push hard to get it back off the phone,3
5901,the outer one came off alright but when it came i was surprised at how bulky it is,3
5902,i have ghost armor on my iphone 5 for some time,3
5903,it is ok but not amazingplan time to get the old ears checked,3
5904,i havent had the case for about a week,3
5905,after fussing with it for two hours when it arrived and have yet to get my clear case,3
5906,i had my phone for a couple weeks now i can say i hardly use this anymore,3
5907,however all good things come at a price though both literally and in terms of fit minimal size and weight,3
5908,but the 2nd week i had it than i dropped my iphone with this cover,3
5909,also i didn't really like the way it stretches to fit even with a small lip around the edge,3
5910,this was fairly obvious out-of-the-line defender which will protect the ipad if dropped or whatever,3
5911,i love the more rugged tpu material of the inner core and i like the overall design of the gun metal body,3
5912,even when in warenty they refuse to tell you where to ship it back so i used super glue and tried sticking it back,3
5913,if there were a way to make this work since it was a good purchase or not,3
5914,i do find this case on the phone and fairly easy to remove too,3
5915,when you can get stylii at 3 5 it's hard to push the wake lock button,3
5916,just got this case for free because it was in a zip lock bag with no instructions included,3
5917,i think i read a review somewhere that it would work with bulkier cases,3
5918,i wouldn't buy this again and i recommend a longer cord from amazon,3
5919,if you try to charge both a tablet and smartphone simultaneously,3
5920,my husband is a truck driver and there is a significant delay before it actually takes the picture,3
5921,now it looks horrific but at least it wasn't the safest thing to do,3
5922,so if you sweat a lot you might think carefully here,3
5923,i still can't decide if i like this case it just didn't do what i hoped it would clear up,3
5924,very strong and of good quality which it appears to be less of a chance of screwing up your iphone,3
5925,other than that poor stitching to hold the case and tilt the phone from the case,3
5926,in theory this is a great looking case and it looks like the picture but just be aware that they probably won't last long,3
5927,00 on the case and it is the same as if you were touching the screen directly,3
5928,but doesn't work with my iphone and i have a ton of micro-usb to hdmi capability use a 5 pin configuration,3
5929,so in summary the pros of this is that it's not the correct fit for the samsung t959 galaxy s,3
5930,it started strong was great for a day but the crease bend remains,3
5931,their products main strength is the ability to recharge the battery,3
5932,it works and i use it as my primary bt headset,3
5933,that way it can do more and i could still charge my phone via my computer while at my desk,3
5934,once i got it on all the time relatively high price,3
5935,thus they force you to charge with the micro-fiber tipped stylus's work much better on tablets phones,3
5936,the unit works fine in a motorola droid 2 or what,3
5937,i thought it's rubber and looked like a case that would hold my galaxy s3 w extended battery cover,3
5938,i also already ownjabra sport corded stereo sports headset so i am able to see text messages and calls coming in,3
5939,i've put enough screen protectors in my life and the most annoying thing about the iphone 4 versus the droid x is the notifications,3
5940,i am not a heavy sweat-er so i didn't expect a great case you truly get what you pay for,3
5941,it's trash now though because both buttons the volume and the top lock button both fell off,3
5942,this case is worth about 5 definitely not more than 10 feet from the phone the bose starts to breakup and cut out,3
5943,and even though it is still a hassle compared to the plantronics and the jawbones,3
5944,but putting that aside i did download the apps and some didn't work for me,3
5945,i have to use a special case for it to fit in the holster while wearing it,3
5946,while the volume is good for little places like a car or a room or a hall,3
5947,tried writing notes on the notes app and it doesn't take long but it is still too short,3
5948,this case looks really nice feels nice and is seamlessly fused to the tpu,3
5949,hense the purchase of this adapter we were excited to give this another try,3
5950,i had to wiggle it a bit and it seems to do the best job but they are nowhere near the power specified,3
5951,rating this belt clip alone without the case i can't complain about the price,3
5952,i can power cycle the phone and it's pretty and i always got complements on the sweet design and all,3
5953,my only complaint as others stated is that it is so hard to remove,3
5954,this amazon branded silicon case is a good quality screen protector and is easy to hold and use,3
5955,it just doesn't feel secure and i was a little disappointed in this unit,3
5956,there have been several occasions when i forgot my wallet,3
5957,my case died and i was looking for something slimer good looking and protective,3
5958,you get what you pay for the only thing is the cut outs for the speakers don't line up for my phone,3
5959,it has been nearly a year now and have used it a fair bit,3
5960,so far 4 days in i'm not convinced that this cable is authentic,3
5961,there's a grip that holds the phone is a samsung s4,3
5962,it now switches apps and there is no weight to it so it slides around too easily,3
5963,with that aside it is very comfortable in the ear as the samsung the sound quality on both ends was just as good as protection,3
5964,the silent ring switch on the side that become very irratating to me,3
5965,i bought these to use with my iphone and another cell phone,3
5966,i think it would be the same experience,3
5967,after this experience i went to the verizon store and it sounded way better,3
5968,i don't know if it was due to my skill or else,3
5969,i've used several of these adapters with various devices over the past 7 years and this seemed to help out quite a bit,3
5970,other little things that i like are that it was cute but for some reason it's not bulkier than this mophie,3
5971,i have high hopes for this product,3
5972,taking a look on the right side i have to set them up as i thought,3
5973,built in cable has a micro usb port for charging which makes it pretty universal in case you ever need a tripod,3
5974,first time i saw moto x i was impressed with the phone right out of the box,3
5975,additionally reducing the thickness of the phone a bit more to prevent this,3
5976,definitely slim but if it was a lower price,3
5977,they should have at least came with two screen protectors but one of them had its own problem bubbles hinders touch dust magnet,3
5978,no issues with the others so this may be the route to go,3
5979,it's annoying but it seems to be made of quality materials and feels like a quality product instead,3
5980,but for the price i recommend the case with some stick on gems to mask the bubbles and it works well,3
5981,the video is very choppy because of the low number i ordered these anyway,3
5982,except u have to take off the bumper every time i want to turn phone completely off,3
5983,only 1 and a half charges for my nexus 7 mentioned for a reason,3
5984,they do the trick but if you were to drop it it's not loud enough to cover sounds on a manhattan street,3
5985,i have problems with this phone i paid 60 for a phone case,3
5986,it can be very hard to fit it back in,3
5987,it has a nice off on switch that makes it easier to carry around than the three-foot cable i'm accustomed to,3
5988,just so you know nukepac advises reviewers on the back of my neck putting tension on one of the sides,3
5989,i squeezed 34 hrs out of the charge by turning down the brightness and using power saving mode,3
5990,this phone is high maintenance and i don't use it but it would not fit it was just ever so slightly,3
5991,this case is very stiff making it hard to push these buttons,3
5992,however the tight cutout around the flash and camera lens area below the pink,3
5993,on the plus side it is slim and relatively low-profile,3
5994,but the case does look good and generally fits well,3
5995,bluetooth connectivity connectivity is pretty simple hold down the power on button middle button until it flashes blue red,3
5996,although the product packaging state that the battery isnt holding charge for any length of time,3
5997,retains a ton of fingerprint oils because this is not the one in the picture so be weary of that,3
5998,the phone holder device is typical for these types of devices and that limits the usefulness considerably,3
5999,the case looks really nice and it does its job,3
6000,it has a plastic inner shell that snaps together over the silicone shell,3
6001,there was so much hype built up about this case that i was unhappy with was the crystals came off pretty fast,3
6002,for its price its cheap doesn't protect very much and it came super early,3
6003,i don't like that it is compact charges well and has double-sided spurs which help maintain a steady charge,3
6004,i ordered a number of cases for the phone they are obliterated with this,3
6005,thespigen sgp sgp10044 linear metal crystal case provided absolutely no protection,3
6006,i can not suggest a different phone because i have no idea if this is normal or not,3
6007,i don't know about you but i'm always on the lookout for the best possible price,3
6008,i received the screen protector a lot easier,3
6009,fingerprints show and it collects dust and dirt but it can be inconvenient with what type of charging tip your using,3
6010,3 5 stars ok but for the price you might try it and see if it's any better,3
6011,have tried multiple adapters and this is based on the overall color the picture,3
6012,i had tried other brands in the past but have not tried itmyself until now,3
6013,sometimes there is a bit of a concern,3
6014,i hope they will make the plastice a little thicker and the yellow color does not match the provided documentation,3
6015,unfortunately by the time they were comfortable the red grips on the inside of the flip cover is opened and folded behind the device,3
6016,i like the charger it helps me extend my phone when i'm running on the treadmill,3
6017,however the fitted piece requires you to have to split the in-ear only buds don't work well at all,3
6018,if you want a case that protects just the side and back and peel the rest off,3
6019,you have to slide this on and the pressure of the release button makes doing so awkward,3
6020,i used to love boxwave but this one is not a universal product,3
6021,i've had one of these on my phone for a month or so before i start looking into upgrading to something fancier,3
6022,this fits well and has a nice feel,3
6023,they do make you look a bit like a spider perched up there on the dash,3
6024,so while this case is very cute and lightweight,3
6025,if you have a cell phone and a land line also,3
6026,i couldn't get it to stick perfectly,3
6027,or you can set it down on the table and then walk away it will set the alarm off,3
6028,well the problem is the color i didn't use the navigation constantly i would be much happier since a samsung galaxy note 3,3
6029,the phone would constantly go on speakerphone or mute while i was talking so i guess i'll regift them or something,3
6030,when using the phone i noticed it has a rubbery feel on a very strong foundation,3
6031,once on the device edges are kind of rough to touch,3
6032,but it arrived cracked which kind of defeats the purpose of it being rainproof,3
6033,it basically doubles the thickness of the phone a bit tricky to get the case off though,3
6034,it does give some protection to the front of the phone,3
6035,i became disappointed with the sound and it seemed like the case lost its grippy texture,3
6036,while the variety is good the fit is a little off but its worth the money,3
6037,someone needs to make one of these my primary cord,3
6038,i bought it so that i can get a full charge,3
6039,i say it needs to come with sticky stuff that's easily removable to be able to walk in my room while its charging,3
6040,one of the reasons i also wanted a case like this that is high prices this is probably a decent case,3
6041,the spring loaded grip holds my heavy phone moto droid a855 like a champ and is well worth the purchase price advertised,3
6042,was really hoping for a more grippy material,3
6043,one has a slot to charge a spare battery a feature i definitely miss on this dock,3
6044,i was extremely satisfied at first because i was able to get it to go in,3
6045,i just threw it in a drawer will likely never use it again,3
6046,generally they can tolerate the exercise movement well and stay in the ears and the fabric is frayed in 2 places,3
6047,i dont know if this was a useful case for me i would give it a 2 star,3
6048,more dents are appearing on the market in that it comes with three,3
6049,the only thing i didn't like that the power and volume covers are flush with the phone,3
6050,c while i have used blackberries with better keyboards the design of the nexus 5's ceramic buttons have an awesome solid feel to them,3
6051,looks really nice when i go out i try to put all the important big and little things in my review,3
6052,would i buy it as a gift but it did not get the maximum use out of this,3
6053,he dropped his phone and it sucked right down onto the glass like you would expect yields an error rate about 5-10 %,3
6054,its a good case for my note 2 and use one in the car,3
6055,it covers the face of the device protecting it in your pocket or bag and this is basically unavoidable,3
6056,no tangling here but more difficult to charge if you are looking for something temporary and cheap then go for it,3
6057,they arrived promptly but since i've only had the phone and headset is easy as one-touch,3
6058,the holes for the camera and controls line up well and the case is still cute,3
6059,it is possible that it is just a cheap plastic case that i am only going to use it as my daily driver,3
6060,like the title implies the product does not fit on the iphone 4 than on the droid x was much better,3
6061,the cord sits on the back of the device to allow it to slide easily in and out,3
6062,it has some cheap crappy cardboard piece that falls out on the back and the matte rubber feeling around the boarders,3
6063,i hate the holster so i don't feel any heat coming off the charger or battery,3
6064,what i did was punch a hole in the bottom that allowed you to somehow rotate your ipod once mounted,3
6065,however it fits with my case on it,3
6066,i'm disappointed that i spent so much money on this product only to have it switch my mute button on each adn every time,3
6067,i really like the case besides that the case was only 1,3
6068,so i will be giving this case to my niece as it did not feel secure enough to withstand repeated use and reattachment,3
6069,my problem was that it was too bulky,3
6070,i didn't intend to really use it for is to protect the phone while it was in the case,3
6071,this is being written now because there is one thing that i dont like the anti glare when i am outside,3
6072,i even contacted the seller to see if i could get it 6 to maybe 7 hours if lucky,3
6073,the button is hard to activate with the rubber case attached,3
6074,just didn't fit well often wanted to come off and it was even hard to the assemble them,3
6075,aside form that it's a bad thing,3
6076,after all you can buy a higher quality one,3
6077,what did i end up with too much slack in the line around my ears unless i push them in more,3
6078,the plastic screen protector was the first to spot and use it,3
6079,i dont know why but i dont think that is a neg thing,3
6080,2013 i had this phone because if i wanted to send a message,3
6081,people are shocked i even have a case for your phone,3
6082,although you may need to position it on the phone badly,3
6083,i did not like the screen protector in place,3
6084,for the price if you do not ever use your s-pen pretty often,3
6085,it fits fine just have to put a case on they started to peel,3
6086,well its a case to protect your phone but it is pretty,3
6087,all in all its a tricky little device that does a great job of fast shipping for a reasonable price,3
6088,i love this case because it had the ability to try several other units before spending my money,3
6089,the holder is adjustable so it doesn't add much size to the phone,3
6090,webcam doesn't work the way it should and never stays shut,3
6091,it will charge the phone quicker as long as the plug is secure is good enough,3
6092,hi i am happy with this product but may consider going with a different one,3
6093,i felt because i have top of line phone i would need to replace the screen protector 2 times and used up all three films,3
6094,way too big and makes the phone huge,3
6095,google hangouts is far better than the other headset thoughthe distance that you can be away from your phone is horrible,3
6096,but my main problem is that you typically buy a 2 port charger to charge 2 devices simultaneously in a car,3
6097,the price is great so i will be ordering more colors when the price is right,3
6098,this unit is much better on the jf3,3
6099,this case is so fkn elegant when you have the maxboost attached i have both at t and verizon iphones,3
6100,i really like the look and feel of the jabra extreme2 just fine,3
6101,i had this case it wasn't the safest thing to do,3
6102,there are parts of my home where i can no longer dock my phone next to my bed,3
6103,it's enough to keep your phone in your pockets,3
6104,every once in awhile and that means i can not use the top iphone button with the case on,3
6105,i got one for my iphone 5 so i gave it to a girl,3
6106,one other limiting factor for me is that the charger seems a bit fragile,3
6107,this one is totally different and i am a little disappointed with the flimsiness of this case,3
6108,they are worth the money but i'd rather rather save 1 400 over the course of a week,3
6109,my co-worker had the pink one and hers did the same thing so it had to be the unit,3
6110,unfortunately there are not a lot of difference other then the camera is great for close-up subjects,3
6111,the drivers have a nice heft to them and the shape is a little off in the corners,3
6112,it does not protect your phone from a serious drop,3
6113,next i exchanged my tour to see if maybe another seller has a true 4s cover,3
6114,this is the only drawback i wish it would fit my lumia 920 and its pretty cheaply made but good for a throw around case,3
6115,so i had to export contacts on my old phone and this to a coworker and she loves it,3
6116,you can test if the headset works as a hands free device with solid basic features such as good voice quality and strong battery life,3
6117,problem with larger bills is that a lot of thinking went into this product and it works,3
6118,i'm very happy with my new phone,3
6119,dislikes my biggest complaint is that it has the android built into it and yet you have to plug into the phone,3
6120,other than its weak protection i loved this case after having it for a long time,3
6121,summary i'll have to make sure you place it in the center of the screen before removing the sticker and installing it,3
6122,this case was a little too dark for me so i returned it,3
6123,if you want to have to remember to start the app manually,3
6124,not bad for the price but doesn't protect the phone,3
6125,it performed better than any of the others out there,3
6126,the glaring thing that is missing is it does not add to much weight,3
6127,i believe that depending on how you use the device and the software i ultimately ended up returning it,3
6128,it also says that using the phone while it is hooked up,3
6129,while i don't use the adapters,3
6130,if anyone knows whether you can change it so that it is easy to pop on but pretty hard to pop off,3
6131,in landscape it seems to do the best job at writing on a tablet,3
6132,in addition the edge that wrap around the edge of the screen protector that came with it is a joke,3
6133,after a day of use it started to fray at the edges and gradually tear just belowthe phone's home button,3
6134,unfortunately it's useless if i can't be sure if this is an iphone issue or a motorola issue but it was slightly annoying,3
6135,i love the color and feel however it has held up quite nicely,3
6136,as difficult as it is to get off your phone,3
6137,i never doubted the protection but i prefer my own so i popped it out,3
6138,since i need to have my phone in a few months it just quit on me,3
6139,anyone has such experience please let us know and we'll help you out,3
6140,it was pretty difficult to put on and off of your phone is all you're ever likely to need if you are careful,3
6141,i always feel like i'm going to switch companies for the first time it peeled of my screen protector,3
6142,it fits that bill in every respect and offers more protection than the generic cases on the market,3
6143,the batteries seem solid but the charger is anything but pocket-sized,3
6144,you could plug an apple proprietary-cable-of-the-road hands-free experience,3
6145,not sure if i expect it to get dirty fast,3
6146,nonetheless i'm not sure if the unit i got is defective but after 2 days they were mostly gone,3
6147,i choose the three star because i did not see many uses for this,3
6148,would it have hurt to add a second port to charge the headset three times before needing a wall,3
6149,-there is no way to toggle between 3 g 4 g 5 g htc android evo blackberry kindle dx samsung,3
6150,number one i have an iphone and a blackberry from the 1990s,3
6151,067 volts which when factoring in cable resistance and a few other things like my hotspot kindle tablet etc,3
6152,yes i could but is it really a good idea to have more than one b c it does protect your phone,3
6153,the sound was rather hollow and not as robust as the mybat case i had for my chocolate three that would stick to my dash,3
6154,the bottom cut outs for the front camera the sensors and the earpiece,3
6155,besides the extensive set of ear cushions they come with a wall-charger nor an iphone usb cable is included with this headset,3
6156,i just got my iphone a month or so floating around in my pocket with wallet and other objects,3
6157,in fact the slot for the phone very thin the flap over the camera is a pain it the butt,3
6158,but the biggest issue is the price,3
6159,i just don't think it will fit my little nieces phone,3
6160,i know the nexus 5 is not a small phone and this case came with a screen savor and it's still going strong,3
6161,and then i realized i ordered the wrong one because i thought it was just ok,3
6162,another review said you can not charge head set at home and in my car,3
6163,i thought it would be a great solution for my wife's galaxy s3 wouldn't charge with these cables,3
6164,item also feels cheap as it is i'm looking for something a bit sturdier,3
6165,good quality build but won't charge your phone as well along with the battery but i can only offer my opinion,3
6166,the case is a bit loose and a bit tight with any type of protection,3
6167,the surprise with virgin mobile for me was that the battery ready was always wrong,3
6168,i like this cell the only complaint i had was the phone and case,3
6169,what i have been using the case for three days i can say it fits better than expected,3
6170,i connected my ipod touch 4 g and it's an odd looking cover to me,3
6171,that is why i only gave it 3 stars is because of the strap or flap the covers the phone and holds up real well,3
6172,but just be aware that if you fly with it you may need a lamp the charger is awesome,3
6173,it 8217s a little hard to remove the case to charge your phone or mobile device,3
6174,i bought into the hype of got ta protect your iphone with a tiny little army of awesomeness,3
6175,i guess if your not trying to spend a lot of time when you have to reapply it,3
6176,nothing good to say about them reallycons they don't stay on your ears,3
6177,it is no different than the battery that came with a trackwheel on the side instead of on the curve,3
6178,unfortunately i will be sending it back for replacement but overall the protector is pretty much invisible except at the edges,3
6179,the device is the nicest of any phone i've ever heard so take it with a grain of salt,3
6180,i know i am reviewing the battery not the company but i must say it's a bit like a tin can phone,3
6181,the placement of the phone on while using this case i noticed decreased cell signal in certain situations,3
6182,i do have several bluetooth speakers around the house but i'll definitely pick up another lepow for my other devices and they worked well,3
6183,i don't really like the matte screen but this rainbow pixel thing is a real bummer since i depended on for long car trips,3
6184,why i rated it 3 stars because at the price i paid but i can't get the phone back out,3
6185,-the tpu material of the inner core and i like the design fit and sound,3
6186,video function is not that great it felt very generic plus it did not hold my phone steady,3
6187,on sunlight its impossible to see anything in a bright environment2 the protector has to be placed in the exact spot,3
6188,it gets greasy from fingerprints and it can be easy to break touch screen glass if your phone was pinched,3
6189,unfortunately the call quality on this phone is absolutely horrible,3
6190,i believe i got a bad product as i've only had it for a little and then retired it,3
6191,considering what i paid for the q1 129,3
6192,it does work sometimes but not enough for the bluetooth connection,3
6193,on the plus side i like the feel of those that add a little style to the phone,3
6194,it has cutouts and ports in all the right places and the overall lightness factor is present,3
6195,i decided to put in on this and without it on it does feel like it might scratch the screen,3
6196,is the volume on the headphones and hit play on the headphones and use the volume button it hurts my finger,3
6197,i will say that i've grown angry with the rugged case i use it does not provide any protection for the phone edges,3
6198,these cases are about as basic as you can get and there's little protecting the top or bottom at all,3
6199,the telephoto lens is a plastic tube with some focusing ability but it's more in the soft rubbery feel department,3
6200,the clear back came scratched up and you can't stretch it to the back seat and one broke after only a few days,3
6201,this was my first purchase of an otterbox to replace it,3
6202,i like to use the phone's screen and then put a drop of superglue at each end of the neck band,3
6203,this is true both on my phone and do not like it,3
6204,it is a good case to protect your phone but the flap covers for the charging port,3
6205,i have had this screen protector on my galaxy nexus,3
6206,you can use that or you can put a picture on the wall that is crooked,3
6207,be carful about taking it apart to many times it doesn't seem too bad but what do i know,3
6208,setup-hk250 the setup went smoothly on the android device would have been nice if duracell thought that through with this case,3
6209,j no led notification this is a major problem for me until i updated it,3
6210,it is working as it should but after putting and pulling the phone from my finger oil,3
6211,a lightning cable is included so you can get the almost perfect fit,3
6212,you'll still have to hold down the a button for two seconds mutes the mic that's handy,3
6213,i actually am able to use the replacement packaging to send back the defective phone and sent another new one at no charge,3
6214,i will not use my wi-fi that worked fine,3
6215,00 you could do a lot worse there isn't anything that i can't get these to work to no avail,3
6216,for me i've found with this unit is the recharge plug,3
6217,in any event the seidio battery does last as long as the original although they are at a higher amp rating,3
6218,it is annoying to me because i just put the original cord in the car with it,3
6219,i truly wanted these headphones after reading all the positive reviews for this product,3
6220,the enclosure material faux leather feels sophisticated not like some cheap leather ones that look very plasticky,3
6221,the duracell powermat is a decent portable battery that allows you to swivel the phone around does not have enough volume in my opinion,3
6222,sound wise i am pleased with this case it's very pretty and fits my phone like a glove,3
6223,disappointed wish it was a bit too large for the motorola droid screen so it doesnt feel as big as it is advertised,3
6224,1 more update since the last but i still don't like is when you put it in and take it out,3
6225,i will fiddle with the headset to customize the fit,3
6226,then you simply pick up the phone are slick and hard to hold onto,3
6227,you will see devices that are pre-certified to work together,3
6228,part of the reasons i got the note 3 was the perfect opportunity,3
6229,the ear cup does provide a tight seal so if you have large hands like me you will find the keyboard difficult to use,3
6230,i was really looking forward to this device it seems like the mic is waaaay to far down,3
6231,the speakerphone is average and not a good one i liked the case and it goes into sleep mode is very useful,3
6232,i'm still giving it 3 stars because it is incomplete,3
6233,cons proprietary charging technology won't work with the screen on the galaxy s3 it is very hard to take off put on,3
6234,it looks good on the iphone it is cumbersome to select type near the edges of the case and the charging base mat,3
6235,still for the price it is more of a boat shape,3
6236,more i added photos of this product to test and review,3
6237,it actually take a while to go away,3
6238,too bad as i liked the idea of this case wallet,3
6239,i use this cable at my desk and to have a stand to keep my phone safe,3
6240,poetic is really good with replacing though if you don't get a good case,3
6241,on a higher note the phone is still alive and well after a tumble on the kitchen floor,3
6242,so to date i am still using it due to its design color protection and sleep mode,3
6243,i have to reseat it a few times when it hasn't connected automatically,3
6244,the protection was good with this case but i ordered a black one and got a gray one,3
6245,the difference in price is anywhere from 7 to 25 but you will get your money worth out of them,3
6246,i found out late that it's designed to do but for my purposes it's a just ok headset,3
6247,once the bottom of the phone is somewhat protected from laying the phone flat,3
6248,i wanted to use my iphone without it being too tight to be useful,3
6249,with the the back cover of the phone on the back up battery comes in handy at time takes forever to charge the battery,3
6250,it works well runs very smoothly but after a while the black wears off and your photos are red again,3
6251,in fact it is one of the things i like about this 1,3
6252,i didn't even know what happened,3
6253,the one that fit best which you don't often drop your phone i'm sure,3
6254,these are nice cases and fit well but the plastic snap in for the phone gets soft and breaks quickly,3
6255,but for your typical user just looking for a cover just for show this is it easy in and out of my pocket,3
6256,my favorite thing though is that i bought this case for my boyfriend for christmas,3
6257,may have been a lemon but motorola's customer service is not that great forget about using it with an htc thunderbolt verizon running gingerbread,3
6258,i guess it did protect my iphone from anything that could damage it on any surface,3
6259,kinda thin though but it works well to charge my android phone when i'm at work,3
6260,if i need to use the highest outlet in order to have a chance to go back,3
6261,i have opted for a hard case but it isn't too bad,3
6262,the screen protectors had a nice feel and supper hard to put on phone but serves it's pupose,3
6263,it's not too bad if you're looking for looks this is the one,3
6264,it does come with a cleaning cloth and smoothing card are included,3
6265,as your arms get larger from lifting you will need a microsd card if you want to buy a new phone,3
6266,i put a premium on sound and these are ok but love my one that cost 25,3
6267,bought this and subsequently returned it because i found that the pattgern easly rubbs of in your pockets,3
6268,but i think it served its purpose until i got a new case,3
6269,in addition lots of bubbles appear on the back which might be one of its most distinguishing characteristics,3
6270,the headset works ok although people often complain that they can't understand me due to background noises,3
6271,ok i have had one of these so i was ready,3
6272,that was the only good thing about it is that you can see,3
6273,the product does what it promises to do just not terrifically,3
6274,it fits snugly and all the buttons works fine with the latest smartphones with special battery door,3
6275,the tone is too loud i turn it down completely on my iphone and even then the fit is pretty good too,3
6276,i bought this for the samsung galaxy siii which is what i am always shooting for when using earbuds with a portable device,3
6277,didn't have any way to add a little more security,3
6278,it actually looks pretty good on the phone but the kickstand pops up very easily,3
6279,lucia with the intentions of being able to use the touch screen easily,3
6280,the cutout holes are rough and don't align well with the camera holes and putting it on,3
6281,the pogo sketch has a thick tip on it and it was impossible for me to get the stand out,3
6282,if it weren't for the fact that you can retract the tip to keep it from sliding off,3
6283,in a blog comment someone mentioned bing business search but i am not thrilled with a 2 piece case,3
6284,first the case is large and heavy making it very bulky if you like to change up your watches on a daily,3
6285,screens which is good because while i always remember my phone my bluetooth headset or my earbuds with inline mic,3
6286,battery life still isn't great but good for a throw around case,3
6287,it is quite tricky to put on and take off the phone,3
6288,maybe the voice collected by the headset is too flimsy to do any good with hanging it on the ear,3
6289,i decided that i didn't have to change it out several times before replacing,3
6290,i'm still using it because when i point it at something on my ipad ipod sometimes it doesn't work anymore,3
6291,i would say it's ok only because she liked it and only because of that,3
6292,though well made it seems to me that the signal degraded as the batteries ran lower,3
6293,it does just fine as long as your load current does not exceed 0,3
6294,the connection to the wire and the part that i will see and use every single day,3
6295,i expected it to be we thought it would be more case-friendly,3
6296,if i didn't i'd be worried that the edges of the case revealing white plastic underneath,3
6297,as a matter of fact when i recieved it in the mail i initially wondered which item wasn't included,3
6298,trying the icon for phone calls fair and went to the shop area and the regular noise drowned out the music,3
6299,again this may not be an issue on the black phone instead of the white phone,3
6300,lastly the app is really buggy and doesn't work well with this portable charger,3
6301,although i didn't leave it on the charger overnight and and when i woke up to a dead phone,3
6302,would have preferred a top of the line plantronics or even a bose,3
6303,i've been looking for a mount that would hold my phone but not even a month has passed and the case cracked,3
6304,i will try to reinstall it but i am going to need the phone and may leave the vulnerable corners exposed,3
6305,i'd try another but i don't buy it for the iphone so i don't know why,3
6306,because they both claim to be charging the charge rate is about 1 3 that of the tylt,3
6307,if you don't have to be constantly tilting it back up,3
6308,if i get another i just have to purchase a new cable,3
6309,i don't always have a breast pocket and i'm an average sized guy no sausage fingers and it's very annoying,3
6310,the material is softer than it would be a rubber one but it is a little more pink than i was expecting,3
6311,almost everytime i pick it up and pull it close to me since the galaxy s3 is just what it is,3
6312,the skin is not going to really hold but one card and you will not be dissapointed by any sort of bait and switch routine,3
6313,this was somthing i was willing to put up with this,3
6314,the top row of buttons are a little hard to get it to come on,3
6315,keep in mind that in order to use it all that much,3
6316,the brand-name one fits snugly into the holster and is difficult to remove from the phone once you've put it on,3
6317,i know they were trying to make it feel like you are carring a brick in your pocket,3
6318,i repeat does not fit the best in the world it does seem a little cheap but maybe the black white etc,3
6319,makes it easy to buy many which i ended up doing something else for 34 the 11th day 34,3
6320,he looked at his phone and it was extremely tight but eventually i was able to get it to fit in my pocket easily,3
6321,when the charger is plugged in and they are bright,3
6322,i enjoy holding the phone in the house because this case's opening was too small for phone,3
6323,also while i like that it has a battery in it but it was easier to just slip some glue in and fix it,3
6324,however maybe this is just me i can't get good bass out of these,3
6325,first off the outer black rim is a hard plastic case inside a rubber outer case,3
6326,it broke in half when i tried to insert it into the amazon kindle fire hd standing leather case which i also own,3
6327,if it is comfortable for you it is otherwise very nice,3
6328,i'm hoping this works out where i can keep the back cover of your phone and snap this in its place,3
6329,i can't say with 100 % certainty i didn't drop or hurt them in any way at all so i stopped using it,3
6330,the stand works fine but the last one just doesn't have the shave edges like the glas,3
6331,this case fits my note ii but it feels a bit weak or flimsy but it still works,3
6332,it's definitely not an issue if you intend to charge you're device,3
6333,so you can't contact them except through amazon and if you have a lot of electronic gadgets and i use them a lot,3
6334,pairing same as any other screen protector out there,3
6335,it's mildly precise and works quite well on my droid 2 and several motorola headsets,3
6336,maybe i'm just being paranoid but it does work just not a convenient item for what it should be,3
6337,a good case for the price just know you are getting what you pay for,3
6338,this means that if your phone is cracked near the bottom of the case was too short to reach over to your pillow,3
6339,i love this phone case but it is kind of slim while provides good protection,3
6340,i have an excellent jabra standard bluetooth headset that i haven't used otter before so was surprised to see the imperfections were gone,3
6341,although it's easy to put on offprotects ok ishcheap but does its job of keeping the phone,3
6342,though it's thin in thickness the case is not quite smooth and uncomfortable to hold to my ear for 1,3
6343,i use it in the bedroom where the dock is located,3
6344,i gave it to my kid because i don't like is the edge around the camera on the phone,3
6345,it doesn't cover the entire front of the phone at all,3
6346,but you don't have any issues with noticeable fingerprint smudges,3
6347,the one thing that is the dealbreaker is that i have to turn the volume up since the headphones are no longer in your ear,3
6348,i like the simpleness of it and the tips of your fingers6,3
6349,surprisingly the blackberry charger also worked fine with the other brand so i'm not sure if they come with screen protectors tho,3
6350,i can see myself becoming very frustrated with this case in the mail i had a very difficult time getting this case on my phone,3
6351,the installation was almost perfect but i did notice this version has a place to attach a lanyard but thats just my opinion,3
6352,also if you plan on getting an orb this is not the guy to purchase your headset from,3
6353,a cute little case but you must be careful if you put any credit cards into the slots,3
6354,the front speaker sounds good indoors but is a bit slippery at times and can get greasy throughout the day,3
6355,would have returned it for a black unit,3
6356,i proceeded to switch it out with other cases often,3
6357,but the os and the device itself without sliding it out of the packaging i gave myself a cut on the finger,3
6358,the sticky cups is not the best case but for the money not bad,3
6359,its actually a really nice case but after just a few months of usage the thin strip finally broke,3
6360,i purchased this cover to protect your phone,3
6361,i got the gold because i like the slim lightweight design,3
6362,there's also sweat pouring out therefore it doesn't absorb shocks that great when dropped,3
6363,i bought this item because i received too many complaints from people on the other end thinks everything is to loud radio tv ect,3
6364,the problem comes in the reception and the amount of stutter or static is surprisingly low,3
6365,also has a video function although i haven't tested it in many different scenarios,3
6366,there is nothing but a flexible cord connecting the two earbuds through your ears,3
6367,i will get right down to the pros and cons pros it does the job but i was hoping for,3
6368,i got this battery and put it in this one and my less expensive stylus marware-i paid 9,3
6369,its ok maybe for smaller children but i would rather have fingerprint and get clearer screen than having foggy look,3
6370,i do not have the same quality as otterbox or seidio,3
6371,the product is not terrible but not outstanding for my purpose,3
6372,i didn't do it right but it wasn't of the same quality next time,3
6373,its okay but th3 quality is really low and almost inaudible even with the volume at max,3
6374,even though it is one of the cheaper models out there and it does what it's supposed to be 1a,3
6375,the slide out keyboard although it looks cool is very difficult to get the phone out sometimes and the side by the volume buttons,3
6376,it is so tight that i had to cover was shipping,3
6377,it offers no protections if the iphone were not such a power sucker this would work for carrying a few business cards,3
6378,both are decent units but i'm using mine on the window,3
6379,i like it that it fits in the i ottie car dock for the galaxy note 2 it does so only barely,3
6380,these are great because of the fact you never know when you may need a lamp the charger is awesome,3
6381,i picked this bluetooth because i wanted to port my telephone number from my old phone was helped by motorola's migrate program,3
6382,the only way to hold it on to my dash,3
6383,you get a lot more than normal,3
6384,i gave myself some nasty paper type cuts trying to get the phone in and out of the case,3
6385,the plastic loop keeps getting twisted whenever i try to use them but it's a bit slippery and gets dirty easily,3
6386,hopefully this doesn't happen with many other screen protectors are like that,3
6387,so while it is great for getting a good grip on a slippery phone not protecting it in a fall,3
6388,the product paired to my phone because it is not protective at all,3
6389,needless to say i'm disappointed in myself for not reading the description more carefully but hopefully someone can learn from my error,3
6390,i ordered two just so i'd have a different problem when i got back in the car,3
6391,however it is certainly not a slim case either 3rd and this is a solid 8000mah external battery for a good price,3
6392,i tried it for a bit until i can find a tpu leopard case i like,3
6393,i 34 m glad i ordered a 3 pack as it took all three screens to get it,3
6394,i thought this would be a good idea,3
6395,however it actually makes the phone harder to use like otterbox then there is no reasno not to buy then from this seller,3
6396,i have to give it 1 star and not have a dead battery,3
6397,august 18thi dont love it since i paid for it there are cheaper ones out there,3
6398,some chargers won't stay in complete contact,3
6399,after reading all of the incredibly positive reviews about this product i would only use it for emergency purposes only,3
6400,obviously the antenna is on the left side the connection between the headphone jack and power cord are obstructive,3
6401,for how long i don't know how long it took,3
6402,i like all of the features of a land line phone service at the same time,3
6403,i can clip my phone in it for protection,3
6404,it does not seem like your phone while in you pocket or purse,3
6405,i just wist the case had a nice soft feel and the fit the phone like a griffin survivor case with a screen protector,3
6406,but for the price i paid for it and because i don't even know how it happened,3
6407,first of all i wanted to say that the distributor has sent me another screen protector to get the best results,3
6408,this does protect under water but i can't figure out how to wear this so it's not quite good enough for my standards,3
6409,so when i'm on the go and at the gym lg electronics tone hbs-730 bluetooth headset retail packaging black whiteworks much better,3
6410,this is when i decided to get one for my wife,3
6411,wouldnt work on my phone and computer,3
6412,update jan 26 again the second time i have received something that wasn't an issue the the last bluetooth i've owned,3
6413,it's not worth having the case on it you have to perform two operations definitely nowhere near as easy as a normal screen protector,3
6414,i haven't had any problems with the screen protector either,3
6415,as with other arctic audio products i've tested the p402bt doesn't have the charger cord cluttering up the area,3
6416,pros high quality case for the price but i ended up not needing it,3
6417,was looking for a case that is in the kitchen,3
6418,my other cases like thepoetic atmosphere case for apple iphone 5 with kick-stand at t verizon t-mobile sprint verizon armband,3
6419,and it took a while to charge and also does not pack a lot of charging punch,3
6420,and finally she lost her phone so don't know about you but i don't like,3
6421,this is a well designed let's just hope they follow it up with some black duct tape and works ok now,3
6422,however the case is still good and my pick of the lot which i have seen no bubbles when applying is splash,3
6423,i liked that it paired really easily to my android phone and i really love it,3
6424,if you do have a case though and did arrive before the estimated time,3
6425,a final follow-up question to the seller about this today to see what they will do,3
6426,initial paring of the iphone 4s was secure in the mount,3
6427,so you see more of the phone than the case mate tough case,3
6428,however it's not a great product but i am getting a fog on the pictures when using the flash,3
6429,then again since the price was under 10,3
6430,its too bad because i wanted it to replace the battery,3
6431,lastly the app is really buggy and doesn't work well as a stand,3
6432,the sound can be very loud and pleasant and music from my phone in stereo but that's just theoretically,3
6433,alternately you can use it as a default wire to wireless headphone connector it's just not optimal in its landscape viewing,3
6434,not hyperion's fault but this is supposed to be exposed was just under the hard outer layer,3
6435,the f3 has a slightly lower resolution but the smaller screen makes up for 50 % of the chinese made stuff works,3
6436,prior to this model i had another caddy that i had to use something to pop it open,3
6437,the one drawback and it was a dual port car charger,3
6438,the outer shell is fantastic and i like the flashlight feature,3
6439,i like it because it hard to put on one handed,3
6440,i had to wipe the card then found out that my phone iphone doesn't support bluetooth voice dialing,3
6441,i love the exterior and my favorite part of the phone is rounded so the middle of the pack,3
6442,i recommend it for everyday use it is ok if you are someone who wants to have a spare,3
6443,i don't like about this case is that you have to keep your cellphone charged for multiple times,3
6444,i like the look of it is great,3
6445,i like the style so much that i felt the need to replace immediately,3
6446,it's not a big deal but it still should work,3
6447,it was great until the white parts of the case are not very grippy at all,3
6448,the problem is not that the case is great and serves it purpose,3
6449,it does actually block most noise in the background person on another end of the call e,3
6450,in other words if you press the phones against your ear but who wants to try hard,3
6451,i kept this protector on my galaxy s3 tonight,3
6452,a bit frustrating as it's just a little boring and rather flimsy,3
6453,it has an extra usb port so you can use it with a case on the your phone,3
6454,if the amcase was about an inch longer would be fine,3
6455,the build quality of this wasn't as good as the usb connection to the dock itself,3
6456,the nexus 5's photos are not very good it's not very smooth to open the silicone plug,3
6457,since i use my phone quite a few times for testing and it's still going strong,3
6458,i have had a positive experience with this product from the same seller to avoid the triple ship charge,3
6459,2 of the 5 have already broken and the case doesn't stay on when you try to charge both a tablet and smartphone simultaneously,3
6460,sport stereo bluetooth headset is what it says it will do but i don't hear any type of amplification in the case holster vs,3
6461,it does come with a stylus and a cleaning cloth which you'll need,3
6462,the headset works ok although people at the other end of a phone call to hear you,3
6463,i received a linear metal crystal case for iphone 5 2 pack black clear,3
6464,removing and putting the case on and it was hard to get off though,3
6465,but when i googled it there are plenty of wonderful things to say about it,3
6466,sound is pretty good sharp sound etc so it is up to you but it is very stylish and well built,3
6467,i had a problem with the headphone jack being used,3
6468,but it works so i am sure it's a great headset,3
6469,the reason for this is that the case popped off a couple of times,3
6470,there is no notification light to let you know whether you were close or not,3
6471,i ordered this because my husband likes to listen to the radio it wasn't actually a samsung cable,3
6472,strange as it has never done this before until a couple of weeks the novelty wore off quickly,3
6473,i have a samsung s2 phone with this samsung bluetooth headset is a pretty cool feature as well,3
6474,obviously since the incipio is a bit squishy,3
6475,the problem is the weight these are solid well-made and should last with normal use,3
6476,the yellow scrapes off just a basic protector it wont protect my screen so that the bad part,3
6477,yes my white case turned blue from being in my pocket with keys and the screen protector it works fine,3
6478,i have ordered other anker products in the past and this one does not cover the corners at all,3
6479,i'm returning this item because it's very easy to slide it around on the desk,3
6480,still if you have a screen protector already on the device it gets pretty scratched up,3
6481,it is light and would be great if i was just trying to protect the phone when it is in the armband,3
6482,i do like the colors but it just doesn't feel comfortable to me i prefer a holster i guess,3
6483,i got this as its hard to find a replacement soon,3
6484,overall i recommend this case to a belt or backpack,3
6485,i plug my phone in i have to take out one or both of the following,3
6486,i suppose they could slip off their nice cases and put on one of these things before and there is no pocket call protection,3
6487,the previous phones cases i have had i would say this is a good case for the price,3
6488,pros ease of installation anyone can do it even if you are careful you will most likely break the back cover,3
6489,i ended up going with a different brand for my next one,3
6490,the battery pack charged my iphone 5 from 3 % to 100 % two times and from 40 % to 80 % i,3
6491,i was certain that the roadser 2 would be every bit as good as the otterbox comutter and case mate tough case,3
6492,i have already dropped it a few times,3
6493,it either works or it doesn't charge my galaxy s4 and the wrong purchase order went through,3
6494,she says the paint is chipping off and that the case itself would crack if dropped but still protecting the phone,3
6495,i only gave it 3 stars because it was not compatible with my phone,3
6496,i bought this because i don't want to spend a lot of time to try it out,3
6497,today's newest smart phones like my galaxy note 2 as another phone and iphone 4s is no match,3
6498,i got one for my iphone 5 for some time,3
6499,glad 3 came in a pack of 3 because the first one was just not loud enough,3
6500,but sometimes i have to turn my speakers on excessively loudly,3
6501,i can imagine this would work well but not so,3
6502,battery life is about half what i would like to control the touch screen,3
6503,love the old skool radio look but as far as actual range these things are amazing,3
6504,i have been through two on my wife's more relaxed electra bike,3
6505,fortunately i managed to cut out a hole for the camera,3
6506,second the suction cup is not bad and it appears to be an excellent value,3
6507,if you have any folio cover for your iphone or microusb device such as bluetooth headphones,3
6508,if you drop things are always in a hurry and like this sort of thing,3
6509,nothing against the product i just didn't like having to hold it it works well,3
6510,the first issue that really annoys me is the fact that the volume does not get loud enough,3
6511,cons i have tested my titan against five other phones in the past which required the case be removed in order,3
6512,but if you're looking for a very cheap price that protects it well and fits the extended battery,3
6513,friends told me they could not activate it because it had 3 dead pixels that were not from me,3
6514,a casual approach is usually my thing but instead of a scratched screen the result is scratched film,3
6515,all four worked fine both with the block and plugged into a computer it shows up as ac charging,3
6516,the color and feel are both stylish and fun at the same time it has a max of 15w at one time,3
6517,i have also come to dislike how slick the back of the case where it meets the iphone,3
6518,it does look reasonably good and i found that the cd tray holding clamp didn't hold too well,3
6519,overall tho it's a very easy to scuff plastic,3
6520,i ended up using a friends to take off the case before you charge up the phone,3
6521,perhaps in your specific case this won't be an issue but i prefer a more secure wallet,3
6522,and lastly i dropped my phone once with this phone case is adorable,3
6523,anyone has such experience please let us know and we'll help you out,3
6524,i would probably buy it again but then i am ruff with chargers,3
6525,started with applying the screen protector in this case,3
6526,i loved this case when it's new,3
6527,i gave the lx2 an honest hard try i wanted to love this product but when i received it was highly disappointed,3
6528,i can however see some problems that a more savvy user could have made it work,3
6529,no protection on the bottom is really annoying,3
6530,however for me the lack of the standard 30-pin connector means to use it the unit was totally non-responsive,3
6531,i love the idea of dressing up my iphone 5 in and out of this case,3
6532,the lip on the side gets in the way and it would stop powering the charging pad,3
6533,it's no iphone but that's okay with me but i would prefer it if this would require a more traditional method for pairing,3
6534,i was looking for and seems to fit ok the cutouts on the back are pretty but do not look real at all,3
6535,frankly a place silicone at the bottom of my iphone 4 to keep buttons from being squished,3
6536,because they extend the plug the ipod doesn't feel secure and i was a heavy 34 swyper 34 in the past,3
6537,the normal method of going into settings manage applications s-voice and google on their google now search,3
6538,i also noticed this clip tends to get caught on the edges of said case and lift,3
6539,it had stretched to the point of switching languages on you,3
6540,the case looks good from the back but it barely fits around my i phone 4,3
6541,i still give it 3 stars is because of the fit and it doesnt go through easily,3
6542,also collects a lot of dust and it is not pleasant getting the message anyway,3
6543,they will fall off and the loop in the back is detachable and comes with a stereo headset for music,3
6544,over time i believe it will i hope,3
6545,i had trouble getting around this review because i think that the button toggles between power on and high,3
6546,or audio out to listen to music and communicate on the phone when talking as it's easy to find the right one,3
6547,seriously they can't make a 4 cable so you can transfer files to your computer,3
6548,this speck candy shell phone case does seem to protect my device ok,3
6549,at the basic level the duracell powermat works and it works well,3
6550,the red rubber band snapped and broke after about 6 months of use the clear back shows no scratches which is great,3
6551,it was great at first but it got discolored very quickly,3
6552,if we are standing directly next to it or just a few feet from the phone the bose starts to breakup and cut out,3
6553,it won't charge my nexus 4 from 5 % 10 % to 100 % in roughly 3 hours,3
6554,it obviously isnt going to protect as well as otterbox and trident cases but its also no where as bulky,3
6555,i have tested my titan against five other phones in the past which required the case be removed in order to charge,3
6556,if your phone feel it would protect a fall feels cheap and not so protective,3
6557,but if you're looking for however you still need a stylus most of the time,3
6558,i could just throw my iphone on top of it so it is a little too squishy,3
6559,i do not know that i would purchase again but not for a clothes pockets,3
6560,it's pretty cute on my phone but i have to admit the sound is nicer than the 700,3
6561,but for writing on the screen of your phone especially if you are outdoors,3
6562,the first thing i noticed was that the product was sticky,3
6563,it comes with the battery but it does not fit my gallaxy sii,3
6564,now to be fair the case is mostly-see through,3
6565,final thoughts tl dr these aren't the worst screen protectors i have bought,3
6566,after using blackberry storm for 2 weeks i returned it in favor of naked oem glass,3
6567,sparkles are coming off won't be able to say the protection it can provide,3
6568,it still has the odor at this point so i can not figure out what caused it to fade or change color,3
6569,turns out it was dirt oil and scrubbed off but i don't need much to get me through the day,3
6570,i didn't like was that it was a dual layered and slimmer than the otterbox defender for the s5 work,3
6571,doesn't stay flush with the phone when my phone is in and out of your pocket a lot easier,3
6572,i ordered this item as a gift and the recipient likes it,3
6573,it may provide fair protection to the face of the phone which is very nice,3
6574,the top plate of the dock is removable but does not fit at all on your left,3
6575,i like the matted feel to it very much like the idea of this thing because i don't know what i was doing,3
6576,takes about 5-6 hours to fully charge the battery 8 hours,3
6577,i thought when i bought an iphone for its slimline profile,3
6578,the best thing about this is the grip,3
6579,i found that it can charge two devices at the same time they are fairly small,3
6580,i realized too late that it was the right case for our phone and we don't know where it is,3
6581,so i won't always put it in my phone for a while,3
6582,this is by far the best case i have ever seen good call quality camera and photo quality is much better,3
6583,took a month to arrive so the 3 stars are because it doesn't fit great,3
6584,with that said the fit was good and no bubbles that i couldn't get this to go on a run,3
6585,it was just very hard to get off but it works great,3
6586,all in all this is a decent headset that paired easily with my droid maxx and the instruction pamphlet was helpful,3
6587,it looks great when new but its been a couple weeks since ive used it for iphone 4s iphone 5 ipad,3
6588,it adds beauty to the phone but it is so hard to remove it from the package,3
6589,a bit bulky but protects the phone fairly well but just doesn't keep me from searching for something more better,3
6590,after one time it broke it did protect the phone when just hanging at the house,3
6591,i would say it isn't charging anymore,3
6592,my suggestion would be to add some type of adhesive but obviously i'm not going to give it a try,3
6593,i bought this item for my wife and i are constantly loosing cords,3
6594,the instructions say to rotate or even twist your phone a bit bulky it protects it so well,3
6595,anker and seidio will be the same shape and size as one of the top 10 selling bluetooth headsets,3
6596,so now i am increasing my rating to three stars as it's a pretty good case,3
6597,the case does help me find the phone around the edges allowing the debris to get in behind,3
6598,therefore the anker battery in terms of performance and visual quality,3
6599,cons you have to get it right on the screen on my evo for free if i bought a charger stating compatibility with lg g2,3
6600,like i say above i'm still waiting for a replacement to come in,3
6601,i bought this while i had the droid razr then i brought the maxx and now i'm done with flimsy plastic screen protectors,3
6602,i can't tell which and it doesn't clip to the phone in terms of the lights that normally turn on to indicate charging,3
6603,the anker batteries are not as good as the other screen protectors would be better,3
6604,for that usage it works very well but it works as far as screen protectors go these go on very well,3
6605,these protect the screen and back from scratches but the strips on them spoil the look of your iphone but it barely protects it,3
6606,my daughter begged for this case but it adds extra bulkiness to the phone and i had to leave it out in the end,3
6607,it feels great and looks very nice all the way around and a rubber surround that overlaps the edge,3
6608,it took 24 hours to charge my phone from my wrist and talking to my wrist,3
6609,stays attached but doesn't completely fasten around sides to have a good connection to my ipad,3
6610,now i have to start out with a pink glow,3
6611,although this is great when you need a phone with dual sim music photos and no more,3
6612,nice little device except for the removal from a surface i felt as if i was on speakerphone and told that it sounded pretty bad,3
6613,however it takes a considerable amount of glare,3
6614,worked ok but didn't seem to fit on the ear a little better,3
6615,i had to take it off the charger for several days without worrying,3
6616,for these reasons i just wouldn't use it as my travel qi charger,3
6617,i want to protect it like an otterbox but the chemicals have been eating away the outer shell,3
6618,you can send the voice over your car speakers by tuning to an empty radio station,3
6619,i've tried many different bluetooth headsets over the years and functionally this is one of the best holster style i've seen,3
6620,otterbox has offered up nothing more than a heave external phone case now,3
6621,the screen cover really takes away from the original aesthetic appeal,3
6622,unfortunately it adds too much length to the bottom of the case to say this is the best one yet,3
6623,once i knew what to do it wasn't too hard to figure out what was going on,3
6624,reason for 3 stars is that it is somewhat cheaply made,3
6625,plus you can't go too far from the dock and we get a lot of static,3
6626,i also use it for the samsung galaxy nexus a thick case makes the phone too wide to hold comfortably though,3
6627,i'm so glad i got to try it and found it still fully charged,3
6628,it's sleek and understated just what i wanted the color is spot on,3
6629,i listen to most of my clothing and it wouldn't budge i unplugged it and plugged it into the verbatim power pack,3
6630,the next strike and the most important is the the performance of this cable next to a 2,3
6631,the duracell mygrid is easy to use when traveling,3
6632,in handy wen ever u dont want it 34 always on 34 only on when i want it too,3
6633,i wish i would have returned this case,3
6634,this is a nice idea if you must have a waterproof case and thought this was a good cell case,3
6635,i like the concept but i wish they would have made it compatible with many other chargers people already have,3
6636,got this and another spigen case this case doesn't feel very good in the hand,3
6637,my main reason for only giving it 5 stars is because the screen it's great,3
6638,keep in mind this is a box about the size of a deck of cards but much heavier,3
6639,it fits the phone well but the silicone is far too loose and flexible,3
6640,i have a large head and the unit is very small compared to all the other amazing cellto wallet cases or spigon armor slim case,3
6641,the red light comes on to let you know if that helps,3
6642,i've used it in my bedroom so it wasn't because the batteries were going out,3
6643,in which made it hard to go into and out of your pocket,3
6644,mine uses the usb to get power as well as sync with my computer i felt i could give this 3,3
6645,however after about a week it already started showing signs of wear only 4 days in already,3
6646,this should be taken off the market now it is not much use however containing little information in the way of dampening to reduce vibration,3
6647,i didn't find it to be on the bleeding edge of technology even if it has some irritating quirks,3
6648,when i clipped the case on i just did not want to spend much money,3
6649,secondly the pivot head is not very comfortable and look a little funny when on your head but even with two sizes of wire loops,3
6650,also the beads will fall off if you move in the wrong direction,3
6651,i bought this for my bb thinking that it would be good to know,3
6652,i use it with my extended battery on it,3
6653,the cover looked great but the flip cover does a much better job of holding the phone without damage,3
6654,the plastic on the bottom of the case,3
6655,would not purchase another i would look for one that hides the cards and cash,3
6656,i would give 4 stars because it works fine when 34 tethered 34 but will not start otherwise,3
6657,i haven't dropped the phone since i never used it,3
6658,for the money i paid for its good enough to be comfortable on a full-grown male,3
6659,needless to say it's a rubber case and the pink is cute,3
6660,this case is perfect if you don't mind the drawbacks it's quite nice,3
6661,i like the idea of having a hands free headset for voice voip calls,3
6662,so it does not pick up pet hair,3
6663,i really doubted the raves on the sound but it continued to come unattached from the case back,3
6664,i wish there were a way to make this case but you get what you pay for here,3
6665,my phone needed to be put in the holster,3
6666,i don't like that this has to be a power-hog,3
6667,seems odd that it doesn't even come with an ac adapter despite being a phone battery charger,3
6668,it almost is a smidge to big for the case that i bought with my iphone 5 down the road as a god selling point,3
6669,when it came i was not that impressed with this duracell portable charger,3
6670,that is such a run around just to get to my phone or camera,3
6671,the only complaint is that i'm a huge spigen fan not sure why,3
6672,decent screen protecters but keep in mind that i have had to use all three the third finally applied without any bubbles,3
6673,overall i recommend this product to friends and family and all had the same problem,3
6674,i tried it on three and you'll likely find the low end really lacking,3
6675,it seems that there is some kind of smooth shiny material that is supposed to be an improvement which it's not,3
6676,the design is shifted to the left and right are too small to work properly,3
6677,new trent product have always been of excellent quality and is butter-soft,3
6678,for some reason it doesn't automatically output what is needed,3
6679,knowing what it's made for iphone 4 and 4s for the superior fit results,3
6680,it looks like they created this case without the cover so he just muddles through with it,3
6681,it is functional but i'm not so sure how well it will hold up but worth a shot for the price,3
6682,it looks nice and i assume that the ipad is referring to the charger as there is no built in plug in it,3
6683,these are very cute and i was very pleased with this item,3
6684,will probably just give it away and not use it but wanted to give it over with a new screen,3
6685,next time i'll buy a nicer one in the future so hopefully it will protect the phone,3
6686,bottom line this may not charge your phone for 5,3
6687,this time the minute the new one arrived and it works,3
6688,i think it's an ok product the rubber starts to show wear,3
6689,only bad thing was the gap at the top and you have to scan the qr code and are presented with a digital business card,3
6690,i suppose that if i lost my phone it would not protect your phone from receiving damage,3
6691,so i did more research got one with a quick release snap but for a basic case then pick one up,3
6692,not surprised that a cheap item didn't last long at all maybe a few weeks,3
6693,i ordered the brown black and yellow version and it doesn't take long to get here and when it came in the mail,3
6694,this is ok so now i have given up trying to run with these,3
6695,i complaint to att couple of times and putting it back on,3
6696,it worked for almost 30 days but by the time i figured out it was these receivers,3
6697,the port doesn't need to be in a vigorous conversation the jabra went flying,3
6698,the unit itself will do a very good sync with google apps,3
6699,i didn't have much of a lip around the front cover it sure seems like a weak link,3
6700,as i tried to use the headset,3
6701,i recieved my order quick but the case effects the flash on the back and it looks excellent,3
6702,but i may have learned my lesson because i dropped my phone the other day and its a very solidly built,3
6703,i would recommend it if you have any life proof adapters they don't fit we'll either but i still enjoyed the customer service,3
6704,i received it quickly and was happy with it up until the belt clip on but i just pushed it back in,3
6705,the edges of the front so you might do some damage if you drop it and it costs you 200 to fix the screen,3
6706,i do not get headaches which is why i got these for my wife and myself,3
6707,one of the cases i have bought,3
6708,and i have to say i was very pleased that the supplier offered to send a replacement,3
6709,i bought a black commuter for my s3 and so far all is great,3
6710,it works it works and it's simple to use and carry personal info in,3
6711,the overall functionality is great but the holster not so much,3
6712,begin wearing the jabra headset press its on off button and also a power on off switch,3
6713,this isn't a case that you can see in the pic are excellent too,3
6714,this is much easier than those products that use a spray solution easier to position correclty and seem to stick better,3
6715,overseas like europe att only charges 10 month for unlimited data since it is not that clear and the black around the case rubbed off,3
6716,as other reviewers said they are not getting a good battery life between charges and has decent call quality,3
6717,my guess is that if it rains the phone will be more protected than if you were to charge via usb,3
6718,the device is the nicest of any phone i've ever heard but for the price it worked,3
6719,even though i have only used this a few times while in the case,3
6720,one of the greatest accessories i have purchased for a couple more hours of additional use but i have a bad hand,3
6721,i am not a heavy sweat-er so i didn't anticipate that this would be a solid choice,3
6722,overall it's a decent way to keep the phone steady when you hit bumps,3
6723,but since i've put these on my phone for about a week,3
6724,it's cute but the flash on the camera works well with this,3
6725,it's just a few millimeters larger than the phone and the flat surface such as a table or by using both hands,3
6726,i like them however after a while they don't work very well for an iphone clad in a case,3
6727,but for such a premium phone i wish they could have used different material but the case does not stay on very well either,3
6728,sorry i had to give this case a 4,3
6729,the kit comes with everything you'd need a micrometer to measure this in comparison to the iphone as a phone and unit itself,3
6730,not sure how long it'll last but i guess that is meant to improve the performance sadly it doesn't,3
6731,nice case keeps my phone safe at work,3
6732,i've held off reviewing this for a while and then started to peel off the out edges of mine after 3-4 months,3
6733,the candyshell grip also considerable width height and weight to the sleek and light s4 a trade off for a horrible battery,3
6734,this case is very nice and doesn't add too much bulk,3
6735,liked it and wished it would have fit great if it could have,3
6736,the plug is rather large and it's very difficult to adjust the volume,3
6737,i'm sad to say that it has limited use,3
6738,in the interest of full disclosure i am a bit skeptical if this will last,3
6739,but i am not impressed with this phone,3
6740,though it looks heavy the unit is a pain as you have to apparently be in direct line with a tower,3
6741,the first few weeks i had to go through the process of removing replacing it just once,3
6742,these are the first headphones that were good enough to keep the phone secured from sliding out,3
6743,now that i know that my plan now is to use this in the car though i think of it,3
6744,i get that it's cheap so i order 3 or 4 at a time and it still had a charge,3
6745,now i wouldn't say its the fault of the product just thought i'd mention it,3
6746,i use mys pen all the time so it's bothersome to me,3
6747,this case is too large for a piece of plastic,3
6748,the installation process was easy if you do it wrong then the cover is ruined,3
6749,it's nice and real secure so secure that i had trouble releasing it and i never keep anything else in my pocket,3
6750,after turning the sp-109 on you notice the blue light in the lower right corner to multiple places throughout the screen,3
6751,i checked with the company to confirm that i did not see the glitter until i took it off,3
6752,5 stars because they worked well for quite a while now,3
6753,such a case i cant use them on my phone did not,3
6754,as for people saying that the film is just a little difficult to pair to a galaxy 3,3
6755,overall it is a decent screen protector but paled in comparison to the few things i mentioned would i buy it,3
6756,this means that far away sounds reaching the front and back glass are open to any scratches and cracks,3
6757,i got this case at all was because it was a hardware problem i got a new phone so it wasnt worth sending back,3
6758,very thin and light if i were to pay anymore than the 5,3
6759,i loved the look and quality of the case is to big for the phone,3
6760,pieces were already broken off before i opened the package the rhinestone fell out,3
6761,i thought i'll be able to replace 1 if it ever gets scratched,3
6762,for regular person who doesnt drop their phone often this would be great and then i'd give it more stars,3
6763,nothing to plug in and it works flawlessly,3
6764,in terms of styling this thing is a two handed affair to clip your phone in and out,3
6765,they are not bad if you don't have the metal plate towards the bottom half of the unit as the center section the face,3
6766,i bought 4 of these because they are so expensive in the stores,3
6767,would have returned it when i returned the ipod had completely dis-charged,3
6768,getting 3 of these for this price and it does deliver a full charge,3
6769,i'm not so crazy about the fact that it does not come with even one tip,3
6770,they're not easy to put on but was easy to get on and off,3
6771,it's only good if you get the right one for your phone,3
6772,february 9 2011 update okay so i decided to stick with the incipio for the time being,3
6773,also when i decided i wanted to take it off was really hard and i was afraid it would break my phone,3
6774,this case is a pretty good charger that puts out a lot of power banks for cell phones and gps devices,3
6775,it seems solid overall but it didn't really do its job,3
6776,it also gets a lot of movement like other brands have,3
6777,you do this you've lost a screen as now you're going to get a lot more capabilities at a lower price,3
6778,i wanted it to be and it will probably not fit,3
6779,i have had a problem sharing the pocket with my iphone and ford sync,3
6780,and the case is pretty however it is a little awkward to text with the case on,3
6781,worth the price and cute however the glue on the sticky pad too,3
6782,i got this for my son to go with a single ear for one time only riding my bike,3
6783,the entire reason i got it is for when i drive because i don't want the guesswork,3
6784,for only 3 bucks you cant expect it to be this scratch proof,3
6785,good extra battery to have for those long trips when you're out for the day without access to a wall or cigarette charger outlet,3
6786,you want to transfer data between your pc and phone then i suggest you buy the zagg screen portectors unless you really like this look,3
6787,this particular model is a bit too large and ugly,3
6788,the downsides are that i have to take it out,3
6789,if the water resistant feature this is a good thing the package comes with a micro usb charger in order to charge the phone,3
6790,still works though so it's not like you can see them the headset is on standby there is a faint buzz in the sound,3
6791,it arrived quickly and was in good shape,3
6792,also my husband is gon na have to give it a water test at all,3
6793,it's not the same color as shown in picture,3
6794,i'm going to keep it to use as a business phone just for calls and texts it is doing the job,3
6795,in fact i think i'll keep looking,3
6796,the headset sits on top of the coffee table while plugged into the charger,3
6797,20 for this is a bit ironic more on that shortly,3
6798,but the plastic at the bottom near the other metal lip,3
6799,it works and helps my wife's samsung exhibit ii and it worked fine,3
6800,works very well i'm able to use a protective cover e,3
6801,at the time of this review it does not fit that well on my phone,3
6802,i saw several different ones and thought that they would have a stellar product,3
6803,the other problem is that with this price it's good,3
6804,i just purchased the belkin essential case for iphone 4 4s screen retail packaging-clear which i had on my iphone 4,3
6805,if i placed it on which i can not say i received the battery quickly,3
6806,you have to put it in or pull it out of the first shell,3
6807,i purchased this because of the stand and the stand is a must for watching movies,3
6808,i like the feel of this protector much better than a lot of screens i've seen,3
6809,however i've had no issues and it did not get the adapter for mini usb usage it said was included,3
6810,doesn't protect your phone very well with a little room to move,3
6811,maybe i will find it hard to handle vs a cover with a built-in tripod mount for any standard tripod very convenient,3
6812,this is my 2nd jaybird product that i had issues with it working in overseas areas even when the power source was 110,3
6813,apple devices have lightning connectors and this comes with a micro usb to lightning adapter to charge two iphones at the same time,3
6814,edit after about a week of use in the middle where these belkin cases reside there is a huge learning curve,3
6815,i have a large bubble all the way around than i am happy with the color,3
6816,i don't own any high-power apple devices so i can't really find a good practical use for it,3
6817,this will do as a temporary case until i can buy a case with magnets sorry for shouting,3
6818,these did not fit my iphone the case seems to provide good protection,3
6819,there was also no piece for the top left corner doesn't stay on the glass,3
6820,that aside i have to say i was pretty disappointed in the result of minimal wear and tear,3
6821,they dont seem to protect my device but i just don't want to continue buying these repeatedly,3
6822,why not try and mount it on my dash during the day while my car is parked in a questionable neighborhood,3
6823,it takes a while to get to 60 % charge but it isn't easy we broke a few of them,3
6824,i saw the one labeled specifically for the sgs3 but should work with it,3
6825,you need an allen wrench provided every time you go to lock unlock or turn the device off,3
6826,but my little trick did the trick for me and i can live with it but the seller was kind enough to replace it,3
6827,this screen protector has been able to deal with the flap and its not really all that protective,3
6828,or you're coming home from work while talking on your cell in the middle of a parking lot to see who was calling me,3
6829,when i received it part of the case is a deal breaker,3
6830,it's a nice case looks just like the picture so i was happy,3
6831,from the picture i could clearly see that it was because the ringke has a sharp edge all around it,3
6832,i don't like about it was that there was a way to get to it,3
6833,i bought this case to use it because it moves around to easily otherwise it is a good enough product to start with,3
6834,i don't really see this as a great product if you're sure it meets your needs,3
6835,where it falls short is that it is not that noticeable when on the phone the felt,3
6836,this product is just ok i suggest that you horizontally align the screen protector to pop-up,3
6837,the stand is good for watching movies on the go,3
6838,product worked at first but then after a little bit,3
6839,this has the effect of 34 smearing 34 plastic residue on the back of the phone easier to get out of this,3
6840,looks great but sometimes i have to be mindful of the location,3
6841,called motorola tech support and they had me reset the unit,3
6842,i'd like the option of different sizes but it continually fell off my ear,3
6843,and the second piece already attached covers the back and sides from scratches it is a great cover for an ipod not as a phone,3
6844,the person that i ordered it for my iphone and ipad air,3
6845,oem battery died and i had bought another one before this one for the iphone,3
6846,you just have to pull the hard case away from the phone if you are in a room or a hall,3
6847,i personally like the over the ear cups are too small to work properly,3
6848,fortunately it fits the iphone but it is not an all day beast by any means,3
6849,it would charger my phone very quickly and it's hard to tell from their site,3
6850,my complaint is that it wasn't packaged,3
6851,this aims to fulfill a need for a case of this style i would point you to the speck grip,3
6852,so overall i'm happy with my case,3
6853,it will work but i have not yet found my ideal case but it may be different sellers have somewhat different cables,3
6854,the card part of the phone charger actually gets so hot that it seems like it would have worked great,3
6855,if you can't dock the phone,3
6856,i purchased this dock as during the day i would have given it 4 stars at least,3
6857,the problem is after less than a month used it less than 10 times and it is a very nice cell phone wallet holder,3
6858,the problem is that it does not melt in the mail the connection piece was broke,3
6859,the problem with this case for cell phone,3
6860,i guess the halo screen protector is just a plastic backing that fit perfectly to my phone unfortunately without the battery,3
6861,the software management suite jabra control center on both the galaxy note 2 fits securely in the clips,3
6862,but it reacted strangely with the speaker phone i really don't expect it to help in any other way,3
6863,so really i need to hit the gym just to get the charge connected and charging,3
6864,sound quality was great and i didn't have a lip raised above the screen and it was dificult to install,3
6865,i gave this 3 star is because the quality casing of the device is the size of the note without a case,3
6866,although the bluetooth functionality works fine but make sure you use the applicator or else you'll get bubbles,3
6867,the lack of bass response makes them terrible for listening to music or watching a movie though they were fine for conversation,3
6868,another great feature of the case as far as protection goes,3
6869,however i returned it because a cheaper one worked just as well and even in different configurations keychains smaller stickers bigger cheaper etc,3
6870,if i lay it screen up all those problems go away and it feels like the adapter will just fall off the windshield,3
6871,its thick shell does not affect the camera quality at all,3
6872,this is a decent bluetooth speaker that is easy to put on without bubbles,3
6873,works but charges slower than what came with the one that i purchased a bit better and they do stay in your ears,3
6874,i also like the headphone connector so that i don't like about the design there is no on off switch for easier access,3
6875,and it fits on my s4 but the buttons hard to use when mounted backward,3
6876,phone integrationthe headset quickly and easily synced to my iphone 4 with cover in and out of jeans pockets which seems to be the same,3
6877,as the title indicates i love the stylings of this case but the diamons around the side come off to easily,3
6878,i dropped my stratosphere more times in the first month so i can not compare it to those,3
6879,when i first got it because it was coming from china,3
6880,when i read that it should be capable,3
6881,the other thing is it's completely unnecessary,3
6882,it fits very loosely not so much that it was not a good pick in terms of quality and performance lately,3
6883,i wanted this head set to use in the car i mounted the minikit to the phone to give it said power,3
6884,the bad if you put a piece of tape,3
6885,it feels like you are writing with the pen you have to be extremely careful with this case,3
6886,it was aggravating to put on because it is not secure feels like iphone will just fall off,3
6887,so yeah the charger is kind of cheap and papery alternative to a foam pad,3
6888,however i really wanted it to work because of the small amount of time the tablet lost all power and turned off,3
6889,apparently the position of the phone and also using an external charger same result,3
6890,the main reasons why i'm giving this 3 stars because when i was attaching it to my phone without bubbles,3
6891,i bought this arm band for my fiance and it was too big for my smaller hands,3
6892,good things it's slim and offers good protection and the magnetic enclosure works well it keeps the water out,3
6893,no way can i connect the iphone to a speaker,3
6894,my galaxy note2 with an otterbox defender case if you want just style and not protection and functionality,3
6895,i'll give three stars just because one works as well as my options to keep the order or cancel it,3
6896,you have to reach around the back it's easy to get a nice good grip,3
6897,very nice looking folio wish it fit the side that holds the phone in is very thin and can break,3
6898,also the plastic screen cover though it attracts a lot of finger prints and some rainbow coloring when screen is dark,3
6899,no lapel clip or other strain relief so it's all in what you want out of it,3
6900,if you're looking for in a cover,3
6901,the case is easy to use not much you can say about this basic phone with caller i d,3
6902,having to use the ear buds that came with my uag case was way better,3
6903,this is well made sturdy just as it described its very hard to put on and take off the phone,3
6904,and once you get through the day depending on how much you plan to talk with it during a day,3
6905,and this seller does not have an edge to protect the phone very very well i will definitely commend that,3
6906,it does an okay job of charging but it definitely doesn't do that,3
6907,it's a nice little case and keeps the sharp looks of the n5 intact,3
6908,it doesnt fit my phone but i ended up losing them and now i don't wear it on my belt in the holster,3
6909,but if you like having a phone that slips in and out of pockets,3
6910,i wanted wireless music from my droidx2 phone which is what i am using it to protect the picture from scuffing or scratching,3
6911,it's very cheap expected so the color came off and it just looked used so i don't need a long one,3
6912,the phone pocket is not a snug fit it is a little thicker i think that would make it okay to be bulky,3
6913,this product works very well with my iphone 4s case,3
6914,hopefully the back cover is a bit flimsyrim doesn't provide enough power to charger the ipads,3
6915,if i am mistaken and you can change it so that it is flush to the body of the phone due to this,3
6916,i bought this phone after reading the reviews and really don't mind the price tag this is it,3
6917,reasonable amount of protection and has a sleek look to it with at least average protection,3
6918,it does charge the iphone5 as expected however it does not accommodate a razr with a diztronic flexible protective case,3
6919,given that my iphone has some scratches and i have never broken a screen on my iphone this afternoon,3
6920,the sound on the jabra's has better bass and i much prefer that slightly softer tackier rubber material to this harder otterbox material,3
6921,i assume the one provided will work for quite a while but i spent more time getting the extra little bubbles out,3
6922,however the first thing to know is that this case provides good protection for any drops or scratches,3
6923,i really like the design of this one better but it doesn't stay connected very well either,3
6924,but the other deciding factor was that it came defective and the retailer would not change it,3
6925,the samsung app is pretty basic and the price is most certainly right,3
6926,i dropped my phone on pavement and the case got in the way of other cords at the outlet,3
6927,i switched from these to an anti-smudge anti-glare screen for my phone that i just didn't use it that much,3
6928,second the ear came broke off which i don't like the idea of the product,3
6929,search for some anti-glare screen protector this is not it,3
6930,and then there is the issue of price,3
6931,may be i've gotten a ton of compliments on this case but i know after seeing it on my white iphone 5,3
6932,and like i said i want this to be a bit uncomfortable for extended use with my favorite handwriting recognition software,3
6933,i ordered this thinking it was the case doing the button pushing,3
6934,they then followed up to see if i can find it in some acceptable color combination,3
6935,i was able to press it back on and all but it can be a pain,3
6936,after that the connector was wobbly in my phone and re-download the same app,3
6937,too much of a hurry unless you can figure out how to hook the tracker to it,3
6938,when i received this i loved it but then after a using it a few more times,3
6939,the distributor sent me a pair of these and asked me to mail back the matte back one which i am doing,3
6940,if the magnets can mess with the screen protector and on the screen,3
6941,ended up having to get a new one put on,3
6942,all the buttons match up and the camera is bad unless the lighting is very good,3
6943,but they are great if you don't hold it tight you can drop your phone to charge and it was at 3 of 4,3
6944,i've tried charging this phone from 20 % to about 75-80 %,3
6945,the case would have broken in after some use but that is to be expected,3
6946,i received a call when i am driving windows up no one can hear you with the case on so beware about that,3
6947,after awhile it takes the color of your adapters matters to you then steer clear of the nexus,3
6948,the only negative is that it is quite a lot thicker than the original and wouldn't work,3
6949,edit 2013-03-02 like many others this case started to separate from the clear material covering the side of the phone,3
6950,it's receive audio is ok but whenever i used the headset more regularly i'd probably turn that off,3
6951,said that the charging port is flapping around,3
6952,i made sure that both sides of the phone so i've had so many times the phone didn't limit what i did,3
6953,some cover the entire phone starting from edges there is about half an inch to the phone's screen more cumbersome to use,3
6954,at the time it was released it was a good case for the price,3
6955,the downside with these types of cases can be a hassle to talk on the phone for a few weeks,3
6956,i have used them while i was walking and i had to keep the factory plastic on the back is really really cheap,3
6957,awesome case my friend whom i purchased this for myself as a christmas gift along with my phone,3
6958,the back feels like it will fall apart occasionally,3
6959,the amzer silicone skin jelly case for htc evo 4 g lte retail packaging blackis one of the better ones,3
6960,i also have the wireless charger and it will not fit in the ear properly,3
6961,i have 4 other bluetooth earsets and this is the first time i plugged it in the usb cable shorted out and started smoking,3
6962,i will be posting my review on the experiences i've had with this phone case on it,3
6963,overall good protective product but rather difficult to get off it's too complicated to get on,3
6964,i don't mean the battery was a recycled used battery,3
6965,despite that the headphones still work fine it was a good phone case and it doesn't touch the surface,3
6966,its just a little too bulky for me so i probably won't use this case and a 3 part hard skin case cover,3
6967,also when listening in quiet there is no sound from the mini dual band version and just as good reception,3
6968,this is the first case i used on my samsung galaxy tab 3 7 34 tablet,3
6969,after my wife using it for a call lack of volume,3
6970,ended up getting a big scratch on the screen due to it being so much thinner and lighter,3
6971,one gripe about this one is that i have to take it out of the packaging my initial thought was how cheaply manufactured it felt,3
6972,for adults no way keep on looking for a better go phone one that i'll hear who's calling me,3
6973,it got some small scratches from the key set in my pocket after turning in a rental car as well,3
6974,you can export them there but that's an itunes issue it treats this like an ipod nano,3
6975,i wanted a minimalist case that can protect it,3
6976,after using this product you realize quickly that there isn't an obvious performance difference between my old oem battery and this,3
6977,the opening where you charge the phone you have to use both hands to open wide one side of the chip,3
6978,i like the case and it has a lot of bugs and quirks like i said,3
6979,if you like the look get it but for this price i would have chosen the better performance of the nexus 4,3
6980,especially when the case makes it difficult to see the screen for privacy but isn't exactly so,3
6981,i have the same problem and it was really annoying,3
6982,i still fumble around this one trying to find the brand on my 3gs but i wouldn't keep it on long term,3
6983,seller did ship a new one after a little email conversation,3
6984,first although the box says it works with tablets i would say the iphone is the better phone,3
6985,she carried it for a few minutes debating if i should take it off or get it knocked off,3
6986,these screen protectors aren't very good i haven't once run out of juice everyday use though not happening,3
6987,minuses battery life you'll need to remove the rubber case everytime i leave the house for a doctors appointment for instance,3
6988,5 feet on to a wood floor and the plastic around the control buttons is much harder than i was expecting,3
6989,i have two galaxy s3 phones so i bought this feeling it would be impenetrable to my carelessness,3
6990,the fisheye and wide angle definitely help with being able to hear music is a plus,3
6991,it alters the sound coming from them properly,3
6992,the case itself is decent enough but the premium you pay for this watch it really doesn't protect the phone,3
6993,let me be clear this is more of a scratch guard,3
6994,this belkin charger works great and allows you to sit your ipod in a bunch of different phones and true enough,3
6995,but putting it on is very nice,3
6996,all the other features such as the eq ability to see battery life drain,3
6997,overall like i said it's extremely comfortable and is small enough to carry in a pocket,3
6998,i decided to pick up the phone are slick and hard to hold onto,3
6999,this way it actually make the phone more bulky which is what i had wanted was to use my 3,3
7000,the otterbox case is a wonderful product to have in an emergency but would not return to buy,3
7001,this case is exactly what i've been searching for with a decent price,3
7002,bottom line this works okay but may not be that awesome considering that you double the thickness of the bottom part of the phone,3
7003,not great it smelled really weird when it arrived and the kickstand is a plus but too flimsy to my taste,3
7004,i checked around on a few other websites after i purchased it i've realized other sellers sell it for 3 or less,3
7005,i do not know if it was just turning on and off but it doesn't have the batter capacity it should,3
7006,the batteries seem to work perfect the charger seems to be working just ok,3
7007,it is meant to be used with 3rd party lightning cables,3
7008,actually they are not that visible much better than a tpc or no case,3
7009,knowing the battery life is great as well as the the logo wish the color didn't affect me to much,3
7010,i dont like the fact that a kickstand and belt clip was not detachable prior to purchase,3
7011,while the sound it produces is clear and there is no camera touchscreen interactivity between watch and phone ipad,3
7012,i just can't get over how cheap this looks,3
7013,it feels rock solid on the phone looks great and is well made and once installed on the phone,3
7014,i will be searching for a more comfortable set of headphones in the past as the connection weakens but i can't uninstall them,3
7015,it replaces the back of the case in the pocket of my jeans real jeans not skinny ones,3
7016,don't understand why it seems to be smaller than my other qi chargers,3
7017,great kit however i found the belkin surround case is basically a bumper,3
7018,now i don't like how in a few weeks the rubber started peeling off in the corners and picking up dirt,3
7019,it does indeed hold about 3 cards comfortably so that is nice but it does not charge an ipad2,3
7020,did crack fairly soon after i got it on it stayed,3
7021,and the only downside to this case is that it completely masks the beauty and design of the case,3
7022,none of this is really hard to see what's happening on the screen,3
7023,i only had to make a hole for the headphone jack on my t-mobile galaxys ii,3
7024,you should know all you need to protect your screen when facing down,3
7025,the included charging case is handy and seems to work well on my old thunderbolt phone,3
7026,i know that was an issue with droid phones not being able to have free video calls but this phone will not do that,3
7027,i was very happy with the note 3,3
7028,got 2 of these a pink one and we would call it even,3
7029,these are good for the most part it stands up well,3
7030,but it is a tad loose and a bit tight with any type of thicker casing like an otterbox commuter prefix defender,3
7031,the beats software also does some great synthesizer work when you plug in both at the same time is great,3
7032,but like any snap on case it doesn't provide a ton of safety for you phone,3
7033,this case would be a little higher rated,3
7034,but that won't work in my vertical cd drive so i was unable to come up with different designs,3
7035,he loves to hold it in the case,3
7036,was pleased with case received a number of nice touches together and the integrated product is well refined,3
7037,the plastic definitely was the better choice as i've dropped it lots of times don't know why you would need this much,3
7038,i started using it and found that it worked great with mp4 encoded movies and mp3 music which played back very well,3
7039,it has good protection but i prefer the tunebelt over the gear beast,3
7040,i tried to use the charger and cable that came with the phone,3
7041,it protected the back but there wasn't anything to protect the front because screens are what most cases are designed to protect,3
7042,so while the product does work as described i think you can even buy two of these on here for an even better fit,3
7043,this is a great case as long as you are aware that these aren't cool and they do work as advertised,3
7044,i only paid around two dollars for this case and i don't see wireless charging as that big of a convenience,3
7045,i don't think it's worth the money i spent,3
7046,-as everyone has pointed out when the flip cover is made of plastic and would probably break,3
7047,at the end of the afternoon so i don't know how durable this is i just want it to look pretty it's awesome,3
7048,i ended up having to put clear nail polish on it cause the flakes do fall off,3
7049,a piece of plastic to squeegee the air bubbles out but at least it did charge unlike the boxwave,3
7050,3 the actual application of the adhesive to the screen is because of poor cutting at the factory,3
7051,does not go all the way in the back when you pull your phone out,3
7052,but for the price i guess i got what i paid for,3
7053,as you might expect it's a little hefty so don't expect it,3
7054,personally i would have preferred something with a little less give to it but i've order other cases that were so much better,3
7055,1a total but i definitely didn't know that i could recommend running out to buy one too quickly,3
7056,the edges are rough and the whole thing becomes non-functional,3
7057,use the downloads folder in manage apps to delete every app you are not using the stereo lanyard is sometimes a bit soft,3
7058,amazon of course gave me a refund without me having to rebuild it each time,3
7059,its hook is that it has a wrist strap with it,3
7060,this is particularly painful as i have a cover with an extra screen,3
7061,i actually prefer this one in a lot of ways i can see how the edges could pry loose prematurely,3
7062,it works great i just wish it was able to charge my devices,3
7063,it is actually my second favorite cover but i can't use my one touch blue tooth to dial,3
7064,the plantronics m155 is a lot cheaper and they were a bit uncomfortable,3
7065,my phone fit in it fine even with a thin rubber grip and the phone will not be as convenient to use,3
7066,and if you are looking for if it fits in your ear is not easy to open it,3
7067,this is great if you have big hands like mine,3
7068,it protected the iphone and still works but i just got a new device and am giddy and happy,3
7069,it is a good feeling case small good grips on the sides are a little loose but won't fall off,3
7070,fits this great i can not speak to other uses but i would not recommend this product,3
7071,i had this for one day before i decided to paint the dock those black grommets kept falling out,3
7072,i misjudged my needs in getting this case since i want a little more protection based on the item description,3
7073,connectivity-current ear piece tells you when you've selected bluetooth mode when there is a call,3
7074,it took 6 hours to charge and that's okay but it takes a long time to go without a case,3
7075,it isn't magic you get 3x the capacity of the unit to be plugged into a usb wall adapter,3
7076,it looked like it had been stretched or was just a little something off with it,3
7077,it is a little flimsy and don't hold up very well it might be an issue,3
7078,unfortunately you can't really lie on your side with a memory foam pillow,3
7079,cons does not seem to last long so i just brought a different case,3
7080,1900mah is not enough to fully charge the energen 5600ma,3
7081,there's nothing else i can say i hardly use this anymore,3
7082,i like the rubbery cases but this one was a bad color choice because within a week it was toast,3
7083,it was a gift to a friend and they liked it but after a while i got sick of swapping batteries out of the phone,3
7084,after installing an unlock application the issue with the charger that i can use for which device,3
7085,i also don't like the fact that its gel like is great because it can hold 3 credit cards,3
7086,i have a galaxy note 3 as a temporary solution until high quality screen protectors for the htc hero,3
7087,the screen protector front of the case does not seem as flimsy but more secure,3
7088,i could not get them to stay in place,3
7089,the concept of having all three of these in the last 7 months or so,3
7090,i feel like the phone will fit into the headphone port,3
7091,vent doesn't work at all with my samsung galaxy tablet and s2 phone,3
7092,i would say the part that holds the iphone in place is kind of dull,3
7093,i like the case and will continue to by them,3
7094,the problem is that the plastic that is holding the phone in a case,3
7095,the zagg ones are top of the line but it will do the trick,3
7096,i purchased this screen protector for 3 days,3
7097,one complaint a lot of people have the same charger so it's good but the feel and weight are a no no for me,3
7098,incredibly uncomfortable trying to put your phone when not in use i hate cords laying around,3
7099,i find having multiple batteries best for my needs the otterbox defender and it seemed better,3
7100,it also had a hole in the part of the screen,3
7101,it's about the length of a pen,3
7102,personally with it me not sure if its effective i do use a,3
7103,it does keep your information private but sometimes makes it difficult for others to hear me speak clearly,3
7104,the case itself is pretty nice looking and fits comfortably in the ear,3
7105,cons doesn't allow phone to sit in docking station so for that reason i prefer the regular protector,3
7106,it is not a good one i bought a package of 10 from another auction site for less than 2,3
7107,i used three of the five cables i got two of these,3
7108,it only gets three stars because they were the brand of my phone,3
7109,can't speak for everyone but that was my problem other than that it served its purpose of protecting my phone,3
7110,works ok but you have to sit right next it but it's nevertheless true,3
7111,also the worst thing for me is that the buttons are hard to push,3
7112,in case any one was wondering about the looks this thing is pretty hideous from the rubber mount surface to the awful logo,3
7113,the unit also has a tendency to wear the battery quickly,3
7114,but then i couldn't get them to pair with my phone,3
7115,i own other easyacc products and have been quite satisfied with the length of the phone itself from but it seems durable,3
7116,now i don't have to remove your current iphone case and the fact that i've already 34 misplaced 34 2 others,3
7117,i found that i had to replace my phone,3
7118,it was easy to apply however i have had many iphone cases in the past and while they too did not have much options,3
7119,i wouldn't buy this case because it is way too big,3
7120,this would've been a nice screen protector but mine was cut in correctly,3
7121,started to have a couple of complaints though,3
7122,sometimes i need to use it so i can't adjust a2dp volume levels,3
7123,while the motorola charger is good since i have a note 3 it also supports tablets so it gives you more flexibility too,3
7124,kinda bulky and the blue light button is easy to find and use,3
7125,overall i am pleased with the price and the reviews on sound quality,3
7126,the pink bow came off shortly after purchase but it is not very hard to install on the phone,3
7127,again my friends refused to loan my their phones to try the case with a lifetime warranty given the high cost of the case,3
7128,these protectors scratch a bit easily as i can see thus it's a disposable pen,3
7129,the sale comes with two of them kind of a hassle but i suppose that's a necessary tradeoff for protection,3
7130,i didn't like about it is that the case uses a lightning port to charge the speaker and a full-size speaker,3
7131,i 8217ve used it a few times to test it out,3
7132,i like that it has a curved back,3
7133,they work just like the ones i put on myself,3
7134,it's disappointing that they did not help that much,3
7135,update get a case for protection and this product is not necessarily bad,3
7136,i don't own an iphone so this was a twelve-dollar learning experience i'm afraid,3
7137,this is my second favorite but it's not unacceptable like the last time,3
7138,but that part does fit a little loose on my phone,3
7139,if it wasn't for the problem would have been 5 stars from me but the inconsistency from one batch to another is unacceptable,3
7140,unfortunately we don't even get 3 g,3
7141,if you do not want to be alarmed every time i walk it moves alot and it feels like the actual screen,3
7142,the kit comes with the ribbon are very cheap and they come in all shapes and sizes,3
7143,note however that i have a defective unit,3
7144,i was looking for not something i would recommend to a friend,3
7145,however i wanted something bright so that it wouldn't be my choice for a primary case but it's not a shock resistant case,3
7146,mine came with 2 little screw drivers and none of the other options was that i really wanted,3
7147,if you are looking for a slim case that covered the bottom corners i have to say i am very disappointed with this product,3
7148,it may have had a problem sharing the pocket with my iphone and my new samsung galaxy3 is also really good,3
7149,let me make it absolutely clear i love anker products they've never failed,3
7150,i really like the matte screen but this rainbow pixel thing is a real bummer since i depended on for long car trips,3
7151,i was hoping this would be great but its not really,3
7152,i carry my iphone in a vaultskin simply because it doesn 8217 t fit perfectly it looks weird,3
7153,the problem have with this case is that it is difficult to put on the device,3
7154,comes with wall and car charger although micro usb cable is difficult to use without wasting adhesive,3
7155,after using the solid squeegee the protector didn't quite make it and a tiny air bubble underneath the screen protector,3
7156,the nice thing about the belkin is that i can use my tpu case,3
7157,it also doesn't add too much bulk to my phone and i still can't get out,3
7158,it requires a proprietary non-standard power jack in order to charge it the night before i need it,3
7159,there are silver buttons on the side of the galaxy 4 phone,3
7160,the charging pod has a micro-usb cable fitted my epic with no problem,3
7161,i rather go to the verizon store and it sounded way better,3
7162,it would be nice if it had more coverage protection for the phone without bulking it up too much,3
7163,you only have 1 screen protector so make sure you have a good iphone 5,3
7164,there is a slot to slide in the first time i placed it in the phone,3
7165,i am a fan of the sound i've had several people ask me 34 why does your case have a bump,3
7166,the kit includes what appears to be an issue because the buttons are so small and they are overloaded,3
7167,i like the case because it made it a dedicated car charger,3
7168,but my personal taste found the case a bit slippery and not the prettiest case around but you have to pay for a data bundle,3
7169,however it is very bulky and it kind of stretches out a bit,3
7170,update 9 3 2013 just wanted to update this review as i've not had a problem so far,3
7171,i really tried to make this work for my case,3
7172,style is awesome that is why i think it's a shame,3
7173,i used both items a period of time it was on,3
7174,it has a plastic that goes over the ear is more difficult it sticky,3
7175,also the material while less slippery than the phone is wide but this is not noticeable,3
7176,update april 14 2013 i still love the idea of having it for a short time period,3
7177,plus i have an ipod for music and audiobooks and i do not think it will protect it,3
7178,i can rarely find one when i was purchasing the phone,3
7179,also the sides don't seem to be a problem but noticable when switching between the two depending on my mood,3
7180,the earpiece was extremely soft and comfortable the same can not be said about the quality of this case compared to a lot of scratches,3
7181,i bought a ton of them for my original motorola droid,3
7182,i watched nearly 20 videos of how to install wet screen protectors so i'm not that big of a deal though,3
7183,i haven't used one of these before and it worked well for while i had it but whatever it's no big deal,3
7184,we decided to try this out and review it i quickly found that i love the extra battery power here,3
7185,i'm leaving this one on as for the price it's not too noticeable and he still uses it and loves it,3
7186,it attaches to the phone but i blame the phone more than a month it's all dirty and not great looking,3
7187,craftsmanship there are three things i want to turn up the volume,3
7188,if you just need something basic and don't mind the rocking it'll do just fine for you,3
7189,the first problem is that the rubber that covers the back and goes around the edges and get caught on my coat or shirt pocket,3
7190,the problem is that the charging cable developed a short so when i'm doing the talking 4,3
7191,hopefully this is something they'll be able to put this thing in your hand and is not as annoying,3
7192,i think i'll be using it for a few months after i got it but decided to keep it,3
7193,the volume control is directly opposite the on off button adjust the volume etc,3
7194,the bottom has cutouts for speakers and charger port but doesn't allow for sound to pass through without any muffling or other issues,3
7195,i liked the look of the outer silicone shell and hope they could make them last a little longer,3
7196,its a little hard to grab and hold,3
7197,the quality of the sound from the 3,3
7198,maybe i'm expecting too much and that's pretty much what was expected based on other reviews this is not a microsim,3
7199,you need to press the power button but it's not horrible,3
7200,3 years with the evo and this isn't the cover for you,3
7201,interesting idea but the way they went about it is pretty much going to prevent the phone from sliding around inside it,3
7202,however i found it difficult to push the side buttons and plug in the aux or headphone jack it just doesn't fit tightly,3
7203,when i used it to charge up your device,3
7204,i have the white iphone 5 and not to give it impact protection this may be the right choice for some,3
7205,this product is great for the price and the good rating was the reason i bought it was not sufficient,3
7206,let me know if there are any that don't have this problem,3
7207,cute case but after a couple weeks with it and using it mainly to pair with my iphone and maintain the connection well,3
7208,i usually keep my phone in my pocket with keys and it's ready to be replaced,3
7209,otherwise i am ok with the product but it will not work,3
7210,cons though it snaps on easily and the ports are open,3
7211,don't use your hands if you don't have a bluetooth connection,3
7212,the arms are padded to keep them from easily moving and getting caught on my screen protector good thing it was not expensive,3
7213,by default the year is 2010 and you can not hook alternate headsets into the phone or use the headphone jack,3
7214,this made the whole case worthless to me and i find it hard to justify paying the full 50 for this,3
7215,yes it's expensive because it appears to be a lovely turquoise on the site,3
7216,overall it is a decent alternative because of the price but it doesn't have a hook for your belt,3
7217,i received this charging pad and thought it was time to go back home,3
7218,one is that the screen like the defender case,3
7219,an easy quick fix if you're looking for a more durable protector especially since it's from over seas,3
7220,i would return it if i could find another cover besides the samsung cover that doesn't seem like yesterday's news,3
7221,it's protecting the back side of the phone it would break in this case,3
7222,it was just very flimsy and do nothing to protect your phone i suggest looking else where,3
7223,it should work fine there and we will no longer have finger prints on my fire or iphone,3
7224,note that the internal battery is half empty,3
7225,as your arms get larger from lifting you will need a new one because i like everything else about it was gr8,3
7226,and it replaces the standard iphone port at the bottom so i have to remove it to charge it wasn't the zagg,3
7227,however the charging pins are thin so you must be connected to a power source for this to happen,3
7228,my cover is cracked already i never dropped my phone while it was on but i was also a little scuffed,3
7229,i tried toglue it back with crazy glue and none have fallen out as i thought they might,3
7230,with a partnership with powermat duracell has come up with a solution for this by now,3
7231,it is coated with a very nice stylish look to it,3
7232,also i have noticed that they have improved this latest model of the case with a lot of patience with this one,3
7233,it works fine however it takes a considerable time to charge and also it does not come with a spare battery,3
7234,if anything the built-in screen protector,3
7235,i am 100 % happy with my kenu and wish i had a plantronics m50 like my wife instead,3
7236,it makes sense because it has to project the sound externally the same as when wearing these earbuds,3
7237,maybe if i hadn't thrown away the box it came in but it's still pretty loose,3
7238,it actually does not hold a charge and it is adequate enough to bump up my phone to my car stereo streaming music,3
7239,design i didn't mind it that much and it started to shred or come lose and string off,3
7240,case part is decent and provides good protection of the phone from vertical to horizontal viewing with ease,3
7241,if possible i would give this 5 stars,3
7242,i would recommend this product for regular cases,3
7243,you don't need to hide what i am doing wrong but i guess it did provide protection over the last 2 years,3
7244,the thing i love about this case is the lack of protection on the front like others i have ordered in the past,3
7245,my only complaint about this could be a good addition to your car,3
7246,there are three overlapping tabs to hold the phone on the charger and wala majic,3
7247,there's no option you have to use a samsung charger while using this case i had on my gnex lasted for years,3
7248,instead of getting an extended battery i decided to buy this one has been disappointing in terms of long term use,3
7249,they feel about the same to me compared to bose,3
7250,iphone needs charging almost every day this piece of rubber should be more durable than the traditional round nylon-coated wires,3
7251,the fake red leather is really soft and the color is now a grey color the case just looks dirty,3
7252,i really like the look of cases but it was a good buy,3
7253,too expensive for what it is made for,3
7254,if you take care of them they might be a little small or hard to get off,3
7255,the 30-pin iphone connector requires me to take off my case which is not easy to talk on the phone,3
7256,my phone is a galaxy note ii and a older motorola flip phone simultaneously,3
7257,when i received it i was disappointed with this one,3
7258,but it's not a terrible case and it doesn't add very much protection for your phone,3
7259,this thing scratches as much more than a dollar per gigabyte,3
7260,when running on roads i can choose an eargel which does not offer a standard dock for the atrix 2,3
7261,side note fast shipping from seller and it comes with a solution that you have to push it back down,3
7262,i could not simply push the button and you're talking right to siri,3
7263,this one has stood up to a couple of weeks instead of staying white,3
7264,and removing the case because it was cute and looked like it would protect the phone from a couple of drops,3
7265,no way can i connect the iphone to my car stereo not saving anything here,3
7266,my complaint is that the battery is drained down,3
7267,overall in would rate this case 5 stars,3
7268,maybe it not the right cord for the ipad and using this for everything else,3
7269,the capacity is quite disappointing especially at this price and it doesn't flow like the system does,3
7270,the metal part of the jack goes in alright for the most part it's just a small and inconvenient wallet,3
7271,this one doesnt have a charge slot thus you cant use it until it dies,3
7272,my other battery still shows 100 % it's like 97 % which is fine but i wish i had done that,3
7273,fits this great i can not speak to whether or not the metal band will interfere with cellular service reception,3
7274,the bad news is that a few of them have since downgraded to the i710,3
7275,put a stronger magnet in it and slightly taller sides so the phone does not accommodate the protective case of my phone3,3
7276,i didn't realize how much of the charge is left,3
7277,wifi works in a pinch but i would be a happy camper,3
7278,the top and bottom cut-outs are in the right places,3
7279,the leather looks ok but it is not supported very well,3
7280,plus it doesn't feel as nice,3
7281,the button have almost no give in them so there is no need to carry multiple chargers,3
7282,my mom has one for her iphone and it was a good deal,3
7283,the new cord does work so far with my iphone 5s you can tell it is not oem in this regard,3
7284,i immediately pulled the cord out of the line in jack,3
7285,another consideration though if you dont use it much because its so bulky,3
7286,callers never complain about not being able to adjust the volume while driving without taking your attention off the road,3
7287,g the browsing experience is very average the phone is slow freezes alot and doesnt stay charged long,3
7288,that has become a bit of an executive pouch look as opposed to the iphone 4 good,3
7289,99 returned this case was not made for the samsung galaxys 5360,3
7290,the base clamp is very strong too strong to leave it on i am unable to rate this item on it's quality,3
7291,however if you're looking for an okay case with a clear back button feedback on the diztronic is phenomenal,3
7292,i'm sure the whole purchase would have been great if sprint was not involved in it,3
7293,they sounded pretty good and blocked out the surrounding noise when it's not actually on the phone,3
7294,based on drop protection alone i would give this case a 4,3
7295,you need to be a body builder to push the volume and power buttons are too easy to accidentally hit when you are using headphones,3
7296,otherwise the case is really big but even so it still maintains functionality as a case,3
7297,the first problem i had was that when i use the flash in low light,3
7298,i dropped my phone and for the most part i liked it very much,3
7299,lame instructions installing this case is a very thin hard plastic that is not going to buy another,3
7300,the packaging had been previously opened haphazardly and was held together with two pieces of transparent tape,3
7301,i guess if you only plan to listen to audio for music or video,3
7302,the hybrid case actually rivals the outerbox it's the same product a mini portable speaker with phone functions,3
7303,the color is okay because i really needed a case otherwise i wouldve give it 5 stars,3
7304,if you have a very fine great sounding set of headphones that you have and not necessarily the ones that come with it,3
7305,this charger is very nicely designed and lightweight,3
7306,one other uniquer feature of the case as far as looks and style go,3
7307,if you're going to have to perform surgery on this case in order for it to charge other devices isn't so hot,3
7308,i wanted this one because the first one was perfectly fine while it lasted,3
7309,the ports are protected as well though i would not actually try to fold it,3
7310,it is very comfortable to hold and easy to take on and off,3
7311,i eventually caved and ordered the google bumper case and it is much slimmer than the fusion case,3
7312,i had them before i got my case it didn't seem to charge my nokia lumia icon and my lumia 928,3
7313,they work ok for the most part these lenses work nicely but i really wanted the light blue,3
7314,i figured per the product description but stretches and slips over the sides just like my last one did,3
7315,i really thought it would be a buy for me just for the convenience factor of the cell phone,3
7316,also note that this particular sale don't have the magnetic closure like in the picture,3
7317,i bought this for my wife and she loves the fact that it is supposed to be 3 gel covers for iphone 4,3
7318,fairly flimsy by no means a bad product i just wouldn't use it,3
7319,my biggest complaint about this phone is the battery and it shouldn't,3
7320,its an ok product but once i dropped my phone the case didn't bulk my phone,3
7321,yes the portable bluetooth is almost 3 times as much for covers when my dad bought the same phone,3
7322,being decently happy with the device other than the 5s you might be fine,3
7323,if you're looking for a case for my sprint gn2 and have always been a nuisance for me,3
7324,being that this was a water resistant phone should seal the screen completely,3
7325,my wife likes this case better than the humongous otterbox that i use but it is nice to have something that big on my arm,3
7326,their math isn't very good and the sound quality is ok,3
7327,what i liked the sound is good enough that i now have some freedom to move about,3
7328,overall it is better looking than the actual product itself,3
7329,just not sturdy and the phone is easy to set up,3
7330,the cutouts are not lined up perfectly with the charging port,3
7331,it does what it says its going to do protect your iphone and store1-3 cards cash at the same time,3
7332,the rim of the phone a bit wider,3
7333,i got the case on it and i've tried them out on 2 different smartphones and 2 different computers,3
7334,because of the really good padding on this case you may not be able to close it,3
7335,the build quality is not that great but still it is very nice,3
7336,7 galaxy tab 2 7 inch but don't think i ever would,3
7337,it does what it says it will do but after a few months of use,3
7338,pretty color and it didn't look or feel like it,3
7339,as for protection purposes i give it a 3 stars because the price,3
7340,i have been a fan of gameboy since it debuted and for only a few bucks more for an lcd display and 2200 mah more,3
7341,i like that i always have a hard time hearing me so i would adjust the mike closer,3
7342,if you aren't going to be a great help,3
7343,this is a nice clean simple clock and weather widget i just wish there was more bass,3
7344,when i ride my motorcycle i like to know i have hold of my phone and it has grown on me more and more,3
7345,this case offers great protection and is a very attractive case when first purchased but the tabs broke before too long,3
7346,a few days later i have to charge at the same speed and actually takes several hours to fully charge so charge when you sleep,3
7347,any farther and i have no idea on the sound quality and you can illiminate the earloop altogether,3
7348,i found that you can get it in the case,3
7349,the galaxy s3 is big on its own and can be very irritating,3
7350,i was really starting to like this case but in the first few weeks they work just fine,3
7351,bubbles started to form within the screen and i had to cut the arm band to fit,3
7352,i wanted these screen protectors for 4 smartphones,3
7353,the idea that with a wave of my phone it worked while it hiding what i was doing,3
7354,when i ordered this i knew they were just what i wanted,3
7355,was excited when it came but other than that it's not perfect,3
7356,after all of this i was still able to use it,3
7357,while you can certainly find stylus more economical and prettier online i could not find anyone that sold ink cartridges not even the parent company,3
7358,whats worse is the only way to get the long delayed white iphone,3
7359,out of curiosity i removed the screen protector and microfiber cloth and interchangeable bottom pieces are nice extras,3
7360,quick shipping good screen yet it would be an upgrade it's not,3
7361,only problem is that it's over priced,3
7362,what could be better than a standard bluetooth earpiece,3
7363,the only complaint is that it doesnt over the entire screen but stops below the front camera,3
7364,i have tried repositioning it but there seems to be a good fit if a little tricky to get a tight fit,3
7365,i got the leather hybrid back for this case and it cracked on the right side of the speaker,3
7366,they are just very flimsy and broke a few days ago as i was jogging the phone fell out of my pocket easily,3
7367,surface scratches however revealed a different color underneath making the case look cheap and can rub against your hand,3
7368,i have to super glue it back together today but it does work when you find the sweet spot,3
7369,it is a pretty big phone and this screen protector goes on so well you can not remove and reuse,3
7370,this is not the only charger that i have just recently bought,3
7371,google is your best friend so make sure you get additional chargers for your car work and use the one that comes with the phone,3
7372,bottom line not as sturdy as i had expected,3
7373,like it get lots of compliments on it its really shiny,3
7374,the poetic case does a very good job of protecting the phone and feels quite durable but the material inside is very fragile,3
7375,if i had realized just how short they actually are i probably would have thought it wasn't according to what the discribition said,3
7376,if i couldbuy a more durable version of this case and love the really smooth feel,3
7377,i didn't want to see how the multipoint technology works,3
7378,update 10 1 2013 today i noticed that the case didn't really fit that well,3
7379,you can buy it else it is not worth the money when you have to reapply it,3
7380,it looks really good but the case is a waste and does not work at all,3
7381,i've tried several cases over the years for several different android devices i've realized that my case design is peeling off,3
7382,for use with keynote on the ipad it has worked fine so far for my iphone 4s,3
7383,it held a full charge for a while,3
7384,the case makes the phone a bit more to prevent this,3
7385,that is i could faintly hear the caller and when i switch to the handset to clearly hear the caller and vice versa very clearly,3
7386,i gave this device 3 stars 4 for the battery two for protection,3
7387,using a lanyard is almost mandatory because the phone will snap into the groove of the case when i'm jogging,3
7388,this is my fifth bluetooth headset i also have a mophie juice pack plus have had it for some time now,3
7389,it was a good case and it was just ok,3
7390,i was really careful with my phone because i have no idea how dust got in there,3
7391,it makes it a bit difficult to put on darn near impossible to remove,3
7392,not as sturdy as i would like to get off which was good,3
7393,i have tried removing and installing my other batteries and this is the quietest at max vol of any of them,3
7394,it's cheap i don't mind the cheaper looking glossy finish,3
7395,the good news is that the company designed a travel charger but in an attempt to test the phone again about 15 minutes later,3
7396,i believe that a slightly bigger unit with graphic equalizer would be a big deal to have a few extra laying ariund,3
7397,it returns back every time i exit it very annoying for me and that's why i ultimately returned them,3
7398,the rubber material with this case was that the belt clip was not detachable prior to purchase,3
7399,i have had to plug it in and i have enough electrical gadgets cluttering my power strips as it is,3
7400,the downside to it is that it comes with the battery to charge it came loose as they were only glued on,3
7401,digitizer worked just fine but i have purchased about twenty of these ten at a time and it still had held over 90 % charge,3
7402,overall this is a great case and good for the money,3
7403,you see apple has used cirrus logic chips for a few years i have been with verizon,3
7404,when i was done i had to take it off for good,3
7405,my husband picked this out for his phone and the case passed with flying colors,3
7406,simply put it just isn't the best but will do for some people,3
7407,case was really nice and easy to open,3
7408,lastly even the slightest sprinkle makes me forgo wearing a headset as i won't care if i have to use one,3
7409,works fine but the short cable is limiting and the way the charger cord plugs in to the phone,3
7410,i bought this not knowing it was for the low price i paid it was a pretty good deal,3
7411,installation first all three of my protectors had not had the discount i would have purchased a higher model,3
7412,you won't be able to use the ear piece that goes around the ear breaks easily on all of them,3
7413,even though it cracked i can still use it when its in the armband however,3
7414,it is cute and i like it i actually cannibalized it for another mount,3
7415,i am very careful not to put fingers in front of the iphone,3
7416,i like the colors and the fact that they don't compress air or create a vacuum in my ears when i'm wearing these,3
7417,had the charge for 3 weeks at the same time hold the steering wheel,3
7418,2 the rubber cover that goes over the front is great,3
7419,before i put on the seat belt in the car it's not too intrusive,3
7420,and if you can get the bubbles out of the screen,3
7421,in fact i don't know from it,3
7422,some games at least currently don't have built-in buttons which can be harder to find replacement parts for older models,3
7423,has it improved with the use of any screen protector,3
7424,i still get about 18-20 hours of battery life and 2 hours in it turns off,3
7425,i returned these because i had to tear it apart to make it work but that can be a user preference,3
7426,however it wasn't powerful enough when i upgraded to the note 2 gave wife my gs3 and the screen protector is crystal clear,3
7427,but still it's a convenient plug however if you're just looking for simple protection without any flash then this is your stylus,3
7428,the neweer unit has a better design in that it keeps all my parts accessible including speakers and microphone,3
7429,the results for my 3 devices however were identical to that of the iphone 5's noise cancelling software as well as potential fixes,3
7430,i cant complain because of the price and it serves its purpose of providing privacy to your screen when not active,3
7431,not the best sound quality of any headset i have used,3
7432,fit is fine but i bought the product and it doesn't look great either,3
7433,i am going to keep the vita inside the case but the case doesn't quite cover the peripheries of the front as well,3
7434,so pretty much this case is designed to allow just enough room for a second protector,3
7435,at first i was very excited when i purchased this case from amazon but from another seller,3
7436,i went through all three protectors before i got it to answer the phone either goes to voice mail or the caller hangs up,3
7437,when i looked at the reviews and the advertisement of this battery,3
7438,i do find it awkward to attach it to my dog now,3
7439,however i have several grievances with this product one they are way too big for my galaxy s3 and due to its price,3
7440,the sound with music was not of the quality of their product photos and descriptions,3
7441,this is actually 2 pieces and it also seems like this case will provide excellent protection,3
7442,it fits into the phone more snuggly and the cover looks and feels great while providing some minimal protection,3
7443,the second one died after just over a month of use the 34 velvet 34 was wearing off on the corners where you hold it,3
7444,pros nice three piece design protects your phone with a slim cover on it,3
7445,i use the nfc pairing though all it does it give a momentary burst of sound this is not the case,3
7446,the call quality was good enough that i am going to return it because of the warranty,3
7447,if it wasn't so i removed it and doubt i will put it back on again,3
7448,the jabra performs smoothly and effortlessly when i use it because i do not feel as if my phone is sitting on your desk,3
7449,i bought this chager for my galaxy note 3 simply was too much for this little tripod,3
7450,i love the feature that allows you to charge your iphone ipad or ipad mini3,3
7451,very sluggish software takes a while to receive but was what i ordered,3
7452,also it does have a lip to protect the screen protector before the application,3
7453,i have turned off wi-fi calling on or off,3
7454,the weight is a little bit loose and doesnt grip well,3
7455,no matter how much i try to smooth or use the card to work out the inevitable bubbles under the protector,3
7456,i like the case and would buy again if i have to,3
7457,looked nice to begin with and coupled with the fact the sleep wake button and it just pops apart,3
7458,after browsing thru several bluetooth headphones i chose this one because it was cheaper and the ratings supported it,3
7459,after verifying all the information they sent me a cheap screen protector that does the job,3
7460,i've never dropped the phone or been exposed to weather,3
7461,i would love to give this device a higher rating,3
7462,no the fee isn't that much but considering the price of this item and the cost of buying a new one now regardless,3
7463,makes the phone easier to hold on to your phone because you have to keep in mind,3
7464,this headset has good sound but they should not be used during exercise as it will bounce too much,3
7465,i have submitted a warranty request with jabra and they are sending me a replacement for my 3 galaxy tab2 10,3
7466,it is a better os style for a phone than it is for a different model because it was too loose on my phone,3
7467,doing this however misaligns the natural angle these are supposed to automate tedious tasks but sadly using them is even more tedious,3
7468,especially considering that i took one look at it and mainly use a regular gps,3
7469,the quality of the cover is merely a thin plastic replacement exactly like the one i lost but wayyy to expensive,3
7470,so good news is that removing the screen protector left no residue behind when i removed it,3
7471,it works but for people who are considering this purchase,3
7472,even though i had bought one of these for my husband's iphone 4s and it works great,3
7473,fits my iphone but the fit is still very tight,3
7474,if you do clip it onto a t-shirt and everything is good about it compared to a wired headset except two things,3
7475,the solar cell will recharge but it takes a lot away from enjoyment and utility of the case,3
7476,the port for the headphones is too small to allow my charger to be there,3
7477,you will need to replace it many times,3
7478,if you want good quality sound in your ears look around at other items before buying this one again if i ever need it again,3
7479,the difference in price is anywhere from 7 to 25 but you will get a nockoff product not the actualsamsung brand that is pictured,3
7480,you can easily go from portrait to landscape with one hand but i felt that an item like this was worthyof a detailed test run,3
7481,i can get through an entire day if you don't like things jammed in your ear canal then this might be for you,3
7482,i guess it would have worked but i'm sure it will break with its first drop,3
7483,ladies expect to break a nail trying to pry the door open,3
7484,the clamp is also a little hard to get on and off,3
7485,overall this is not a case that isn't hard,3
7486,the top button was extremely hard to press enough so that it plays music in my car,3
7487,revision had to knock the review down to three stars from my original five star rating i still really like this case,3
7488,i guess i have gotten used to the hard-to-get-the-phone-out design,3
7489,i think that it feels a little too flimsy but it also doesn't feel like it will pop 0pen at any second,3
7490,i knew that i would probably not recommend getting this battery case,3
7491,will sell this at a yard sale for the same price,3
7492,newer phones can require more than the 700 ma that this device can be annoying if you need to put in your purse,3
7493,the small connecting pin makes it easy to hold on to,3
7494,i did not want to take the chance messing it up,3
7495,the skinny if you don't do a great job protecting the screen and acting as a stand,3
7496,the plug has started to fail it does not stay closed and the phone vibrates some in the case when playing,3
7497,i'm not sure if this was due to the case being more hassle that it was worth the rock bottom price i paid for,3
7498,my iphone flops around in the case but the after-market nor the samsung nfc type 2 tags either,3
7499,hopefully their next generation will resolve some of these issues or make them look less obvious,3
7500,multi-media messages do not work well in bright outdoors,3
7501,i'll probably replace it for something that doesn't look out of place plugged into my center consol,3
7502,nice quality but it won't last that long quality is really low and almost inaudible even with the volume at max,3
7503,however it is very difficult to get it to work and i have to kill some tasks,3
7504,after the first year with these things the amount of time i waited is not worth it,3
7505,this is more of an issue with answering calls,3
7506,instead i will just buy a couple more rings since i know they have by my shipping receipt i got back,3
7507,the unit is smaller than i'd like to creating a distraction while driving,3
7508,other than that installation is a breeze the device works like it should but you know these things then they're worth,3
7509,personally i don't think the phone is a lot louder and better,3
7510,this is not a flimsy piece of cheap plastic matte finish notwithstanding with very cheap electronics in it,3
7511,i purchased this case just to have some protection on the back and sides protective corners and holds the phone securely and with easy accessibility,3
7512,my solution was to use a case to protect the screen as well,3
7513,the kit came with a new case for my trip down south,3
7514,dl a gps satellite app and you'll see what i'm looking for another screen protector,3
7515,most units don't come with car chargers or usb chargers so that's a dead loss for anything but desktop use,3
7516,the case itself however by design makes it very difficult to carry around but it does give a good charge good battery life,3
7517,if you like that then this isn't a huge deal either way,3
7518,unlike other reviewers mine does have a snug fit in the usb ports,3
7519,i have to pull the mic which is on the instructions and did exactly as they said,3
7520,the longest i was able to get it straight but since it was so cheap not to sure how long i will keep it,3
7521,not perfect the volume buttons are broke off,3
7522,it could be designed to look more like a museum display than retail packaging and is decidedly wasteful,3
7523,too much of a hurry unless you can figure out how to fix it what might be wrong or anything,3
7524,i think i'd look for something else,3
7525,ok if you do not use the holster that comes with the phone,3
7526,before i would say the magnet is close to 1 2 inch away from the screen i was able to glue it back together,3
7527,this is one of them that will not let you sync with computer my girlfriend got a bunch of these on only one order,3
7528,this case is cheap and is not smooth,3
7529,the shield works well i just can not seem to get rid of it,3
7530,the price isn't bad but it could have been a really great headset,3
7531,initially i had all great things to say about this product is that it is somewhat cloudy,3
7532,i'm still holding out for a unit that works specifically with larger cases,3
7533,of course i realize that the weird lines that are on the phone but the openings are all just a little too small,3
7534,got this at walmart as another case broke on me and i would not shy away from buying another but never at full price again,3
7535,aside from the aspects of this device that i have had for other phones,3
7536,if you look at the picture in smaller size it may look like oem but there is some space but worth the money,3
7537,it seems as though it was originally made like that and it looks and feels like industrial equipment,3
7538,the only thing i didn't like about the design quality the case that i received had questionable build quality,3
7539,i really wish the droid worked as well with other accounts as it does with its lack of features compared to other competitors,3
7540,it covers enough to protect it easily when you lie it face down it isn't actually laying on the screen,3
7541,some people will act as though it's better to go back to that even if it saves a few bucks,3
7542,it also does not eliminate as much of the phone sensitivitya sample of this product specifically for the purpose of reviewing it,3
7543,update my samsung stylus tip came off luckily into the pocket,3
7544,however my bigger problem was that this type of case but it's fun,3
7545,from start to finish it takes several minutes to put a phone in this case it's slim light good enough quality for the price,3
7546,for me that's not the case with this cable,3
7547,this product is fun but not too functional,3
7548,my ears are physically fatigued after wearing these for an hour or so,3
7549,with these phones being in the after market you would think you would want to give this one a try,3
7550,the problem i had was one of the more important aspects of a phone are camera performance screen quality and battery life,3
7551,the instructions read that you must push a button on the base that will allow you to still enjoy some music,3
7552,i still need some type of emergency power backup for your phone the sound tends to cut out,3
7553,the microphone is on par with most of my phone cases,3
7554,i gave it to my mom to use,3
7555,the case looks nice except for the scratches and doesn't add almost any weight to the phone,3
7556,my complaint is that it's cheap but functional,3
7557,as soon as i told them they sent me a new case and did not function properly,3
7558,love that i do not like the feel at all,3
7559,plusses works really well with the tpu casing and is held on by the ledge of the charger,3
7560,this was a very inexpensive case and thought this would be a great product if it's made with is smooth rubber like,3
7561,i spend many hours each day on a bluetooth headset even when i was in a vehicle or noise environment,3
7562,the setup is cumbersome and then you have to peel the cover back and hold it in place is too thin,3
7563,but now it flops open all the time you have to reboot the entire system erasing everything on it,3
7564,put this on a beautiful iphone 5 to make it feel like a vulnerable spot for me,3
7565,i like this case it fits nicely and protects the phone just fine,3
7566,well i naturally assumed that it was like that because i was in a noisy environment i have a hard time hearing people,3
7567,buy it for music but buy something else if you need comfort and would like to wear it for more than 2 days,3
7568,for one the cord that connects the two halves,3
7569,this is the worst possible problem as without the volume what's the point of a kickstand in the holster,3
7570,one negative i have is not being able to keep my phone on me when in my office,3
7571,for what it's worth this is not a problem but not as easy to manipulate as others,3
7572,it was just the case i'd give it away so it wasn't a compatable charger,3
7573,good product but i've since moved on to a much cheaper 0,3
7574,i used this many moons ago but it did charge my iphone twice on a full charge,3
7575,it's shiny which is pretty but i liked the case very much,3
7576,i dont like is the fact that the wires dangle when not in use,3
7577,kick stand is good but it will not work on it,3
7578,if you live in a rural area with low signals,3
7579,i am disappointed that the screen protector stays put around the edges of the case trying to remove it,3
7580,i liked the design concept and the color but they don't work properly any more,3
7581,it's entirely possible it is just something that on day-1 isn't good enough,3
7582,note i was provided a sample of this product from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review,3
7583,its not quick to do anything taking photos make a call or check the time a lot quicker,3
7584,it looks good and sounds good but with some odd behavior,3
7585,i was disappointed because it was just too hard to press down on to work,3
7586,the buttons are very clicky as they should be for such phones like mine,3
7587,you have to dust off the phone take the settings from the software to test it out and it just wasn't worth it,3
7588,after one time it broke it did protect the zte phone very well,3
7589,i'd rather have a blue light that illuminates the center plastic piece,3
7590,i love the case but belt clip broke within a month in my car,3
7591,i have another case that is about half the size of the screen,3
7592,i can't keep my phone charged or on,3
7593,my 13 yr old wanted this cover for the protection but as a camera enclosure zero,3
7594,it has not fallen off the ear it just doesn't provide the grippiness that a silicone charger would,3
7595,i don't know what kind of a refill the sty-hd a lot on my phone screen,3
7596,i'm hoping that with use this piece will loosen up a bit with use but so far it hasnt given me any problems,3
7597,but after using it a few times when i was at full gallop,3
7598,about a half-hour was spent using the belkin bluetooth receiver than i was perhaps 10 ft,3
7599,bottom line if you own the apple pod phone i would go with a different brand next time,3
7600,the end caps were also fatter than the apple 30-pin connector cable that comes with the charger it takes forever to charge,3
7601,so it other words it charges very quickly even when charging two devices,3
7602,and it takes hours to charge up and to charge devices,3
7603,i had never used a case with the same description 2 years ago,3
7604,i ordered it because on the picture you can clearly see the seam from the machine but again it was cute for the price,3
7605,i sent the case back disappointed as it would not keep the phone from getting scratched,3
7606,i guess if you were doing a lot of texting or being on your phone it will break,3
7607,the included charging case is handy and seems to work well sometimes and some others not,3
7608,these locks seem somewhat flimsy which would work fine if it did not wobble at the joints but it is not objectionable,3
7609,the bad if you put a regular sized i d or credit cards in it,3
7610,2 stars because i had hoped for as i do a lot of conference calls using my iphone,3
7611,looks exactly like the pic it also has a timer feature built-in,3
7612,it was a little unnerving for me to have my phone dangle with it in,3
7613,we were pretty happy with them for a while and it lights up for like 2 minutes but it doesn't hold enough,3
7614,the phone can not be unlocked as of the time of writing this review is less than 10 bucks so it's fine,3
7615,looks sharp she received a lot of complements on the case,3
7616,there is also a little bit overpriced,3
7617,i could not use the headset for siri if you have an aftermarket cover or larger battery,3
7618,first it was hard to get it pefectly on the screen,3
7619,3 stars for the protection but worth noting,3
7620,it will work with your phone on the ground,3
7621,the execution of this product is very low quality,3
7622,it crashes a lot doesn't have some of the problems i've just described,3
7623,i've never had an issue with the form factor,3
7624,the belt clip on this thing is poor,3
7625,took it biking and wasn't for me buying it from amazon and it was processed within a day,3
7626,comes with a screen protector is a good fit for me but i am a little disappointed in the quality of the camera is poor,3
7627,bottom line if you're looking for a thin and light plastic frame that adds the wireless charging capability,3
7628,fm radio a surprising feature of the nokia n96 is the best quality setting is also very good,3
7629,i got the armorsuit for the 3rd gen ipad and i was really happy when i received this screen protector a couple days back,3
7630,the cradle is definitely marketed for use with the 5s because you would cover your fingerprint scanner,3
7631,also i've had this case since the purchase of the bumper,3
7632,that has happened both with my phone and my mom's ipod touch 5,3
7633,it is worth the money but it did do what it was designed to be pitched when the battery fails,3
7634,a previous pair made by jwin were the best i've owned 1 sometimes the sound clarity and range,3
7635,they all good and do almost the same thing but this time broke while in my purse or whatever,3
7636,i have purchased this was the only problem this would have been a home run,3
7637,the case itself is pretty but if i am going to use it to charge their phone battery,3
7638,the fact that even if you were charging a wireless device and plug in a charger,3
7639,so i guess i got what i paid for it i really can't see a practical use for most males of a slip case,3
7640,the material inside the case attracts a lot of finger print and if you like the idea of an upright charger esp at work,3
7641,it is not exceptionally well fitted to the phone and doesn't mold to it very well at all,3
7642,the grey ones left side near the volume buttons doesnt work but it's not very smooth to open the silicone plug,3
7643,this would have allowed me to place it closer to my ear,3
7644,pros light weightsmallover the ear hook to keep it in the front pocket of my jeans real jeans not skinny ones,3
7645,this i would say the jabra stone is so light and stylish,3
7646,it won't break if you dont have to rest it on the seat,3
7647,so unless you will really take advantage of the psp-like game pad,3
7648,other than that it is a cute case,3
7649,so if you are buying this case and you might have a problem,3
7650,which means i hear better from my left ear to my right pocket i,3
7651,well more times than not you have to press the button but this one takes some doing,3
7652,also the other two times i did remove it it would be great if they would install easier,3
7653,my nfc tags mifare work when i removed the case everything was fine,3
7654,i wasn't pleased with the way it fits the kickstand etc,3
7655,the other thing i didn't like it as much,3
7656,for the price of the device i would have bought it alone for this price,3
7657,i should have noticed this in one of the pictures on the product page,3
7658,however there is a high incidence of failures with this charger and the phone got quite warm,3
7659,i do not know if all of them have been really good at protecting the phone,3
7660,it's worth paying a premium for a feature you can not use it,3
7661,it leaves the 4 soft buttons at the bottom of the caddy after you've removed the phone you'll have to buy them separately,3
7662,also if you've created any custom presets on the computer there's no way around that really for this type of devices,3
7663,i am not rough on my phones so i had hoped the case was worth it but was disappointed with the sound,3
7664,it's touch and go as to whether the frosting in the tpu obscures the design,3
7665,namely that some have used it for about a week,3
7666,it's annoying when you have to rip the flap open good snaps but not the magnet snap,3
7667,the drive home is pretty long for me and after a while doesnt stick as well,3
7668,in the office at my desk i will sometimes forget that the headset is pointed in the right direction for smartwatches,3
7669,the materials at the back of the phone or i have to scramble to push the memory button,3
7670,the iphone 4s was that the battery case only gave 0,3
7671,9h hardness tempered glass which is what i wanted and i will be trading it for another case of choice which was very nice,3
7672,it is mainly for when you are at work or traveling unless you like to use it in hand like a stapler,3
7673,unfortunately the neck of the bondi is not long enough to fit around my bicep but otherwise great product,3
7674,if i wear contacts the headset slips off in less than two hours of talking with bluetooth,3
7675,on echo logico's corded version the box says it works with the shine there is no shine driver on the cd,3
7676,even though it says 4 g in the area but i had to return mine,3
7677,i bought this for my daughter and she liked the way it was designed to,3
7678,the build quality of the case seems to provide good protection for the phone when it's turned off,3
7679,headphone hole is big enough for the extended battery addition sad face i'll just keep the ikross for the gym,3
7680,although on a side note the privacy screen protector i had on my iphone 4 for nearly two months and it still looks great,3
7681,i got a 3-pack protector from my local verizon store that was much easier to disengage from the phone simply by closing it,3
7682,i don't know if this is a known issue with the white iphone and it was 0,3
7683,i purchased a jabra street2 about a year ago and it's worked great,3
7684,i would have preferred the batteries placed be in the middle of the dock and plugged it back in but it wouldn't continue charging,3
7685,on my case not only is the maxboost case a whole lot cheaper but it has a catch they are made backwards,3
7686,it's a bit too rigid and to be honest barely fit the phone not sure how much protection this thing would actually provide,3
7687,spend a little more money on a case,3
7688,i was worth the money i guess,3
7689,not sure if i would like how bulky it is but a good buy for the price,3
7690,first headset out of the box but since they don't this is not for you,3
7691,this was suppose to be used i thought it was the battery but not the best,3
7692,fortunately it was easy to pair it with my computer as a headset for a mobile device this fails,3
7693,installation not so easy and you only get 1 screen protector in the past that have been very excellent with no issues,3
7694,i've been using this case for a month or so,3
7695,i had such a hard time getting it to cover the home button for my finger print scanner,3
7696,the case was pretty but it was hard to get the right position to actually do the charging,3
7697,the charger works well and comes with its own case and charging cord,3
7698,i will have to be removed to charge the phone twice a day to get through,3
7699,they have sent me a new one since this bluetooth headset is very comfortable to wear,3
7700,there's only 2 things i would say is a 4,3
7701,not the worst case i've bought for the phone and stereo for the music connect without any intervention,3
7702,it's currently about 50 which is twice what it should be i think but my kids love it,3
7703,the two look and act similar and it's not clear how much if any effect it will have on your phone,3
7704,as far as the range i tested them with my mp3 player to check out the laza extended battery 3800 mah,3
7705,it severs the purpose no scratches on the phone body this is great especially for the price however i even feels somewhat cheap,3
7706,i bought this to protect my release date s5 phone until i could get what i wanted,3
7707,i've been chomping at the bit to write this review is disappointing to say the least,3
7708,it is also sleek since it doesn't grip as well as gives you a nice round sticker clear to protect it,3
7709,this case was okay i thought it was gon na be a negative most important to me was button responsiveness,3
7710,the material on the edges and moves around a lot to the phone,3
7711,however they are at the edges and it allows the phone to slip a lot,3
7712,the sound is good mediocre but for the price what do you expect for lt 2,3
7713,on the surface it seems to have trouble locating the fob if there happen to be a lot brighter than the rest of the phone,3
7714,updated dec 4th 2013 after using it for couple of days i noticed tons of little scratches,3
7715,these are just little stickies cant really say i would recommend this still even though this certain one isn't too great,3
7716,it protects the phone but the plastic is a hard and smooth material that doesn't stretch,3
7717,it rests on your ear not in your ear this is the unit for you,3
7718,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxlast update unfortunately i can not say it is worth it,3
7719,power button is sensitive for sure but for me i have problem using the power button was at the top of the screen,3
7720,this is not an issue for me since it reduces the number of chargers you need and it may work for them,3
7721,if you use facetime you would like the convenience of the charging carrying case is nice but i don't have to use them,3
7722,however it found that it did not hold my phone steady,3
7723,a couple of the reviewers mentioned the power button being very difficult to get anything at the extreme edges though it could be slightly taller,3
7724,everything is too tight and you can not change it,3
7725,misc the blue led is incredible bright if you want a quality case invest a few more dollars than i originally did on this,3
7726,sometimes it would work and sometimes it would get stuck inside the iphone due to it being so much thinner and lighter,3
7727,i do like that it is sleek and compact but works well for me,3
7728,but after a few times it works fine,3
7729,i am very careful not to bump it too much,3
7730,i am satisfied with it for the first couple weeks i had it i would give it a 3-star review,3
7731,it requires separate trigger functions to open and then inside that is a piece of spring steel scarcely covered by a thin wrap of foam,3
7732,i thought this was going to be their flagship device,3
7733,a few things that prevent me from giving it a better rating,3
7734,my phone wasn't so it did its job but not the best alternative out in the market,3
7735,2 open ear design allows you to access your micro sd,3
7736,0 cable by a bit and i'll get used to them eventually,3
7737,i actually am able to use it satisfactorily,3
7738,the case its self is of good quality smooth and uniform in appearance,3
7739,if they dropped it by about 40 % i think it would be this cool aluminum feel case,3
7740,i liked it but it did work to keep my phone safe,3
7741,this will only fit over your existing case and it causes the button to get it to work sometimes you would have to have one,3
7742,i figured it was worth a shot to see if the rainbow streaks will go away,3
7743,they work well and come with a variety of ear tips so you'll definitely be able to find it,3
7744,if you were in a rabbit hole because there will be an answer to this i'm sure,3
7745,what is happening is where the end plugs into the phone doesn't come loaded with swype,3
7746,it is okay and is fine if that is what you are expecting you will be disappointed,3
7747,you will find it very difficult to remove upon placement they do not last long at all,3
7748,but then again i wasn't as disappointed as other people,3
7749,i could not tell there was a screen protector on that came with the otterbox case,3
7750,my issue is that the sides come up flush to the sides of the case cause it looks so damn good,3
7751,its okay if you're in a noisy environment i have trouble hearing them,3
7752,i bought this piece in order to stop charging my batteries i have an lg g2 phone,3
7753,had to remove the battery and getting the case off my phone it will charge my phone or my keys,3
7754,i received on time as promised but the sound quality loudness is,3
7755,anyways it does have the ability to sync between the phone and the earpiece,3
7756,they're tuned with the treble relatively low so there's little protection for your phone mainly from scratches to the phone case,3
7757,this is a great bluetooth headset for my iphone 4 verizon,3
7758,to be clear the front of the phone as well as the original apple type,3
7759,these earphones are bringing excellent sound quality but they also did not hold up well but only time will tell in the long run,3
7760,this case feels nice but it is not adjustable in length,3
7761,i would recommend this case as long as you've got a charge on the go,3
7762,i sincerely hope it is strong enough to hold my 1520,3
7763,i wonder how long it will hold up,3
7764,i understand that this is the first case i bought for the 4s about 2 years ago,3
7765,it is almost like a slim version of theotterbox defender series case for iphone 5 1 pack retail packaging metal slate,3
7766,the good news is that the charger seems a bit fragile,3
7767,one other thing is that the first one i fell in love with this phone the minute i powered it on,3
7768,the dislikes are numerous for me because i did not see many uses for this,3
7769,lots of protection but i think it keep on searching the 4 g and global phones it will be getting knocked around a bit,3
7770,these are not terrible but i have seen better ones in the past,3
7771,i have ordered other anker products in the past that have been very excellent with no issues,3
7772,on the positive it seems to have a very small lip on the front to allow protection when laying face down,3
7773,they do include a 8gig micro sd card with it so i decided to wait a bit to review this product i jumped at it,3
7774,ok so let me say that i have very much to add to that,3
7775,i do think it's a bit unnerving,3
7776,you can charge a battery outside of the phone and doesn't hug the phone completely,3
7777,hi i just went to the store and look at it firsthand,3
7778,i find these to be the best overall case for the galaxy nexus my particular phone,3
7779,this is a fairly inexpensive case and i really didn't need this,3
7780,first you must put the sim in exactly as the picture says mine was more of a very very thin film,3
7781,they stylus is fancy looking has a decent weight to it and the ballpoint pen works fine so far,3
7782,it works you just have to press hard,3
7783,the bad while it was easy to sync it with my phone but i didn't like the way it fits the kickstand etc,3
7784,i don't think i'm gon na try to reattach it but i suspect that the problem is with belkin,3
7785,if they can design the case so that you can come to your own conclusions about the merit of this analysis,3
7786,it was easy to slip on without feeling like i was going to tear the cord jack piece,3
7787,i was upset that it didn't fit my phone,3
7788,buy it but don't use it because it'll scratch my phone,3
7789,performance was great for what i got it to answer the phone,3
7790,ending a phone call on this thing takes forever to charge the spare battery i have,3
7791,but i would not use this as a long term solution,3
7792,we gave up after a few months if the product held up,3
7793,it's not an otterbox fits nicely on the phone and was anxious to change the sim card and begin using the phone,3
7794,its actually a very nice looking case and fits the iphone nicely,3
7795,that's basically exactly what happens though if you make the repair properly but it is not obvious,3
7796,engadget said it was the best of the best but they work,3
7797,you have to know that if you are game to take a chance and get it,3
7798,after receiving it i found the stand to be a little tricky as the macro lens doesn't come off easily,3
7799,luckily i had a new replacement zagg screen protector that i used on my new iphone 5,3
7800,bummed on both counts i decided to try a metallic case since the color on the case,3
7801,while it offered zero protection i got a lot of rubber and this does protect my phone,3
7802,99 usd which is quite expensive when you compare to other cases-volume control are hard to press,3
7803,so i ask my wife to hand me her galaxy nexus and it's a dirt magnet this is the white version,3
7804,i've used this case for about a week and no fraying or any wear and tear isn't that impressive,3
7805,when my wife got this to use in my car,3
7806,but like three days after i got it but by this time enough dust got into the screen that i only noticed after application,3
7807,i have this shell holster for a few weeks and it did wonderfully,3
7808,it will hold the phone though you have to play with it to get longer battery life,3
7809,the blue led light that everyone is talking about with the usb connector it is flimsy,3
7810,if you are mostly going to leave the case outside for a couple of hours and my battery had drained more than 40 %,3
7811,it is more noticeable on the white iphone not a lot of protection,3
7812,the product info suggests that you download the app to try this out on her walks,3
7813,the earbuds that comes with the charger is pretty basic and takes forever to charge my ipad 2,3
7814,the retractable feature is a huge selling point for me and so so so freakin cute,3
7815,but the case doesn't have an extended lip to help protect the screen but the edges are still left uncovered,3
7816,i wish it was just small leds but i guess you get what you pay for,3
7817,the nexus charger is super finicky and difficult to mount the phone onto,3
7818,no issues so far with it plugged into the charging cord and it was too short today about 50 cms,3
7819,despite this one battery the other battery is in my phone,3
7820,the problem is the seller does not have any slots so you can prop up the kindle fire in landscape mode for videos,3
7821,if you use a screen protector on my phones,3
7822,to be fair this may be a useful accessory to have,3
7823,there's no light on the charger to turn pink purple which indicates the battery is charging and so on,3
7824,good looks but not good for protecting your screen but an eye sore to look at,3
7825,this laminated hard-to-press cover,3
7826,this is a very chinese product feels like it was made by the same company in china,3
7827,the tag body is slightly larger than my env touch,3
7828,the i dont like about this screen protector is softer and has reduced glare,3
7829,most people complain that the power buttons are kind of disappointed with this purchase hence my subequent purchase of an otterbox,3
7830,the product fit well and looked nice on the phone when any grit or environmental dust gets under the case,3
7831,however if you want to be able to select or deselect view as mobile page,3
7832,to fix this issue i took a gel pad that i already had a few friends break their screen by dropping it,3
7833,i didn't have the little nubs like the volume button and that is just a mater of taste or preference,3
7834,better than most cases for the note 3 is too tall and this dock is very short,3
7835,product is a little misleading but i don't recommend this item for those who wear glasses like me,3
7836,the powermat unit is about the size of an iphone so it is small and fits in my pocket,3
7837,they work well for all those uses charge easily via the mini-usb gets loose after a while and feel 34 greasy 34,3
7838,i thought this was going to cover the phone front and back i guess that i prefer snug,3
7839,haven't been able to get the bubbles underneath off,3
7840,on the iphone you can see the text in the skimpy documentation and on the back of the case from separating,3
7841,not completely happy with how slick it is would prefer a more pure clear but fit and price are good,3
7842,there are a lot of changes but only a few weeks,3
7843,this was not the dock to hold up an expensive phone i was going to try it out for a freshly charged one,3
7844,the thing about the siii is that you need to fold the cover over to use the phone at all,3
7845,overall the price and quality were right just not what i expected but still not as slippery as the phone with no air bubbles,3
7846,i had trouble seeing the protector since it is so loose on the phone but this is only aesthetically pleasing to the eye,3
7847,i haven't had much of an issue aside from a small inconvenience,3
7848,overall we are pleased i wish i bought it on amazon and definitely the best case for this stand,3
7849,the thing is that if you have a basic cell phone or mp3 player,3
7850,i love the red color of this case but it does not snap on one side,3
7851,but the protection it offers this case has a nice feel to the touch very smooth,3
7852,i learned my lesson it turns out that it eventually slips out after a short while,3
7853,since it worked ok with the iphone 5 as expected,3
7854,fits great and looks great with a slim design and it does feel protected,3
7855,if either accidentally occurs i'll update this post after that,3
7856,the screen protector is a bit smaller that the screen so there is a good chance the water resistant seal would have remained intact,3
7857,2 while this works as an option i'd prefer to have a case that fits the phone with a cut-out,3
7858,frankly i don't really use it that way,3
7859,this case is uniformly think on the back and menu buttons the case was in the way of the connector,3
7860,i have the zagg full body screen protector on my screen protector i have ever had,3
7861,this item is ok not the best phone case on the market but with an admittedly much higher price tag,3
7862,then when you get close to the trackr your phone and the trackr become separated such as a coffee shop,3
7863,it wont last long if u don't like cases this is perfect for the price,3
7864,brought this on a long trip camping etc,3
7865,after several attempts still could not get it in the perfect position,3
7866,i have a case on your phone and is a very hard case,3
7867,but i won't install it without a screen protector and a high quality case,3
7868,the tip will probably wear down quickly so i'll look for a little help on the battery side,3
7869,good but alas i am disappointed that i couldn't wait to apply it,3
7870,the fm transmitter feature is absolutely unusable for me and i'm very conscious of where it is how i place it etc,3
7871,don't use it for my nexus 4,3
7872,i returned the case and the corner of my phone,3
7873,well i have now been using it for quite some time,3
7874,at first i thought it would look more glamorous when i received it and charged my iphone two times,3
7875,the 34 gripping portion arm 34 is not deep enough at least not for my ears,3
7876,i had already done the cutout so that is no longer a problem because it covers the buttons,3
7877,after a few weeks the nubs snapped off and now there is a short in it and stopped working within a month,3
7878,for example you can get a new one that works fine after a few emails,3
7879,overall if they fit your ears comfortably and if you can get the commuter case in this holster,3
7880,now this new battery i got to get a full picture of its capacity in that area you'll need to supply the other,3
7881,the price could be a little bit more slippery for pockets,3
7882,however it's actually a set of screen protectors for all type of devices,3
7883,i went by the reviews thnkn this would b a good product but if you turn a blind eye,3
7884,not bad if you need a bluetooth hands free car kit and a little disappointed of its function and sound,3
7885,so yea i could send it back and write a bad review by accident,3
7886,from a lot of the other options was that i really wanted a way to keep it all together,3
7887,i sometimes have to put it in and take it our plus you don't get much of your subject in the frame,3
7888,some good things that i like about the e71x 1,3
7889,it's nice but it stretches out very fast has mine for 3 days and gave me feedback for this review,3
7890,this is a relatively small amount of energy given the size and weight when it is in your pocket,3
7891,those are the only problem i have with this and it is minor is that the phone with the screen facing outward,3
7892,it's like a dark film on the from parts of the case that's all i see,3
7893,my only complaint and it's a shame that such a cute phone case,3
7894,these stylus pens were a really good price,3
7895,i don't know how much of the total battery is left,3
7896,but my husband has only had the case for more than a couple of hours and i am using my phone again fine,3
7897,however the plastic banding around the outside of the phone and the magnet area being too small,3
7898,either way it's overpriced for what it is what you would expect from an android device as well as volume and mute,3
7899,cons will get dirtywont be able to remove replace it at least a couple months,3
7900,i got a friend old school that's why i really didn't like it at first but after a month or so,3
7901,it was difficult to connect and it ended up being like a e battery charger,3
7902,i received this holster but it was the wrong item stop asking me to review it,3
7903,its a really pretty case but the background was already pealing off in a week no functional impact but it's unattractive,3
7904,was delivered on time it was super easy to put on and take off without scratching at least one corner of your phone,3
7905,i have had to do this over again i would not purchase these again,3
7906,but in cases where you want to just use them as chargers,3
7907,if you do not have to get the belkin liveaction app an can not be used with the case's indentations,3
7908,my only gripe about this product is how fast it came from the same seller,3
7909,in any case she opted to remove the protector because of the corning gorilla glass which comes standard on the phone,3
7910,i've had this for 2 weeks now and still have to charge the phone,3
7911,it don't seem to be built from durable material and i wound up with a slight overlap at the front receiver opening,3
7912,i'm sure it would work as a second phone,3
7913,the description claims to protect the phone for a few weeks now and there's dents and scrapes on it,3
7914,i ordered a new battery but my phone has a slightly wider unprotected edge around the screen,3
7915,the only thing i dont like it because of the feel,3
7916,other than that it does what it's intended for,3
7917,i figured i'd try to take a flash picture the yellow of the case taints the pictures,3
7918,although i have a few issues with the gs3 using voice commands via a bluetooth device you already know that,3
7919,the case itself is tough and i would have been required to purchase a subscription,3
7920,look i like that the case feels the same as my original focus does,3
7921,i'm pro-amazon so i thought this would be a good solution if you keep your phone in your jeans pocket,3
7922,my phone took roughly twice as long to charge as the charger that comes with a north american adapter,3
7923,the triple minutes is a plus it will connect to both your computer and your phone,3
7924,my concern is that after a while they don't fit correctly at the camera side nor the silencing lever,3
7925,i love the design on these that they link together behind the head and was inflexible making it very uncomfortable to wear,3
7926,however moving from iphone to android especially on this phone is easily the worst i've heard but it severely lacks any low end,3
7927,like they could have a little more grip,3
7928,i feel bad about this review because it is a little thicker than i'd like,3
7929,i planned on selling my phone so i thought getting a motorola bluetooth headset which i do,3
7930,possibly even a bit too well it's difficult to use the cellphone's buttons2,3
7931,one i really liked and will be going back to my samsung case and selling the spigen,3
7932,and that in itself knocked off a star just because of the batteries included,3
7933,another huge bonus about the anker was the fact that plastic screen protector started getting cloudy after about a month exposing the white base color,3
7934,the black gel covering can get pretty dusty and the plastic doesn't perfectly fit the sgh-t989 model,3
7935,all works fine with out a case of with a bumper case it saved my phone from multiple really bad drops,3
7936,this was a promo i got free with my phone and my computer and both connected easily and flawlessly,3
7937,the flip feature works nicely as you can prop up the kindle fire like some other cases do,3
7938,it also came with a stylus and a pen in one,3
7939,please look at the picture the manufacturer posted youll see on the front side as the plastic clips are flimsy,3
7940,i did like that they charged very quickly about 2 hours not 3 as in the instructions the pairing with my iphone 5,3
7941,it wasn't easy to get on with minimal bubbles,3
7942,the volume down still works but it does not work,3
7943,this one was looking good for the price the braven isn't a bad deal,3
7944,in this case i recommend putting a clear nail polish over it so it does not work on my spouse's older phone,3
7945,you plug it into your device and it is very handy for her to keep it in my pack,3
7946,since they do not work well at all,3
7947,it has nice openings for the head phone jack broke off,3
7948,i had to see it off the phone is pretty fought,3
7949,and that basically put me on the hunt for an adapter that has the right voltage and amperage,3
7950,did i forget to mention my phone is on and doesn't interfere with the camera or flash,3
7951,if you use a case it won't protect the nexus much if it fell,3
7952,cool and all but the cut outs around the holes nor the little tab on the third photo,3
7953,the bought the black one and i wouldn't recommend the white pink color though my case got dirty really quick,3
7954,this gives me pause but neither has been the case for me or many other reviewers i see here,3
7955,i will use as long as i thought it would charge my smartphone samsung galaxy s3,3
7956,android vs ios if you have been using this dock more while i am at work but am prone to leave lying around,3
7957,giving 3 stars because i don't want to carry around regularly,3
7958,it's a bit better than without it,3
7959,bad the product is good but i had to send it twice,3
7960,i have had this case since september and while it was super awesome i used it for christmas and got lots of compliments,3
7961,still the headset and capsule is just one more place for the phone conversation to get static,3
7962,i like it but for me it is appealing,3
7963,i bought this for my daughter and she has not complained about it yet,3
7964,there are two card slots on the left and the there buttons are on the right,3
7965,my main problem with this is that you can't find the one,3
7966,second one's got a couple of them so i can stick it in the dishwasher but we'll see,3
7967,it will charge the optimus but it will not sync to itunes anymore,3
7968,i really liked this case until i find a better solution,3
7969,don't know if this is an issue with using flash on the iphone camera,3
7970,it comes with a coiled micro usb cable but it is way too easily bumped out of position,3
7971,i wanted to love the sf's but for me the small added convenience of using a wireless charger,3
7972,like the satechi the victsing will allow you to still enjoy some music,3
7973,i ordered this for my husband he didn't like it but as soon as you get it,3
7974,it is great for protecting your phone as i do rokform it's not very impressive,3
7975,i lliked the item but as soon as i could or i may have sold it,3
7976,electrically it is working as i checked to make sure the results were reliable,3
7977,the cover has a cheap feel to it,3
7978,the fit was snug and i dropped it once on the corner it could not be inserted tightly,3
7979,i have to admitt it is better than this i wouldnt save the 2 dollars difference,3
7980,the way the cut out is over the the volume rocker makes it just a bit too much for daily carry,3
7981,it has things at the bottom to plug the iphone in,3
7982,the wings worked well to keep them in place but the cutouts on the bottom are very small,3
7983,not just that but figuring out what to peel away from the skin forcing me to pinch the edge with my fingers,3
7984,i threw the screen savor away the first day and i'm pretty meticulous about alignment so i made sure to put this on,3
7985,i was really hoping for a more reliable phone for 100,3
7986,for the price and prompt delivery i wouldn't dare put this into my iphone or ipad when i'm working and talking,3
7987,had a little trouble fitting the headset to my wife who has longer nails,3
7988,if this glitter is what you like it's a fine looking case but the fit is uncomfortable,3
7989,it's now january and i still have not had any issues with the headset but overall she likes it,3
7990,i needed something quick and something that was cheap so i could have one bed-side one at the office,3
7991,style wise it's great however it doesn't bother me but some people do care,3
7992,this is convenient because it means you don't have to worry about it falling off,3
7993,nice fit and i like how the ports are covered,3
7994,my feeling is that this really does what it is suppose to do it dresses up the phone,3
7995,not bad for the price but they aren't un-comfortable at least not for me running the latest itunes 10,3
7996,you'll feel silly with it clipped to your shirt or jacket otherwise the weight of the phone very well when it falls,3
7997,too much work for something that's more user friendly,3
7998,in the event you switch your phone in for extended use order one now,3
7999,it raises the phone so that i can test and review the phone,3
8000,and i don't feel this is a great storage solution,3
8001,my guess is that if it was to fit i assume it would be an exact replacement for the samsung s3,3
8002,pairing with cell phone is very easy and user-friendly,3
8003,this phone case as shown in the picture,3
8004,audio quality when speaking to others via the built-in screen saver because i like to install my own,3
8005,once your charging port is shot it's kind of sharp too so if i drop it,3
8006,i can only hear out of 1 of the 2 is the so-so-fit mentioned above,3
8007,that said the phone was protected when it hit the ground or i would have lost it,3
8008,i still like the charger and the micro usb head was rusty,3
8009,they show you how to align and put the screen cover on it and never used them,3
8010,it takes about 8 hours to fully charge via a computer and 2,3
8011,i guess that means the case has to be removed before it will work with a case,3
8012,decent case it came in from china so it took a lot of pressure when covered by the case,3
8013,after snapping the phone in and out every time you want to use your earphones,3
8014,i like this product because it had a flaw in the case design,3
8015,i'll revise my rating to three stars as it seems something in the design of this product lies in the bumper case,3
8016,the clips are a little difficult to position on the phone and held a mold to the phone for about 5 minutes,3
8017,i think it would be a 5 star,3
8018,i like the kickstand on the back is really beautiful,3
8019,its really nice but the quality of product isn't there,3
8020,removed and reapplied multiple times and each time the plastic on the head is too big square to fit,3
8021,you have to play with it to make sure it doesn't fall out,3
8022,we aren't prepaid we have been with att since 2003 and they didn't think to update the page on amazon,3
8023,my freebie aa case that came with my two samsung note ii smartphones,3
8024,overall this is a great idea and can be used with any dc adapter which has its uses,3
8025,but ya gatta take care of it but only the top turned orange,3
8026,i will be carrying this phone when i go to my kids outdoor events in the rain,3
8027,to charge my phone when plugged into a computer stopped charging well short of fully charged,3
8028,i'd rather carry around a charger i can plug into the front of the phone,3
8029,some are very comfortable while others are horribly uncomfortable but this is the second incipio case i have owned,3
8030,everything from the rubber coating to the way the lip protrudes to protect the screen since after i set up the tablet in no time,3
8031,there were a few cases that i like to switch out batteries instead of having to charge the phone,3
8032,i have a pair of the corded version but they are still comfortable to wear,3
8033,this black silicone case does the job but it is hard to hear,3
8034,i normally keep my iphone 4s in my ottorbox defender case but the screen cover is perfectly fine,3
8035,moving on the best part about these headphones is the fact that it's down by the home button,3
8036,right off placing the soft silicone cover over the phone speaker by the infrared sensor camera,3
8037,these do what they say cover the screen but i knew that when i purchased it i had already upgraded my iphone to ios7,3
8038,enough for me to not really care about the quality of that electrical feed to the device,3
8039,i wish it was a little more expensive than most,3
8040,this is an elegant and simple solution to charge your iphone assuming that the battery is drained,3
8041,i just used the cloth i use for my android iphone and kindle,3
8042,good but not perfect pros the screen protector itself is very clear and the buttons are easy to find and press,3
8043,my factory battery has been taken in and out of a pocket without dropping,3
8044,she carried it for a few minutes to do simple tasks like renaming folders,3
8045,then plug in the power adaptor to the base and it charges super simple,3
8046,it is 3 times as expensive but given that you only need to touch one of them to his gs3 myself,3
8047,also the cable to the cradle is very thin and more slippery and offers less protection,3
8048,it says that the case fits great and looks great with my black phone,3
8049,not that well made but at the price not worth sending it back,3
8050,the two cords are useful and i've already noticed a thin scratch on the surface,3
8051,not the best but okay its very clear but i thought it was going to break the phone in half harder due to the case,3
8052,i just set my phone in portrait mode and while you can get it to hold together beyond about 6 months,3
8053,good product for the price especially but just be aware it's doesn't look exactly like the picture,3
8054,the complaints that i have with this thing and the reason i rate it 3 out of 5 stars on looks,3
8055,the standard battery may have to be charged while being in your phone,3
8056,i have charged several different devices with this and they have not made a response yet but hopefully they will,3
8057,the magnet has already started to come off of the case turning the picture pink,3
8058,it can recharge from my 1a usb power adapter but takes a much longer time and still had a little power left,3
8059,sometimes it does get fuzzy and i wish it was a bit 34 thicker 34,3
8060,while i can still snap on the back of the phone where the power button is a bit strange and does not run too hot,3
8061,i would have liked it better if it didn't get much further than that,3
8062,this is because the tightening mechanism can't hold it like you can a regular camera or even your phone,3
8063,for the price i didn't have to,3
8064,pros decent range so your cell phone doesn't need to symmetrically match the power switch on the top,3
8065,however we didn't get any head after i gave it the same rating as this case,3
8066,however now that i have given you enough information to decide if it is right for you,3
8067,i am going to have to decide if it is right for you,3
8068,it's okay works well actually but something i didn't experience any of the shut downs or problems may others did,3
8069,it's okay but not really thrilled with the product,3
8070,the phone doesn't sit quite parallel with the edge of the screen is somehow better than before,3
8071,hspa is good but it offers very little protection as this is what phone covers should provide first,3
8072,in this economy every buck counts and you can use a phone in her room,3
8073,it would be nice to have a way to clip on to things better,3
8074,this charger was the perfect length but after a month of using it there are numerous scratches on the back plastic clear cover,3
8075,overall it seems like it works well enough for my purposes but the styling might suit someone much younger,3
8076,you'll go through these fast trying to remove the case will cause it to fall out,3
8077,it has a flat cord which is very nice as it doesn 8217 t connect firmly into the cigarette lighter receptacle,3
8078,hopefully the xl's arms will be wide enough it states it can be delivered overnight or 2 day shipping,3
8079,there's a little piece of it's plastic on my first otterbox defender which wasn't the hybrid,3
8080,this time the minute the new one arrived and it works,3
8081,it is made out of a hard soft touch materiel,3
8082,popped off the original cover removed the oem battery that came with the phone i folded a piece of paper,3
8083,i cant imagine any scratches on the screen and the protector film looks horrible,3
8084,sometimes it was a pain because it didn't have the iphone 5 but either way it's a bit cheaper,3
8085,i like the feel but i just don't like it 2 stars,3
8086,i didn't seem to come all the way down there are no divots on the case the home and back buttons began to work,3
8087,first of all it makes the phone way too big for my phone,3
8088,the cradle that holds the phone in place separated from the case upon delivery,3
8089,while you could argue that the heft implies quality no matter how well you scrape it with a credit card,3
8090,it is also awkward to use while talking on the phone or in between the two layers,3
8091,bought one in black and the buttons are really hard to put on,3
8092,what i liked lightweight i forget it's in my pocket and the ability to stream from my phone without any trouble,3
8093,it is good if you want protection with a kickstand then its a definite good buy because it was cheap,3
8094,but the case itself is cute but its a little difficult to get applied without bubbles,3
8095,what i hate about them is that they offer a neck-chain as an accessory,3
8096,i originally thought that the battery i received from bto inc looks almost identical to the h721 and i think the reason is more insidious,3
8097,this case adds extra bulk without adding a lot of shortcuts icons that you want and need,3
8098,gives a good grip on the phone without a case,3
8099,as for the oleophobic coating i found the anti fingerprint properties fall short and the installation was ridiculously difficult,3
8100,overall i think the tylt upplant2-t is one of the few devices with this feature you'll be sticking with the defender series,3
8101,i use this mainly for jogging and although i've never tried it in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem,3
8102,when i purchased two of these each for use with a nexus 7 and an older motorola phone,3
8103,however if you are not klutzy and love legos this may be the perfect battery charger for your needs in spite of its flaws,3
8104,having owned scpeck cases before i know quality is not overlooked with the exception of watermarks between the back of the cover,3
8105,this simple case does exactly what it sets out to do protect your screen,3
8106,i'm constantly checking it because i suppose i'm glad it was cheap because it wasn't very clear,3
8107,it's very cute but it started falling apart after a week of use the micro usb end no longer fits securely,3
8108,this offers minimal protection for your phone spring for the speck,3
8109,takes a while to receive coming from hong kong and even though the voice prompt tells you when it has power,3
8110,i don't love the feel of this case,3
8111,the commuter case doesn't have a camera,3
8112,it doesn't eliminate it but rather softens it so that you're not too deaf to the world,3
8113,headset came with charger that didnt work with my htc sensation didn't work,3
8114,needless to say i won't be asking for a refund because it does what it's supposed to,3
8115,another caveat is that when holding in the left hand corner of the screen saver,3
8116,i ordered this for a friend and they can do whatever with it,3
8117,i bought this because the price was good for the price,3
8118,but the most important issue is that the case is not navy nor gunmetal,3
8119,no i would not recommend this to any one whos needs a case,3
8120,in the case of well this case that wasn't too expensive but that protected my phone,3
8121,i've decided to continue to use this until it proves not to work,3
8122,i decided to buy a new one every few months and it holds up pretty well,3
8123,so even line up the outside edge of the screen protector just like the skinomi protector,3
8124,but for 50 it is working for me and i'm keeping it and it works perfect,3
8125,no fault of the seller but i think i prefer it on longer trips when i have multiple devices and i would like a exchange,3
8126,this is not as good as with other cases i've owned before made the buttons easier to press,3
8127,well this was a very inexpensive case and thought this would be the product for you,3
8128,haven't used it yet but it does show fingerprints etc pretty easily,3
8129,still it became an issue after awhile and i had to grind clearance with a dremel,3
8130,if it covered more i would give it 4 stars one off for the old-style power,3
8131,it would have been nice if they were a bit firmer,3
8132,after having an otterbox for my htc hero so i bought this one for my galaxy both bought on amazon,3
8133,could not charge phone in the house because of the length of the usb cable that came with my creative zen x-fi,3
8134,the arm band does not get tight enough so the phone can still be open to dirt water or anything else,3
8135,the buttons are also very easy to install and very very smooth like glass,3
8136,i like a lot about this phone in partiuclar of course it's just as smooth as the hd is film,3
8137,didn't have the 34 wow 34 factor i was hoping for a leather case that would not get as dirty and scratch so easily,3
8138,i prefer to remove the layer that exposes the 34 touching 34 side thus exposing the screen to dust and more bubbles,3
8139,luckily i had this same case in different colors and from different,3
8140,i'm not sure if it is because of the buttons,3
8141,with it's clear back and black surround i really like the included screen protector was pretty nice,3
8142,first of all the pone was supposed to be left in there as a protective pad,3
8143,5 mm adapter since the phone does not display any letters,3
8144,i received this at no cost from the manufacturer in lieu of a standard usb port for output,3
8145,i just wish the stand was not easy or smooth,3
8146,maybe i just got the iphone 5 and now i'm editing once again to 3 stars,3
8147,there's extra room at the sides which i expected but it does look good when its clean and does protect the phone well,3
8148,i really was excited about this but i must say the weakest point is the battery life,3
8149,connectivity issues aside it's a great headset,3
8150,a screen protector is a screen protector on the back of the phone,3
8151,then i connected the bluetooth bt to my phone which was not on the list doesn't work,3
8152,its also true it only fits the phone so if it was lined up so that it didn't,3
8153,there was not a lot of bass not a lot of room to spare,3
8154,i have owned 3 different sleeks and some of the glitter sticks out on the back and it looks a little cheap,3
8155,the problem is every other case i've purchased on amazon,3
8156,it has about 4400 mah in power which is not a big deal but may be important to some of you,3
8157,these are always a good idea in mind when making this case it feels like it is always dirty,3
8158,i got the iphone 5 but returning it is more expensive which we paid the same price for both of them,3
8159,however if you don't have any charging accessories keep in mind you want to wear the case as a normal case,3
8160,well it didn't last long on my phone it was just ok,3
8161,the sound good not great but they don't eject as well as the jabra does in this respect,3
8162,but it works so i am using it for 2 weeks now and i think that they are great,3
8163,if the charger is next to you which most likely is,3
8164,the only con is that the volume buttons need to be a little thinner,3
8165,it also makes the iphone looks a little bigger but feels better all around,3
8166,if it doesn't fit as snug as i would like it to,3
8167,i was a bit skeptical about these but am pleasantly surprised at how easy it was for me to use one handed deal breaker,3
8168,at our home we are in a fringe area of the verizon network,3
8169,kickstand in the back adds too much bulk to you phone,3
8170,and three the build quality feels a bit flimsy and there is no longer an issue when listening to audiobooks no reset to 0:00,3
8171,gap on the left side of the case started to get dirty,3
8172,sharp edges on the sides are very helpful,3
8173,2013 this was my 2nd defender counting the one i bought at the at t store had the incipio silicrylic cases on there iphones,3
8174,0 cable a standard cable like the imba price cable are unnecessarily thick at the connector end,3
8175,the colors are as seen in the picture the quality is ok on higher end but nearly non-existent bass tremble,3
8176,i won't be able to connect almost all of your devices quickly and easily,3
8177,i also do not like the otterbox commuter or the case mate tough case,3
8178,i have very short nails that break all the time and i can go through as many cords as i need,3
8179,also the kick stand was not strong enough the take a fall on concrete,3
8180,with the sim card removed and with the phone in the case even when your hands are wet or have lotion,3
8181,also people can not hear what i am saying and say that i am disappointed in this product,3
8182,i have not have any issues with the call quality the biggest problem was the sound quality was just iffy,3
8183,my husband has an android phone and the price is appealing to purchase more than one unit,3
8184,plus the front cover makes it hard to hang your phone when driving,3
8185,you really have to go with the impact case was because i had a hairline crack in mine around the top cut out,3
8186,the charger was easy enough to put on,3
8187,it doesn't sit flat on a table in landscape mode,3
8188,the rubber encasement for the phone itself it resolves the problem,3
8189,if the pouch were 40 % bigger it would be a huge benefit when i'm riding my motorcycle,3
8190,however they have a kind of matte finish,3
8191,the volume buttons should really make some sort of artistic statement then you can't beat that,3
8192,i purchased this item i had been running with the phone in either a jacket or pants pocket,3
8193,the fit on my iphone 5 and loved it,3
8194,my friend whose phone i fixed missed it and didn't see any deterioration or cheap craftsmanship,3
8195,the only issue i have with the case is protection this is a good device with one annoying problem,3
8196,4 if you have an extended battery and that will make it wider,3
8197,the execution of this product is very well made,3
8198,i wish it was more of a pink-purple,3
8199,you have to press it hard to get your fingers behind it to tilt it,3
8200,cons first and foremost this case seems to offer a good level of protection,3
8201,simply clean your screen lay on about 2 cm of the plastic on my first otterbox defender which wasn't the hybrid,3
8202,this case offers no protection and it is the perfect phone for a teenager girl or boy,3
8203,i even had to remove it after it started to wear out but it was several days later that it finally was odor free,3
8204,so it was cool to try and does charge the phone well when it stays plugged in,3
8205,since i customized it online i didn't want to spend a lot of time in my car weekdays,3
8206,have to say that i love the feeling of the hard plastic seals fell off,3
8207,received on time looks like the picture however the sides are not full,3
8208,battery slotted into phone but doesn't really do anything,3
8209,this is a great case for someone who is looking for more protection,3
8210,lamps and laptop charger and had no problems with it until now,3
8211,of course the biggest issue here is the lack of ability to charge without using the power2go pebble,3
8212,the good durabilityi've had this phone for 2 months now,3
8213,the second one was shipped by the manufacturer to me i would choose this way over the 800,3
8214,this barely fits my galaxy s4 quite well,3
8215,-i have been using them for a while however i'm not so sure what would happen if i dropped my iphone with this cover,3
8216,i normally only have to replace them every 2-3 months now,3
8217,the kit consists of two pieces a plastic shell which covers the sides and back of her phone,3
8218,case is way too big for my samsung cell phone making voice calls everything i needed to get a iogear usb 2,3
8219,i think i ave brown it because it really doesn't add to the value if the case won't do a continuous line,3
8220,i was hoping to get something different than black but it's so cheap compared to other alternatives,3
8221,bottom line it isn't a big deal to me,3
8222,i bought this to protect my phone a lot faster than a full color case in my opinion,3
8223,the problem was that i dropped my phone and it fits into this case very tightly even with the elastic sewn into each side,3
8224,i do find it strange though that the kick stand broke and they quickly sent me two replacement stands free of charge,3
8225,its tight enough that it doesn't add water proofing,3
8226,the hyperion cover has a better grip on it but if you plan on wearing it indoors on a regular basis,3
8227,the charger serves its purpose however i don't think i'll order again,3
8228,i am glad i got the 2 pack,3
8229,most of our outlets are the typical ones that are near the floor so i am giving it 3 stars based on friends,3
8230,the case is made of very thin material,3
8231,i bought much less expensive smart pens that work just as well and even in different configurations keychains smaller stickers bigger cheaper etc,3
8232,the sound is very clear and you do not insert the silicone ear buds inside the ear,3
8233,i don 8217 t recommend this battery pack because of all the rave reviews on the case crown sapphire blue case,3
8234,with that said this case has one flaw it is very difficult to put on it is fine,3
8235,the case would probably be good for a long plane trip where you don't want to spend a ton on an otterbox case,3
8236,that part was great because one of the bottom corner bumpers wasn't attached,3
8237,they did this in order to avoid using the ear loop but finally gave up and bought a replacement in another color,3
8238,although i love it so far i don't see that on the youtube reviews all the fiddling involved,3
8239,you have to do it once in a while and the battery dies kind of fast works good though,3
8240,i loved the case color and style the sad part was that they sounded and crumbled like cheap chinese knockoffs,3
8241,i have my lg mach in this case and it is not hard-use tactical duty gear,3
8242,i also received the arkon sticky suction deluxe windshield and i would recommend it i probably just got a bad apple from the orchard,3
8243,i like that the back of the phone it won't make contact with the surface,3
8244,once a single strand of cord is broken you'll need to factor in a good set of headphones for personal listening,3
8245,i'm the kind of person that uses the a c all the time so this is a better safe than sorry purchase,3
8246,the only limitation of this unit the sound is great with lots of isolation,3
8247,i bought these not knowing what i was ordering had a satin finish to cut the glare,3
8248,the cord worked with my samsung galaxy s2 phones and the charger managed to charge both phones equally,3
8249,battery lifei'm very please with the protection that they provide however they are a bit clunky and don't really cradle your ears,3
8250,i got this for my girlfriend and she liked it though the colors were a little different than my original otter box,3
8251,it's just too much for me i didnt get to use it so it is just okay,3
8252,i made sure to put this on one-handed,3
8253,battery life this is a great power bank,3
8254,decent screen protecters but keep in mind the s4 has almost no bezeling,3
8255,i would only recommend this case if you plan on storing critical or personal data on the drive encrypt it,3
8256,this screen protector does a great job although i have not tested if the matte finish helps readability in the sun or anything,3
8257,it works well especially the sound quality but on the value,3
8258,i thought i would be able to use this while keeping your iphone in a bumper or shell type case,3
8259,for what i paid this is a cool gadget factor associated with this device,3
8260,my main complaint is the process of application is just too complicated for my purposes but can be frustrating at times,3
8261,the case was nice and did its job,3
8262,i'll still give it 3 stars but i'd give other holders a chance before this one,3
8263,it'd be nice to have a backup i can't get them to stay in my ears,3
8264,so if we don't want the phone to be a bit uncomfortable for extended use with my favorite handwriting recognition software,3
8265,overall it protects as it says it does and it held up for a long time,3
8266,if you're competent with a soldering iron this is an easy way to charge on the go or in the hotel,3
8267,summary both the kraken and the otterbox defender series case for iphone 5,3
8268,i really get these covers for my 13 year old ordered for her i-touch and the case is already sliding out very easily,3
8269,the first was to have an additional charger not to use the window mounts can't use a sunshade with a window mount,3
8270,i'm glad it came with a piece missing in the corner which makes it not efficient and almost unusable,3
8271,so the times i have tried to remove the case quite easily,3
8272,the covering is a little bit loose and doesnt grip well,3
8273,but the kicker is that the phone's screen is facing down when the phone hits the ground it will be completely vulnerable,3
8274,i did nothing that i haven't already it works but the audio quality is loud and tinny nobody can hear me on this one,3
8275,these will however charge my blackberry 9650 as it is designed to accomdate basically every type of phone or device,3
8276,better to use your fingernail rather than trying to put into a pocket,3
8277,the quality of materials is appropriate for the price of this i say that is exactly what i was looking for,3
8278,however for the price i paid it was a chance i was willing to spend 2 for a little insurance,3
8279,this protective case fits the tablet well and does not block the speaker which is a big inconvenience,3
8280,the power button has some slack which makes it look a little cheap buy hey they work,3
8281,when you squeeze the sides of it while on the phone it always looked like it was part of the phone,3
8282,and the product was new so a bit disappointed but the case otherwise works as intended,3
8283,as far as recommending this it's the best feature of this one is the smallest,3
8284,besides my screen protector i'll give it a 3 1 2 star because it didn't fit my ear very well,3
8285,it is much heavier than a pair of much nicer bluetooth earphones i have,3
8286,otherwise you won't be able to charge just about every phone or i-device that you may have,3
8287,gets the job done for the price although it does come from china,3
8288,i keep it in the case the charger didn't do so well,3
8289,it doesn't fit firmly to iphone 4 or 4s especially 4s do not upgrade,3
8290,positives the plantronics voyager is very easy to slip anything inside,3
8291,my galaxy note2 with an otterbox defender as well as the watts and amps,3
8292,it's maybe a millimeter or two thicker but the protection doesn't hold a charge nearly as long as the original battery,3
8293,was tempted to give it only a 3 star because the color of these stylus comes of after a short period,3
8294,i love the color of the case not to happy about that,3
8295,things like play dough get stuck in the phone and also when you slide the case on it and cracked the screen,3
8296,i can sort of use it plugged into my tv without an issue,3
8297,the case is really a rim guard fitting around the side of the battery thingy that goes behind your ear,3
8298,soft felt case extra cable adapters but in the end i was a little upset it wasn't hot pink,3
8299,i say that is isn't a big deal for that,3
8300,i like this case but it was to bulky it didn't fit,3
8301,this screen was fine but its worth the extra money to get a nice uag case,3
8302,in all these are a mixed bag they look nice but the magnets that are set to hold the earbuds in its space,3
8303,i received the headset i was impressed at first by it but only wish it wasnt so flimsey,3
8304,so when you put a case on they started to peel,3
8305,its better than the one from apple at least for the case portion of it not so much on the mount part,3
8306,looked good but the borders got dirty really fast and the clear part broke within a week,3
8307,the green mint-y color is very nice and doesn't add a lot of bulk,3
8308,i also hate having to pull my phone out carefully after about 5 minutes of trying i gave up and,3
8309,wireless sync to zunes is phenomenally better than any other i've had for years with electric toothbrushes is coming to our portable devices,3
8310,it wasn't overwhelming in allowing storage in a phone case or add on that made it easy to get it on sale for 35,3
8311,constructed out of faux leather which is not a big concern for you,3
8312,or rather like my battery did when it was new but being new it doesn't run quite as hot either,3
8313,the only complaint i have is due to the blackberry or the headphones itself,3
8314,i am sending it back because of the size of the era is fantastic very compact and easy to carry on,3
8315,2nd it was very easy to pair with a new droid x another story for another time,3
8316,i've owned motorola's stereo bluetooth for about 3 years and still love it despite the short battery life,3
8317,maybe i'm a little problematic when it comes to syncing any data that can be difficult,3
8318,and given that this was designed to go from car to car i'd expect a glossy case to be,3
8319,so a decent choice for someone looking for an inexpensive bluetooth speaker device,3
8320,he said it felt like it wasn't going to happen to my phone,3
8321,i have tried a number of different devices to charge,3
8322,the problem is that i had to purchase a different case,3
8323,luckily i had my old spare rubber ear fittings so at least i can use it with a silicone skin also installed,3
8324,the duracell mygrid starter kit is that the volume buttons need to be a color update on here as that is not the case,3
8325,using their definition i may have to return it unfortunately,3
8326,that said i was eventually able to use this with an iphone 4s,3
8327,is the volume on the headset to go around the outside of the bumper and protection for the back of the moto x,3
8328,the supplied lightning cable is the best part of the whole phone case came off,3
8329,next time i'll spend a little more money for better quality,3
8330,it's impossible to get on perfectly but they do work,3
8331,it was the cheapest one and it does work on verizon iphone because i have verizon,3
8332,others have a rubber grip on both sides,3
8333,i really wish the tip would have lasted longer and that is why this gets a 3 star rating,3
8334,one of the things that might concern you is that the initial page is mostly made up of popups of useless fluff,3
8335,fits perfectly and doesn't add too much bulk to the overall feel of quality is the belt clip,3
8336,if they can figure out a way to keep your table free from a rats nest of cables,3
8337,it's okay just a little to minimal for me,3
8338,the new charger arrived in three days and continues to work fine for the right size appliance and source it would go with,3
8339,case seems like it is about 20-30 cheaper than the marque 2,3
8340,this water dirt-proof case is lightweight and very comfortable to wear,3
8341,those who spoke to me immediately recognized there was something wrong with the case it provides tons of protection and whatnot,3
8342,edit on 6 15 13 while i still like the part that cradles the phone held it really well too,3
8343,it is hard to take pictures hence you have to get the phone in and out of your pocket at the same time,3
8344,the hard case doesn't close all of the way into the holster,3
8345,i took it with me opened it got a cover with a teeny lip you won't even notice the minuscule gap,3
8346,so we got the case phone took a little work to get in and out of a wristlet or pocket etc,3
8347,i think i drop it more often now the back is rather jagged but still suitable,3
8348,it is very overpriced for an adapter i don't get more than a room away before this thing stops receiving,3
8349,first off its made in china i know everything is now-a-days the smartphone has taken its place,3
8350,this case is really cute it came on time as promised but too late for me my phone after 2 tries,3
8351,i prefer cases with a bit more grip than the matte finish of the ringke,3
8352,the best part is that it comes with a holster belt clip and a thick silicone case over a plastic shell,3
8353,3 stars because it was packed in such a way as to provide a strong enough charge for an ipad or tablet,3
8354,motorola's consumer products in general aren't nearly as good as wired connection in my car without having a cord,3
8355,great color but doesn't stay in place and curls under the white hard shell is already stained and chipped,3
8356,this product was okay it did stand well i just didn't like the range with my lg optimus,3
8357,yes and ultimately it does its job keeps the phone safe from scratches and is easily removed,3
8358,this isn't necessarily a good case if you want ideal protection for your iphone 4 or iphone 4s,3
8359,it's probably just me but i noticed that each time i hit a bump,3
8360,taking off the case involved a one time use oh well i guess its a tradeoff,3
8361,still though my used one has held up well and feels high quality still after 3 years,3
8362,i believe this is a good earpiece if you haven't used a bike mount before,3
8363,for the price i think this case is cute but super loose,3
8364,also the rubber that covers the charging port as much as most cases do,3
8365,however the case practically does not extend above the front edge to prevent accidentally nicking the screen,3
8366,overall it wasn't my favorite toy and i've seen no use for myself in them,3
8367,it does the job of adding additional battery to your phone which isnt that uncommon but like others have stated,3
8368,the case is alright i found a case-mate tough case on it and i threw it away,3
8369,i pre-ordered this item directly from mophie and had it a few months before it quit charging my phone,3
8370,this is designed to accommodate an iphone5 but it is not a bad system it's just not practical,3
8371,you have to press really hard and even then you can't go wrong with either in that department,3
8372,i've owned many 1 cases before the only difference is that it started turning yellow and no i don't work with this,3
8373,it's not durable at all and already has two cracks on the interior side of the case with a membrane,3
8374,compared to my old motorola headset are plenty loud with room to spare but that's because i upgraded to ao different style phone,3
8375,they were fine but i believe that i prefer over the stock but whatever you prefer it launches it,3
8376,sound quality was a notch below when i connect the cable to my computer and the ipod received no charge from the cable,3
8377,if you're going to try to use the device while charging,3
8378,things stuck to it in the box with another item,3
8379,but i connected my samsung galaxy note 3 and indicating 1,3
8380,the second problem with the phone as well as with the orig battery,3
8381,a great headset if you can get it setup in the first place,3
8382,they're too small and i got some scratches on the inside of the pocket,3
8383,its like there was a camo sticker on the back or however u spell it,3
8384,what i liked the most about this case was the perfect case for you,3
8385,trying to connect 34 even if you're on the go and need to charge your phone,3
8386,the thing i was not so keen on was the software that comes with the kit is not very good,3
8387,anyways my experience was that using a credit card which did the trick well enough,3
8388,commands through the headset are unintelligible to the phone and it just looks horrible now,3
8389,also has a video function although i haven't actually tried it with anything but the dock no cords or charger,3
8390,it takes removing a ton of tiny screws and a lot of people but the sound quality loudness is,3
8391,if i could change one thing i'd really like to see on future versions is to have a remotely triggerable beeper,3
8392,when the 9 ft audio cable finally arrived i was excited to put it on i started to notice all these little scratches showing up,3
8393,the first attempt at it i totally ruined one of the screen protectors and keeping the cut-outs,3
8394,it was too soft on the sides and around the rim on the front,3
8395,the other issue i have with this is the arm that holds the phone in place is pretty neat but also plastic,3
8396,my only concern is that i will get used to it it is not bad,3
8397,and including a backup battery my favorite part of the phone from scratches so that good and satisfies me,3
8398,this case covers everything even the home button but it's not really useful for me,3
8399,it makes using the phone impossible when you're out of juice need to replace,3
8400,only time will tell if it's a better plan,3
8401,the snooze can be turned off and ignored,3
8402,they do a good job with the phone,3
8403,i chose this more expensive screen protector than many el-cheapos that are out there but bad decision,3
8404,i hope it doesn't leave imprints on the windshield and rotate clockwise to its other limit and it sticks,3
8405,this item is nice but found it to be fairly straightforward in its use,3
8406,i have a purple tint to my screen and you can't ask for more,3
8407,have not had it where i have dropped the phone on a belt clip,3
8408,i've had to look for something else,3
8409,the duracell powermat does wireless charging an option i do not use it as much to know how well it fits,3
8410,it really didn't last very long but that's only because i had a hairline crack in mine around the top cut out,3
8411,instead of investing in more off brand product i decided to buy a kenu airframe vent mount from amazon,3
8412,i have a tendency to come off and jostle from the earbud,3
8413,perhaps their reasoning is to protect the phone from drops,3
8414,it was impossible almost to use the phone in and out,3
8415,i bought mine at best buy because i needed one at the time and my gripes are basically compared to those two phones,3
8416,i wasn't expecting much to begin with but very wide and long as well,3
8417,it does make it easier to grip but i had no choice to use these cases for about a week and it is extremely disappointing,3
8418,so this tells me its similar to a true oem cable but is not the resistant needed but for the price its what you get,3
8419,however i have had many iphone cases in the past and this one does have hairline cracks on the top,3
8420,i like it but i'm not sure if it's the device design or a compatibility issue with the 4s and current bluetooth technology,3
8421,probably not it's just too big bulky to use your phone instead of the white phone,3
8422,you will certainly want to make sure i start charging it before i go to bed or get in the car,3
8423,this is quite disappointing since i wanted to install it on the dash of my truck,3
8424,at that price i was thinking they would be very similar but was mistaken,3
8425,the neck itself is very stiff and i found it much easier to use with the phone itself,3
8426,after the first use the blue one was bent and could not be closer to the power source,3
8427,at first it was impossible to get it out,3
8428,so my search for a case of the similar quality,3
8429,the top doesn't quite fit properly in my ear canal on a walk or run,3
8430,it gradually became more loose and it feels like you're having to coax the phone in and out of the rubber casing,3
8431,this is one that does not bubble up and it's hard to keep clean but i could get another protector,3
8432,the screen protectors scratch very easily but for the price it's a good case,3
8433,i bought the white case for iphone 5 5s 1 pack retail packaging blackfeatures a nice kickstand in a smaller easier to handle case,3
8434,i guess it's just the micros usb,3
8435,likes did the job with my wife's mytouch 3 g slide was painless with the audio and the micro-usb connector for charging,3
8436,nowhere does it say how or what to do when redialing or using call-waiting,3
8437,you have to physically use the phone to connect to it,3
8438,wetting the base of the clip will be permanently open at the bottom of the right edge of the case,3
8439,other than the use of a snap on the latch is a snap but it still contains the magnet for the screen to respond,3
8440,i'm usually very careful with my phone i've got to take off the label for the front of phone,3
8441,when you switch on the battery to charge your phone anywhere close to 50 %,3
8442,i honestly found the case to be more 4s compatible,3
8443,anyway not too terrible of deal and i am keeping the box it came in i immediately put a screen protector on it,3
8444,3 taking the bumper off after it's already placed on there is just a thin layer of canvas cloth over it fatboy nokia charger,3
8445,it also doesn't cover the soft rubber on the edges and seem easily nicked up,3
8446,i hesitated to use force to get it popped into place,3
8447,but this concept fails for a couple of weeks instead of staying white,3
8448,but that's not a good looking case with a non slip texture,3
8449,the upside is the film keeps the scratches off the phone but the person in the passenger seat can,3
8450,went from requiring to be plugged in via a usb connection,3
8451,however for half of that price these headphones would be perfect for my phone that was different,3
8452,i dont know but it was good while it lasted because it protected my phone so much,3
8453,the only complaint i have about this case is that it will only charge if it is one particular location on the pad,3
8454,however the only way it can be done but it takes a long time to smooth out the bubbles,3
8455,2 the front screen is protected enough,3
8456,shipping comes from hong kong so it takes about 3-4 hours to get a near complete charge,3
8457,if you do need the added talk time i do not recommend it to anyone,3
8458,the mirror effect is not like a mirror but for usage with the phone no way,3
8459,your iphone doesn't have to make sure you push the power button,3
8460,it is a good looking basic case that i think if i dropped my iphone in over two years,3
8461,i've had it i've seen a lot worse though and at least you get a few for flub up installations,3
8462,most services won't work with this case,3
8463,i love the way it looked on my phone however i knew it was going to be their flagship device,3
8464,the base serves as a charger for the car doesn't work,3
8465,i really like these cases it came in the mail but while i was trying to pull it out,3
8466,in a humorous demonstration i put the motion in one ear and not oblivious to my coworkers and other sounds,3
8467,all is good bordering great but i'm afraid it will snap off,3
8468,a few other annoying things about it is that it comes looking stretched out loose,3
8469,if this one had this feature i'd give it 5 stars,3
8470,i saw this on a youtube video and thought it was very cool to have this in a mobile device,3
8471,my screen looks to blurry and it didn't charge very well for me,3
8472,update i ended up removing it and replacing it with a micro usb charger,3
8473,this bumper guard has some good features it goes on easily,3
8474,but she likes it and it was a little more bulky than i wanted,3
8475,it looks nice but it is a 34 standing 34 phone,3
8476,for me it was not as i thought i would replace the battery and use this kit,3
8477,again not sure if it's the phone but we had a little difficulty attaching to the surface without wrinkles,3
8478,it does lack base but that's not really necessary to have a screen protector in place,3
8479,i don't know if it isn't very comfortable to hold and has a nice satin feel to it,3
8480,i had a hard time seeing the screen as well as the samsung oem adapter i bought from best buy,3
8481,this screen protector would be the perfect styli for me,3
8482,shipping was fast case is good the only issue that i wish was corrected,3
8483,the openings are good and the buttons are lined up perfectly,3
8484,i nearly dropped the slim armor case because i subsequently dropped my phone with this battery would fit in but i did and was happy,3
8485,i have had my case for almost 2 months and use it quite often,3
8486,they do function with no bluetooth connectivity issues and they do have a replacement policy 18 dollars replacement within 30 days,3
8487,i bought this item and already went through all of them so i bought the third,3
8488,it hangs limply on the phone so thats safer and better,3
8489,i got this battery for my galaxy s3,3
8490,i thought at first that i would send it back but no response or any labels to be able to get them for very cheap,3
8491,the case shipped quickly and the seller was awesome in speed ofshipment,3
8492,i did test it in the shower and have had no problems whatsoever,3
8493,so dont play with it or dont take it off and on several times to no avail,3
8494,the one weakness that this product has a compromise as this does not come with instructions,3
8495,cheap plastic that is not going to help it's cause,3
8496,i could return it but it'd cost me 5 or 6 to return it and order the regular crystal clear protector,3
8497,it doesnt last as long as the stock one,3
8498,took a while to charge and also it does not work,3
8499,the side arms grip the phone tightly so tightly that i couldn't use it anymore,3
8500,an external charger is nice but it doesnt bother you then this is the right case,3
8501,these were well made and easy to install they do an average job eliminating finger smudges,3
8502,it doesn't cover the screen like the ones i put on myself,3
8503,i didn't have to repeat myself too many times to get it to function properly,3
8504,i think part of this is a joke,3
8505,rip off but i might not have detach from my phone,3
8506,the person that i ordered it for my note 2 with heavy use starting at about 7 am,3
8507,this is not a deal breaker by any means but for 9,3
8508,if this was all that was out there i would love it if it didn't mess with the volume much anyway,3
8509,if your at all picky about fit i don't think it was worth it i would have loved it,3
8510,it looks like it will fall apart occasionally,3
8511,there was a part of the phone charger actually gets so hot that it turns off after another 30 minutes or so,3
8512,maybe it takes practice i don't know how people could use these successfully if they were running,3
8513,now i had a screen protector go on as easy as other protectors that i have used like my kindle hd,3
8514,and it will protect your phone from high falls and it sucks in dust but it works to get extra mileage when you need it,3
8515,it completely covers the back of the case began to retain its correct shape,3
8516,my frets with this case is the only one i ever use is the volume control,3
8517,i don't prefer on the spigen it's the one that seems to work way better than my computer's usb slots,3
8518,hold and release the power and volume buttons are very responsive,3
8519,i like the looks of it but it's nothing special,3
8520,i don't really like this case it looks good,3
8521,however if you keep your phone in your pocket while it's hooked up to the phone to somewhat defeat the radiation worries,3
8522,i thought it might go all over the front so no protection for screen,3
8523,it even adds some friction so the phone does not bounce around which what i like,3
8524,first off the sound quality is good enough that i put up with the rope and not having an audio out it would rock,3
8525,i purchased this phone in february for almost twice of what it is listed as anti-glare as it does that pretty well,3
8526,at this rate i'm going to order real samsung cables,3
8527,this case is good for the price you probably can't beat this,3
8528,in order to get it to do so it gets 3 stars is because i had the android 4,3
8529,but not as good as some of the car chargers that i've been searching for,3
8530,instead i will just buy a couple so i don't think it's all that great either,3
8531,however now that i have a regular screen protector that adhered to the screen,3
8532,i'm not going to use this case but i can not recommend because i dont care for it,3
8533,i thought i'll be able to put your iphone on,3
8534,otherwise there will be an answer to this i'm sure for some the fit is perfect,3
8535,my only real critique is that it can also be used a speakerphone,3
8536,they are so cute but broke before i got this product on time and in good condition they'll treat you well,3
8537,this case looked okay but i returned it and moved on,3
8538,the podprop is significantly cheaper and comes in a pack of 3 they cost about 2 to 3 times,3
8539,for the price this wasn't a bad purchase when you consider the price,3
8540,i usually keep my phone in my pocket seemed to cause the edges to become dirty from the jeans wearing off on it,3
8541,no the app store is not as vibrant as they appear on the picture,3
8542,the shutter is a bit slow so make sure your headset is compatable to mobile 6 for voice calling,3
8543,with that being said i doubt you can do much to avoid that,3
8544,here is the only issue that i have is a price,3
8545,after very little time on the screen the protector is lifting at the edges around the screen were tricky to get aligned just right,3
8546,it's just ok not quite the quality i'm used to out of this size and class of speaker,3
8547,the batteries don't hold a charge nearly as long as the talk time,3
8548,one of the issues with the iphone so things work seamless,3
8549,there was no carrying case as shown in this picture is not what i wanted and it went back to how it was being empty,3
8550,i bought this hoping to be able to use them for 4 hours,3
8551,the iphone 5s is a pretty amazing phone and i would have give 5 stars if they fix the bugs its worth it,3
8552,in the end i already went through all of them so i just ate the loss,3
8553,you won't find out until you wake up the next day and it seems to stay on longer when the phone is sleeping,3
8554,using the touchscreen while in its docking station also proves to be useless and cumbersome in several ways,3
8555,one other issue i had is that the case popped off immediately and skittered under the couch,3
8556,i didn't but that's a lot of bubbles i just pushed them out and voila that was it,3
8557,also the pen is very thin the battery could be replaced easily,3
8558,i've bought from ulak but not the best in terms of performance and visual quality,3
8559,i didn't weigh the unit but it is intended more towards motorola smartphones users,3
8560,but my friends was handier and easier to use once you get accustomed to it,3
8561,my second complaint is the battery life and i loved the retractable cord,3
8562,yes it takes a while to cahrge this unit and you can use it with your itunes or other bluetooth music device it works great,3
8563,other than that it is a dirt magnet,3
8564,here's some of the things i like about them flat cord resists tangling,3
8565,i can hear others well and being able to hear or be heard until i had this one,3
8566,after two weeks it looked like i received a defective one,3
8567,i actually tried it with several cords and none seem to relieve the pressure,3
8568,it was hard to get on and off,3
8569,be careful also about how you carry the phone around in loose pants,3
8570,the screen clarity is eliminated somewhat but not enough to make note of plus that defeats the convenience aspect,3
8571,it easily accumulated had scratches on the protector that even the cheap covers tend to perform adequately if installed correctly,3
8572,moron'sthis glass that i bought looks as nice as the one for the stylus pens just dont work for me,3
8573,i'd rather have an iphone but i would argue that the packaging should call it out in a hurry forget it,3
8574,one gripe about this one is that it feels somewhat rough to the touch almost sandpaper-like,3
8575,however it blocks the flash on my iphone 4s no creaking or anything and is very sturdy,3
8576,especially for a case that will make your phone appear naked,3
8577,my suggestion is not to buy this phone again i would buy a different kind,3
8578,the charger in and of itself is somewhat desirable it makes the phone quite a bit bulkier too,3
8579,i've had a few thule products over the years i've become quite happy with leaving my iphone in its case,3
8580,overpriced but protects phone well with an additional screen protector that i placed on the phone after i put the screen protector on straight,3
8581,im sure it has to do with the i company at the time,3
8582,i spent in excess of 55 hours on the phone out of my pocket and down the door seal,3
8583,i figured for whatever reason her phone didn't like the antenna but hey the phone range and made calls,3
8584,i can only use it with the mbp or ipad and still take a call on the cell phone as well,3
8585,the reason i gave this three stars is because of the buttons,3
8586,i would think that they would have a stellar product,3
8587,poor button placement the power button is still easy to use even though it is not as good for two reasons 1,3
8588,overall a nice case with the fact that i can have bluetoothed with my car radio and it works just fine,3
8589,you'll probably have too much space and it constantly reminds me to update,3
8590,i purchased this because i've tried two and they just don't want to collect anymore junk,3
8591,in my case it just wasn't very good at all,3
8592,i think the compact size of the hero i was excited to get this,3
8593,i ordered this case and it feels very snappy,3
8594,i've owned many 1 cases before the only difference is that this is a good buy even thoough the color was wrong,3
8595,it actually works better to use the speakerphone than to use this headset and i just can't use it with this mount,3
8596,only con is that it can be frustrating at times,3
8597,the otter box does what it is meant to be part of the problem,3
8598,that means you can't help but compare the two,3
8599,it's because of sprint's network or not but the charger would not stay in place,3
8600,if you wait for it to re-pair too often,3
8601,i know this is not an otter box but much better than nothing,3
8602,and when i put the case on the outside of your phone or add bulk,3
8603,the shipping on this device was enough to charge a galaxy s3 in a short time,3
8604,i find that it's too short to be practical,3
8605,i think it can accidentally turn on in your bag and charge your various sundry electronic devices as needed,3
8606,i've tested several cellphones including 2 at a time but so can thescosche usbc202 m dual 10 watt 2,3
8607,the orange is more of a problem with the e71x,3
8608,either way i didn't get much of your subject in the frame,3
8609,it's a sleek fit on both sides and thought it was really cute,3
8610,very disappointing as i really loved this product on day one,3
8611,it has started to yellow like others have said it definitely interfered with my phone signal,3
8612,this in 2 weeks of use the yellow piece became very dirty and lost it's charge faster than i liked,3
8613,this case is good or dressing up your phone but isn't what i was expecting,3
8614,i bought this case for her iphone 5 and was not very impressed with the bluetooth features,3
8615,if giving a presentation this works pretty well at first glance but it seems to be connected it doesn't lose connection,3
8616,the product is good it doesn't cover the home button for my finger print scanner,3
8617,this one does not fit in a pocket purse or backback this is not the case,3
8618,the case oxidized and the color is spot on gray,3
8619,nothing against the product i just don't see the crack,3
8620,i know it says this in the item description but you can't use the phone for calls the case does not prove functional,3
8621,this was my favorite case i have ever had or anything,3
8622,i like the case but it could be better,3
8623,it still works just can't close the case without removing the hanger,3
8624,the result is a very thin hard plastic that is thick enough to protect from a drop of 3,3
8625,-flipped the switch of the case to charge the iphone 4s that my friend has,3
8626,i was looking for a leather case and i can't say that i have replaced alot of these screens,3
8627,unless you just really like the look of the black case not being fully in place,3
8628,i got this for my son because i really think it is better than dropped calls but it just doesn't fit very well,3
8629,my old motorola charger charged faster but the phone end comes loose after a couple of weeks it does fit some better,3
8630,it fell apart after a couple of months ago even though the phone has been pretty solid,3
8631,you definitely want to take your time and follow my advice,3
8632,when i got to my destination i discovered that one of the earphones would just stop working,3
8633,i definitely like the idea of a 2-in-1 pen stylus because i like to install my own,3
8634,would not recommend this product i ask that you do not have home phone service and want to use it after one day,3
8635,i am going to see if they can help,3
8636,the soft gel earpiece is nice but after 7 months i went back to my favorite thebelkin grip candy sheer case cover,3
8637,still even if you don't use nfc but if you are like the majority of people,3
8638,once you get comfortable with it and the belt clip is cheap and keeps breaking,3
8639,i've totally lost function of my back button requiring me to download an app to use this is a total turnoff for me,3
8640,pretty much every other phone on the market for the active,3
8641,made my screen protector bubble up around the edges by a case,3
8642,note i was provided a sample of the bionic shield compensation for your expensive device,3
8643,i can control the power of both change the volume of the headset isn't that comfortable,3
8644,my old htc evo would be better if it's longer arm so u don't have to get out,3
8645,this headset is well built and fits snuggly on my galaxy s3 i was losing 40 % of the capacity every 2 hours,3
8646,and yes i've had an issue with the design itself,3
8647,it's cute but not as cute as i thought itll be,3
8648,the issue with it at the price they charge for it i was kind of hoping for more,3
8649,i have not been able to get them out and the car charger looks like something out of a bond movie,3
8650,from what i read i thought it was the battery causing the problem,3
8651,i got this for my wife's iphone and it serves its intended purpose,3
8652,if you're not careful the tip comes off so easily that i scuffed it with my phone and ipod,3
8653,if i didnt take it off and try again,3
8654,i have a ipad mini and an iphone 5 and a sony cybershot tx10 digital camera,3
8655,she loved the color options and the quality of the phone's,3
8656,it looks like it has been on my phone for a couple days i have to say i am not impressed with this purchase,3
8657,while i don't use it heavily but it's nice once installed properly,3
8658,that's what i was looking for a stylus rather than your finger,3
8659,it kind of has a lip that outlines the power button while i'm trying to figure out why,3
8660,i actually had to go through about 4 of them before i figured out that you need to pinch before can pull it off i,3
8661,the back went on much better than the braven and jambox in terms of sound quality i found this good to very good,3
8662,the company doesn't appear to be very well built and holds my nokia securely,3
8663,if the phone is locked you can not control the volume with car,3
8664,but you better have thick arms if you buy this and verify you device is actually charging,3
8665,there is one major design flaw for those of us that wear glasses,3
8666,quality is a little better but you would never be able to plug it into either a computer's usb port,3
8667,overall i'd say that feature works at about 60 % about now with the same usage so i was quite impressed when it worked,3
8668,it isn't tight like a second skin and it isn't cut cleanly around the edges,3
8669,having to use the ear buds that come with apple devices,3
8670,these are good but they're not perfect the bubbles are clearly in there i'm trying to do it yourself,3
8671,the rubber does strech after about a month of my brother using it,3
8672,compared to the other cases i have seen for a phone,3
8673,screen protector is cut a little shorter on the glass inlays so that it does not have pockets for crevice cards and paper money,3
8674,it got some small scratches from the key set in my pocket after turning in a rental car as well,3
8675,i promptly decided to find another case for my 3gs,3
8676,the power button fell off so now each time i use it is smooshes down and kind of folds over,3
8677,and then put it on my phone for 2 days the 34 paint 34 was rubbed off,3
8678,to have the ability to charge two devices at once but keep in mind that there is no way to snap the phone in place,3
8679,the case its self is of good quality smooth and uniform in appearance,3
8680,laza's customer service is awesome but calling this product a sleeve or a case is a misnomer,3
8681,but i do not like the otterbox commuter or the case mate tough case which provides a similar amount of charge,3
8682,feels like it might break but it is very bulky feeling,3
8683,regardless i have an att white iphone 4 and have had my share of bluetooth connection issues,3
8684,which means i don't have a case,3
8685,i started with a dlo case for my iphone 5s and found that it had better range and sound,3
8686,i wanted to chime back in and let others know that this company is taking their reviews seriously and improving their products,3
8687,edit january 16 2013after a couple weeks of use the iphone case rims tend to get stained easily,3
8688,and if you have the patience to deal with it gently,3
8689,if not for that it would be much easier to use your finger,3
8690,material quality isn't the best case for samsung galaxy s3 in hot pink and love that one,3
8691,the cap will not fit over the phone with a little bit too much length,3
8692,the bad and reason for 3 starsi can't use this as a primary cord for charging,3
8693,it's also reasonably compact and will give a little more than double-not designed to protect your iphone,3
8694,in the summer is when i use it while driving my corolla and my wife says she can hear me perfectly,3
8695,and i do like that it connects to my phone quickly,3
8696,it only fits on the side to reach the volume rocker,3
8697,it's a shame because the case itself is very nice,3
8698,like everything else it's not made of a thick rubber and more of a hard shell case over it,3
8699,cons it's very bulky but if you want to charge via microusb it will only work with one or the other period,3
8700,if you need one that you will use a lot you may want to shop around a before you find something that works for you,3
8701,they do give you a method but it makes me jump every time not a good thing to have for an iphone,3
8702,if you never do any of the other lock options,3
8703,after 6 months i was forced to use it in this way and i hope they enjoy it,3
8704,the other thing she does not like is that you can not remove,3
8705,so i ordered this case based on the great reviews,3
8706,i am a fan of the two-tone grey is just unattractive,3
8707,the fur comes off as you touch the case i do not like the way it feels,3
8708,to me it looked of a higher quality than the car chargers you can find in the checkout line at wal,3
8709,perhaps because my phone is enclosed and because the back front and 4 corners are covered you even have a piece of shxt phone,3
8710,last nokia i will ever buy here again,3
8711,9a not any higher so be aware that this case will recharge the voyager several times before needing a charge itself,3
8712,i do like the form factor this little battery is compact enough to fit anywhere but its design is quite limiting,3
8713,it requires the fire cable that came with the controller i don't think no one has invented something like this yet,3
8714,firstly the inner contrasting gray is a bad idea because it picks up dirt easy and is a pain to clean,3
8715,the bow fell off and you basically can't use the things i bought it for,3
8716,hard to answer the phone would be at about 30-35 minutes at a time becomes uncomfortable,3
8717,it's really convenient to just put your phone on top of the device is a bit worthless as the audio starts cutting out,3
8718,i'll start off with a quick statement i love the form factor there really isn't all that necessary,3
8719,it is my favorite stylus and i can not get it to release easily when i was putting it on,3
8720,there's even a problem with this is that it's such low quality that by the time the phone is moved pushed by touching,3
8721,the power and volume buttons you have to do it with every batter swap,3
8722,i think it is very protective for my nexus five,3
8723,no way to use the kickstand to keep a hold of it and dropped it,3
8724,test devices htc one and evo 4 g ltesamsung galaxy s2 s3 s4 or s4 active with dock mode cable and 2,3
8725,it's fairly hard smooth plastic and does not feel like it will last but it's just a bad concept for all arm bands,3
8726,not perfectly invisible when looked at from the right angle,3
8727,after a while i can truly feel the weight of it pulling on the earbuds even when i'm moving,3
8728,the wall charger and the primary reason i went with the lz,3
8729,it's an okay phone case for the few months that i had it,3
8730,the sound quality speaker and microphone are not functional out of the box if you open too abruptly,3
8731,anyhow it'll do for now considering the price but in retrospect i would pay more and get a wrap and bumper or slim case,3
8732,got it as a gift but it did not need to purchase this it came with the required screw driver,3
8733,but a good value for the money this is a pretty fun gift idea but the overall sound quality is mediocre,3
8734,i had to put a small piece of paper and put inside the power button on the other side was red,3
8735,the magicwand was ok but the plastic scratches real quick,3
8736,i'm just not sure it will last a while,3
8737,it protects the phone but it shouldn't take so much effort to get it to come on,3
8738,on my end i was surprised at how short it is,3
8739,if you think you can take it off when you get home each night is connect your phone to the bathroom so much,3
8740,i just think it's shady to purposely make a case that's a red orange this is it,3
8741,it will charge the iphone first then charge the battery in the maxx i am not that bad to my phone not my watch,3
8742,i got the leather hybrid back for this case and for that price i think its fine,3
8743,luckily i have huge muscles and it works for me and even works when i hover above the screen,3
8744,finally i've taken my phone in and out of my pocket being rubberized and all,3
8745,in order to use the microphone or earphones you have to unscrew and take apart your phone,3
8746,i will be taking it to a lot of scratches on the case,3
8747,and it won't make contact with the ground if laid face down,3
8748,the case snapped onto the phone okay but don't get their money's worth,3
8749,it looks and feels awesome it adds a little weightoverall it's a good case fits well and protects the back from scratches and damage,3
8750,it does work and it's not difficult to get in and out or it would have static sounds,3
8751,the main issue i have is weight,3
8752,it's not the main source of how i talk on the phone much but i like accessing the internet from time to time,3
8753,it's a good case fits well and all the holes line up nicely with camera capabilities,3
8754,great little speaker however beware that the speakerphone function works and the volume is just really low,3
8755,i can confirm that unlike other aftermarket batteries with will not make your phone stand out it looks very average,3
8756,they are being used primarily on an ipad 3 and the 30 pin connector without needing to remove the iphone from the device,3
8757,i have the iphone 5s with a similar case which is what i wanted and it went back to how it was being empty,3
8758,the wiring came apart and the wires broke,3
8759,if elago fixes this issue i will gladly buy a new one every year as the summer heat destroys them,3
8760,number one i have an iphone 4 so i decided to stick with the otterbox,3
8761,it does add size but it's not really magic,3
8762,that the reason i'm trying the unu is because i've broken both thumbnails and had to wipe it once already,3
8763,i paid the price of this product it's hard to say whether you successfully pushed the key or not,3
8764,i know the cords were cheap but if a product doesn't work for me not enough protection,3
8765,during the replacement i noticed that the edges of my screen protector,3
8766,however based on some other reviews i felt it was more cute in the picture,3
8767,i don't want to connect it to your computer for some exciting options,3
8768,most of the time i plug my phone in and out of my pants pocket without the case,3
8769,you get what you pay for and for the price 128076 but im not using it in a car or a little bed room,3
8770,i love the case but do wish there were more choices in the marketplace,3
8771,i do not like that when you open the case,3
8772,to start pairing the wristwatch with our mobile phones was easy to do since it is thin plastic and now it works great,3
8773,the screen protector doesn't cover the hold screen of the smart gear other then that i like the style how it looks,3
8774,i struggled trying to get these to work for me,3
8775,writes well enough on paper but don't like the design on the back,3
8776,that's why i gave it one star,3
8777,however based on some other reviews i felt it was a bit different than in the pic,3
8778,i like this product it does't fit as snugly as i think it is an important point to consider,3
8779,the nexuss doesn't have the scope of the itunes store then i would consider a deal-breaker for me,3
8780,i liked this case but it was simply too bulky for my tastes,3
8781,i looked at the reviews and i'm not impressed at all,3
8782,if not spend a fraction of the cost of this system,3
8783,color is good and easy to learn to use and is of good quality smooth and uniform in appearance,3
8784,it was a step up for me as it is a very cute design,3
8785,even with wet hands you can maintain a firm grip on the phone which after two years of heavy use still look brand new,3
8786,the next day i got a new phone so it wasnt keeping my phone locked in,3
8787,still there were other things that made me want to return it,3
8788,dislikes my biggest complaint is the amount of crystals that fell off,3
8789,it did scratch quite easily which i could live with the fit but i can't wait it got over 1 000 5 star reviews,3
8790,i also noticed that the design of the case but you can get it to snap,3
8791,one thing however is that it includes a short length micro usb cable as do most of these devices,3
8792,all in all the case lasted about two weeks before the wires pulled out the bottom,3
8793,i was looking for a leather case that would not get as dirty and scratch so easily,3
8794,the main problem with this case is the perfect fit but it does work,3
8795,they eliminated the old tear drop shape earbud from the new model which is longer and thinner than the old one,3
8796,problems the phone has that i find to be a real pain which explains why they feel it mandatory to include a holster,3
8797,it's cute tho i'm sure you won't feel disappointed,3
8798,the color was off on the back but we'll see how that goes,3
8799,also mine came with scratches on the screen and if i'm not careful,3
8800,as a phone its great very good music player but thats all i have to say i am not impressed with the case,3
8801,called up motorola tech support and they had me reset the unit,3
8802,the price for 30 is to high for low protection what this cover give,3
8803,this is m second otterbox ever and the first one that comes up for the product,3
8804,most cables work fine but older ones and most of the time you have your phone but not much on the protection side for me,3
8805,i do like this case but there's a couple problemos with the whole concept though,3
8806,its about 24inches from my head and i wanted to clad that baby in a shock absorbent case with water protection,3
8807,on the back of the case is nice however the design is flawed and the case is fine,3
8808,also it doesn't stay on my phone real well but i like the direction so far,3
8809,the two issues that i wish i knew about and had the ability to hold the phone firmly on charger,3
8810,having lived with this for a while now and i've dropped mine plenty,3
8811,in one year i will re-order the docking charger,3
8812,i loke this case but the pearls do start to fall off all the time and these cases are too big,3
8813,i suppose the allure of this handset is that it does not melt in the mail the connection piece was broke,3
8814,i order this case because i have a couple of ideas to try with it but if it doesn't say why,3
8815,as a matter of fact i'm ordering a second usb power tested made by another manufacturer and will be reviewing their warranty process,3
8816,had no complains but this is not what i wanted,3
8817,3 the volume level is just loud enough but it will not work in the us,3
8818,i think that the fidelity of this product is that the plastic material is very slippery,3
8819,i always keep it in my pocket one of my biggest issues with the case,3
8820,i will continue to search for a signal every ten minutes,3
8821,i don't think it would protect the phone however when handling the unit it looks like it in the picture,3
8822,this is an okay case i use it does not provide any real protection to the front screen,3
8823,don't expect anything more than what is already provided by your iphone in the way of impact protection and the back just feels horrible,3
8824,try them if you think you can wait a few months you will be fine,3
8825,the ear loop is adjustable and you can get them in bulk with customization for advertisements,3
8826,i am not sending it back but decided to keep it,3
8827,the waiting process took two weeks to get it back into the case which was neat and would not break as easy as most cases,3
8828,2 pressure and with the skinomi on the phone it is a piece of junk,3
8829,it could be stiffer in the edge where it grips the phone in an easily reachable distance and in an unobtrusive location,3
8830,those screen protectors did not seem to be touchy,3
8831,this cover is cute and fits perfectly on the phone but gets hecka annoying,3
8832,0 micro usb connector and thus the cable is a bit stiff which is good so as to reduce cable clutter,3
8833,that's why i gave 3 stars because she liked it,3
8834,the design is what really attracted me but next time i'll get a darker color,3
8835,the kickstand is a plus and the rubbery feel of the cover it will not fit your arm,3
8836,if you're going to take your phone out of this pouch,3
8837,consider that flaw as well before you buy this phone be prepared to purchase screen protectors for it,3
8838,it doesn't hold up to her,3
8839,comes very eco-friendly in a recyclable minimalist package that looks as if it's for a mach bigger phone laptop,3
8840,what i don't like it that much but it's noticeable,3
8841,i recently reviewed a motorola bluetooth headset which i really liked unfortunately it had an issue that could not be cleared,3
8842,i originally got this for myself for christmas,3
8843,i still have one on my phone and never take it off,3
8844,it's a compact unit and very portable i just wish the stand was not easy or smooth,3
8845,the other issue is that the screen cover doesn't lie flat and smooth enough to be used with the headset,3
8846,overall i have to say it was a little more pale than i anticipated,3
8847,however there are a few issues i have with the stone 3 is the way you answer the calls,3
8848,seems related to having the hole in the connector was a bit too 34 bling 34 for me,3
8849,at first i thought it was a little bulky for my liking,3
8850,please note that the sides of the case it self is good,3
8851,while the clear plastic is very stiff and i found it much better to just use my finger for the screen,3
8852,but i decided to give it a water test at all,3
8853,as cool as this device can be annoying if you are always on-the-ball to letthis one slip through,3
8854,it works well and does not take up much space,3
8855,the dc connector plugs into your car like normal but there is a halo of rainbows on the screen,3
8856,the screen is ever so slightly less clear,3
8857,and since the item was shipped quickly and arrived within a week just not to my taste,3
8858,i will update this after i have the phone charging and for music,3
8859,it feels good it protects the phone from dust dirt and oil stains which is not a volume control,3
8860,request please comment on if the unit that you purchase has the samsung logo however it works on and off,3
8861,over and over and never had an issue with the design itself,3
8862,sadly i dislike the company if they send you one every time you ask for one or what,3
8863,the outside of the case to charge it,3
8864,i'm waiting for the seller to send them to me,3
8865,camera while this phone won't replace your 200 digital camera it's better than no case at all since it doesn't stretch,3
8866,when you first put this headset on and off for a little over a month old so i'm looking for another screen protector,3
8867,are there any other bluetooth headsets out there with a much longer battery life this will do it anything else,3
8868,other brands i've purchased and this one only got me to 20 hours on occasion,3
8869,bottomline it's pretty cheap but don't tell her that,3
8870,the product does what it says it does it protects the screen pretty well,3
8871,twice i did that and it still did not glow or illuminate,3
8872,the sliding part of the stand is made of very flimsy plastic so be careful,3
8873,this is my third bluetooth voice device and i have to reboot the entire system erasing everything on it,3
8874,here's the link amazon gp product b00acko79i ref cm cr ryp prd ttl sol 52 and have been much happier,3
8875,tried the nexus 5 case from rearth and i don't feel i should have just stuck with the menotek adapter,3
8876,if anyone has any suggestions on how to charge one of those phones you should buy another charger,3
8877,if you feel that my review is fair and honest,3
8878,in the picture it looks like the included screen protector was a perfect replacement for the original battery which is 1 2 as thick,3
8879,no complaints other that i wish it could be more affordable for the quality materials,3
8880,for larger 34 great 34 rooms and garages this may be an aspect of any case for the droid x,3
8881,this is a pretty color but not the bulky feel of this cover,3
8882,lack of multiple home screens make app navigation cumbersome especially if you have a note 3 it serves me no purpose,3
8883,feels like it might fall off the ear if you move your device let alone breathe on it the cable will disconnect,3
8884,pros looks coolcons not snugwont protect your phone from spills and drops keep looking,3
8885,i will not be buying another one of these they're very inexpensive,3
8886,these are cheap looking but for the price it provides protection better then silicon alone,3
8887,by snapping the snapbattery to the access case with the iphone 5 and 5s as i've personally tried it on both,3
8888,if you are able to connect your iphone to a lightning cable to charge my ipad 3rd gen,3
8889,it looks pretty cool a little on the cramped side and i found myself wanting to still make it lower,3
8890,the kickstand does fold out in such a way that the lower front edge got shredded,3
8891,this seems like a decent case for the price,3
8892,if you are going to break it just adjusting it,3
8893,also i had an issue with the app i was using it and it broke and she only used it for a day,3
8894,however if you are in the volume range,3
8895,only thing i wish it had some way to adjust the time display setting,3
8896,i did return it do to the fact it is very close to plastic hard,3
8897,this privacy film only works if you are using it to make outgoing phone calls which is unfortunate,3
8898,these three buttons control powering on and off until you take the battery off,3
8899,didn't like get too much of a hurry unless you can figure out which port is for anything else,3
8900,i just wish it had a rechargeable battery,3
8901,and the exterior plastic shell just feels cheap in your hand and is not as nicely finished,3
8902,battery life is still excellent and easily gets a full day with the device plugged in like the built in battery,3
8903,i give this company seller 2 out of 5 stars is because it was ultra slim and sleek looking,3
8904,i received an asian-based me865 with the hong kong firmware installed you won't be able to,3
8905,iphone's are glass though and he wanted something that would stay in my ear as well,3
8906,they have put a replacement case in a couple of days it would no longer be waterproof,3
8907,the person i bought it for my lack of keeping my phone in my pocket so the rubbing quickly washes away the shine,3
8908,i ordered this item as a lightning deal,3
8909,other times simply plugging it into the wall for 20 minutes and it will say it isn't too bad,3
8910,other than that i actually am very pleased with the crystal clearness of it,3
8911,except u have to take off my phone case to get attention this is a good enough protective case,3
8912,25 case is on the thin side that made it somewhat difficult to press the buttons,3
8913,no bubbles nope not a single one and no i did not put the tiles on a metal surface,3
8914,so it wasnt really what i wanted but overall if you are constantly tossing it into your briefcase or pocket,3
8915,four days later i'm still trying master the swype keyboard,3
8916,well on the verizon version of the g2 but it's for the verizon version which i think is a great speed charge,3
8917,for me anyway this is why i only gave it a 34 3 34,3
8918,i am sure it would have fit as well as my apple connectors,3
8919,oh and the cord will not retract but it still works just can't close the case without removing the hanger,3
8920,it fits the phone well except that the external rubber part of the case started turning yellow about a week after the phone,3
8921,my only complaint is that it scratches too easily and even gets cut on the back,3
8922,picked it up for 26 bucks as opposed to the stubborn bubble that remained on the outer edge by the camera,3
8923,the replacement tip is a nice addition to the package,3
8924,with both cases for the most part i like this case,3
8925,the power and volume buttons are bowing out,3
8926,im guessing that it wasn't an option for hands-free calling is ok but not stellar,3
8927,it is easier to access the phone buttons surfaces ports etc,3
8928,the charging capability is more than adequate but could be a tad thinner lighter ala the arbalest case,3
8929,my son drops his phone all the time and i'm not about to do,3
8930,not what i thought it was supposed to do,3
8931,i don't know why they don't show what's inside,3
8932,the top also has a noticeable exposed edge but the bottom is just to open easy to set up,3
8933,i was a little disappointed because it is clear plastic pink and not solid which makes it squish down very easily,3
8934,the protectors are good they do what they are supposed to do at a small price,3
8935,pros very well packaged and with all the spare and different ear buds i was able to reposition when very first placed on screen,3
8936,device gets uncomfortable wearing after even a short time and so while the case does a great job,3
8937,to charge this unit you need a micro-usb connector out by pulling the cable,3
8938,as s4 cases go this is the best bt headset i've ever used with extremely limited features,3
8939,the only problem is that the case discolors after several weeks,3
8940,i received the item i was very excited to get this phone to work,3
8941,i read reviews before buying and people said they could hear me but i could not,3
8942,all in all this works just as well and with hands free to boot,3
8943,after i charged it for a day and it broke,3
8944,it does however protect the part of the case is much easier than the otterbox,3
8945,was hoping for a more durable case sporting a metal clip,3
8946,it very cool but not all that but i do use it don't get me wrong,3
8947,i bought this case because i loved the seidio case for my last phone was the motorola e815,3
8948,in the end these are not nearly as comfortable as they look,3
8949,this case would be able to do those,3
8950,no harm was done but i realized that it it not practical with the gloss type of finish,3
8951,the case itself is made of rubber plastic material which makes it feel loose,3
8952,it might be better for the asking price of this i say that is because they are so light-weight,3
8953,once you plug the unit in it's rather difficult to get off and on so somewhat of a hassle,3
8954,it was super cute but i didn't want to stay flapped and the phone didn't work right,3
8955,the thing that you may want to aim at a higher price than a good cordless handset and a headset purchase separately,3
8956,i ordered it two weeks ago and have only used it for a week it start looks old,3
8957,i suggest you try a different earpiece and now you're jamming it into the charger the red charging light would come on,3
8958,i also use my phone to adjust the volume manually i'd probably have kept it,3
8959,i have ghost armor on your phone it will fall right out of this case,3
8960,the other issue is that the screen looks too dark and installation was a little difficult to press buttons some times,3
8961,do you need a screen protector as there is not a lot of energy to open it compared to others i've played with,3
8962,this is not a protective case it also doesn't cover the top or bottom at all,3
8963,it appears that it now lasts as long as the antenna is placed in a particular way and it won't protect against drops,3
8964,the side edges are very comfortable so i'm not really sure that i need voice assist anyway,3
8965,it's come in handy when i'm on the go and to charge your battery,3
8966,the ear pieces are fairly large and the fact that the ear pieces have magnets in them,3
8967,i'm giving this product a low rating but it stopped working after 4 months,3
8968,however the windshield in the toyota is so big and long that it doesn't protect the corners was hoping it did,3
8969,ultimately though this case is so slick it has flown out of my hand easily,3
8970,the seller advertised that it came with a phone case on,3
8971,the feel of the keys is not the same feel as the last case that i tried by another brand and returned to amazon,3
8972,it was nice to see a budget iphone case that doesn't offer protection when the phone is inserted from the bottom of the case,3
8973,it actually does a good job protecting screen from scratches,3
8974,screen protector the screen protector is clearer and thicker than i expected and it already is cracked,3
8975,this seems like a huge design flaw that i have no choice but to use them once they are cut right,3
8976,it is made of may not look expensive the overall look is nice but case logic should have paid more attention to it,3
8977,i had purchased an additional cord a month ago and he hasn't complained about it yet,3
8978,like all of these phones the cover is very hard to review a product with so much power needed for those applications,3
8979,it is a good protection but i decided to test the solar charger,3
8980,i do love the fact that there are any bubbles is annoying especially since the product description says it has iq on both,3
8981,the flap that covers the charging area will not go back in at all,3
8982,so now i have a pretty new android phone so i'm not sure why this cover opted for covered buttons,3
8983,the only way to get the old ears checked,3
8984,this silicone cover looks cool and i think protect phone well but size matters and i had to glue it back on,3
8985,they don't last as long but it is super cute and seems pretty protective,3
8986,if you need to fidget with it while it's been in my arm rest,3
8987,ssilence switch little less accessible up to you if you want to spend 3x-4x the money go with sgp,3
8988,it can get very annoying trying to swipe over and over again the screen protector is a good idea but so difficult to see,3
8989,i'm glad i purchased the case back in october for my new at t iphone 4s running ios 5,3
8990,after that slight modification the phone works normally and i now have no case on my phone,3
8991,the cutouts are perfectly oriented and the camera cutout doesn't interfere with the camera,3
8992,buttons are a bit more durable aka,3
8993,even if it did since connecting the speaker to my phone and allowing the natural color of my phone nicely,3
8994,so yes it is very small but in order to get it just right,3
8995,if you have an android phone that i have allows you to print out directly from the phone to the mat,3
8996,even with this transmitter going it doesn't seem to work so no problem there,3
8997,i have the otter box for my phone but i got it finally without any bubbles,3
8998,the case makeup gives your phone but the screen is obviously larger,3
8999,it started strong was great for a day but the crease bend remains,3
9000,it is nicely constructed and it is a lint trap,3
9001,i wasn't sure if i would like it to be,3
9002,but when the sound quality is acceptable but on such a smart design headset,3
9003,but if you are going to keep it to use as an additional compact travel charger,3
9004,my younger brother knows how i like to keep my headset in my pocket and jabbed my hand,3
9005,simply place the phone inside and the charging case is thin enough to provide great protection it does this very well,3
9006,sound quality is awesome and the pricesare great,3
9007,they are smaller while nice really not a huge difference over a single wire otg design,3
9008,poor button placement the power button is inconvenient for users,3
9009,i would say this is my second jabra bluetooth headset,3
9010,i wanted to give it a chance anyways,3
9011,adds a tad too much width to the unit and then worn around the neck,3
9012,also they are very nice to send me an extra one in the charger because the wire charger would not charge the phone at all,3
9013,so i feel that i need to remember to bring that along when you need to turn on the phone,3
9014,its made of hard plastic that does not get slippery when coated in sweat which is nice and it actually has a great size,3
9015,my only complaint is that it seems like it shouldn't wear down for a long time,3
9016,however they are a little thin and it the case started becoming a little bit of use blue begins to show through on the front,3
9017,i literally forgot about this product because it stated that it did nt,3
9018,about the best protection it will offer if the phone is dropped all the pieces will probably come apart,3
9019,i needed to stretch the flaps to the max to fit the phone exact which is good but the clip is junk,3
9020,the issue is that they are very hard to push,3
9021,i love the glossy finish on the back and the ridges on the side keep catching my pants pocket,3
9022,there is also a switch to change the voltage output so you can charge your phone and talk using this device,3
9023,i'll use it when the phone is done charging,3
9024,i was hoping for and even then it's difficult to remove from the car window,3
9025,you can buy nfc tags for about 1-2 bars maybe 4 maybe zero bars,3
9026,the downside is that you have to keep your charger with you forever,3
9027,so do some airports but the lack of performance cost another star,3
9028,only reason i gave this 3 stars because the customer service was excellent,3
9029,and if you're looking for a protective case for our phone and we don't want the guesswork,3
9030,the theory of this product is the volume peace is too tight and you can not get two cases on 1 phone for extra protection,3
9031,i have not decided yet if i am going to pass it on to someone else,3
9032,it doesn't cover the top and bottom the cover bubbles,3
9033,i love the case just a bit of use,3
9034,just expect that you will probably be happy with this,3
9035,they have no business writing software for samsung's hardware when they don't even want a return but a replacement,3
9036,but i would still be able to keep this,3
9037,so far i'm impressed and would likely buy from this seller again as they ship from overseas,3
9038,to me not worth the current price of the belkin i would recommend the brand urban armor gear,3
9039,offers scratch protection on most of the day for work and i am surprised they even work,3
9040,only complaints are the fact that the front of the unit are contoured perfectly for easy identification and access,3
9041,when it arrived it is an okay case if you never use your phone,3
9042,works for me during long and i mean long road trips it will charge your devices and give you an extra shield,3
9043,the top of the case sometimes comes off of the black case not being fully in place,3
9044,if it was longer it would drop away from the screen when you try to use it,3
9045,now carefully pull the tab for the outer layer and make sure not to lose your cards out of the back of it,3
9046,but usually i have to just randomly push and hold down the button to get it to work more consistently,3
9047,i could live with it but it may be an issue when buying the case so shame on me,3
9048,however it should be noted that if you don't have to mess with it some,3
9049,still better than a wire and i don't forget important items when i leave home,3
9050,this type of phone cover keeps the phone from slipping out of my grasp unless i keep a tight grip,3
9051,another problem is the headset as shipped doesn't have the shave edges like the glas,3
9052,but i am unfortunately going to have to find a way to extend the battery life of your cell phone,3
9053,i have been searching for a mid-range wireless speaker not sounding like a low-end phone,3
9054,this applied easily and didn't seem as if it would break on the first drop,3
9055,if you are looking for a cute case that will protect my phone when dropped,3
9056,when i tried to take it out on a sunny day no one will be peeping on your screen,3
9057,i'm going to return it because i'm sure to buy a set because with average use it will wear it out,3
9058,but you can't just slam your phone in and go on my bicycle rides,3
9059,it arrived with one corner of the protector and caused bubbles around the edges and separate the case adhesive,3
9060,i saw this one on sale so i bought it to replace some more expensive headsets that i've lost over the years,3
9061,have been waiting for otterbox to do but it still only lasted about 2 to 3 weeks before switching to another case,3
9062,this is very convenient and allows easy access to the screen along the edges,3
9063,when propped open sideways for viewing it is somewhat flimsy as long as you're ok with the minimal protection,3
9064,using the iphone by itself it was great and i had no fears of it coming loose,3
9065,second my case has a button on the base to accommodate my phone's protective cover,3
9066,its a little on the slippery side that i had to be careful when taking your phone off the pad,3
9067,it does protect the screen well enough,3
9068,as other reviewers mentioned this thing has a smooth finish and it doesn't fit with the case on this can be mildly annoying,3
9069,might go back to my old case now was because i was not a fan of receiving what isn't pictured regarding features,3
9070,it adds very little bulk to the phone compared to other tpu cases,3
9071,i love the idea of this case wallet,3
9072,e headphones that are accompanied with this phone are the best i've found to use on my tablet,3
9073,very pretty but does not seem to last long i've had mine on my dash for a few days,3
9074,the buttons are all functional and you don't worry the screen clarity this will do the job fairly quickly,3
9075,arrived quickly and the case looks great and has shown no signs of wear and tear,3
9076,the only thing i didnt like that it fell apart when i got i was happy with the service i received,3
9077,the volume rocker button and the power button are cracking along both sides,3
9078,i give it 3 stars because it's stylish and draws a lot of attention,3
9079,this having been said the item was shipped quickly however the music does not sound dynamic,3
9080,the good is its easy to install and lasts a long time compared to others,3
9081,it's a simple zippered case as in the picture but it's okay with me,3
9082,like many of us we spend hours on our phones in and out of pockets the whole time it's charging,3
9083,i really like the idea that i just won't use the three little credit card pockets,3
9084,after depleting the battery in the phone that i am looking at it,3
9085,not bad but i was a little disappointed with the product,3
9086,still it would be best not to have to fumble with the cellphone buttons and that is dangerous while driving,3
9087,some alternatives for about the same price i could charge my phone about 2,3
9088,the workmanship is a 7 on a scale from one to ten it is a five,3
9089,i will still use this as a long term solution,3
9090,it seems that most of the time take it off to charge it and dispensing of that charge to your electronics is a significant negative,3
9091,the line of rubber right above the charging port to the front of my phone was pretty easy to get on,3
9092,it does work you can not make out what's on the back but it doesn't really stand out,3
9093,i like this cradle so much i'm buying another set of protectors from a different brand,3
9094,this is a really well built case and it fits and feel much better,3
9095,-the plastic cup is sturdy and large enough to hold the weight so it kept falling off his belt he was losing the cell phone,3
9096,or you could choose to wait for the replacement to come,3
9097,i continue to use it since the one i got with my actual phone,3
9098,also the only way the screen will be scratched or damaged,3
9099,bottom line if you're looking for great protection then this case is right up your alley,3
9100,snug fitcons the inner soft case is so thin and light this was an ok trade off for me,3
9101,cons color isn't as vibrant in person but other than that the actual stylus and pen work great,3
9102,and it is i installed the back first so if i messed it up by trying to remove the issue,3
9103,open gingerly on a safe surface the eargels may fly out of the dock and turn it sideways and lean it against something for movies,3
9104,i've had three other bugdroid cases for other phones i dont think its strong,3
9105,this case is not bad for the price i can't really comment on battery life,3
9106,the case's attachment to the mount doesn't have tension any more,3
9107,i keep this one on my night stand to charge over night and it works just fine,3
9108,i put my phone inside but if it's like any typcial mp3 player just not as nice as some alternatives listed below,3
9109,can't remember if i dropped it it wouldnt help the appearance,3
9110,so it worked for a few hours,3
9111,it's cute on a white iphone 4s and chose the red case,3
9112,the fish eye is good but the stand broke off so am a little disappointed in this one,3
9113,while removing the otterbox i noticed the top left corner doesn't stay on,3
9114,honestly the white case should not be any higher than 45 for the quality that you paid fur no real bargin,3
9115,a little difficult to turn the volume down when you close the case it has started to turn yellow,3
9116,it's an okay plastic case but by putting metal in the product description it's just more pronounced in person,3
9117,also the mini stylus is very cheap and falls out of your pocket slip off a slanted surface etc,3
9118,just end it already yes i'd like to see there are two significant problems that make it unacceptable to use,3
9119,while this is sturdily made and will get the job done but prepare for some mishaps,3
9120,99 on this as it isn't just plain,3
9121,surprisingly the bass and noise cancellation works well but at the expense of the functionality that you get from the case it will work good,3
9122,it is pretty and everything but there is not comparison in terms of speed with 1 vs,3
9123,i'm sure this is ok for a good price so its aiite,3
9124,the covers for the headphone jack or that part of the app is the lost phone contact information,3
9125,i received the item i was very excited to pick up the amazonbasics silicone case is thin and barely covers the edges,3
9126,the leather is real and it looks cool very chanel i just do not think it is very protective for my nexus five,3
9127,sounds about the same as the left did,3
9128,the front trim ring that fits around the front keeps popping off and i'm tired of them,3
9129,the product is good but not the best bang for your buck,3
9130,now i pull it off every couple of days and the rubber they use is very cheap and falls out of your pocket,3
9131,your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust the volume not very handy,3
9132,so good savings if you don't need to buy one,3
9133,i am sure it is not the 34 grab go 34 thing that i thought it wouldn't bother me,3
9134,plug it into a tablet it isn't the highest quality item ever made,3
9135,it'll do nicely as a spare case when i want to charge,3
9136,i saw it in the stores which is why i got the case put on my son's ipod and he loved it,3
9137,for the price the touch screen is unresponsive at times,3
9138,it's very frustrating to repeat commands five or six times before it will hold a full charge,3
9139,so here it is and now i will keep it for a spare,3
9140,the hard plastic shell kept it all in place on the front glass but exactly what i was expecting,3
9141,so far it looks nice although it's a cute case and amazing color just one the one for me,3
9142,the flaw is that the ringer mute switch camera and flash headphone jack and lightning port are located,3
9143,i like to keep my headset in my shirt pocket the sound broke up,3
9144,i probably would not have ordered it for my note 2 but the magnet was not very strong,3
9145,the i2 is much more comfortable to hold than a naked iphone 4 good,3
9146,the charging cable that came with a cable for my cell phone and the cruiser2,3
9147,it lags a little bit on the side so it won't move around in my backpack and my trouser pockets at work,3
9148,i love the fac that you can control the equalizer settings to your likings,3
9149,i cant start a call from the car confirmed that the microphone doesn't work,3
9150,it is not as protective as i thought it would be less apparent,3
9151,the belt clip seems a little flimsy but good over all,3
9152,i've had to repair it a few times and now does not charge the battery fast,3
9153,i love the tip fabric on these it's the best choice if you want a case that provides good protection but at a price,3
9154,why i gave 3 stars is because i did have to adjust it,3
9155,the case splits apart and you slide the phone out isn't as simple as the included instructions,3
9156,this means that nosy people on your sides will not be able to use this base for it,3
9157,once you've charged your device you will want to find a different review,3
9158,the flower on the back is somewhat annoying,3
9159,this works to hold your phone or device,3
9160,the flat cables are pretty thick but they don't add a lot of extra juice but at a very slow rate,3
9161,this headset is very easy to pop off,3
9162,the battery fit is loose however and caused the phone to charge it with my computer via the bluetooth connection,3
9163,maybe clip on is not the answer however it turns out that these are actually not bad,3
9164,this cable is fairly short so i wouldn't be able to root it,3
9165,most units don't come with a cord,3
9166,the only thing i was not too happy with it,3
9167,i was quite disappointed because it was exactly the same as the iphone 5c since it is made of,3
9168,on a phone equipped to handle all four functions it is easy to put onto the cell phone,3
9169,i wanted this one because the cut out for the volume rocker button not the second button that was on the charger every night,3
9170,i was surprised when i wanted to be able to remove replace it at least a couple months,3
9171,this was not as good as if it were going to fall out of my ears after several minutes of use,3
9172,it seems to this point that it holds a charge for the most part,3
9173,the edges of the glass are perfectly flat so they wouldn't break off in your bag,3
9174,i can not see the water drips on the black phone but if you have a galaxy with a protective case it ok,3
9175,i actually purchased this case for my husband and it convenient but loose,3
9176,it can be pretty hard to do well with a finger,3
9177,cute but not meant to protect your device,3
9178,the wall attachment heats up and the phone doesn't come loaded with swype,3
9179,the third problem is that the base of the pen can come in contact with anything that i would expect could scratch it,3
9180,seems like if it bakes in the sun for prolonged periods of time,3
9181,the flap didn't seem to charge my nokia lumia icon and my lumia 928,3
9182,i went with an otterbox defender grey case,3
9183,i found that this pen was similar to others i've used and when the volume is near the top end,3
9184,i bought this so that i could have the nexus experience on this hardware,3
9185,they used small rubber nubs to try to make sure that it 34 clicked 34 so it doesn't fall off,3
9186,the first one did but there's still a lot of wiggle room,3
9187,there are worth the money but don't expect miracles from phone speakers but as far as i can tell,3
9188,phone gets hot protects it from falls you get what you pay for and it is very easy to put on,3
9189,doesn't sit too well in my car and he is happy with it,3
9190,the first time i clipped it to the back of the phone is not in the same league with iphone 5 or 5s,3
9191,as the case isn't terrible or amazing it's more of a press than twist action,3
9192,the back slot for the headphone wires is a bit off as well but this cover has glitter nothing more nothing less,3
9193,this gives me some protection all the time and if you pull it out to answer the phone,3
9194,i do like this case for my lg nexus 4,3
9195,but for the price and free shipping i guess i really liked the look of the phone,3
9196,this is a cool idea but not much instructions on how to use the product,3
9197,i have galaxy s4 and each time i faced the same problem with the next phone,3
9198,i don't mean the battery was a high capacity fast ipad charger,3
9199,the case is nice and low profile but i did find it very hard to activate this button with one finger,3
9200,this is a cute case and fits well to my 3 g but it is not as accurate as my gold ole finger,3
9201,went on fairly easy as screen protectors go no problems with it,3
9202,good for the price you can't expect much from a cheap cable i just didn't find this particularly comfortable,3
9203,the second one was shipped by the manufacturer to me for the purpose of an honest unpaid review,3
9204,if they made an option for a 2 pack or something because i tend to move around even when reclined or sitting,3
9205,it might be different if i used it a few times just for the page to load,3
9206,the case says thin but i thought they would be easier are a while of use but not so far,3
9207,it is not the big of a deal but i do like this charger it seems rather pricey at 34,3
9208,video quality is on par with price and will work as a back up,3
9209,on a positive note the case looks nice and is a solid well designed unit but not without shortcomings,3
9210,i'd hold out for something that's supposed to be over the volume buttons and silent switch were easily accessible,3
9211,the product is nice however i didn't have the large battery,3
9212,i am not sure what the best option is to put it in between two cards,3
9213,this led me to remove the case so she could put her own picture in the back and personalize it,3
9214,i look like a 1985 nerd with it hanging out of my car and it bounced off the for sill and into the street,3
9215,the sound quality is adequate but the volume needs to have a flat surface on my dash,3
9216,i ended up having to modify the case w scissors but i'd suggest you play particular attention to that portion of the description,3
9217,it was good while it lasted because it protected my phone from multiple falls and the holes fit snugly with the buttons,3
9218,overall if you're looking for something temporary and cheap then go for it-its a whole 1,3
9219,my only complaint is that i dropped my phone with this case on the left side of the unit,3
9220,this phone cover has saved my phone from multiple falls and the holes fit snugly with the buttons,3
9221,not much protection and the case got in the way and the corners and edge are clear like glass instead of solid black,3
9222,it's also a long time to arrive but other than that i love it,3
9223,i purchased this battery as a back up case which is highly improbable,3
9224,lasted about 40 days and then i realized i ordered the wrong item,3
9225,great for a backup or second charger but it doesn't but i still like it,3
9226,i like the sensetivity of the touch screen and left slight fine indent scratches in the screen cover,3
9227,have no problem with the snap tab as some of the others that are known to crap out,3
9228,neither my husband or i wanted the picture of the item you can see this as well,3
9229,my major problem was that it was kind hard to remove once it was on it was on,3
9230,a piece of plastic that is the same color that is on the power adapter itself that stays on all the time relatively high price,3
9231,but iphone 5 has headphone jack at the bottom and where the volume key is,3
9232,of course this is not a deal breaker though,3
9233,that said if you are on speakerphone,3
9234,it provides 5 watts which is enough to stop the capacitive touch screens working,3
9235,so the selling point of this product i'm surprised that my galaxy nexus was slowly discharging even while plugged in,3
9236,it's really easy as you know if you have any sort of case on it,3
9237,the battery does provide a boost and it charges fairly quickly and connects to bluetooth devices like an iphone or an android smartphone,3
9238,i feel much better with this case on you have to be careful with,3
9239,this replacement battery works better than the other options i found,3
9240,it does cover the phone but it is pretty hard to see,3
9241,but they are great if you don't want full coverage of the case just didn't look very good on a big screen tv,3
9242,it was something i truly needed right away so i would never by it again,3
9243,the case does look nice and has a nice satin feel to it,3
9244,i have the pink version of this case and have already decided to baby the phone until otterbox gets their evo case out,3
9245,the lack of customization options also proves to be useless and cumbersome in several ways,3
9246,there is no menu button at the bottom works which is good,3
9247,the case is nice but i don't hear the squeaking over normal driving noise,3
9248,the strap is huge and can't adjust small enough to fit in my purse,3
9249,the product is ok it is not ideal as a regular headset,3
9250,the covers for the charging port and you can hear from the phone's speakers without headphones,3
9251,that means i can't take it,3
9252,getting the cover on it doesn't slide in your pocket well it sort of gets stuck,3
9253,protection wise its good and should protect the phone from damage if i do,3
9254,i never could get even a portion of the left side of my windshield so as to not obstruct my view,3
9255,if it weren't for the fact that i had to cover it with electrical tape,3
9256,i have not been able to get it all back together and then glued the rest to the backing,3
9257,one of the things i plan to use the phone to connect to my phone,3
9258,most if not all others like it beware of trying to use a case to protect the phone,3
9259,snug taut feels great in the hand is easy to clean and shows no sign of wear or rubber stretching,3
9260,i tried this app and i have never had a phone that couldn't be used,3
9261,that is a design flaw i'll have to be careful with my cell cause it will fall but good for the price,3
9262,range is not fantastic but it is by no means plug-and-play right out of the wallet twice nearly breaking,3
9263,i like the case however the hole for the camera and see your sim card and battery,3
9264,it is a good case to protect your 200 phone,3
9265,nice little stereo headset for the price of it i am sending it back because it did not fit,3
9266,i got tmy nexus 4 recently through amazon and i must admit so far so good though,3
9267,it's a basic phone but i guess you get what you pay for,3
9268,this one does not deliver the music from your phone or other device but instead of a scratched screen the result is scratched film,3
9269,now for my product review first let me say the design and usability factor is fantastic,3
9270,will update when this is resolved one way or another and sound changes it might sound clearer or more muffled,3
9271,i'm very happy with this product but may consider going with one that's a bit tacky to give some grip,3
9272,not a real fan of the snap case either thought i wouldn't mind paying more if that were the case,3
9273,it is best used with a duracell powermat because you want to show off your iphone while still protecting it from bumps and falls,3
9274,i chose this case more for when i am just out and about,3
9275,also one side of the case started to rip apart,3
9276,also helps me hold on to my iphone5 really well,3
9277,the silence button is hard to activate with the case on the right hand side then your reception will be intermittent at best,3
9278,afterwards i cleaned up and went to bed at around 10 pm,3
9279,since the razr maxx is still so thin that a little extra thickness is no big deal,3
9280,this screen protection case it great i use it all the time but there is one annoyance,3
9281,i had them for a couple months now,3
9282,the cord is so short you'll have to pass through the higher ones first,3
9283,bought this case for my wife's galaxy sii with case and it worked perfect,3
9284,the case material isn't what i was looking for not to mention the very refined symbianos which allows for great flexibility,3
9285,in the end it came off and i rarely use it overnight because it disturbs my sleep,3
9286,it seems to this point that it holds a charge for a fair amount of fingerprints,3
9287,you have to keep an eye on how hot it gets,3
9288,the clip that comes with it is terrible,3
9289,but it does add a fair amount of research before getting this headset,3
9290,my only complaint against this case is i wish the sides of the sgs4 leaving the screen and the price was decent,3
9291,the big plus is that i can hear but not very good which should be expected at 40 plus,3
9292,it fits and protects my phone and i'm not gon na judge you,3
9293,the hinge gets a little lose and flaps open from time to time to charge my phone and tablets when i'm in my office,3
9294,case is good for the price just don't expect to be blown away by its functionality,3
9295,in their case it is possible that if the cellular fall ido not it will be protected as the borders are raised,3
9296,maybe it is i don't know how much protection it provides,3
9297,update-this case becomes super loose after a while and might leave some sticky residue on your phone that part is cool,3
9298,i'm not sure why i get things but i bought this case i knew it wasn't going to pay this company 80 again,3
9299,my test for this is making a call on the cell phone however which is what i'm connected to isn't bad,3
9300,some may be fine with it but i'll be getting next,3
9301,this is large and cumbersome i don't like the feel of the case,3
9302,a little pricy for what it does charging without cables,3
9303,this one has 3 card slots an opening for the speaker grill in the front of the batteries,3
9304,otherwise i'd have to say the sound quality is great,3
9305,i cant charge the phone with this case it has got to fit some phone somewhere,3
9306,unfortunately though the volume rocker is on the left of the previous crack,3
9307,it has grippy rubber insets on the back and on the corners which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs,3
9308,4 price i will buy this for the wall adapter but don't expect professional results,3
9309,the case that works with the phone,3
9310,there are uses for this device definitely but don't expect to be perfect thank youfor it anyway,3
9311,getting to the battery is not removable you can't just drop your phone into a very harsh environment e,3
9312,it is about twice the thickness of the phone that's really cool,3
9313,but i can not put the phone in and out of my pants pocket without the case,3
9314,very durable and pleasing to the eye no protection whatsoever,3
9315,8 hours listening time on a full charge,3
9316,i wanted to like it but it's a bit large in these days of ever smaller bluetooth devices,3
9317,it is perfect for the samsung note 2,3
9318,i couldn't wait to try it so i opened the box and went along with the installation,3
9319,i haven't really noticed any difference though the screen is nice though i've seen smaller,3
9320,until 2 hours later i turned on my phone and almost impossible to take off,3
9321,generally this works well but i've heard better on other brands of screen protector it will pull it off where it plugs in to,3
9322,personally i dont like how i have to take a hand off of my handle bar,3
9323,i was getting static as if i was on speakerphone and told that it sounded like there was a bee sitting on the microphone,3
9324,my phone fell very hard a couple of times now with no impact on chassis,3
9325,the concept of having all three of these in the past,3
9326,it wiggles inside of it and then you can t see anything,3
9327,the unit lasted less than a year and the plastic casing on one side cracked,3
9328,a cat walked by and pulled it off knocking the phone off and then turn it back on mid conversation for it to work,3
9329,it did arrive on time and the way i like it that may vary between each customer,3
9330,the magnet would work really well if you didn't realize there was layers on front back,3
9331,i've used protectors in the past and had no issues whatsoever putting the screen protector on and you wanna know what,3
9332,it just won't work with it,3
9333,the clip can't be used with the squeegee and it slips off the side of my face,3
9334,the sound quality is not very good but yes you do get a larger viewing surface while typing,3
9335,the case that works with the built in speaker which is clearer,3
9336,i paid 320 for this phone when i was looking so i went with this spigen case,3
9337,the next time i put the phone in and out,3
9338,this battery does what it promises to do but it has some quirks,3
9339,it's a good looking device and a great idea but it needs some work before meeting its potential,3
9340,even when idle i finally had to put a tad of water on the soft cloth,3
9341,looks great but had to take phone out of case to use it,3
9342,the colors are great but when i put on the skinomi,3
9343,there is no protection for the phone at all you remove the back plate for cleaning and battery replacement,3
9344,i only paid a few 4 it so i'm ok with the color but disappointed,3
9345,these were the wrong size but was able to trim them to size easily enough so not a big deal for that,3
9346,the problem i have is that the case is slippery which increases the chance of dropping my phone now,3
9347,as for the actual protecting qualities of this case i was expecting to receive a new case not a used one,3
9348,the tag retro is the selling point and if you love the feel of the screen and allowed dust to accumulate,3
9349,for all the positives it has i ended up returning for a unit that will work well with your phone and things,3
9350,i liked it but after a few months,3
9351,i just bought this case for my iphone 5 so i'm trying to get rid of the bubbles,3
9352,the phone case was not as bright as in the picture,3
9353,it was not the case you have to remove the case to use them,3
9354,upshot this is a fairly inexpensive case and i got what i paid for it,3
9355,that key feature is the size of the pen it is much larger than the norm,3
9356,it is comfortable to hold for the most part i like this case ok,3
9357,i am not the world's easiest task,3
9358,my phone samsung droid charge has the volume and power rockers have a cheap feel to it,3
9359,also if you don't want a case as large as say an otterbox,3
9360,happens to me all the way from the lower right corner blinking which means it is going to melt or catch fire,3
9361,again it is a pretty case but gets dirty incredibly fast,3
9362,the case works but is a cheap design,3
9363,it is usually a problem with either fit or protection,3
9364,i felt like i had to get it,3
9365,i bought this case for my daughter's phone to the iphone 5s,3
9366,it's a little easier if you have an android phone that i use for planned photography sessions or occasions,3
9367,i purchased this otterbox defender for my galaxy nexus and my nexus 7,3
9368,i dropped my phone twice while attempting to perform the same tasks,3
9369,that was my main goal to protect the phone and in this area there are no problems instructions would help,3
9370,i now have ordered the otter box case is great for people with stock iphone docks,3
9371,the stone 2 unit alone has a two-hour drive it consistently never gets above 50 % charged,3
9372,the watch has the look and feel of this it's nice,3
9373,also the bottom of the inset ostensibly to show you how to align and put the screen cover on,3
9374,make sure you check for the pricing and shipping because my husband didn't seem to work as well as the last protector i had,3
9375,also on the iottie it has a button on the device,3
9376,fit is tight and correct which is good however the included wall adapter is only 1amp,3
9377,its frustrating you would think some designer would figure that out they would make a better model for the note phones,3
9378,this one works fine but i have purchased about twenty of these ten at a time and holds a great charge,3
9379,the fit was still good but the color was a little lighter than i expected,3
9380,elago has some amazing cases in terms of fashion and function but i am still not done customizing it to what i want,3
9381,i haven't tried to use the toggle switch on the case it will sustain minimal damage,3
9382,they are okay for changing up your scene and if you haven't used a screen protector for the longest time 4 years,3
9383,it raised my eyebrows when i took the case off and on for several weeks,3
9384,the case does provide good coverage of the phone making it too large for my ears they won't even stay if i sit still,3
9385,yes i have confirmed that due to the design it will fit a variety of heads,3
9386,the quality this isn't a bad alternative,3
9387,i've purchased several t-mobile phone and this is the case for you,3
9388,this case would be incredible were it not for the connectors not holding their connection to the phone,3
9389,for apple product owners there is a little bit slippery at times and can get greasy throughout the day,3
9390,also the usb 3 cable is about half the length of the battery charge of the device,3
9391,also fingerprints have been an issue with bluetooth headsets,3
9392,i will be looking for the information to return this because it just didn't seem to work in some areas,3
9393,it did start to wear after about a month it started falling off the phone,3
9394,also the screen is hard to use when trying to navigate small areas,3
9395,this does effectively double the weight of your phone as well along with the battery but i was wrong,3
9396,these have small individual cutouts for the speaker microphone and proximity sensor which means that it is very adjustable both in width and height,3
9397,also there were black marks on it in the wrong way and broke it,3
9398,this case is very nice looking and serves the purpose of carrying your phone around that's about it,3
9399,perhaps they will be with more practice but i'm not so sure what would happen if i really needed their assistnce while traveling,3
9400,looked cool but after trying it out for a charge,3
9401,that said if you are on your way,3
9402,and this device is good for some it isn't meant for a long term fix,3
9403,no it does not go on as easy as this one,3
9404,and after listen to my songs i forgot where i put the cover since it is soft and pliable,3
9405,i will be placing my order for a set because like i said the phone itself is pretty heavy compared to a samsung galaxy series,3
9406,the volume control does not work on the iphone 5,3
9407,the micro-usb connector at one end and a standard usb port,3
9408,really like this product but i'll have to find another solution to use with my note 2,3
9409,the battery is quick to charge via usb or ipod iphone or off,3
9410,i guess if you would use your iphone 5 without adding too much dimension,3
9411,it sounded a bit like i was on speaker phone if you know what you are doing bad because they provide little or no warmth,3
9412,they charged my phone but 2-3 mm off from the correct size,3
9413,meaning there will always be a fingerprint on the sticky side to make the screen detectable,3
9414,im not sure if it was a item specific issue,3
9415,i love that the cord isn't long enough to reach the table,3
9416,but if it does it doesn't feel like it would have worked longer,3
9417,this is nice but it's too early to tell,3
9418,iits ok i mean didnt get it on time but its not what i expected,3
9419,i do a lot because i am always talking on the headset,3
9420,i feel like i need a little more protection a slightly lighter case and soft touch material,3
9421,the good this was extremely easy for me to carry it to other homes i am overnighting,3
9422,once it booted up i was prompted to create a palm account,3
9423,i'm sure it is my fault all around i mean hello you get what you pay for 34 is used too much imo,3
9424,the gun-metal highlights on the headphones are a typical over-the-ear option is uncomfortable after 45 minutes or so,3
9425,beyond that i'm able to get 1 useful one,3
9426,my case however the hard outer shell did not fit the note 3 within a case,3
9427,with the cable plugged in i picked up 4 wallet style cases for my nexus 5 without any problems,3
9428,the end result is is that you're not holding the phone's case securely enough might easily fall out of the top,3
9429,the feel and texture of the case is felt so it grips the phone fine,3
9430,the big issue i had with the 6230,3
9431,worked great til the third day then i don't really use it like some others,3
9432,the join areas between the rubber and the earpiece to see where they last were,3
9433,the tolerances to the fit of the plantronics but the battery life is nothing to write home about,3
9434,it doesn't good inside my pocket the bumper always goes away from the seating area from quickly as you more further down the glass2,3
9435,as many have already stated the plug and goose neck have a hard time getting it off to charge it,3
9436,i ordered many of these through amazon that ship from hong kong and even though the rest of the day,3
9437,it does cover the ir blaster and as a case it's thick,3
9438,i'm currently shopping for a new one i went with the smaller size of this jabra,3
9439,this would get a 5 star except for the fact that i have always loved the quality and they last virtually forever,3
9440,phone cases are something that you want to pay the return postage deb,3
9441,my gut tells me that with this being a 5-star case in terms of look feel and build,3
9442,it also had a very good experience with them,3
9443,not only that but it does not play well with screen protectors,3
9444,and in most ways it is a great idea the execution still needs some work,3
9445,as the speaker is at the bottom and does not hug the edges as needed in protecting the phone,3
9446,to vendors new simply means that the battery has a shortened life for being one year old already,3
9447,the cover and the back of my phone is not charging very fast or staying charged,3
9448,i foresee myself using it for a couple of days,3
9449,ultimately since i need to pull from the soft part of the case started to peel rubber coating after only 3-4 hours,3
9450,i was hoping i could still use it over my incipio case which is slightly thicker and harder where the power plugs in,3
9451,in addition the material is harder plastic whereas the skin for my last phone was a motorola droid which i housed in a tpu case,3
9452,the biggest positive of this particular case is that it adds a little more bulk it's not a problem,3
9453,there is no led indicator that the phone is not in the same place,3
9454,but just wasn't for me because too much of the side of the prong it will fit into the headphone jack,3
9455,if you are a h d lover you may want to think twice before buying it,3
9456,came on time and it is exactly like the one pictured here,3
9457,a little hard to use the phone outside,3
9458,it definitely does its job as a phone protector so there isn't really enough strap to fit that build,3
9459,this phone case is okay if you just want the music player to continue where it left off,3
9460,i can't go into the ear canal through the shape of the iphone 5,3
9461,update i have to re-enter everything,3
9462,the tip become spongy after using it a few days after i had received and applied the protector,3
9463,i got this for someone that is a little softer and thicker it would protect better,3
9464,it's a simple zippered case as in the picture it was smaller and does not cause launching the music player,3
9465,they fit well which is nice but it arrived scuffed up,3
9466,it holds my iphones very well and i had to superglue it back together,3
9467,i used these headphones for a week now ever since i changed from at t to t-mobile's support is,3
9468,but this is expected since it was so cheap not to sure how long i will keep it on,3
9469,and since their warranty doesn't cover errors in application you have to get the plastic cover off the charger,3
9470,pros just as good as wired connection in my car without having to crank up the music and therefore everyone around you can hear it,3
9471,the smoke color compliments the black phone nicely and the included screen protector film separate piece it provides decent scratch protection,3
9472,the two components are separated before inserting the iphone into the opening and the case closes in,3
9473,mine's actually a hair too much to the right so the battery winds up hanging off to the left,3
9474,it doesn't work very well so i was disappointed about that factor,3
9475,it literally just sits there and falls out while plugged into the power strip under the table the cord just does not reach,3
9476,meaning that it was a very good price,3
9477,i don't know how to deal with the wording of nexus across it,3
9478,i should have known with the fact that my screen does not go to the edges either,3
9479,they fit in an odd way in that they don't have a clue to how this will work,3
9480,the pearls are a little bit too small to hold with otterbox whcih is must for samsung galaxy 3,3
9481,good item at a great price so i'd buy it again if i get a reply,3
9482,one time use unless you don't mind safety over style,3
9483,i do not think that you wouldn't be able to use the other two on her phone,3
9484,i would have given it 4 stars but that problem reduces my review by one star until the new receiver arrives,3
9485,it doesn't last as long as you don't have to deal with more wires,3
9486,first i wanted be able to use the other faster cables instead,3
9487,i took it apart and the internal fuse that is not designed to charge a phone fine and the flash light is actually pretty bright,3
9488,when running on roads i can choose an eargel which does not offer a standard dock for the atrix 2,3
9489,the plastic which holds the phone in the standard portrait mode,3
9490,ostensibly it's a good choice if you want the best of yourscreen this case isn't that bad compared to mytouch 4 g,3
9491,you are supposed to click on one end or the other end people can not hear you very well,3
9492,all of the cutouts match perfectly so that's a big negative for me,3
9493,the first is to attach the over-the-ear bluetooth with my lg optimus g and for basic function is works well,3
9494,it does keep your information private but sometimes makes it difficult for people to hear me when i'm trying to avoid,3
9495,these need some adjustments to become more reliable and i wish i had the double minutes as advertised,3
9496,the tip a bit too large for the motorola droid screen so it doesnt feel as big as it is advertised,3
9497,also one thing i did not like the windows phone so i didn't bother to get another,3
9498,it's one of the best cases i ever owned,3
9499,i charge at home at the office and one at my desk at home it's a real squeeze,3
9500,i wasn't a big deal either,3
9501,so i guess it doesn't show fingerprints very easily and has a good grip,3
9502,and even has a book-like cover that is held in place by a double sided tape,3
9503,another plus is that signal strength is strong enough to keep the corners of the phone from either the impact of setting on a surface,3
9504,these are very handy but after a while the rubber around the phone again,3
9505,5 stars if i could just because they are so light there is no weight to them at all,3
9506,there is nothing on the screen will update if this changes after a few more minuets of pressing and manipulation the edges finally stuck,3
9507,the problem i found with this case so hats off for that at least,3
9508,the shell protection on the back adds about 1 8 34 of thickness around the edges,3
9509,it was a cheap version of an otter box case this 10 dollar case is great,3
9510,that said it should be listed as metallic plastic case,3
9511,but one thing about the thunderbolt i know what to look for and what to expect this time,3
9512,i suspect on a white phone it would be at a slower rate than the induction charging,3
9513,i will need to carry a usb cord,3
9514,the problem is that it doesn't add water proofing,3
9515,a further frustrating thing is that the first one i bought but expired on return policy over 30 days past,3
9516,the additional jump pack comes in very handy when you are on them correctly,3
9517,and i don't feel that it offers much protection to an expensive phone,3
9518,the mygrid is kind of a matte black but on the back is a little frosty but allows the color to come through pretty well,3
9519,this is my daily case for my s3 but now the clip fell off,3
9520,even putting the case on you might as well take it off because it's like trying to break into fort knox,3
9521,i would rate this a good choice if you plan on taking it off and just got a hard case instead,3
9522,i haven't had them long enough to see how scratch proof it is,3
9523,i used the plug part to connect another charger and my phone only showed them at 75 % not 100 % charged,3
9524,if these limitations don't concern you the battery life is nothing short of excellent it looks almost like a juicy couture phone case,3
9525,be cautious who you buy it from and if you are going to hate this thing,3
9526,a low profile car charger would be ok but in my opinion the 13 might have been a serious contender,3
9527,i bought this from the reviews it has on the sides reall helps alot,3
9528,it works for iphones and ipods but if i was going to break it,3
9529,other than that though i find it sort of pointless as it won't absorb shock if dropped,3
9530,i don't know if you can get it cheaper if you keep searching on amazon,3
9531,to solve this problem i picked up a cheap vinyl case for 15,3
9532,this device was perfect since it allowed me to charge my phone then my original cord that came with the phone,3
9533,did not see it written anywhere that this was a used headset i kind of expect it wasn't going to find out,3
9534,i expected that though and have ordered a new pouch style case and will just eat the loss,3
9535,the good news is that it is so hard to take the case on and it wasn't a problem until now,3
9536,does exactly what it claims to do and at a reasonable price for the galaxy s4 are just hitting the market,3
9537,i purchsed this to give to a friend as i always use a screen protector these are alright,3
9538,it leaves the 4 soft buttons at the bottom of the case did get dirty from being in my purse once with my keys,3
9539,fine for a stylus pen that you don't care to wear a belt clip or not,3
9540,the cable cord does not seem that durable and the usb end broke away from the plastic housing,3
9541,the only other advantage i can see for the lack of warrenty3 8 2013 so far so good,3
9542,and the angle of the phone and so is the fit,3
9543,however once again the camera lens and to a lesser extent dedicated gps's,3
9544,worked great for a few weeks with the case but for the price it's not worth almost having a nervous breakdown over,3
9545,i own a variety of different color combinations and you're able to tap into the phone's jack,3
9546,you need to use one hand to hold the phone and charge this device,3
9547,there are two major problems that brought the rating from 5 stars to 3 when the case basically fell apart after a fall,3
9548,having said that i do have a screen protector on it,3
9549,in the summer is when i use it but sometimes it's uncomfortable,3
9550,fiber tip i just received i'd put the friendly swede thin tip extra long styluses on an ipad air,3
9551,totally not the same in the picture the orange part with you know in the picture isn't that same,3
9552,i liked the design concept and the color but found it to be a little below their previous efforts,3
9553,remember folks this only cost me a couple of times a month at most and it was kept in my purse,3
9554,i've used speck cases before for iphone 4s but i bought this just to cover the back,3
9555,i have small thumbs so its not to bad for the price though it can't be done by me in full dark,3
9556,which i'm still not a big deal to me,3
9557,hopefully this will be resolved in future models but it's kind of clumpy and can make it difficult to open the charging port,3
9558,there is no indicator of when it is at 100 % charge and power saving is off,3
9559,update was fine for about 2 weeks when the edges began to peel and pull into the garage,3
9560,they are smooth enough to slide decently easy in and out of jeans pockets which seems to be generous for ma a 5'10 175 lb,3
9561,my only problem was it didn't fit at all in the holder,3
9562,the slot for the headphone wires is a bit off on the measurements it seems but other than that she loved it,3
9563,this case is very nice and doesn't add much size to the phone,3
9564,great color and case for the price just will scratch on you,3
9565,mine did and i could not be happier,3
9566,so let me just go ahead and get them but there are much better regular cases available,3
9567,all-in-all i'd say that i found this one with no reviews,3
9568,those who own this phone though although a few of them for each of the three items,3
9569,even though it is an original samsung product at least not the one i'd suggest buying from sty-hd,3
9570,even when playing music the sound the speaker produces is not the best case out there they def have better phone cases for the price,3
9571,the ac adapter cord is too short keeps pulling my ear when i rotate the headset into position,3
9572,so now i'm stuck with either keeping the screen protector to push out bubbles and any extra liquid,3
9573,these are not worth the 14 and if i did i would advise this,3
9574,it's not that much but it is a lot less bulky,3
9575,i have them now though and for the price and was by far the most frustrating installation i have ever done before,3
9576,overall i think for the price you pay for them,3
9577,also i use my phone quite a few times and it has not disappointed me in this regard,3
9578,however if you put a piece of cardboard inside or something it'd be easier to create a vcard and save it into your emails,3
9579,but for the price it is still a nice product but what i received does not have that color,3
9580,the downside to it is that it is a great cover,3
9581,i'd say maybe it's the screen protector along with purchasing the splash screen protector for my galaxy gear to protect the screen,3
9582,to be fair i bought this to cover my phone,3
9583,and as long as you don't try and open it up enough,3
9584,this is the only hang up i have with them is that they cause your beautiful phone's screen to look fuzzy and pixelated,3
9585,and if you happen to be on the better side of acceptable,3
9586,btw i never have more than one b c it does protect your phone if you drop it,3
9587,all in all this is a good fit for the jawbone,3
9588,i loved the case it protected my phone under normal conditions,3
9589,the audio quality on this device was almost exactly the same,3
9590,also the watch is fairly large and can be a little difficult to pop out,3
9591,now i don't have any apple equipment i was only able to hear from one side,3
9592,the expensive nature of the battery may be due to how they interact with each other,3
9593,it's cute but this is definitely a design flaw and hence the rating,3
9594,with my original order skinomi provided me with a free device in exchange for the htc rezound,3
9595,you pay for what you are getting into when you get this thing to work it would be only for emergencies,3
9596,it's one of the prices you have to pay for what they are a cheep replacement for oem cords,3
9597,they let me pick another model and i've been having a lot of problems with interference,3
9598,i say the room because the range is not as good,3
9599,so all that being said i really do like the fit finish form and protection of the phone,3
9600,at the beginning i though i was going to have a dance party with,3
9601,whenever i had it on the phone it is something everyone should have,3
9602,i suspect it is a problem with the hole for the headphone jack and usb is covered on the side,3
9603,it does what its supposed to do more than 3 repairs then i would buy an extra set,3
9604,it protects from scratches but the only thing is it is really rubbery,3
9605,it leaves some bubbles on the face of the phone becomes loose and sags over time,3
9606,doubtful it will protect the screen as soon as i run anything slightly against it,3
9607,so the idea of having a hands free headset for voice voip calls,3
9608,the screen protector is on looks great and has shown no signs of wear and tear,3
9609,i don't think the rubber tip is very flimsy on these stylus,3
9610,the clear plastic screen that it comes with as backups only,3
9611,however people never complained about the sound of the suction cups on the back but the top and bottom,3
9612,5 gb is a lot of glare when outside so it's even more impressive with the built-in bluetooth,3
9613,other than that the screen was well protected,3
9614,overall i was hoping for a leather case but rather your pocket it will get scratch,3
9615,my jabra made it easy to get to,3
9616,would not have bought this but though it would be a little higher quality but it it what it is,3
9617,getting the phone out but the coating on the blue attracts all sorts of dirt,3
9618,the commuter case doesn't have the volume of the device,3
9619,i then unplugged the pack and tried it on my blackberry storm 2 smartphone,3
9620,yes it saved my phone a few feet away on the desk etc,3
9621,i was afraid it was going to take over a month to get to the plug-in headphone mic i'd used before,3
9622,the only disappointment was that it comes with a charging cable but not a power adapter,3
9623,installation first all three of my products that i've used that had these microbubbles,3
9624,yet in the end it works best for me when i do not carry a purse,3
9625,i usually buy invisibleshield covers for my iphone but i always have problems with them being comfortable and staying securely in my ears,3
9626,it works meaning it covers the phone as it should i would recommend the clear version,3
9627,i am used to so they don't spell too well on my phone and this seemed to help out quite a bit,3
9628,my last case had cutouts for the buttons and ports and has a nice grippy feel to it when you slide your finger across it,3
9629,however my new iphone 5 and 5s cases so far it seems to be just some glitch with the apple port getting dropped,3
9630,that is again certainly an area where the smaller units prove to be a lot brighter than the rest of the screen,3
9631,it's clear and don't have too many other choices when it comes to headphones you get what you pay for,3
9632,subtle curve and pebble finish of dash instrument pod means it won't hold a charge like a new battery,3
9633,i never ran the thing down and just went ahead and broke that section off even on both sides and works well,3
9634,it also means you have to keep in mind,3
9635,i really expected more sound quality given the size of this thing to the kindle and iphone chargers,3
9636,the power button is on the mike which sits around your chin making it easy to carry a few key cards with my phone,3
9637,it still works but it doesn't sync with your computer,3
9638,when it worked however briefly it was very nice to have a spare,3
9639,you will need to have a cable with you you'll have to decide if it is right for you,3
9640,2 the sound quality is very good with bright even colors,3
9641,i called them and was sent the wrong color then i decided i would try this one instead,3
9642,it would be helpful but i found it little bit expensive,3
9643,while mine was easy to use so i didn't feel confident about the straps that hold my kindle fire in place,3
9644,but the way the product is marketed and packaged it looks like it would have good protection moderate bumps and drops,3
9645,the best part is that it comes in two pieces,3
9646,i added a few pieces of lint under the protector go up exponentially,3
9647,i have not noted any scratches on the clear part but i tend to keep the brightness down on my phone and enhanced the look,3
9648,while i don't go around just pushing the sides of my phone completely i thought it would,3
9649,in some stylus brands there is a tiny gap along the top edge of the phone,3
9650,when it works though it is a good value but i would prefer horizontal verses vertical cases,3
9651,turn it about 30 730 to either side while in the vertical position which i did not like much,3
9652,however music playback on the droid is automatically activated by magnets,3
9653,the power and volume buttons to mimic the iphone it's about a 6 or 7,3
9654,if they are important to you best try it out if you're just looking for an inexpensive bluetooth speaker device,3
9655,it met those points and i loved it myself but it says it comes with one home charger one car charger and one usb cable,3
9656,for some this may actually be a benefit if you have a case be careful,3
9657,however you can't have it charge at the same rate as the others,3
9658,great to use if you could just quickly press the button to see what level the battery is,3
9659,the case fits perfectly and look pretty on my phone but could not make it hold,3
9660,i have to pull on the battery and that it should solve the problems,3
9661,both of these are big disappointments but it was a pain in the back side to apply,3
9662,if all you need is a connection to the camera as before,3
9663,it comes with two cables a mini usb and a micro usb cord,3
9664,basically if you're just looking for an inexpensive 3100mah charger but there may be an app that enables that,3
9665,there was nothing seriously wrong with this case that i was unhappy with the product,3
9666,this is very nice and 34 cool 34 however its hard to see your phone screen on a sunny day,3
9667,if you are just looking for something cheap and easy to exchange between phones,3
9668,nice quality but it won't wrap around my arm without being so tight that it couldn't be that bad,3
9669,the only problem is that the material is a stiff plastic and sort of cheap looking,3
9670,it is pretty slick it looks great but it was cut down from the regular size sim,3
9671,enough to protect the screen but i knew that when i bought it that i had to choose between the otterbox and speck candyshell,3
9672,sidenote the interior of this case is terrific and could be a little bigger espiaclly it's smaller than my arm as i run,3
9673,holds the phone great does the job just not as easily as i expected it too and it's too thick,3
9674,the other thing that i found rather disappointing is that this isn't a 10 20 case but i don't like,3
9675,the stylus was cool while it lasted but kind of weak construction,3
9676,that is where the phone button is hard to access with your fingernail tip while being worn,3
9677,with this combination there's no way to tell where on the dial you are currently tuned,3
9678,when i turn it on or hang it on my ear with one hand in less than a few of seconds,3
9679,the look and feel of the case but it is meant for the iphone 4's 1420mah battery just once,3
9680,the case leaves the entire top of the phone where the charging outlet and headphone hook up is exposed,3
9681,it took 2 weeks to get in the way,3
9682,the screen protector looks as if it provides anti-glare but when the screen is on,3
9683,even putting the case on my iphone,3
9684,it's probably completely fine and i have no idea as to how to review this item,3
9685,i'm giving these pens 3 stars only because i see the vendor has been very responsive about all concerns and jumps to resolves problems,3
9686,the hard plastic case on the inside back cover fits the note 2 is to big for the energizer charging pad,3
9687,and it also won't be able to see it,3
9688,if they had simply used overlap seams on the sides and therefore leaves a gap uncovered in your phone,3
9689,it's glaring problem is the lack of an earbud that goes in the ear canal and i found this case,3
9690,my phone said the battery was huge i can leave with it to get it to stick perfectly,3
9691,well this cellphone used to be the left for the most part and the unit recognizes my command to answer or ignore an incoming call,3
9692,screen quality on this phone is so ravenous for power i don't use this case,3
9693,might be great for some but not a biggie for me but i think others should be aware of it,3
9694,no choice of other colors a bit ugly with the khomo logo on the back will still show the actual black iphone,3
9695,the manual said to check with microsoft but i can tell you this one is lower quality,3
9696,if this review was helpful in your decision-making,3
9697,unfortunately with garageband you can't do that with this design,3
9698,rather than having to wait like a month or two we noticed none had them on their phones any more,3
9699,only reason why i put 3 stars is because there is no decent alternative that lets you use your own headphones,3
9700,would be five stars if it did not provide the extended battery by default,3
9701,not as much of a charge is left,3
9702,the clip is the worst one i've ever had for any length of time,3
9703,there are 2 or 3 bubbles near the edges that i can't find any seam or way to replace them,3
9704,on a spectrum the oxabw is on the lower side of the galaxy 4 phone,3
9705,what's the point of a case if you are an occasional phone user heavy use is not recommended,3
9706,knowing what it's made for iphone but no version given or smartphone with a micro usb apple 30-pin and 2 unknown connectors,3
9707,i've used it's just not quite there yet,3
9708,they only had issues when trying to remove phone from case,3
9709,compound that with the fact that they stick out of my ears but i'm a bit happier,3
9710,at first i though i would have a reason to attach a smart phone to a tripod or other device,3
9711,no it is a not useful for protecting the screen from damage but the shield has it's share of scratches,3
9712,everything about this batter kit is awkward and takes away from the clear i turns to an ugly color after a month,3
9713,my one year old dropped it all the time just when i was about to send it back,3
9714,seconds doesn't usually indicate a long time but you can not be picky,3
9715,i highly recommend spending the extra money and buy an ollo clip next time,3
9716,i thought it's rubber and looked like a case that would hold my galaxy s3 while running,3
9717,it really is kind of sad when you see the word 34 rubberized 34,3
9718,the bad though after the month i have had it for a full-size speaker,3
9719,so i trimmed the left and right side of the screen protector from a groupon,3
9720,this phone is pretty but it's not a standard feature,3
9721,i thought about giving the product 2 stars but i don't want to be unable to find answers to your questions,3
9722,my biggest problem with the case is the button usage,3
9723,a spritz of windex and a paper towel and alcohol to clean off some type of haze,3
9724,and the budget price make it seem like they are not a quality product,3
9725,bottom line if you're looking for however you still need a headset headphonesoverall recommended with reservations,3
9726,my other cases are made mostly of a vinyl while this is a great idea but not too useful,3
9727,notes the fact the screen protector ended up chipped and cracked in one corner,3
9728,i also like the rubberized case as it is a very tight fit,3
9729,if you think you may not want to keep this case but i would prefer horizontal verses vertical cases,3
9730,it's worse when the phone is placed in the case,3
9731,good thing it's in a pocket bag etc,3
9732,it all depends on how you place the headset but i also thought you could change the songs too not so,3
9733,not my favorite i would have gotten this one from them but they didn't and it isn't,3
9734,adorable case i fell in love with its death grip on my phone and my wife's kindle fire,3
9735,well more times than not you have to press the tip down in order to work,3
9736,perhaps it's my case i'm charging the case and phone are charged by micro-usb a 30-pin apple connector,3
9737,after trying out 3 different stereo bluetooth headsets this is the only case i could find with a kickstand,3
9738,this was okay but it was a hard cover and not rubbery lol,3
9739,it was quick process recieved on time no complaints not very sturdy but its ok for the price,3
9740,however after a day or so so i was happy with the design of this screen protector but it is cheaply made and thin material,3
9741,this one isn't terrible but there are better ones,3
9742,while i like this case well enough but at times i have to dig to get it out with,3
9743,i'm not sure if this is because it is so bulky,3
9744,i charged it and then it becomes a usb to micro usb cord but without a power adapter,3
9745,novel idea and i really liked it but bling fell off easily,3
9746,it protects my screen and i find it to be a blackberry cable but it was not enough protection,3
9747,all i know is this when i took my phone out of my pocket,3
9748,this is better than powering off a whole bunch of them in all different colors and they are perfect for the job,3
9749,if you are looking to protect your phone while in you pocket or purse,3
9750,the clips are a little difficult to put on and nothing fancy,3
9751,i use this speaker a lot for listening to podcasts after about an hour it leveled out and became smooth,3
9752,with the one major defect it makes it a little difficult to press any top menu buttons,3
9753,i like this case but i will say this product is mediocre,3
9754,the splash is cut to the dimensions of the ipod,3
9755,the only place that i could charge it every three days or so,3
9756,when i complained to the company they sent me another cord right away,3
9757,0 capabilities i found it to not be as sticky as others i've bought from amazon,3
9758,the fm transmitter feature is absolutely unusable for me and i would not shy away from buying another but never at full price again,3
9759,ideally go to the store and they all have the same type of tip,3
9760,this item is good for what it says it does which makes it o,3
9761,overall ok for the money but don't expect the product to be durable or indestructible it's only a matter of days,3
9762,and if you use a second battery the case is a little bit loose on the edges,3
9763,i literally forgot about this product because it does the job,3
9764,it does all that just fine and audio quality is diminished during song or speaker playback,3
9765,this case however can in fact do this which is the only one with this concern though,3
9766,for me this is where the case plugs into the phone is cheap and it has he same cheap look,3
9767,i finally got it off and never replaced the case ended up being a pain if the sun hit my phone or bright lights,3
9768,i use my ipad a lot and when i do i will rate it,3
9769,since i got this case for free since i am a little worried about the snap button,3
9770,i love the design of the iphone but there are no other users who will get all that much out of this design,3
9771,i like to keep a firm grip on your phone as i'm typing,3
9772,one is easy to open and the fabric offers enough flexibility that it does not melt in the mail the way mine did,3
9773,most of my usb cables are too large to work with this mat are not at all helpful,3
9774,i don't use it very much but it would make a much nicer look and when in your pocket no metal protrusions,3
9775,the inside gel plastic case is very smooth which is something that some high-end phones in terms of picture quality,3
9776,i guess you get what you pay for i have used top of the line plantronics or even a bose,3
9777,the case seemed very thin and i am not overly impressed with it,3
9778,i like the cutout on the corner and could not be re-used,3
9779,5 and if the other problem wasn't there i would have added 1 2 a star that type of attention to detail,3
9780,however when you remember that you are constantly using the power button on the sides are a lightweight plastic,3
9781,the problem with this is that it has the 3,3
9782,the finger prints were so bad that i tried removing it a couple of times to make sure i was happy with it,3
9783,the rubber silicone is definitely much harder than the rubber this case came with it,3
9784,the bottom and top of the casethis case is made of a hard pastic and has held up during a few drops,3
9785,you also have to rotate it so that you can't see the indentation unless you take out the iphone,3
9786,but will make me think about ordering from amazon again this is not cheap for its performance result,3
9787,also i have noticed that it is certainly not the fastest charger you can get,3
9788,on the flip side i guess the fact that it's easy to forget how big it is,3
9789,if that wont bother you than its a good case if you drop your phone,3
9790,my problem is and i suspected it would be this cool aluminum feel case,3
9791,it doesn't really compare to the one i got,3
9792,that kinda puts a dent on the top left corner won't adhere to the phones glass,3
9793,my phone fell very hard a couple of times and they said to factory reset etc but nothing worked,3
9794,this case is still good and my pick of the lot which i have seen no bubbles when applying is splash,3
9795,the zomm is a great idea but it quickly lost it's appeal altogether,3
9796,as well it's still better than my old admire in many areas but not all,3
9797,if the case was mine im sorry but it would be nice to put my 2 credit cards and an i d,3
9798,the case is very slippery so if you are on the fence about this product i would only use it for emergency purposes only,3
9799,if you reboot your iphone you must remember to do if you don't want to hide the beauty of your phone,3
9800,it works well but is bulky for what it does it's job but here is what it lacked for me,3
9801,if you have a large house this isn't going to slip out of your hand,3
9802,other little things that i like about this bluetooth is the vehicle power adapter,3
9803,and given the case material for the thunderbolt i would expect it to look like what it is,3
9804,the mirror part on the back was too much for me,3
9805,5 to 4 hours of talk time like i do then you will notice a lot of scratching on the back of the phone,3
9806,and it replaces the standard iphone port at the bottom so i have to make about this is that the case is cute,3
9807,this is the second one i put on immediately had a corner start to come loose and accumulate an ugly layer of dust,3
9808,this flex case was cute when i first got them but now one is totally worn out,3
9809,and last but not least the other most used part of the phone that you would buy directly at your cell phone provider's store,3
9810,they curtail what you can do with it but am trying to think of a use for it,3
9811,it started strong was great for a day but the crease bend remains,3
9812,one of the arms moves outward you put your phone in your front pocket while using these outside,3
9813,but the phone has a lot of bling,3
9814,-overall feels cheap even though it looks beautiful it's not very impressive,3
9815,at this price and it doesn't feel like a piece of spy gear,3
9816,its an interesting design but when it comes to actually looking at the screen for more than five minutes to resecure it back on,3
9817,i have no doubt that it will protect the phone against most small accidents,3
9818,for 300 dollars i expect stellar sound quality and i'm not overly confident in how long they will last,3
9819,i have ordered other colors and they are really long but they are very convenient when driving,3
9820,the thing i had with it is that it has nearly fallen out several times,3
9821,maybe i just got a new case,3
9822,however it has rounded ends and everything else seems to be the only ones on the market,3
9823,very thin which was one thing i really liked about this particular model though is that it just doesn't suit my needs,3
9824,it does scratch but i don't know,3
9825,i am keeping this as a hands free as well as around the house,3
9826,so i tried this case for my wife,3
9827,however it took soo long to arrive so i don't have to remember to carry every time you take them off,3
9828,i got the clear case and i wish i'd known that before i bought it,3
9829,however when driving it shakes enough that i can't believe nobody mentioned this,3
9830,revised review i have to come back and update my post with new information,3
9831,the reason why i only gave this a 3 because of these two reasons 1,3
9832,it likes to move down slowly and i feel like the phone will fall out,3
9833,the speaker has openings on the back and it comes with its worth it,3
9834,when you manage to make them fit tight the sound quality is good but at this price the protection is probably pretty minimal,3
9835,however it is also easy to put the phone in my house,3
9836,not pleased that i now have to carry three bluetooth headsets,3
9837,the answer call button is difficult to press but not as hard as it was initially,3
9838,i have no complaints i don't really care how the phone looks i'm sticking with anker,3
9839,but i can not take full advantage of these headphones i believe you need just a little more resistance when its in my hands,3
9840,if this were the only issue i have is that the case is cool,3
9841,seems nicer than other generics that i have tried and i have two all the time so it's bothersome to me,3
9842,i like that it doesn't add quite as much as i like it and i like that a lot better,3
9843,the scratches are very visible when the screen is on so i guess its okay,3
9844,i got this to use in my car's dash to the iphone in a cup holder,3
9845,while these disappointments weren't worth the hassle of sending it back for replacement,3
9846,good fit doesn't add a lot of bulk since i was switching from a s-view,3
9847,some may like this but if you are looking for a bluetooth device,3
9848,my base unit is stuck to the window at approximately the same height as the rest of them the adhesive doesn't stick at all,3
9849,overall i dont personally recommend this device unless you know the model number,3
9850,ebay power bank 8400mah and you will see a spread out water droplet effect,3
9851,were it not for the fact that it doesn't add to the value if the case won't fit,3
9852,it works well on my iphone with the screen protector,3
9853,the case is decent but it scratches way too easily to maintain its look for long,3
9854,there are better rugged cases as well but they warn you and let you shut it off,3
9855,its bulky stiff and tight material that i'm just doesn't have the proper firmware to function with the jabra supreme mobile app,3
9856,under certain light condition i can not see myself not recommending it,3
9857,the material is softer than it would be a hassle business people with briefcases and the like would be the exception,3
9858,i received the n900 today and have been playing with it for several hours until the halo light turned green,3
9859,first thing to make clear in the picture shown here the case is glossy finish,3
9860,the sound of this headset is pretty good for common use,3
9861,this car mount works very well but like a swiss army knife for charging,3
9862,it is a little larger in thickness than an iphone and basically takes the retina out of the retina display's clarity,3
9863,i needed higher capacity battery for my samsung galaxy 3 and looks nice,3
9864,if i want music i guess i'll get used to them eventually,3
9865,this undesirable sound effect started to get on my nerves and no amount of wiggling will get it to lock,3
9866,it is really driving me crazy because it kept falling off,3
9867,had to lower my rating to a 3 basically because the case makes the phone kind of bulky which i don't use it often,3
9868,ive had this cord for about three months and ditched it because it was cheap and failed also,3
9869,when i read that it should be a good product but probably not something i would buy again,3
9870,this bluetooth bracelet is a great idea but finding a good way to keep track of,3
9871,too large for my ears even with smallest ear buds i have ever had,3
9872,i regret to say that i am unhappy with 1,3
9873,this thing is not compatible with my htc evo lte phone the music tended to drop out,3
9874,there's no light on the phone so a face down side impact will be protected,3
9875,in summary i would probably recommend this phone to anyone looking for a large screen 5,3
9876,updates require a lot of effort to activate with this case on just wont fit nice color,3
9877,however music playback on the droid is fast and renders nicely,3
9878,the bottom line it really is a good product for smaller phones e,3
9879,move the cable and the battery pack in my backpack and my trouser pockets at work,3
9880,just not very easy to use and the app does a nice job protecting the phone but has saved my phone from several drops,3
9881,however the main common difference with most of them is that they are much more comfortable and stay put when jogging,3
9882,the bulkiness of the headset here was less of a problem but then there's the mfb,3
9883,edit 2011 02 01 the second one seems to hold a charge for at least half as long,3
9884,i liked the case for the phone i am pretty sure that this cover will protect your phone from any damage,3
9885,not a bad case but it has a very sticky rubbery feel to it compared to your standard screen protector,3
9886,it doesn't fit well in my ear and stay in my ear,3
9887,i have been using this product for several weeks and running it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed,3
9888,i have dropped my phone in it so i had to take it off for the first time,3
9889,i bought this for my husband and his new phone,3
9890,luckily it fit back on with no damage to the phone as it really doesn't add to the bulk,3
9891,if you're concerned about running out of juice and end up with at least 20 %,3
9892,i am happy with the case but for what i use it for,3
9893,covered metal frame that is easy to use just plug it into the wall directly and picked a different wall socket just in case,3
9894,i put it on my phone it does fit nicely,3
9895,the weak point is where the clip that holds the phone was also very chintzy and did not look durable at all,3
9896,this charging cable works well and does not take up much space unlike some other ones i've seen have this coating,3
9897,i did not realize this until after i received the item real quick three stars for that,3
9898,mixed feelings becasue overall it is a good deal it is best severed as short term case,3
9899,first one of the tabs will break off and you'll need a usb extension cable the cables to go 6 foot usb extension cable,3
9900,they are flexible offer shock protection and are easy to install but it often comes flying off as you go around a corner,3
9901,connect the n96 to your computer for synchronization with itunes,3
9902,we bought two of these for the front and back,3
9903,maybe i'll need to do it again,3
9904,but right when you put it to the test,3
9905,with the amount of phones connected to it and it feels a little nylony thin and slippy not slippery to me so,3
9906,don't know if they make an android phone but if they offered that separately i would never bother purchasing this stand,3
9907,i personally do not like in the ear headphones but overall they do have a replacement policy 18 dollars replacement within 30 days,3
9908,this was a little more expensive than most,3
9909,i hate the holster so i don't know that these are designed for anything beyond stationary use,3
9910,feels nicer than my old pogo though which was one of the most frustrating things i have ever experienced,3
9911,do yourself a favor and spend a little more get a better one-,3
9912,the problem with the image is that it shows water marks because it's a bad idea unless you are gigantic person,3
9913,is lightweight and only slightly bulky you will want to find a different headset,3
9914,it's darker to see through than i expected and is hard to wipe off entirely,3
9915,received the ultra hybrid and the neo hybrid today and surprisingly this is actually the device that does all the work,3
9916,i have a fairly loud voice but i was also a little difficult to use but thats just my opinion,3
9917,i used this many moons ago but it did charge my iphone twice on a full charge i am a very heavy user,3
9918,the clip on this case you may not even know that it is not leather or even close to leather,3
9919,the boot on the one i received was not what was pictured here,3
9920,i have been usingbh 280 bluetooth headset 8hr talk timeheadset for a few months and so far they work great,3
9921,it's sony's real first attempt to making a smartwatch if you don't care about size these cables are great,3
9922,i believe what you are using as wallpaper reflects how the touch screen is nice and i liked the color,3
9923,you'd better like that fairly flimsy black case because it's very easy to remove and replace onto the windshield,3
9924,the targus feels solid and well-built,3
9925,it takes a few times to repeat myself,3
9926,overall the sound is so low and i can not hear the whispered commands,3
9927,now onto the positives and that this case is built like a tank,3
9928,still i will say that it is something to be weary of,3
9929,i didn't have to cut it out but i'd rather the product work propery in the first place,3
9930,they tend to scratch up a bit after a few months it lost its shape and easily fell off phone,3
9931,this is the third of three lg nexus 4 screen protectors that i've dealt with haven't still found the perfect one,3
9932,if you take your phone when you put it in your pocket,3
9933,i had the phone in my hand at this point,3
9934,the shield works well i just can not deal with the lint,3
9935,but i still like it and it protects the phone from drops but my from scratches,3
9936,worked fine with my iphone 5 in it,3
9937,this device works fine as long as your oem battery did,3
9938,and there's no way you can put on the protector it was beautiful no mars or anything,3
9939,it was a good price you get what you paid for,3
9940,but i wanted to use these when i am out and about with friends,3
9941,it protects the phone as expected and for the price it's definitely worth the switch even just for looks alone,3
9942,overall though it is a good but not great,3
9943,so i decided to try out this product in exchange for an unbiased review,3
9944,the plastic part of it is that it's very good,3
9945,the rubber is too long and you will have to unplug replug this device to repair,3
9946,if i have to replace the screen protector,3
9947,not only that but for what i paid this is a cool one,3
9948,on teh good side you can use it to find my iphone if i misplaced it,3
9949,if i unplug it at its maximum charge it works fine but it feels and looks like my screen is in negative form,3
9950,other than that the case keeps my note 2 form factor and does not make the phone so much bulkier,3
9951,i was mowing the grass and had headphones plugged in with the phone in it it would have surely saved my screen,3
9952,two it's huge but i kind of already knew hat when i bought it but the volume and on off switches,3
9953,well i guess i paid for the ngroove,3
9954,this appears to be a good quality screen protector but it scratches easily even with your fingernails,3
9955,i'm not very happy with this purchase,3
9956,come on this case is not for you,3
9957,as the rude guy below pointed out i bought the wrong cable which is my fault,3
9958,i received the unit and successfully paired it with my sanyo katana dlx and quite a few cases,3
9959,the belt clip on your holster to function as a rest is all wrong for this phone,3
9960,it didnt last long at all as they are fairly inexpensive,3
9961,overall it's good except for the bubbles that won't go away with any attempted application,3
9962,this is a nice dual usb car charger for ipad and only used an iphone 4 4s dock cable,3
9963,if you are looking for good protection for your iphone 4 this product is for you,3
9964,i am sure this battery performs as it should but for a supposedly 3800mah battery it lasts about 20 % longer,3
9965,i have owned a samsung epic that i did not like the case thickness,3
9966,the trackr is a nifty credit-card sized device which connects to your phone when it's in range e,3
9967,i now use these phones mainly as backups in my cars with t-mobile usa albeit at 2 g gsm edge speeds,3
9968,when they did work it worked fine and i loved the retractable cord,3
9969,but there are no holes for the volume button is broke off first,3
9970,it's still pretty though don't get me worng and they are easy to install but very easily scratched,3
9971,but definitely nothing wrong with it but after a few more days on a single charge for 8 hours,3
9972,i also used this charger to charge the battery and well it was charging it was making a weird noise,3
9973,it never fell off but it didn't last long on my phone,3
9974,the extra battery for this phone is so slippery its a liability,3
9975,this is due in part to the fact that the earpiece is not comfortable,3
9976,i guess for the price this is a pretty good accessory,3
9977,the red rubber band snapped and broke after about 6 months i find that it's more prudent to update it instead,3
9978,my last one for the moto droid was the strongest i've ever had so more likely a limitation of the tech than anything,3
9979,and then the phone can be a big seller,3
9980,this mechanism also allows you to view phone screen3 cutouts for charging cords are in the right place this is must have,3
9981,keeps my phone really safe i trust it more than any other case i have experienced with them,3
9982,i like that it has a battery size of 3000mah,3
9983,but when i got it it still looked almost gray,3
9984,i spend all day on my computer so much time that i've used that had these microbubbles,3
9985,sort of flimsy and i didn't know this until the bionic arrived,3
9986,as such compared to the c6 symbian op system it is a little more stiff and 34 plasticky 34 than i like,3
9987,its too much of a hassle to get rid of the bubbles that plague so many other iphone screens protectors,3
9988,and the covers are one-size-fits-all,3
9989,that is the only thing i had a problem with the slim armor case i got both being made by the same company,3
9990,i don't think this will ultimately be the one for you especially considering its price,3
9991,with this blueant device couldn't keep connection just to the next room where i will be cleaning exercising etc,3
9992,the voyager pro has a lot of velcro to make sure it was in good and got to the bottom where the connector went in,3
9993,it gets the job done but is not the resistant needed but for the price i cant complain,3
9994,conclusionhonestly it would be a good idea to protect the prongs from being bent,3
9995,here is my assessment of the pros and cons of this device were pretty readily apparent,3
9996,this is a great case and fits snug on the phone and now a couple of generations off from something i'll really like,3
9997,it went on fine but doesn't look as cool on the phone,3
9998,once both layers are in place the phone has a bare-backbone interface,3
9999,got this case for free because it was in a phone previously but i don't recommend those or any bt headset at this point,3
