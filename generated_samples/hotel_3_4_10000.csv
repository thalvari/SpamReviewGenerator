0,i will probably try another marriott in the area next time i will stay at one of those,3
1,the elevator still doesn't work and they could not fix it,3
2,we chose to stay at 40 berkley was due to the inexperience and inefficiency of the desk personnel,3
3,didn't try the pizzas which make up half of the restaurant and you had to drive around town to make connections,3
4,i returned late in the evening around midnight,3

7,we stayed in a room with 2 queen beds a nice,3
8,shower was ok it had an old television and the remote did not work and the desk person could not fix it,3
9,this was only a place to stay for the price and location it was worth it,3
10,we were only there for a night to attend an event about 20 miles away,3
11,no coffee tea making facilities in the room would have been more compelling but,3
12,the hotel is old but it really needs to be renovated but it was very clean,3
13,while i was happy to see a brand new bed in our room and walk-in closet coffee in the lobby,3
14,nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people,3
15,other hotels in the area as it is a tourist area,3
16,inside the room it was a good place to stay if you enjoy pleasant walks,3
17,i was there for a week and i stayed at this place years ago and really enjoyed our stay,3
18,we were not given the type of room you are requesting with the hotel,3
19,they printed directions for us as we simply needed a place to sllep,3
20,not value for money and not what you would expect from an older ramada,3
21,we did not find the room as clean as i would have liked,3
22,i'll look for a better value the next time i am back to the area,3
23,website for this hotel is deceiving in that it depicts that the hotel is basic yet comfortable for a night or two,3
24,key cards didn't work and i could not smell it inside my room,3
25,i will not book through expedia again and probably won't stay here again even though in all other respects everything was fine,3
26,i travel frequently to the us and i like to stay in the busy town area and wanted some quiet,3
27,the room was way outdated and the shower head was so low that i hit my eye on it while rinsing,3
28,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
29,this must be a different toom the design of the hotel and the personality of the housekeeper for our area,3
30,we were tired from traveling all day and needed a pet friendly option and this modest motel filled the bill,3
31,the food was great as was the people in the room next door if it was family,3
32,hotel is nice and clean but there was no signal in our room,3
33,the room was clean but the dressing area was disgusting i didn't even think to ask but he did,3
34,hotel was ok just about all the staff did a good job every day,3
35,other than the smell of the room and bathroom was clean,3
36,our toilet leaked so there was a lot of noise in this hotel,3
37,the bartender was very nice and we had a comfortable room,3
38,the staff that did try and make up for it by putting us in a parlor suite,3
39,i arrived and no one was there and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks,3
40,the woman who checked us in was extremely helpful with all my extra requests thank you,3
41,but overall a good stay but the pool is very nice and talkative which is great,3
42,it was just a stop over on our way out west,3
43,the free parking in boston is a huge plus but the lack of cleanliness was my biggest gripe,3
44,not value for money and not what you would expected from a nice hotel,3
45,i couldn't tell any difference from what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
46,would've been a nice place for a nice price,3
47,i left behind my cane called the motel and they were very short to get off the phone,3
48,rooms were clean and the room size was great for the kids,3
49,bed was comfortable and the staff is great and the room was ok but my advise is don't stay on the mattress,3
50,when we checked in was super nice and location was perfect,3
51,both elevators are also old and need to be refreshed in many ways,3
52,the floors were disgusting rarely vacuumed and i don't think there is anything standing out for this hotel,3
53,the hotel was located pretty central the breakfast was lackluster room was just ok and worked out for a one night stay for us,3
54,i asked why and they told me you have to pay 50,3
55,we are happy you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
56,the restaurant attached to the hotel is in the process of renovating the lobby area,3

61,we could not get a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
62,pool was dated as well as the chico state campus,3
63,the cabin was amazing and check-in out was efficient,3
64,there were many many yappy dogs early in the morning and kept going indicating the rooms were empty,3
65,was in town visiting family i was disappointed in the space compared to the price,3
66,we arrived late and asked the front desk to ask for,3
67,i thought for the price of 130 for the night this hotel will work,3
68,we reserved a non-smoking room which they didn't want to spend a lot of time waiting and riding or walking long distances,3
69,that did not happen and i had to call and wait an hour to get the person in front of me,3
70,stayed here because it was close to where i could walk my lab,3
71,i've stayed here 3 times and all 3 units seem to be for pets very pet friendly,3
72,we reserved a queen but i think they put us in a room with two double beds,3
73,the signal for the free wifi was not very good and only cost 7,3
74,we could not even have a cup of coffee and enjoyed warm oatmeal with brown sugar raisins and cream delicious,3
75,but this extended stay is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
76,the room was decent and the staff was friendly and the room was surprisingly comfortable though we spent little time in it,3
77,bathroom was clean but there were hardly enough towels provided and they were very short to get off the phone,3
78,needs remodeling set up was not conducive for a good night's rest and continued our trip the next day,3
79,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids,3
80,the stay was ok the room was clean had a nice tv and refrigerator,3
81,floors were beyond disgusting wear shoes at all times and the bed linens were clean as were the bathroom and towels,3
82,was a good place to stay for a night or two that's all you need,3
83,make sure you confirm the type of room we reserved disappointing,3
84,easily able to walk to fishermans wharf and many great restaurants that are relatively close 1 mile or so,3
85,it is in a great location and close to family,3
86,not the greatest hotel in the world but it was clean and the staff did a good job of it,3
87,the housekeepers are lazy but the front desk was very helpful,3
88,he eventually clarified that since i had booked a room with one bed and one room with two,3
89,it was well located clean and met our needs for a place to crash but don't expect the service to wow you,3
90,this hotel is great for location to the convention center and 3-4 blocks from the beach,3
91,the cabin was nice but the pool was super dirty,3
92,i have stayed in numerous other lq locations in the past so was surprised by the comfort,3
93,i would definitely ask for a room away from the highway i think it would be petty to bash,3
94,however there was one employee a woman at front desk when i checked in the desk clerk was very friendly,3
95,the room looked like it had been vacuumed,3
96,good location near i-81 but not noisy and since it is at the end of the halls where we were put,3
97,very clean and within walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
98,when i needed quarters for their own coin operated laundry i had to leave earlier than expected due to an emergency at home,3
99,my wife said she could even hear the couple in the room next to ours she invited us to see inside,3
100,this is a hotel so you have to walk a couple blocks from here,3
101,although i did find it a little expensive for what it is and what it offers,3
102,having said that there are some drawbacks there is no coffee maker in room but motel coffee is in the breakfast room till 7 am,3
103,so over all it was not a problem,3
104,we saw this hotel on trip advisor so here it is,3
105,both elevators are also old and need to be brought up to the condition of the hotel,3
106,beds were a little hard and the pillows were fairly poor also,3
107,front desk had someone but food drinks were not open early enough for me and i'm not picky,3
108,it's location is good and the lobby is no exception,3
109,the rooms don't have any real complaints staying here,3
110,offenbach is not a nice hotel but not friendly,3
111,hotel was an older building carpet in the room was not clean the gold fish we had requested came hours,3
112,this the third time in the last month i've stayed at the campus inn several times on duck football weekends,3
113,clean room great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
114,it isn't the easiest getting in to and out of due to its location and that's what i was after,3
115,it was comfortable and the shower worked great,3
116,we asked front desk to switch us and got a room on a lower floor and there was a strong odor of cat urine,3
117,if you have no other option then it's alright to spend a night at alamosa after visiting great sand dune,3
118,the only issue was the ice machine on the third floor which i could tell had not,3
119,the gentleman at the front desk nathan that my room with a king bed and no closet,3
120,there was a lot of noise kids running in the halls all night and early morning,3
121,the desk clerk was very nice and attentive,3
122,on the bright side the fitness center was better than most places we have stayed even though it was already pre paid via expedia,3
123,i went to branson for 4th of july so there were very few guests at all so not sure why the short memory,3
124,it was surprisingly quiet area must say i was surprised by the lack of items in the room needed attention,3
125,the hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful considering there were no rooms available for all three nights,3
126,it was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and leave it parked there,3
127,so i was already paying more than i should for an establishment that did not earn that value,3
128,it was clean for the most part we enjoyed our stay,3
129,the ice machine was broken a towel from a previous guest on the shower curtain,3
130,but room was adequate although there was a small roach in the bathroom and one in the bedroom,3
131,we spent four nights in this hotel over a saturday,3
132,my only suggestion to the hotel is convenient to the interstate,3
133,40 berkeley is a very good location in the glen,3
134,it took me more than an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet,3
135,the night staff was very nice and brought batteries on request,3
136,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was too tiny for the room,3
137,stayed here because it was close to the interstate and everything in the room look really old,3
138,the whirlpool jets were so terrible that it was hard to move around the parking lot and supplies in the hallway,3
139,yes there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it to make sure no one could get in,3
140,no pastries no toast and the juice machine did not work and i didn't know it till the next morning at check out,3
141,the room was clean but the mattress of the king sized bed was comfortable and the room was clean the beds okay,3
142,the bed felt as if i was given the bottom of the bathtub also looked very dirty,3
143,recommend you spend the money for a night i didn't need much,3
144,resort staff was very nice however we booked a room for a weekend in a couple weeks,3
145,the staff and accommodations were nice but we found ants in our room,3
146,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was easily seen from everywhere in the room,3
147,there was a refrigerator and microwave and a quiet air conditioner,3
148,i didn't like the soap shampoo n conditioner and the pool was closed and the detours were not clearly marked,3
149,but room was adequate although there was a small refrigerator to store our wine,3
150,so josh offered to print for me then asked if i wanted an accesible bathroom upon arrival,3
151,it crosses the street about 200 yards from the hotel and you could always order in,3
152,it was well located clean and met our needs for a place to crash but that is about it,3
153,the pictures from the website made the room seem more clean and modern,3
154,the second night i stayed i was in a room that was described as facing the walmart parking lot,3
155,the pool area was nice but they didn't have a nice feel so moved to a room with 2 queen size beds were comfortable,3
156,it needs renovations but the room was nice and clean not much different than a room at lumiere,3
157,if you need a bed close to the airport which was a plus,3
158,we had an event at metlife stadium and chose this hotel because it is the only one in kingston that is decant,3
159,but the sheraton offenbach hotel is an older hotel with fresh looking carpeting but the hotel is in a great location and close to family,3
160,line at check-in was quick but i had to ask for some basic things,3
161,it was ok for a one night stay it was fine,3
162,it was a great room for staying the night and hanging out at the pool but surprisingly fri was quieter,3
163,if you're looking for a nice looking room go elsewhere,3
164,the club car is nice but the staff was very nice and the bathrooms were clean,3
165,we had a c issues at 3:30 am and it woke us up every time it cycled on and off,3
166,i had to call and wait an hour to get there just follow the signs and the mosiac art,3
167,would have been happier had they provided some sort of breakfast would be available,3
168,this hotel is what you would expect from a comfort inn,3
169,the room was clean and the free breakfast wasn't a good selection,3
170,just messed the morning plans as i wasn't going anywhere at 3:30 am so we slept with the window opened,3
171,the back of the hotel in either direction,3
172,clean room great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
173,no hairdryer in the room but overall it was a good but not great hotel experience,3
174,it was a good place to stay if you enjoy pleasant walks,3
175,u can't ask to be at a game at the stadium by 5p,3
176,hotel and staff were excellent but the walls are so thin we heard every word and were awakened,3
177,the roof top garden gives you magnificent views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
178,when i went down for the continental breakfast at 7 am only to find they were out of it,3
179,i called them was told a shampoo dispenser was damaged the room smelled of it clean towels did and so did the bedding,3
180,all in all it was a great exorbitance half the price,3
181,breakfast was nice and they are pet friendly up to 85 pounds i believe,3
182,not sure i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks it's worth it,3
183,we were so happy we had been able to match my name i d to a reservation,3
184,i was not impressed with the complementary breakfast,3
185,i'm torn about vista hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub were out of order,3
186,we stayed at this resort overnight as we didn't want an expensive hotel as we were there only for a quick night's stay,3
187,this was not as pleasant as i am used to sleeping in a softer bed i slept ok,3
188,the condo resort is in a great location the staff was very friendly,3
189,in the room itself the bath towels were rough and hard there was enough toilet paper for one use,3
190,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a plunger we were surprised that nobody offered assistance,3
191,the wifi is sub par to say the least and some of the rooms have a refrigerator and some don't,3
192,the breakfast was good but the pool was very pretty and the food good,3
193,the front desk clerk was very nice and bed comfortable,3
194,also when we told the front desk and they took care of it v,3
195,there were fairly large cracks in the walls and scratches on the tub,3
196,with it true but it doesn't hold enough so we had to trek up two flights of stairs that was the worst part,3
197,clean and convenient but the rooms are a little run downed,3
198,we like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn t like the dark entrance and wondered what it was hiding,3
199,the room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and fridge in the room,3
200,however the hotel is old and outdated but it was clean,3
201,i returned late in the evening and the room service is poor,3
202,really the only con was the a c unit in the room barely,3
203,also there was not a lot of choice for breakfast,3
204,the hotel was clean and very comfortable,3
205,we spent one night in this hotel and that's unfortunate,3
206,we felt safe and close to everything we wanted to do was shower and sleep,3
207,but it was clean and the beds were dirty so we had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves,3
208,i neglected to note there was no elevator so pack light or be prepared to go into salou every evening,3
209,front desk lady was nice and helpful the room was ok getting to it was another matter,3
210,we previously stayed at the hotel for one night before heading into st,3
211,the second night i stayed i was in a bit of shock when we saw it as we wondered if the,3
212,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about this place is the staff,3
213,first they don't have a room for you your mate for couple of nights this is it,3
214,the location is iffy i would not go walking without my husband,3
215,i strongly suggest not staying at this hotel if you're looking for a hotel to stay the night,3
216,we originally planned 2 nights for our family of four the room was small and there is not enough parking,3
217,we booked this hostel because it was the end of the building nearest a large truck parking area,3
218,room was clean and the beds were dirty so we had to wait a good 30 minutes to check out,3
219,room was clean and the staff was accommodating and friendly,3
220,staff were friendly but the front desk clerks are super nice,3
221,just to have a place to stay for a night on business basic but was ok,3
222,barely room to walk between the bed and i kept stepping in it,3
223,one suggestion we have is that the bed was pretty comfortable and clean,3
224,all and all i might stay there again but not for a long vacation,3
225,overall i'd say it's a good hotel recommend it,3
226,booked this hotel because i just wanted a quiet comfortable place to sleep that was close to i-15 and inexpensive but clean,3
227,i will choose this again next time i'm that way,3
228,i think they could step it up just a bit considering the price you pay you would expect a little more,3
229,we have stayed at this hotel because it was the only one with a key to acess the towels,3
230,it is not walking distance to beach and almost right next door to it just in case your kids need something better for breakfast,3
231,then the room was not cleaned or towels replaced but we found out the pool was not open,3
232,my only complaint was that there was no fridge in the room which was handy,3
233,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
234,our friends had no closet bar to hang clothes and had the same problem with all but one,3
235,surprisingly good for the price and location,3
236,breakfast was pretty basic but the staff was very courteous helpful for that reason alone i,3
237,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was stiff and had springs poking me in the back,3
238,the sheets are clean and the bathroom was above average in size but we did have a problem with got way to hot,3
239,there was nothing spectacular about the room but it was booked for the festival on friday,3
240,called the front desk and the check in process was efficient and friendly,3
241,the room was cheap which was good but i wish we would have looked more at the b w at the convention center,3
242,no mention of this anywhere the breakfast selection was poor but the fruit was fresh,3
243,a decent hotel for the price and convenience quite nice,3
244,but the guy at the front desk and they took care of it v,3
245,the man at the front desk in the morning and the lovely waitress working it,3
246,on a positive note my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was easy to find but could use some more counter space,3
247,pets are accepted but there is no elevator in or near the lobby,3
248,other than that the location was good and the ladies were really nice who did the breakfast,3
249,it was a nice experience we were in a room we needed as a family,3
250,the hotel was just okay needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose,3
251,it is a hostel so obviously it's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh,3
252,however we had a room in the courtyard,3
253,the air conditioner did not function properly in the room and there were no complimentary shampoo or conditioner,3
254,the hotel itself is in dire need of a place to stay for a reasonable price,3
255,room is noisy since it is right off the highway so it was quieter,3
256,the food at the restaurant was very good,3
257,my fianc and i stayed here for the river rock weekend,3
258,what i couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and bathroom walls had hair dye on them,3
259,we did ask for a smoking room so we bucked up and stayed the night,3
260,very poor layout there is another chair at the opposite end of the area i'd be hanging out,3
261,target is across the road from miejers,3
262,nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people,3
263,finally got tired of it at 11 pm and called the front desk and explained that their were no knobs to turn,3
264,most unusual style of shower that i've never seen a jacuzzi tub stuck in the room like an after thought,3
265,i certainly don't have any more rooms,3
266,there was some hair on the floor of the room,3
267,we only used hj for an overnight stay but wouldn't want to stay longer than a night or two,3
268,we literally couldn't drive anymore so we needed to book a hotel and it is simply not as good as it got,3
269,the first day at the loby they tried to charge us for our stay after we had already paid,3
270,think this is one of the better motels in lagrange,3
271,hotel staff were very nice but the air conditioning was really hard to control it was either freezing or off,3
272,it was very pet friendly but i would not recommend to a friend without the caveats i have mentioned,3
273,views were very nice and it had a grainy picture,3
274,we also had the restaurant and the food was ok,3
275,the hotel itself or should i say tried to eat,3
276,on the plus side rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
277,location is about as good as it could have been a little cleaner,3
278,the hotel admitted it was not a great solution particularly for the cost,3
279,this hotel isn't a bad option for a quick overnight and this fit the bill,3
280,the hotel itself was very nice and the location was easy to find but there is not much social activity for the evening,3
281,i defiantly got what i paid for in the first place,3
282,one of the lamps next to the bed were not working at all,3
283,no frills so if you need a quick one night stay,3
284,we asked thedesk personell and she told us they were broken so we had to park in the fire lanes,3
285,we always try to stay at another hotel across the freeway it was full,3
286,at the time we arrived it was raining and the quality inn popped up,3
287,with the king sized bed and the desk and table it was a little noisey from the cars parking and the people staying above me,3
288,the views were really nice and helped me to find another hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there,3
289,the internet at the hotel is great for a three star price and you won't be sorry,3
290,but again it was a quick overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
291,the first room i was given had not been cleaned ants were crawling in the windows and the service was friendly and pleasant,3
292,the area the hotel is located on the grounds with an outback steak house,3
293,overall i feel i got what i paid for in the first place,3
294,but this extended stay is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
295,the combined parking facilities total 3 were good enough and it was very cold drafty,3
296,the a c didn't work and i could not smell it inside my room,3
297,thin walls no exercise facility and you can't beat this location for value,3
298,i would definitely not go there again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
299,location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to even swim on our family vacation,3
300,location is about as good as it could have been,3
301,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are bothered by traffic noise request a room in the upper floors breathtaking sight,3
302,it was not a real inconvenience to me for everybody was very pleasant and helpful but the poor mattress really messed my sleep,3
303,honestly we were expecting more than that but it was a weekend it wasn't able to be fixed,3
304,for example almost had to convince the front desk to ask about our room which wasn't the case for others,3
305,the location of this hotel is its location,3
306,pool bar open only for a few hours in the morning,3
307,the guy who checked us in on friday was very nice and brought batteries on request,3
308,booked online showed up and was given a double queen room with a sleeper sofa,3
309,a little high priced but these days what can you expect a chef on hand with a omelet bar would be sweet,3
310,other than that we were very satisfied with the room and location of the hotel and there is a bench to do so,3
311,the free wifi was not very good and only cost 7,3
312,and hung up on me the second time i have stayed at howard johnson,3
313,i see that the hotel is located on the grounds with an outback steak house,3
314,the hotel lobby was gorgeous and the staff wasn't overly friendly but it was clean,3
315,there was rust spots on the bottom of the shower curtain was falling off and there was a bunch of tagging,3
316,no one told us that the hotel was not the greatest but the customer service was just okay,3
317,got over 100 a night wasn't all that impressed with the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness,3
318,our room was clean and the hotel was conveniently located,3
319,it took the staff two adults an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet,3
320,helpful friendly desk staff for a late check in and had to take a cab from airport which was inconvinient,3
321,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke and outdated color scheme,3
322,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to spend a lot for a room,3
323,regardless i was told that there is a little weird you have to go to the hotel the next week to get corrected,3
324,the door latch on the inside of the room did not smell and clean and that's what i was most concerned about,3
325,we are recovering from back issues after spending the weekend at this hotel as they use dish network,3
326,overall not a bad place to stay when visiting someone from west point,3
327,the staff were very pleasant and accommodating and a good value for the money,3
328,my only complain was they ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't open that early,3
329,came in at the end of the day,3
330,for 50 for 2 ppl i would expect a clean room room without debris on floor,3
331,outside of that the other employees were helpful and nice and it was a good but not great hotel experience,3
332,the place is clean and the beds were super hard and the husband and i had the king bed room with hot tub,3
333,good price for the location pretty bad considering the quality of the stay was the other hotel guests,3
334,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was an older place that had been updated,3
335,i personally did not find the room as clean as i would like,3
336,the room was clean and the employees quite friendly,3
337,checked out at 4:00 am to catch an early morning train we couldn't talk to the manager,3
338,the air conditioner was very loud and spoke to the front desk about it,3
339,i was in town for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel,3
340,there was dust on top of the sink in the room had a very strong musty smell that i believe come from the air conditioners,3
341,the hotel was still under construction at the time of booking,3
342,also there are no restaurants to eat at unless you want to eat every meal at mcd,3
343,this the third time in the last month i've stayed at a lot of hotels cheap pricey,3
344,on our second night they did get us back in a room with a queen or king size bed as opposed to two doubles,3
345,overall not too bad though if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills,3
346,the bedroom was pretty good and so was the pool area very poor with jacuzzi closed off with tape,3
347,there's only one person working the front desk and he and everyone there did it with a smile,3
348,the hotel itself is extremely run down and is in desperate need of a lick of paint on the outside,3
349,that said location is good and the room was immaculately clean,3
350,staff lovely helpful people can you ask for anymore hotel a little dated but clean and the beds were very comfortable,3
351,we were given the wrong information about the breakfast time and we were not asked when we checked in and clean rooms,3
352,hotel aura advertises itself as having everything you'd expect from a motel 8 perfectly priced for what we needed,3
353,it was also fairly quiet considering the place was full and we had a double occupancy with a terrace overlooking a small canal,3
354,knights inn was located very close to where i needed to go but still pleasantly quiet room,3
355,the guy that checked us out in the morning we were awoken by the housecleaning staff barging into our room,3
356,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue,3
357,but flat screen tv in the room in fact the bed was comfortable,3
358,the issue i had was they double charged my credit card 225 for service deposit,3
359,it was ok because there was a starbucks n stores right across the street is a lovely setting for a walk or run,3
360,clean rustic place with a weird heated pool in the basement was dark and really creepy,3
361,the hotel was in a cute town and super close to downtown indianapolis motor speedway lucas oil stadium etc,3
362,needs a little improvement when it comes to the florida keys,3
363,i think i will be going back there next year,3
364,i thought for the price of the hotel reflects that,3
365,they were doing construction and when i called the front desk to ask about our room which wasn't the hotel's fault,3
366,my issues with this place are that there was no coffee pot in the room,3
367,the staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful even just passing in the hallway,3
368,the hotel is located right off the highway which was convenient for us,3
369,for 210 night the room was not very clean but i always wear shoes in hotels anyway,3
370,we did back up the truck a few stalls from the entrance and within walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
371,we were not going to be in the dining area,3
372,room was good enough for a short one night stay on a trip to walt disney world,3
373,it was close to the highway and downtown newburgh,3
374,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
375,there's a liquor around the corner and a gas station with a jack in the box thrown in for good measure,3
376,they are renovating the new rooms are very nice and the staff was friendly,3
377,the hotel is very close to disney parks,3
378,took about an hour for the room to warm well after midnight,3
379,make a casino clear path to the lobby and there was a little bit of effort it could look alot better,3
380,it was ok the carpet wasn't clean it all,3
381,hotel was fine and the bed was very comfortable,3
382,my room was not cleaned on a regular basis and appeared to be very disorganized,3
383,the service and the food was very good,3
384,although the people who worked there were nice we will not be using this company any more,3
385,and when i came back it was open but the hot tub was way too hot,3
386,the room was comfortable and the room was fine but the amount of noise in the room was quite small,3
387,the nice thing is that you are also close to the convention center and the beach,3
388,when we first got to the room there was water in the bathroom there is a drain on the floor and it smells bad,3
389,the king size bed takes up most of the room so the other queen bed couldn't see the tv that well,3
390,breakfast was nice and the staff was very friendly and service oriented they are what keep us coming back,3
391,the bed is as hard as a rock the room was small but included updated furnishings and a very large screen television,3
392,i liked that it was in walking distance to places to eat,3
393,i had to stay at the sleep inn also a choice hotel but it was the wall plug that didn't work,3
394,except this trip they were other guest 5 to 6 in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style,3
395,just spent one night but it was a nice facility nice room and accommodation,3
396,it was also convenient to the interstate and resulted in a somewhat noisy room,3
397,i returned late in the evening and the room service is poor,3
398,the cabin was amazing and check-in and check-out procedure was quick and painless,3
399,it's a great place to stay if ur just wanting a quick place to sleep for a norseman who are used to colder bedrooms,3
400,breakfast was a voucher for mcdonald's which is right next door and has the best hawaiian food around,3
401,rooms are comfortable staff at reception were friendly and helpful,3
402,the room was okay but one of the least expensive for the area,3
403,the room was tiny but it was clean and everything in it worked,3
404,in addition there is room for a chair in the room was dirty and had tear,3
405,best western of long beach is in a older section of town directly across from a public transportation train stop,3
406,a regular type dining chair was in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing,3
407,for the price i would have to go elsewhere for food,3
408,no pool was a bumner and the customer service was great room was satisfactory awful view from window,3
409,warning that you only get 2 small bars of soap and no shampoo or soap only one chair thanks tom beaudet,3
410,upon arrival we were told that this was a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
411,the latter was especially frustrating because i was trying to get into the martin mason,3
412,we used the indoor pool for a short time breakfast was very good,3
413,the breakfast they offer was decent and the dining room was ok,3
414,not very clean to say the least and some of the staff are not professional at all,3
415,we rented a room with a king sized bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good,3
416,but the beds are too small the water in the area has a brown tint,3
417,it's an ok place to rest your head thats in a great location to see the city of boston,3
418,it was pretty comfortable but the walls are very thin and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway,3
419,but again it was a quick overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
420,i was very surprised that there was not a micro fridge or microwave in the room,3
421,the free parking in boston is expensive subway,3
422,we and booked this hotel because it had free breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
423,good place for a quick stop over the hotel was fine for the price and location,3
424,the location was fantastic with lots of shopping restaurants in walking distance,3
425,this hotel is no longer a country inn and suites brand cause we had stayed there many times before with out these problems,3
426,the hotel is fine but don't go expecting courteous service,3
427,friendly staff when we checked in and there was no one at the front desk nathan that my room with a king bed,3
428,all in all it was a nice hotel close to my final destination from this location,3
429,i had a smoking room and received a non smoking room it smelled terribly of stale smoke,3
430,i bought one with the hot tub i know it was a timeshare with a check out time 10 am,3
431,we pre-arrnged to have our room either on the first floor since this hotel did not have any problem in our room,3
432,the decor of the hotel is under major renovation,3
433,just in time as we flew to get on the treadmill several times between,3
434,they attempted to resolve some issues we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged,3
435,rooms are comfortable staff at reception were friendly and helpful,3
436,we truly thought we walked into the lobby we were greeted with the stink emanating from somewhere,3
437,the place is ok a little old but good for a room and a bed i can sleep in,3
438,2 the location is convenient to the interstate and resulted in a somewhat noisy room,3
439,their breakfast is offered in the form of an apple pear and orange,3
440,that smell seeps into all areas of the hotel and the lot was flooded ankle deep in some places,3
441,people had toddlers in the hot tub floating on the bubbles,3
442,the staff moved us to a upgraded room,3
443,the neighborhood is nice and there was a clump of hair in the pool,3
444,stayed here for business and it was good and came super fast,3
445,air conditioning in room 114was so loud that i couldn't even bite through it,3
446,stay away from this hotel if you have any problems talk to claudette,3
447,room was quite comfortable and the room was very expensive for that class of a hotel,3
448,the hotel was pretty quite even though it's next to the train tracks so you heard trains all night long,3
449,the rooms were nice and large with a small kitchen which i didn't ask for the correct room,3
450,it took me more than an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet,3
451,there are no restaurants to eat at unless you want to eat every meal at mcd,3
452,cleanliness is an issue from the dried food on the outside of the hotel is smash burger and their olive oil and basil french fries,3
453,location was in a business center which was nice and quiet and the bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good also,3
454,except this trip they were other guest 5 to 6 in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style,3
455,this the third time in the last month i've stayed at harrah's before and i had a good visit,3
456,we did make use of the pool a couple of times-reasonable price quick service food not bad,3
457,the hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of restaurants near the hotel and it was close to airport,3
458,we visited alexandria va over the 4th of july we didn't want to spend waterfront money,3
459,i dreaded getting out of the room and the channels on the tv were cloudy or fuzzy and the breakfast was ok,3
460,the room was small and a bit worn it was clean and i do have to sya this was fixed prior to my departure,3
461,the room was clean the decor was eclectic the location was great because there was a long wait,3
462,it was nice that there was a lot of noise from the highway all night long,3
463,i love the design of the hotel and parking lot is in decline,3
464,must have been a sealing problem at the base of the toilet which gave the bathroom a very bad look,3
465,but the light on top of the sink in the room had a strange smell,3
466,breakfast was decent and all day coffee and tea is a nice touch but then charged without my knowledge for the upgrade,3
467,but very thin walls could hear conversation of people in the lobby drinking beer with additional beer's in coolers around,3
468,on the whole as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but you must remember that you get what u pay for,3
469,an average room for a good price for one night for a softball tournament not a bad spot for just an overnight stay,3
470,in addition there is room for a chair in the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
471,i stayed 1week around germany and this was the worst experience ive ever had,3
472,breakfast was good but staff could not keep up with breakfast and refilling items,3
473,room was nice location but hotel was in need of some improvements,3
474,i was standing at the front desk are happy to help,3
475,i needed a cheap place to stay the night due to weather,3
476,they attempted to resolve some issues we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged,3
477,the hotel is also close to the elevator and we,3
478,although clean i will not stay at the ip again,3

481,my husband and i stayed in was clean but not very tasty,3
482,i mostly booked this hotel because it's pet friendly,3
483,this hotel was ok but very thin walls could hear conversation of people in the lobby drinking beer with additional beer's in coolers around,3
484,if you are planning on a one night stay before going to the dessert museum,3
485,on the way out i stopped at the front desk very polite and helpful,3
486,adequate for a night on my way across the country,3
487,upon arrival tv remote was missing and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks,3
488,spare blanket in closet needed for pull out sofa had to be moved and the tv unplugged in order to use it,3
489,booked the room for one night so it was good to have a bell to ring,3
490,the rooms are very nice and the bathrooms were clean,3
491,we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the facility and room,3
492,overall if you need a ride back to the hotel from a 13 hour motorcycle ride,3
493,would have been happier had they provided some sort of breakfast would be available,3
494,the only complaint that i have is that the bathrooms could use more counter space,3
495,i was not impressed with the breakfast food in the morning and was offered an apology,3
496,front desk lady was very polite and helpful answered all our questions,3
497,didn't not supply extra pillows and blankets in the closet,3
498,the rooms are clean and quiet and the bed was very comfortable,3
499,we were staying for three nights and we would definitely stay here again,3
500,this was not as pleasant as i am used to sleeping in a softer bed i slept ok,3
501,we asked thedesk personell and she told us they were broken so we had to change rooms which was a hassle,3
502,when i spoke to the person at the desk in the morning,3
503,not bad for the price but i wouldn't stay there again,3
504,very diasppointing for the cost in comparison to other hotels in this price range kind of hotel but the hotel is clean and well maintained,3
505,shower curtain was damaged and there was a good variety of food,3
506,the lobby and dining area for the price could have had a room away from the tracks,3
507,however upon returning later in the evening i called the hotel to get reception for internet,3
508,all the staff were very friendly and rooms were clean,3
509,it was easy to reach easy to find and if you forgot something near shopping and restaurants,3
510,i was not pleased with our stay at days inn,3
511,the furniture in the rooms were very clean and the ac worked well but a bit noisy,3
512,the hotel was okay for short stays close to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult,3
513,hampton inn did serve a good breakfast and the other hotel allowed some smoking rooms that i have a real problem with,3
514,upon checking in the lady at the desk was very helpful,3
515,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and the fridge was broken,3
516,service could be better concierge didn't give us the wi-fi though free was constantly cutting out and in,3
517,the bathroom small and the pumps in the shower did not drain properly and the water looked like dirty backed up water,3
518,we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the bathroom,3
519,the other hotels in the same location,3
520,the hotel staff came in my room when i first arrived but it was switched to another,3
521,once we found it we were put in a room that had already been renovated,3
522,it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
523,the staff are friendly and it's a nice comfortable hotel,3
524,our room was in the back of the pizza parlor,3
525,this was a one night stay in a small town so we were not expecting much and we were not told at check in,3
526,it looks like a cheap motel but the rooms have what you need fridge microwave coffee maker,3
527,i know that is something they know about because all the rooms have been renovated and everything in the bathroom was pretty bad,3
528,our room was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful everything looked clean but maintenance was below par,3
529,this must be a different toom the design of the hotel and parking lot is in decline,3
530,it feels unfair to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under renovation so there were challenges due to that,3
531,the condo resort is in a great location i would recommend this hotel to everyone we meet,3
532,there were also a lot of naked old men hanging out on the ceiling of the bathroom all weekend also,3
533,the eggs didn't look very appetizing and it was hard to move around the parking lot and not any hills,3
534,that is until one steps off of the elevator on each floor there was no carpet only,3
535,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning so i can't complain too much considering the price,3
536,location was great and the place was clean and i will say i found the bed very comfortable,3
537,the room was clean and the staff was very friendly and accommodating,3
538,on arrival hotel has wow factor our room was basic but clean the bath was dated but clean,3
539,on the other hand was quite pleasant and the staff was nice and,3
540,good hotel for the price and location,3
541,the hotel was nice but the stove partly worked couch is broken and one of the best buffets for the price of the room,3
542,when we arrived we were informed that the coffee pot was inoperative so that we would not have stayed even the first night,3
543,in general this hampton falls short in many areas and i do not know if any rooms do have one,3
544,check-in and check-out could not have been nicer nor tried harder to assist us in,3
545,after reading many reviews we decided to book this hotel for a stop during our move cross-country,3
546,after reading many reviews we decided to book this hotel at the last minute,3
547,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is that we were able to control the temperature in the room no closet,3
548,there was construction going on in front of the grand canal and within walking distance of key shopping dining and beach areas,3
549,however once we got back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
550,my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
551,ok place to stay for a night or two it's not bad,3
552,basic accommodations nothing fancy which is all we really needed for the night,3
553,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning and we literally stayed there from 12 am to 7 am,3
554,room was ok for an overnight stay before a flight,3
555,we probably won't stay here again if the price was right and the location couldn't have been nicer,3
556,i had to wait awhile at the front desk were helpful but could have been better,3
557,this was a last minute stay so i can not complain that there was a printer and computer in the lobby was great,3
558,but front desk was very apologetic and moved us to another room exactly the same but black things were working there,3
559,was going to a baseball game at chase field so we wanted a close hotel that provided free wifi and breakfast,3
560,many rooms face the highway so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue,3
561,no pastries no toast and the juice machine did not work for the entire week we were there,3
562,the staff was friendly one day our room was not up to par,3
563,after a late flight i needed a place to sleep for a norseman who are used to colder bedrooms,3
564,people had toddlers in the hot tub and everything was clean,3
565,hotel is great with the exception of a couple things,3
566,no amenities such as coffee maker in the room and told her the beds had not been made although the towels were replaced,3
567,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
568,but if she wasn't there it would have been nice to at least have a hot 15 min shower,3
569,the hotel met our needs for the night,3
570,this hotel was no frills but the room was and how large it was,3
571,it is located in a great location and close to family,3
572,when we arrived there were several people outside in the parking lot for an hour waiting just for that,3
573,rooms were clean the property was run down and in need of a good nights rest for the the expensive price you will pay,3
574,said its their right told refund within 1-2 kilometres of all the things you might want to consider another place to stay,3
575,there were a lot of children running around the corridors and breakfast was a bit minimal as there were no options for fruit,3
576,that is the nicest thing i can say it's clean in the room but overall it was ok,3
577,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is that it's about 35-45 minutes from downtown austin,3
578,while its in the middle of the day,3
579,the hotel is at the edge of the french quarter,3
580,room was a nice size clean and the tv was too tiny for the room,3
581,but on our stays it was clean and the beds were comfortable,3
582,its a old building and it was still only 63 degrees,3
583,overall the hotel itself was nice the rooms were nice and clean although the beds were definitely small and uncomfortable,3
584,what we liked about the hotel was it was close to universal studios,3
585,however we had a room with a handicap-accessible shower,3
586,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
587,this hotel is under new management again and many of the commerces appeared closed for good which is,3
588,it was a few blocks further away from the beach and an easy location to the highway,3
589,it was fine for a quick overnight stay,3
590,it stormed one night and the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with,3
591,it was a convenient location for our needs is very good,3
592,was very disappointed because the room was at least 85 degrees,3
593,there is a nook in the room which i find criminal,3
594,i wasn't informed until check in that it was just what we needed for our short stay in north platte,3
595,but otherwise it was fine for my needs,3
596,while the room was a bit damp and the air conditioner cycled on and off,3
597,cleanliness of the room could have been cleaner but were ok,3
598,the elevator is extremely small-my husband and i stayed here as a last minute booking the night before our cruise,3
599,the room was adequate pool was very small and not very private,3
600,the rooms were ok but there was no flatware glasses nor kitchen linens,3
601,the room i had reserved wasn't available and they put me in a cab to go to another hotel,3
602,i found out during the night that my room had not been cleaned in a loong time,3
603,i really needed to just get away for a night to attend an event about 20 miles away,3
604,my issues with this place are that there was no mirror outside of the bathroom in the corner had a lot of hairs,3
605,it wasn't about the money more the deception i felt that was slightly early for a weekend morning,3
606,the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there,3
607,the view was grim but i didn't see when making the reservation,3
608,we didn't expect anything special and we didn't see it until we were finished breakfast,3
609,room was nicer than expected but we were expecting what we had experienced before,3
610,the hotel is supposed to be new but it is not a great hotel it is a good value hotel,3
611,the sound carries through that door as if they were in the midst of the rush and could not find a place to sit,3
612,hotel was ok just about all the staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation,3
613,we stayed at this hotel because it was close to the highway for romantic get away,3
614,the staff were all very friendly and helpful and the location was a short drive from st,3
615,we spent one night at the last minute,3
616,room size was good bathroom could have been cleaner there was hair on the floor of the bathroom in the room,3
617,we were given a room that was on the counter either,3
618,breakfast had no coffee and no milk so we had to move rooms from 1st floor to 2nd,3
619,basically a serviceable room at a fairly high price for the room parking and location,3
620,only downside was no elevator so pack light or be prepared to go into salou every evening,3
621,had to call and wait an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet,3
622,i am glad to see you had an excellent stay at our hotel and will be going back to the hotel,3
623,this was my 1st art show in richmond and the hotel was pretty quite even though it's next to a main street,3
624,i rented a room with a king bed,3
625,the bed was very comfortable and the room was acceptable,3
626,definitely not worth 900 for two nights but would stay any longer then that because there was no pool as advertised,3
627,i was on a business trip and i travel often,3
628,i've stayed at a lot of hotels in the area,3
629,was nice but pieces in the wall in the room i stepped on the towel in the bathroom and no place for a night light,3
630,on our way to texas we stopped at this hampton inn and found it very nice,3
631,moreover the expedia rate included transportation to and from the car was nearly impossible,3
632,breakfast had no coffee and no milk so we had to use the hotel room service,3
633,they tried to give us a non-smoking room,3
634,it was close to the interstate and everything in the bathroom was not super clean,3
635,timeshares agents are roaming all around in the hotel and the staff was friendly and we checked in before 3:00 pm,3
636,and with the king street trolley you can easily get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
637,would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to stay if you don't have a refrigerator in room,3
638,it was in the 80's during the day and it was close to airport,3
639,the hotel was noisy in the halls and the fridge was a bonus,3
640,location was ok clean room but the front desk was very pleasant and helpful,3
641,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and you could always order in,3
642,my room ac didn't work very good,3
643,this hotel is no longer a country inn and suites that hasn't been updated since the late 90's,3
644,i stayed at this hotel for decadence based on a recommendation and i'm glad that's all we needed on this trip,3
645,when we arrived it was raining and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive,3
646,we had to leave the door open because there aren't any restaurants within walking distance which have decent food,3
647,place is very low cost and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
648,i would definitely ask for a room on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3
649,the bathrooms are small and the place could use a little up dating,3
650,i was gone most of the day so i would say that overall it was a good place to stay,3
651,take care when you book that you are not staying by the beach,3
652,our favorite part was the location-very close to the airport which was a plus,3
653,that being said the hotel is easy to get to from i-81,3
654,1 there was a dead roach in the middle of tourist paradise 15 min,3
655,i think they need to get new towels,3
656,great very friendly staff and one of the receptionists who was also much friendlier,3
657,the charge for two in a room with 2 double full sized beds,3
658,staff was friendly and did help out with some things in our room from the previous occupants coke bottle sock,3
659,my wife and i was climbing the stairs to the ground floor to the 1st floor and the grounds,3
660,that did not happen and i had to sit up for an hour in the middle of times square,3
661,all in all it's good enough for a one or two night stay,3
662,last weekend when we went back to the front desk and got the sheets changed and i immediately posted a bad review,3
663,this is motel on the way to our final vacation destination,3
664,also the hotel is directly next door to the freeway so there is road noise,3
665,hotel was fine and the mattress was very hard and uncomfortable i almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress,3
666,bathroom again a little dated but clean and the staff was pleasant and helpful,3
667,called the front desk and garage had that ghetto feel but the room was clean and spacey just too thin walls,3
668,location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to even swim on our family vacation,3
669,also the check-in process took a long time for the water in the sink to warm up,3
670,the bathroom faucet handle came off in my hand but i was able to find a room that had very recently been smoked in,3
671,the hotel was right off the highway so it was quieter,3
672,it snowed one night and the parking lot had cigarette butts scattered around,3
673,the location was good and the room was very clean with a good shower and comfortable beds,3
674,we have eaten at other concentric restaurants and thought this would be a good location but i think next time we might stay near louisville,3
675,we finally made time to go and it was closed for he whole time we were there,3
676,not great but adequate water pressure in the room and was moved at 3 am was moved to another room w o incident,3
677,the restaurant is too loud and without much of a breeze and the staff were great especially during check in,3
678,continental breakfast was what you would expect 2 queen beds a big tall guy had to sleep on a pull out couch,3
679,besides these 2 things the room was fine the room and clean the breakfast was good and front desk was courteous,3
680,the pool area was ok however the hot tub was incorrect which made turning on the jets confusing,3
681,if you need a place to sleep for the night,3
682,but it was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and work on it,3
683,however once we got back to the hotel on the ground level,3
684,over all it was not a real inconvenience to me for everybody was very pleasant and helpful but the poor mattress really messed my sleep,3
685,although the property shows its and had a few cleanliness issues it was basically a boxed lunch and for the price we paid,3
686,i only had to wait a half hour for the drinks we ordered,3
687,the front desk staff was busy discussing their schedule for christmas and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks,3
688,when we checked in we were told there was a new manager,3
689,but it's done so with a fairly blank face with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it,3
690,good deal breakfast was not great but we were tired and did not get backtill late in the evening and the room service is poor,3
691,overall it is not the ritz carlton but if you are staying just a few nights,3
692,the bathroom was clean but there was nothing stocked in it,3
693,the room was large the bed was very comfortable the staff is very friendly,3
694,it's an average stay for sleep but don't expect much from that kind of place,3
695,but it was great to be close to everything its ideal,3
696,we were there to visit universities in the area and found this one to be more expensive with less offered,3
697,we were there to visit universities in the area and invited my significant other to stay with me,3
698,wifi access coded given upon check in rather than having to call the front desk and management we dealt we were very poor,3
699,i chose this hotel because of the hotel,3
700,i booked this hotel was for an overnight stay when driving to your destination,3
701,everything was okay except that the room smelled musty or moldy,3
702,the first impression is that this is a very old hotel with a fresh coat of paint and some fresh updated wall art,3
703,it was decent for the price and location,3
704,the condo resort is in a great location the staff was very friendly,3
705,the room was clean and there was a carpet runner in the lobby that look to the pool,3
706,walk across the street and meet at the hotel next door which isn't made clear in the listing,3
707,perfect for a quick overnight stay but it's a little old need to upgrade bathrooms,3
708,not even sure why because it was not so far from home when you encounter such a happy staff,3
709,we would stay again if travelling through the area by train,3
710,the breakfast was certainly not the best hotel but the staff is exelente and probebly the best place to stay in santa barbara,3
711,the hairdryer was missing the towels were rough and scratchy and there was leftover beard trimmings on the bathroom sink,3
712,the hotel is fine but don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine,3
713,i would have rated it higher but there was no microwave and we had a double room with a shared bathroom,3
714,i was commuting to dusseldorf each day so it was sweltering at night when we got back 2 hours later,3
715,breakfast was nice fruit make your own waffles was great and the bed was comfy and the climate in the room was inadequate,3
716,could only connect to the wi-fi log in at check in we had to wait again at the front desk was very helpful,3
717,for that i would not stay there for more than a night,3
718,continental breakfast was probably the worst i have ever seen to the dogs barking in the lobby,3
719,i stayed at the holiday inn express branding i would suggest they use a little more care for personal items,3
720,we couldn't stay in the first room was not acceptable,3
721,the outside of the hotel is somewhat dated,3
722,but the staff was very nice and helpful and the breakfast was wonderful with very nice employees taking care the that area,3
723,their breakfast buffet in the morning was kind and efficient,3
724,when we returned to the room to work on it,3
725,service staff were friendly and the place clean,3
726,rooms are dated and front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and the price and location,3
727,clean comfortable nice breakfast in the morning is the usual fare,3
728,we were the only people that ate there that evening there seemed to be something wrong with the card reader on the door,3
729,only about 15 channels on the tv were cloudy or fuzzy and the breakfast was nothing to talk about,3
730,i will go there again for the price,3
731,the hotel itself was quiet and the bed was very soft,3
732,we were outside most of the time so it's not a 4 or 5 star property,3
733,the marina district is a very good location in the middle of things but a warning that it could be very loud,3
734,it appreared there had not been a flag there for some time then got a very unfriendly person,3
735,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to our final vacation destination,3
736,i had a big surprise when i checked in i was given a 7,3
737,the rooms were clean but i will likely try a different hotel when i am in waterville again,3
738,we were looking for a quick getaway for our anniversary the room we were in which is always ni,3
739,there's a little pantry of a place in the shower to lay your soap or to set you shampoo,3
740,i ordered a burger from room service and it was good could have more cable chanels,3
741,shower and bathroom while appeared to be clean and comfortable and the shower had plenty of water and very hot,3
742,the innkeeper is very nice and is huge,3
743,the night staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the room price so i didn't have to pack these,3
744,they attempted to resolve some issues we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged,3
745,the back was nicer as it was on the same switch as the light,3
746,but the walls of the rooms are very nice for the price,3
747,because we were still in our room at 9:30 sunday morning they didn't clean the bathroom or leave us any cups or washcloths,3
748,hotel does not seem to be a factor,3
749,the location is great and the room was comfortable and unoccupied,3
750,the night staff was very nice and the staff was attentive,3
751,it is up on a hill and has a great view if you get a balcony room,3
752,we opened up the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
753,i would definitely ask for a room away from the highway,3
754,the sheets are clean and the bathroom was not clean hair in tub,3
755,the bathroom shower could use updating but other than that it was ok i will stay there again,3
756,our room was not ready when we arrived at 11 am we requested an early check in,3

758,location was great very easy to walk for anything you need,3
759,the room was large the bed was very umcomfortable and somewhat itchy,3
760,it was easy to reach easy to find and if you forgot something near shopping and restaurants,3
761,the team and i appreciate you taking the time to complete an online review your feedback is important to us,3
762,my pillowcases were yellow and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo,3
763,the restaurant attached to the hotel is convenient to the shopping area and restaurants,3
764,but was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the room could have been claner,3
765,dinner portions were medium to what i considered small even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
766,the room rate was higher than you would expect for the price you pay you would expect a little more,3
767,hotels website indicated that a complimentary breakfast was not included as written,3
768,this was a challenge given we were traveling with an assist dog and were made to pay 10,3
769,i've stayed at a lot of hie throughout the u,3
770,rooms are very nice and the breakfast was delicious,3
771,we changed rooms but still the beds are comfortable and there is a charge for breakfast,3

778,i enjoyed having the restaurant in the evening which was a little discomfiting,3
779,my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
780,unless you know the access to the hotel can be difficult to communicate with if you do not speak spanish,3
781,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
782,many other hotels and places to eat so is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities,3
783,when you check into your room be sure to check directly with the hotel and the location is excellent,3
784,a word of advice to other travelers book a room on the 2nd floor had a musty mildewy smell,3
785,this place is very old but well maintained and effectively managed,3

792,bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was great,3
793,the room i had did not have any problem in our room,3
794,it's fine if you just need a place to rest in between a long road trip,3
795,when we entered the initial room we were assigned had not been cleaned,3
796,instead we were given rooms on the second floor facing the front of the,3
797,room was clean but we were disappointed by uncleanliness and lack of housekeeping,3
798,this hotel is located right across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses,3
799,staff was friendly and we got a good nights sleep after driving,3
800,the room was a good size but a little dated,3
801,in addition there is room for a chair in the room was not sufficient to read by but the manager immediately,3

803,in their pool area there was no towels in the pool,3
804,the meal was okay but not very accommodating,3
805,rooms are small if your tall you may want to pass on free breakfast,3
806,it was the cheapest we could find for staying in downtown boston,3
807,no one told us that the hotel was great for the price we paid it was worth it,3
808,it had an old box tv and everything in the room was real wobbly from the legs being loose stains on carpet,3
809,the promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be too friendly towards cash customers,3
810,i wouldn't stay here again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
811,did not like the smell of the room not very nice,3
812,i reported an elevator malfunctioning but i guess it was too late to find a different hotel,3

821,our room upstairs was ok stayed for one night while on mlb tour of the u,3
822,i wouldn't hang out at the hotel bc there is not much social activity for the evening,3
823,bed was hard as a rock the room was small and air conditioner loud,3
824,it looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and the pictures are not reliable,3
825,my coworkers 30 plus guys and i stayed here for pacific university family weekend,3
826,it worked for us but i don't think it was worth the 144,3
827,overall i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks and it was fine for a stop over it was clean but basic,3
828,the cabin was amazing and check-in out was efficient,3
829,had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of you in a polite way,3
830,the staff was polite and accommodating being i was traveling with a very budget conscious group for a conference in town,3

834,the hotel is nice but the staff was the shining moment at least,3
835,my son had to sleep in spare bed,3
836,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't think it was worth the money no,3

842,usually accessible rooms are located in the front of the building and didn't have to wait for the bus,3
843,i called the 1800 to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under major construction,3
844,the hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of restaurants near the hotel and it was close to airport,3
845,very busy breakfast in the morning was okay,3
846,i picked this hotel as it had a pool apon arrival the pool was not available because of maintenance,3
847,friendly staff for the most part clean however just very old reminded me more of a small older condo,3
848,i wold stay again because for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
849,it appreared there had not been a flag there for some time then got a very unfriendly person,3
850,he allowed us to check-in a few hours early,3
851,service was great and we were able to deal with the parking issues associated with the downtown or larger hotels,3
852,finally got tired of it at 11 pm and called the front desk they said they would bring one right down,3
853,room service food was really good but i didn't like was the cleanliness of the bathroom,3

859,that said the rooms are fair at best,3
860,room was very clean and in good shape very comfortable and the pillows just right,3
861,there is a gas station right across the street is westfield valley fair which is a big shopping mall,3
862,then when i asked for a change from king to 2 double beds one sofa bed suite room,3
863,the staff are very friendly and are willing to help you with anything they can,3
864,it was ok but the room had tons of fruit flys,3
865,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
866,the front desk staff was very friendly and got us checked in quickly,3
867,i asked to be moved to another room that had the carpet cleaned and the carpet was torn in places,3
868,then we find out they don't have a room for you,3
869,i am not sure why it hasn't been professionally cleaned in some time,3
870,we were just simply there to sleep the bed was comfy and we got a king with a sofa,3
871,as usual i booked a non smoking room and got a smoking room,3
872,it was nice that it was located very close to where i needed to be,3
873,housekeeping staff was very good and the front desk clerk was very friendly and even got us an early check-in,3
874,we were just getting back to the interstate and cheaper than downtown rooms,3
875,i wold stay again because for the price and close to the expressway,3
876,back bay metro station is just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in branson,3
877,unless you know the access to the hotel can be difficult to communicate with if you do not speak spanish,3
878,staff was very helpful and cleared everything up quickly and got us into a room comparable to what i had requested,3
879,the room was definitely old and the bathroom was not clean hair in tub,3
880,our room upstairs was ok stayed for one night only and felt that it was pricey for the area,3
881,it was a shame that the front desk person was friendly and helpfull,3
882,there is a gas station and very easy access to the highway or i-25 to get me where i needed to be,3
883,hotel was okay room was a little beat up but saved was well spent on fantastic wine,3
884,the location was great very easy to walk to the crosswalk almost get hit,3
885,the only negative was are room was by trash area but i think it can be beat for the price,3
886,however it was not too bad of a mattress it did the trick and was fairly close to a nice shopping dining district,3
887,the view of the water it would be a great place to be,3
888,however on the night i stayed they were having a problem or not but the water was cold,3
889,the condo resort is in a great location the room was small but adequate,3
890,the television in the room was dirty and the towels turned black when i wet them,3
891,there was a issue with our stay the staff was very polite,3
892,there was a issue with our stay the staff was very courteous helpful for that reason alone i,3
893,we rented 2 rooms with double beds in both rooms the beds were very comfortable and the dcor reflective of the marriott,3
894,it was so bad i felt like i was inconveniencing her,3
895,that said it was our first time at lobby,3
896,the rooms are sadly out dated and in need of updating with patched holes scuffed walls a cigarette burn in,3
897,room service breakfast was 30 min late and i had to park at the other end by entrance,3
898,my family of four stayed in a double room with 4 people,3
899,our view was the roof with the sound of the elevator hydraulic pump cycling on and off,3
900,however more generally the hotel is not in a good way,3
901,it was also very disappointing when we went to go sightseeing the door would not latch closed,3
902,i was there for 7 hours and my room was not cleaned or towels replaced but we found out they were short staffed,3
903,could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable pool area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
904,got there and was told they didn't have my reservation when i arrived,3
905,we stayed two different nights and returned after the first night because there were no knobs to turn,3
906,i've stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past so i know what to expect,3
907,the rooms were clean but i will likely try a different hotel when i am in waterville again,3
908,the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and this was a definite plus,3
909,each night i would have to give it a rating it was alright place to lay your head,3
910,no much to choose from in lavonia ga,3
911,it was a pretty decent room and i was able to get us checked-in 2 hours,3
912,rate not cheap but less than many others in the area due to a prior positive experience,3
913,did i stay at the mccamly plaza hotel,3
914,we wanted to stay on the lido again this would be a good choice for a bargain hotel,3
915,i wouldn't hesitate to stay here again but only for the convenience of playing golf in lakeway,3
916,for example almost had to convince the front desk to give me towels for the amount of people there,3
917,also the second room we were given was dark and gloomy didn't have a ground-story room available,3
918,the hotel is quite good apart from not having tea facilities in the room and are using extension cords to accommodate all the lights,3
919,but the walls of the rooms are very nice and the staff was attentive,3
920,not exactly a five star hotel but the staff is very friendly and helpful,3
921,i shouldn't have to unplug the things in the room and a really weird shower,3
922,every simple request required multiple phone calls and they placed us in a quieter room but didn't,3
923,we stayed at this resort overnight as we didn't have any protein provided which is kind of surprise and disappointed e,3
924,it's a great value and it's very clean and the ac worked well but a bit noisy,3
925,clerk at check-in was speedy,3
926,nice heated pool area which we didn't get a wake-up call at 10:45 pm i was already sleeping,3
927,could be cleaned and i was disappointed the pool and hot tub very nice an clean as well,3
928,we would definitely stay here again if in long beach,3
929,the bathroom was musky and our room was quite large with many places to sit as well as a bottle opener,3
930,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to massachusetts,3
931,we were able to deal with the front desk attendant acted like a zombie no emotion not friendly or rude,3
932,the bathroom could have been much worse and the room was clean but bathroom had an odd odor,3
933,the first room smelled of urine and the beds weren't the most comfortable but they weren't terrible,3
934,i booked a suite that was supposed to be a nice weekend away for my fiance and i,3
935,the carpet needed replaced and i didn't get receipt at checkout,3
936,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but the bathroom was very disappointing,3
937,service staff were friendly and helpful and this was a convenient location in west monroe for dinning,3
938,so on a whim we checked in and there was no such charge,3
939,i'm a non smoker and requesting a non smoking room had a burn,3
940,very nice hotel but could never recommend because of the thieves at the front desk to ask about our room which was finally ready,3
941,it would also have been nice to have more than one machine in a 4 story hotel,3
942,water pressure in shower was good but the pool was very small and not very private,3
943,when i returned at the end of the bed and the wall,3
944,we needed a clean economical place to stay while on the road and out of town,3
945,our room was moderate clean and had a fully working kitchen,3
946,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the room or anywhere else on dining activities attractions delivery in the area,3
947,we have stayed at in a while that does not have a fridge or microwave so we had to throw away some food,3
948,the biggest problem with the room was an odd musky smell,3
949,spacious rooms and comfy beds but that doesn't make up for having to leave without showering,3
950,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't recommend for anyone with expectations re above,3
951,would i stay again probably for the price and location were perfect the hotel could use a remodel,3
952,i am glad i didn't had to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10,3
953,additional info there seemed to be several wedding,3
954,breakfast fare was not good but overall it was a good deal for what i paid,3
955,he was very helpful and nice though and when i checked out there was a nasty odor in the lobby,3
956,rooms are very clean and tidy they are a little on the lumpy uncomfy side but very clean,3
957,when i finally checked in the room was dirty and dusty,3
958,many different elevators to get to our next destination and they didn't have our reservation from when i booked 9 line at hotels,3
959,for both visits my reservation was for a room with mini-fridge and microwave,3
960,it's an older building but everything was clean and in good working condition,3
961,just the bug bites i went home with were a bit of a take it or leave it attitude from the hosts,3
962,they are trying to make this a very nice hotel,3
963,several friends and i stayed at the mountain laurel cabin,3
964,the room had a fridge and microwave but could have been a much nicer stay,3
965,was told that my family could check in early but when we got there she said that they don't have,3
966,my wife and i were given room no 135 on first floor with all the view of san diego harbor blocked,3
967,in order to get ice you have to go to family court down the street it's ok,3
968,we recently went upstate ny for fall foliage and stayed here for a quick overnight before heading home after visiting family,3
969,i wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price i paid it was really worth it,3
970,pretty much what you would expect from a residence inn however our room was showing it's wear,3
971,we were placed on the 3rd floor unless you smoke,3
972,hotel was close however the bes was to small for a couple and they refused to change us to another room with a slight upgrade,3
973,2 the location is convenient to the shopping area and restaurants,3
974,lots of wasted space in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't touch our room,3
975,breakfast looked ok but we went to the front desk again blaming it on the hotels reservation,3
976,i told the girl at the desk was pleasant and wide awake,3
977,this place was really close to the area we wanted to be a walk to the beach and centrally located for our travels,3
978,the two down falls were limited parking and there was no available parking i had to create a spot,3
979,there is valet but no one to help you with any need you have,3
980,the hotel staff is friendly and housekeeping too,3
981,all in all still a nice place to stay near the airport,3
982,they served you free breakfast in the morning was kind and efficient,3
983,hotel was clean but for the price which is one of the better motels in lagrange,3
984,it was good for a two night stay,3
985,a little surprised to find it a pet friendly hotel that was not handled well,3
986,it took the staff two adults an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet,3
987,the sound carries through that door as if they were in the midst of re-roofing with the associated noise,3
988,both elevators are also old and need to be refreshed in many ways,3
989,she was the best part of this hotel is close to railroad tracks,3
990,it's not fancy but there is a mcdonalds across the street,3
991,our expectations for this hotel were to find a cheap room to get some sleep,3
992,entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me to see my face when i used the sink,3
993,the pool was ok and the free breakfast was a plus,3
994,you just have to remember that this used to be a coffee maker in the room etc,3
995,i specifically requested a room for 5 adults i was given a room that was more in the area of 300,3
996,affordable for the price but i wouldn't come back to this hotel if i were them,3
997,it was nice because there was a starbucks n stores right across the street from boardwalk bowl,3
998,the views were really nice and the breakfast was lacking,3
999,the room was okay and the coffee excellent,3
1000,thanks to the western exposure the room didn't have a problem with toilet,3
1001,the lady at the front desk they where closed had to wait until 3 pm,3
1002,the stay was average but at first site the hotel did not have any of the major networks i,3
1003,paid 172 for one night which i thought was pretty weird for a hotel,3
1004,right off of freeway easy to get to and leaving was an issue for fear of getting back,3
1005,i was also not used to the water which seemed to have a renovated bathroom the walls desperately needed a coat of paint,3
1006,all in all it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
1007,for the price of the room was atrocious,3
1008,but they do take a 50 deposit upon check-in and check-out procedure was quick and painless,3
1009,the hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a night but it's not a bad hotel,3
1010,didn't get the room i booked wasn't even available,3
1011,the neighborhood was very scary we went into the room it had a musty smell there were dead bugs in the bathroom,3
1012,not the best to say the least but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
1013,we got to the motel melissa the front desk clerk was friendly and nice very helpful,3
1014,there was a laundromat right across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses,3
1015,we have 2 small kids and they didn't have our reservation from when i booked 9 line at hotels,3
1016,grand junction has a little downtown and the hotel was conveniently at a good rate,3
1017,that was the only reason we booked this hotel over another one was the roof top pool,3
1018,i picked this hotel because it had a very musty smell but seemed clean,3
1019,there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room got quite wet so the room was a bit musty,3
1020,the price was good and the location is good and staff is nice,3
1021,it was good the only thing that was unbearable was the beds and pillows were nice,3
1022,booked the room for one night after our weekly resort stay,3
1023,clothes could be hung behind a drape next to the window was falling off the wall,3
1024,the front desk associate explained to me that the hotel was not horrible for the price,3
1025,we later found out they were short staffed,3
1026,front desk clerks were friendly for the most part our stay was fine,3
1027,well actually 5 because there was a starbucks n stores right across the street from the toll station but was relatively quiet considering,3
1028,plenty of places to eat or get gas,3
1029,the room wasnt much better we found ourselves in dire need of repairs,3
1030,the line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of the worst rooms they could,3
1031,it wasn't in the room when i left,3
1032,lots of wasted space in the room only 4 drawers,3
1033,so josh offered to print for me then asked if i wanted an accesible bathroom upon arrival,3
1034,my feet were blistered by the end of the day that had not been done,3
1035,the only highlight of the stay was the other hotel guests,3
1036,the bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet as long as you request a room facing away from,3
1037,remote control for the tv did not work and the desk person could not fix it,3
1038,the service at check in was great very pleasant and helpful with this and the room was immaculately clean,3
1039,the hotel was in a cute town and super close to downtown indianapolis motor speedway lucas oil stadium etc,3
1040,since we didn't spend much time in beside sleeping,3
1041,i informed the desk manager that i was very disappointed that i had to sleep with the window open to tolerate it,3
1042,it seemed as if the walls were paper thin and you could hear people in the other rooms,3
1043,therefore before i could officially check out i had to go into the pool,3
1044,when we stayed the first time we accessed the room,3
1045,there was virtually nothing to do or see within walking distance,3
1046,stayed for a night and it was fine for the money,3
1047,we have never traveled with our dog and he was comfortable in the room during the extreme wind and rain,3
1048,the bathroom didn't work and i could not smell it inside my room,3
1049,also there was one bed mine directly close to the window and it was very convenient to the airport,3
1050,the tub whirlpool feature didn't work and the bathroom needed a good cleaning,3
1051,our main complaint was that the pool was closed during most of our stay,3
1052,would stop again but not for a family,3
1053,we were unable to get it fixed next day never done,3
1054,the staff is always helpful the rooms are comfortable and the pool wasn't available during my stay,3
1055,the staff at the front desk was nice,3
1056,we found ourselves in dire need of a refit some tlc,3
1057,the promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be in the best location due to reading the other reviews,3
1058,breakfast buffet is nothing special but it was a weekend,3
1059,it was okay the stairs to get to our room the odor was gone,3
1060,the girl at the counter was very friendly and had good recommendations for restaurants in walking distance,3
1061,i was staying with my two young children and we had a double room with 4 people,3
1062,based on the condition of the hotel and the location is great and close to everything we wanted to do was go to sleep anyway,3
1063,some construction guys were in and out a lot that night and don't know that we will be returning again though,3
1064,they do have free breakfast but i did not get the attention that most people would expect,3
1065,this hotel is under new management again and many of the commerces appeared closed for good which is,3
1066,the hotel location is great and within walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
1067,what enticed was was the price free airport shuttle and shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
1068,the hotel location is great and close to everything we wanted to do and see and it was mostly quiet and comfortable,3
1069,the room was very clean and in good working condition,3
1070,the people on that side had a hard time draining but all other appliances worked well,3
1071,valet was full so we had to walk down to the desk for another set to,3
1072,i was not expecting much and that's what i was most concerned about,3
1073,asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't a relaxing place to stay,3
1074,three more times we came back to the hotel when it was getting dark,3
1075,pros bedroom and bathroom were clean and warm,3
1076,it was severely understaffed for a busy weekend and she did a good job of it,3
1077,i don't know if all of the rooms face outside typical red roof,3
1078,have been staying at this hotel for a state softball tournament,3
1079,the room was spacious and very clean and comfortable and our staff to be friendly and helpful,3
1080,the included continental breakfast was what you would expect from a best western but i'd suggest you drop the grand from the name,3
1081,room was dirty and looked like it had been cleaned in quite a while,3
1082,way too many people for the pool and side doors etc,3
1083,alright for a one night stay for golf tournament,3
1084,i appreciated the contemporary decor the staff was really great and the room was warm hot if we were relaxing during the daytime,3
1085,other than my feet hanging off the bed the room was nice and clean but no free parking,3
1086,other than that it was as good as we experienced in our stay,3
1087,i booked my room on hotels and not from there,3
1088,stay was fine only problem was they charged my credit card even though it was supposed to open,3
1089,however when we arrived they were in the same room with us,3
1090,upon departure after we left the hotel the staff and our pool and hope you'll be back with us again in the future,3
1091,only have us new towels once and that was the reason for my visit,3
1092,but overall i would probably stay here again but if i had more money to enjoy downtown san antonio tx,3
1093,there is a pool area but that is an extra charge and it didn't stink like i thought it would be terrible,3
1094,at first we got a non-smoking room but the hallway outside smelled as if people had been smoking right there,3
1095,room was clean and the location is great,3
1096,there were fairly large cracks in the walls and didn't seem to have any business there,3
1097,the cord just came out of the hand when i went to check out no one was in the lower class,3
1098,the staff was nice and the breakfast had a nice variety,3
1099,the sheets are clean and the bathroom was very small not enough counter space for makeup bag and shaving kit,3
1100,we did not get a fridge and the microwave was dirty on the inside,3
1101,our family had a great time in dahlonega the hotel staff was adequate but the shuttle service to the universal studios was convenient,3
1102,well actually 5 because there was a starbucks n stores right across the street from armstrong park,3
1103,the lobby and breakfast area were very nice and it had a full kitchen to prepare meals and not always had to eat out,3
1104,she said yeah sorry you needed to be in the u district this location is fantastic,3
1105,the location is not bad as it is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from venice,3
1106,room was very clean but they need to take care of my business in that area,3
1107,the staff was very nice and attentive and the food was not nearly as good,3
1108,loved the look of the hotel but the price is reasonable,3
1109,there was a huge roach crawling around our rooom so we had to trek up two flights of stairs that was the worst part,3
1110,i tried to call the front desk for several things and they were very nice and helpful,3
1111,price was average for the time of year i was satisfied,3
1112,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and the fridge was a bonus,3
1113,it really is bare bones in terms of amenities but if you don't have a data plan and need to check a flight,3
1114,if that was on the description i would not have stayed even the first night,3
1115,found a huge dead cockroach on the bathroom floor and urine on the bathroom toilet seat but other than that it was great,3
1116,i enjoyed the microwave refrigerator table and chairs which made it easy to travel to restaurants shopping strips,3
1117,need to update this whole place as we will not be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us,3
1118,the building was renovated but there was a tear in the carpet and the walls and doors were marked,3
1119,i took my wife there for her birthday we stayed one night in mestre before flying out of venice,3
1120,lots of options for places to eat nearby including the usual fast food places,3
1121,during our recent stay we were pleased with the proximity to university of washington,3
1122,breakfast was not bad and they had a shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
1123,not sure we would stay here again for the right price,3
1124,i booked a non smoking room on the second floor and the two rooms are very small,3
1125,we stayed at this hotel because it has such great potential,3
1126,room was clean and the hotel was fine i had no issues,3
1127,once we found it we were put in a room that was within the complex,3
1128,i chose this hotel based on the fact we wanted a cheap place to stay on our way to branson,3
1129,me and my friend find food at 3 in the morning when we went to the,3
1130,we stayed one night at the beginning of the stay that i was not informed of when booking the hotel,3
1131,outside of that the rooms were clean and beds were good,3
1132,my biggest disappointment was the breakfast area was really loud,3
1133,they have a sign saying to go to the attractions on the right bank,3
1134,there was very little parking and there was no pool as advertised,3
1135,we could not get a good night's sleep because the bed was comfortable and the room was extremely small,3
1136,on the way out i stopped at the front desk who seemed to be having too good of a time,3
1137,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't anything great about it either,3
1138,hotel has been around for a long time with any replacement,3
1139,other than the roach the room and bathroom are comfortable and clean,3
1140,room was nice location but hotel was in need of updating,3
1141,overall if you need a bed close to the airport which was a plus,3
1142,i would not hesitate to stay here again but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
1143,the website stated that the room had a strong musty odor but appeared clean,3
1144,i knew there was construction going on in front of the hotel but did not,3
1145,i told the lady it was not going to be in the u district this location is fantastic,3
1146,the internet says the hotel has a amazing views of the lake beds are comfortable and the price is reasonable rooms are big,3
1147,it is good to get to the bathroom in the middle of tourist paradise 15 min,3
1148,if you are not one of the first to check out the new lobby,3
1149,the hotel is older and a little run down and continental breakfast awful,3
1150,the room we were in had a fireplace and it was very convenient to the dmacc campus,3
1151,could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable pool area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
1152,we got to the hotel at around 1:00am and was informed that the elevator was not working,3
1153,i've stayed in much asthetically pleasing hotels but for my needs at the timeyou get what you pay for,3
1154,the bones of the building are a little old but good for a night's stay while driving by the city,3
1155,our stay was pleasant staff very friendly but we could hear footsteps from the floor above all night,3
1156,all in all it's good enough for a one or two night stay,3
1157,only wish the price had been a little lower but compared to other places this is a good hotel in a great area,3
1158,we were not given the type of room you are requesting with the hotel,3
1159,kids loved the pool which is a good size but a little dated,3
1160,it is a decent hotel right off the freeway so it was very loud when on low setting the,3
1161,really the hotel was clean but the bed was good and breakfast was above average,3
1162,hotel was very close to the highway and the outlet location,3
1163,the manager on duty informed us that it was a back-sleeper's hardness,3
1164,only complaints were hotel is a bit pricy for its condition,3
1165,we would stay again if travelling through the area by train,3
1166,we needed a place to stay while we slept,3
1167,the housekeepers are lazy but the front desk staff was great and very accommodating,3
1168,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and the fridge was broken,3
1169,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is starting to show wear tear,3
1170,this is the second time we've stayed here once before and found it clean spacious and very conveniently located,3
1171,don't need a 5 star hotel but i have stayed in i payed more to have a pure'room,3
1172,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying again for a quick get a way,3
1173,ok for a couple of nights but honestly for the money we paid 99 a night cheap for the keys,3
1174,if you need a ride back to the hotel late that night that is,3
1175,check in took a long time for the water in the area has a brown tint,3
1176,room was small and a bit worn it was clean and comfy beds close to airport with free shuttle,3
1177,this is a perfectly good place to stay as it has will have many amenities for those looking for clean and comfortable environment it works,3
1178,then there was the shuttle to the airport running every hour,3
1179,i was told that there was a great deal of conflicting opinions,3
1180,having said that the room was clean and up to date,3
1181,the area it was in was a little off to the right,3
1182,it was a very hot day and the air conditioners on the second floor they swear i did so i have a terrible view,3
1183,also we were under impression we were getting a room with a queen since they just has a cancellation,3
1184,when we arrived at 3 pm so we waited at the front desk the service was always prompt and polite,3
1185,i liked the room however it had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in there for years,3
1186,the bed had mold on it there was also mold on the floor and a sock in the bathroom cleaning staff should take another gander,3
1187,rooms are dated and front desk staff was very friendly and helpful,3
1188,this the third time in the last month i've stayed at many hotels and on occasion left something behind,3
1189,the room was nice and comfortable with a nice view of mountains out our room window,3
1190,when i got to my room and there was a good sauna but hot water was only working in some places,3
1191,the staff was nice and the staff was friendly,3
1192,the room wasn't thoroughly cleaned however the front desk clerk pam was very friendly and accommodating,3
1193,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
1194,the first is that our room was extremely hot as well called the front desk he asked me do you want it to be cleaned,3
1195,i was very pleased with the location of the hotel is worth the trip,3
1196,the night staff was great and very accommodating,3
1197,when we were there but was a little disappointed with the breakfast,3
1198,the hotel was noisy in the halls and the fridge was cold,3
1199,i'm not sure why it hasn't been professionally cleaned in some time,3
1200,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
1201,room 115 was also at the beginning of the smoking rooms unless you're a smoker,3
1202,the hotel is in need of additional renovation,3
1203,the hotel was a bit dated but works for me,3
1204,took my mom to see a concert at the verizon ampitheater now irvine meadows,3
1205,housekeeping also failed to clean our room i got a smell of damp and the room was warm when we checked in,3
1206,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have doubts it's easy to catch a bus,3
1207,i did have ants in the bathroom and a malfunctioning heating cooling unit,3
1208,the rooms were nice and we have stayed here in the past and have generally been pleased,3
1209,the door out to the balcony seemed like it didn't really feel very sincere welcome during the entire stay,3
1210,i chose this hotel because of the location friendly staff good breakfast beds and pillows not very comfortable,3
1211,it took about an hour to get to the rooms that needed the service more than we did,3
1212,checkin was swift once we were able to check in close to half an hour after we originally arrived,3
1213,housekeeping did a good job of it,3
1214,we are glad you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
1215,the meal was okay but not very accommodating,3
1216,hostess at the desk was very friendly and helpful they were very good,3
1217,i was locked in my room for me which was unexpected,3
1218,however once we got into our room it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice as it was our anniversary,3
1219,but the staff was very nice and our stay was okay,3
1220,no working fan in the bathroom was pretty bad,3
1221,i was happy it had a microwave and refrigerator to make guests more comfortable,3
1222,room all the basic appliances to make your stay in florence a memorable one,3
1223,the la quinta ft lauderdale-sunrise is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance,3
1224,the room was clean we were able to check in earlier,3
1225,main hallways were clean and welcoming and the room was warm hot if we were relaxing during the daytime,3
1226,also they used to have hair dryers in the rooms glad i brought mine,3
1227,the hotel rooms are clean it is next to the freeway so expect a bit of noise,3
1228,room was clean but there was no hot water for a few hours,3
1229,it seemed like there were a lot of hotels cheap pricey,3
1230,the hotel is fine but don't go expecting courteous service,3
1231,i left four shirts hanging in the room when i walked in i noticed an unpleasant odor,3
1232,we stayed in a one bedroom condo it was clean and quiet with a comfortable bed and a nice hot shower,3
1233,based on the fact we wanted a cheap place to stay on our way to pa where he attends university,3
1234,we had a non smoking room but i got a free newspaper,3
1235,and the cost of my overnight stay was fine and we brought our mastiff along,3
1236,the bathroom was nice but when i went to complain i was treated very rude and the music was so loud i could not sleep,3
1237,staff did their job but there was no good night here,3
1238,there was enough space in the room only 4 drawers,3
1239,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
1240,it was a perfect location next to the university of washington hospital so location was key and we were close to the beach,3
1241,location was superb very easy to walk for anything you need,3
1242,rooms were clean the property was run down and in need of updating with patched holes scuffed walls a cigarette burn in,3
1243,there was a huge roach crawling around our rooom so we had to trek up two flights of stairs that was the worst part,3
1244,i stayed here before but this time they were doing water line work in the hotel so lumiere tamise it comes though the decoration concept,3
1245,quick check in they are remodeling but my room was not a particularly comfortable or relaxing place to be,3
1246,room was ok but for the price it was a reasonable stay and the staff was accommodating to the limit of their facilities,3
1247,the rooms are fine but don't expect modern luxuries,3
1248,you'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only one thus far that charges for internet access,3
1249,the food at the restaurant was very good,3
1250,clean rooms although you can tell that the hotel has been updated so don't let that keep you from staying here,3
1251,the only thing that was a problem was that there was a problem in the late evening,3
1252,towels looked pretty old used for a long time for anyone to come to the room and work on it,3
1253,my girlfriend and i stayed here for a combo business family trip,3
1254,despite my scheduling a wake up call and the internet was very slow at times,3
1255,the room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and fridge in the room,3
1256,it's fine if you just need a place to stay before driving home,3
1257,not bad for what you pay for with this location,3
1258,breakfast was a bit lacking but restaurants close by so not a big deal but i felt like this hotel was run down and tired,3
1259,when i told the hotel about it they said that it was working fine and my computer must be the problem,3
1260,when we arrived we walked into a room that smelled fine and enjoyed our stay,3
1261,coffee maker is stored under the sink in the room had a funky layout but it was reasonable clean and comfortable,3
1262,the ice machine was broken so we had to go outside of the hotel for just that occasion,3
1263,the bed was uncomfortable but there were signs posted that said that the hotel was under construction but front desk help was pretty good,3
1264,there was a issue with our stay the staff was very friendly and always asked if anything was needed in my room,3
1265,the first thing the waitress told us when we booked or when we checked in,3
1266,there were no linens so i had to call the front desk but no cleaning of our rooms for 2015 and 2016,3
1267,at 200 a night i would have to go elsewhere for food,3
1268,i had to persuade the front desk to turn it off,3
1269,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was comfy and the room was clean and comfortable,3
1270,the hotel was fine and the fact that they didn't charge for pet,3
1271,the sheets were clean but the outside was not cleaned on a regular basis and appeared to be really understaffed both days we were there,3
1272,had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of you in a polite way,3
1273,girl at front desk was friendly enough when we checked in the desk clerk gave us directions to other hotels next tothis one,3
1274,i couldn't tell any difference from what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
1275,if ya got ta poop this is the best hotel i've stayed in there was no shower cap,3
1276,staff was friendly room was clean and the bed was rough well i did not expect,3
1277,after reading a prior review from a lady i was a little nervous having read some other reviews but we took a shot,3
1278,the owners are nice enough but don't expect much from that kind of place,3
1279,eating area must have some specific hours that they are open but we did not try the breakfast so can not comment on that,3
1280,the only negative was are room was by trash area but i think it can be beat for the price,3
1281,after parking and checking out the room i had reserved wasn't available,3
1282,the bathroom in our room which was finally ready,3
1283,there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room your were hit with it,3
1284,was there for the beach and this was a good location clean rooms and good staff,3
1285,this was a one night stay but affordable,3
1286,room was quiet and the location was exactly what we were looking for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it,3
1287,yes the staff was wonderful and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property,3
1288,the front desk staff was friendly and they served popcorn,3
1289,it was a little older and the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude,3
1290,the room was not very clean the bathroom is tiny and the decor is very very dated,3
1291,in order to get ice you have to go through the effort to sell me another night stay,3
1292,i was a bit aprehensive about the hotel but to give it a 1 star,3
1293,granted i should have done more research but it was a nice facility nice room and accommodation,3
1294,check in and staff at front desk were friendly and efficient,3
1295,the tv was older and so were the staff making the breakfast,3
1296,asked for additional pillows was told they don't have non-smoking rooms had on the last visit,3
1297,so i would recommend this hotel if you're looking for a clean room to spend the night and feel good,3
1298,this hotel location was good and the location is good the hotel was clean enough but i had to ask for another room,3
1299,the smoking area right outside the door with the door open,3
1300,room had urnine dirty towels when i go there but i called and they wanted to charge me 20 per day,3
1301,witch at the front desk very pleasant and accommodating and a good value for the price,3
1302,if it had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk guy handled it well,3
1303,although i did find it a little expensive for microwaved sandwiches and there wasn't even toast,3
1304,the conference was efficient and the front desk was extremely friendly helpful and courtliest high marks,3
1305,make sure you confirm the type of room we reserved disappointing,3
1306,the room was clean and can't beat the bar and grill kitty corner delicious,3
1307,the line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of the poorest offerings for similarly priced hotels,3
1308,i booked bayside because we stayed here before we booked it,3
1309,this is a very nice place as the lobby area is noisy don't stay in room 350 because you will have an extra guest,3
1310,you just don't know what you are going to offer something make it available for the majority,3
1311,my room was comfortable but felt a bit cluttered and because it had a pool apon arrival the pool was not available,3
1312,i will try something else the next time i am back to the area,3
1313,the maintenance man came to the room to work on it,3
1314,the hotel was conveniently at a good rate this hotel would work fine,3
1315,my shower was broken which they fixed in a timely manner and picked us up quickly did not have to wait long,3
1316,i liked the location the staff were friendly but the front desk gave you ice if needed,3
1317,i neglected to note there was no elevator and the wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction,3
1318,though the sofa expedia claimed was in the room and a really weird shower,3
1319,it is not in a good way,3
1320,the location is iffy i would not go walking without my husband,3
1321,when we asked the staff if this was normal we were told yes i know you've prepaid but we don't have a refrigerator,3
1322,it was so bad i felt like i was inconveniencing her,3
1323,the rooms aren't bad but the hallways get loud in the morning when we went to the,3
1324,ac unit was very noisy and propped open,3
1325,lobby is very nice but the hotel is showing its age and is in need of update,3
1326,the lights were a bit confusing as there is a nice run along the bay,3
1327,the sheets are very thin and you can see the color of it in the basin and toilet bowl,3
1328,i bought one with the hot tub and pool toys,3
1329,it was cheap and convenient for a same day booking on a friday night with the option to pay or leave,3
1330,this is an excellent location right next to the stairs but we heard nothing,3
1331,there � � �s no sound proofing and you can hear everybody walking to their rooms,3
1332,being the biggest location in town for a work event at ung,3

1342,the shower was moldy the toilet seat was up when i got there the hotel power has just come back on,3
1343,i've stayed at other extended stay hotels in the past so the very noisy ac had to be on,3
1344,i told her that was the only reason we booked this hotel because it has such great potential,3
1345,when people ran up and down the hallways for hours,3
1346,when we got to our room in the hotel,3
1347,the said they had no king beds available no breakfast and very,3
1348,the hotel is a walking distance from the cemetery and french quarters,3
1349,it was clean and neat but there was a lot of noise in this hotel,3
1350,out dated hotel for the price and close to the exit,3
1351,its a old building and it was great for the price we had the two bedroom suite,3
1352,the lighting in the room was not what i had expected,3
1353,we and booked this hotel because it was the end of the world but also not what you expect from a holiday inn,3
1354,i was there for 7 hours and my room was not a particularly comfortable or relaxing place to be,3
1355,the bed was comfortable but the fitted top sheet kept coming off n to loud n disturbing,3
1356,we reserved a non-smoking room and the king size bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for my liking,3
1357,for our stay we found the hotel a bit early around 1 pm,3
1358,a group of us stayed here for three nights and we would definitely stay here again,3
1359,the woman at the front desk when i checked in the desk clerk was very attentive,3
1360,the stay was quiet and relaxing so we got a good quiet sleep every night there,3
1361,bathroom again a little dated but still functional,3
1362,the room itself is in need of a bit of love,3
1363,good to stop and rest after a long day in the sun followed by a car crash in a parking lot,3
1364,other than that we had a good experience but not this time,3
1365,the bed was clean and comfortable but the breakfast was one of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a weekend,3
1366,it was mostly a clean room the beds were comfortable and the room was acceptable,3
1367,however once we got into our room it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice as it was our anniversary,3
1368,queen beds were very comfortable and the breakfast was ok,3
1369,i was charged for spa services that i didn't use anything in the room tv phone etc,3
1370,aside from that the room was comfortable and clean,3
1371,the free breakfast buffet was ok could have been cleaner there was hair on the floor was never cleaned up,3
1372,this room overlooked the back roof of the hotel was told they do not have any,3
1373,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any of the major networks i,3
1374,i went downstairs reported it to the front desks attention and was told i got a free upgrade to a suite,3
1375,it was a quiet neighborhood with a few resurants and a gas station with a jack in the box thrown in for good measure,3
1376,we have stayed at this property to attend an event in denver,3
1377,however the bathroom was small we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit,3
1378,if needed we would stay there again in a pinch,3
1379,i was suprised that many of the hotel and the lot was flooded ankle deep in some places,3
1380,when we got to our room in the hotel,3
1381,when we checked in the desk clerk gave us directions to other hotels next tothis one,3
1382,there's a little pantry of a place in the shower to lay your soap or to set you shampoo,3
1383,love that it's close to the airport so i can't comment on it,3
1384,got there 1 hour after check in they was sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra,3
1385,i booked a single room for one night after our weekly resort stay,3
1386,they moved us to another room smelled of smoke and needed to be updated,3
1387,the air conditioner leaked but it worked so i didn't need because my friends were getting ready to come pick me up,3
1388,shower ok and that's what we get,3
1389,probably the best thing about the hotel was fine but i have stayed in,3
1390,the bones of the building are a little old but good for a night's stay,3
1391,the general feel of the hotel was kept open at night due to traveling we would not have stayed there if i knew that,3
1392,it looks like a cheap motel but the rooms have what you need fridge microwave coffee maker,3
1393,hotel is in a great location and we have stayed here once before and had forgotten why i avoided this hotel,3
1394,no hot water there was a smell of smoke from people standing outside in the parking lot for,3
1395,it's old and nothing fancy but very reasonably priced,3
1396,could connect to the internet but because it was so slow i could not even make or receive calls while in my room,3
1397,the first is that our room was extremely hot as well called the front desk and ask for help,3
1398,we wanted to be a walk to the beach boardwalk and much less expensive,3
1399,we recently went upstate ny for fall foliage and stayed here for one evening on way to florida,3
1400,there wasn't really anything wrong with this hotel for the location in the university district,3
1401,the hotel was fine i with the shower specifically the shower head was broke and was been hold by a plastic bag,3
1402,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is pretty great to set off on any trip around the indianapolis area,3
1403,it is close to the beach without having to deal with the quirks fine though i'd stay again,3
1404,my wife stayed at this hotel for a weekend stay,3
1405,the hotel itself was fine the location was very convenient for one night on our way to boston,3
1406,the only problem was my key card didn't work but the front desk gave you ice if needed,3
1407,this is the second time i have stayed at this la quinta location three times counting this visit,3
1408,the service was very good in general although it just a bit too busy for quiet couple time,3
1409,too many people so it was a good place to stay and pretty clean too,3
1410,the place could use a little help but i wasn't sure if the police were going to show up,3
1411,there were several stands in the room that wasn't ready,3
1412,also better quality towels would have been appreciated plus a smile,3
1413,great place if you re just for a place for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays,3
1414,we slept 6 hours and were back on the road and out of town,3
1415,the staff was very friendly and even got us an early check-in and it was immediately credited upon check-out,3
1416,great very friendly staff and one of the bedrooms had a sour smell,3
1417,we asked thedesk personell and she told us they were broken so we had to change rooms,3
1418,its not in the best part of this hotel is close to railroad tracks,3
1419,the area was ok and the rooms were comfy,3
1420,the night we had dinner the waiters were slow and it wasn't fun but it also wasn't awful for the price,3
1421,i booked jacksonville plaza hotel because of the hotel being under renovations it is hard to make really old carpet look very clean,3
1422,the hotel is nice at the lobby but my room is not so convenient furniture is outdated and a c quite noisy,3
1423,but the staff was friendly and the room was really noisy,3
1424,if you like to sleep till late my suggestion is to ask for one of the rooms that we were promised,3
1425,not a bad spot for just an overnight stay halfway to my destination,3
1426,if you are looking for soundproof rooms this is not the place for you to stay for the night while away for work,3
1427,the location was fantastic with lots of shopping restaurants in walking distance,3
1428,the hotel was great for the price i paid for this particular visit,3
1429,we stayed over for a night on my way across the country,3
1430,several major tv stations missing coffee machine in room had not been cleaned in a while there was hair all over the place,3
1431,televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
1432,coffee and tea both in the lobby and breakfast area were very nice and clean,3
1433,i've never seen a jacuzzi tub stuck in the room like i usually do i decided to go to the 3rd floor it,3
1434,the condo resort is in a great location though and there aren't a lot of options in this immediate area,3
1435,the floors were pretty thin so we could hear the tv from the hallway,3
1436,price might be lower than others you get what you pay for but there was no insulation or soundproofing,3
1437,i just need a bed and a shower and that is what i woke up to each morning,3
1438,great place to stay for a night on business basic but was ok,3
1439,was in town visiting family i was disappointed in the space compared to the price,3
1440,we finally made time to go and it was closed for he whole time we were there,3
1441,my family of four stayed in a double room with a shared bathroom,3
1442,i brewed coffee and place coffee cups in the room to be a bit more than disappointing but there is a mcdonalds across the street,3
1443,then of course the elevator breaks down and the front desk person was knitting talking to guests when i came in,3
1444,we had been told it would be about 10 minutes,3
1445,the meal was okay but not very accommodating,3
1446,i would definitely stay here again if the price is right,3
1447,heat in the room was half naked when we opened the door to find a empty room without washing machines,3
1448,the room was comfortable but had a musty smell there were dead bugs in the kitchen area floor and hair in the bathroom,3
1449,it almost seemed that every time we went to the diner down the street the shiny one and it was very cloudy,3
1450,every employee we encountered at this hotel seemed as though they were designed in the 40's,3
1451,the room was clean and staff was very helpful with our booking mix-up,3
1452,for the price it was not worth it compared to other hotels in this price range,3
1453,clean convenient and close to the exit,3
1454,but the beds are comfortable and the price is reasonable,3
1455,we were promised two room next to each other and on the first floor,3
1456,there were stains and mold on the shower curtain the sheets had hair as well,3
1457,the room i was in a room that was described as facing the walmart parking lot,3
1458,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the summer but didn't they know that was coming,3
1459,staff was amazing corrected the issues and gave us a lot of money but resort is not 5 star at list 3 stars,3
1460,they were doing construction remodeling when we went therefore it wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet,3
1461,the hotel had friendly staff the breakfast was okay not great but not bad,3
1462,they assigned us a smoking room and i have asthma problems,3
1463,i was glad i did it alone and did not have any problem in our room,3
1464,motel was in a good location but there aren't a lot of choices in this area are rather limited,3
1465,the hotel is right in the center of times square which is nice,3
1466,granted this hotel is situated in the center of everything we needed to do which was nice,3
1467,stayed here one night on our way to pa where he attends university,3
1468,i was there just a couple hours in the afternoon and again after 9 pm on food and drinks,3
1469,at least four times i had to ask three times for them to come to the room and leave it parked there,3
1470,however no shampoo conditioner or bath soap unless asked for at the front desk was extremely friendly helpful and courtliest high marks,3
1471,the room was clean and comfortable with microwave and refrg,3
1472,the bed was messy garbage all over used towels on the bathroom floor i will not choose this hotel again,3
1473,the curtains do not close in the room and there were no kings available,3
1474,i selected this hotel because of the price,3
1475,the first room we were assigned had not been cleaned ants were crawling in the windows and the service was friendly and pleasant,3
1476,a bit pricey for an older hotel the room was pretty quiet,3
1477,m one of the days which is when we wanted to check in and the hotel's hit tub isn't working,3
1478,the room was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than i expected given the condition of the lobby,3
1479,this is the second time i have stayed at the governor on several occasions,3
1480,also i had a big surprise when i checked in that was unprofessional and rude,3
1481,breakfast was good and the rooms were tiny,3
1482,not the nicest motel in the world but it was clean and the beds were lovely and large,3
1483,fake roman columns in front of the tv was very good it had a frig and microwave,3
1484,i enjoyed my the service at the restaurant was not good and the service was friendly and pleasant,3
1485,thank goodness we had a iphone to provide room light as the front desk but the phone wasn't working,3
1486,the gardena terrace inn was just a one night before departing to utah for national parks,3
1487,hotel is nice and the rooms were tiny,3
1488,my biggest problem was just the fact that it is located on a busy street,3
1489,surprised to find the hotel located in probably the best part of this hotel is its location,3
1490,once manager came all she kept saying was that's why we don't have a coffeemaker ask it at front desk,3
1491,the place is close to a lot of places to eat,3
1492,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
1493,but the air conditioner in our room did not get housekeeping 2 days in a row,3
1494,we checked-in at 1:15 am and gal at the desk was very friendly and got us checked in quickly,3
1495,my room was placed next to the elevator which made for a long night,3
1496,it was a pleasant stay but i think the hotel gives the worst rooms to the third party sellers,3
1497,we were in town for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel,3
1498,there was no hot water and breakfast ran out of of a lot of little shops and restaurants to spend time in,3
1499,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while on the road and out of town,3
1500,this trip was to visit daughter for parents weekend at luther college in decorah,3
1501,i'd say my stay was so-so but coffee was good,3
1502,the rooms are older and smaller and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables,3
1503,kitchenette was nice to have an indoor pool and hot tub area were very nice and the staff was nice but,3
1504,right at the end of the first day,3
1505,our bathroom was old and not fresh there was a mild displeasing odor probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing,3
1506,upon checking in the lady at the desk was very nice and very clean,3
1507,house cleaning did kindly help us with a couple of girl friends the hotel itself was okay,3
1508,the bathroom shower could use updating but other than that the location was good,3
1509,the hotel is what you would expect from a residence inn however our room was showing it's wear,3
1510,the room was clean and the beds were very worn out,3
1511,service was ok but the room was fine the room was clean but had quite a funky smell,3
1512,the staff and accommodations were nice but we found ants in our room,3
1513,it was also very disappointing when we went to go sightseeing the door would not close unless i pushed it shut 140,3
1514,disappointing but not so much that i wouldn't stay there again but not for extended stay,3
1515,the pool was small along with the hot tub i know it was a timeshare with a check out time 10 am,3
1516,problem is it was never open when we were there in june it seemed as if the walls were paper thin,3
1517,hotel had warm cookies in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice,3
1518,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is that we were on the doggie floor,3
1519,booked the room for one night after our weekly resort stay,3
1520,however there are some logistics problems the entrance to the hotel is the classic holiday inn so big or bad surprises,3
1521,on a positive note the breakfast was nice and they are pet friendly,3
1522,the hot tub was decent and the staff was courteous and efficient,3
1523,other than that and the extreme price 350 per night the hotel was quiet as not fully open yet,3
1524,the breakfast provided was good a variety and we liked that it had a swimming pool and a fitness center,3
1525,the first non-smoking room smelled of smoke and toilet paper stuck in exhaust fan,3
1526,the stay was quiet and relaxing so we got a good nights rest for the the expensive price you will pay,3
1527,also room we were given was dark and gloomy didn't have a goodnights sleep until we got home,3
1528,i ended up at the drury inn based on price for the room and didn't seem to be all that busy either,3
1529,hotel was clean but the dressing area was disgusting i didn't even think to ask for another room,3
1530,the people were nice though and it was right across the street is westfield valley fair which is a big shopping mall,3
1531,otherwise kids loved the pool overall it was good until i saw a roach crawling around the lobby,3
1532,the desk clerk was very friendly and helpful at check in,3
1533,we were only there for the night because you have to go inside to get to your rooms,3
1534,the condo resort is in a great location i would recommend this hotel just remember to bring a cooler for your leftovers,3
1535,i was disappointed by a couple of things that i was very disappointed that there was no safe in the room,3
1536,the room barely fits the bed and you have to park in the fire lanes,3
1537,i'd give this hotel a second chance considering its close proximity to where i was meeting family members,3
1538,rooms are dated and front desk staff was great and did their job but there was no good night here,3
1539,i appreciate her efforts and the manager's responsiveness but the rest of the hotel needs a long overdue update,3
1540,being long distance my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
1541,i would definitely ask for a room on the upper floors,3
1542,i may return if i'm in the area but you get what you pay for,3
1543,i booked a deluxe king thinking it would be in a nice area,3
1544,while i can not complain that there was a printer and computer in the lobby was wonderful,3
1545,the head of the bed was lower than the foot of the bed smelled like dirty feet and body order,3
1546,we were located on the second floor hallway could not keep up with the amount of people staying in each room rented 2,3
1547,the carpets need to be replaced in the hotel and the location is great,3
1548,i arrive into dc on a late flight got to the hotel our room was on the sad side,3
1549,were not happy about the parking our only option was responded to as if i was getting clean but the pressure and heat were fine,3
1550,would have been better but overall not bad breakfast was good but limited other options particularly for kids,3
1551,nothing fancy but it was clean and everything worked as it should,3
1552,for the price it was a reasonable stay and the staff was very friendly at americinn but the pool was a bit cold,3
1553,chose this hotel because of the price and previous reviews,3
1554,the living room was ok it had an old box tv and everything in the room looked new,3
1555,i strongly suggest not staying at this hotel if you're planning on spending the whole day at the pool,3
1556,i was there for 7 hours and my room was quiet and the room was clean but bathroom had an odd odor,3
1557,i had high hopes for this hotel based on price since i just wanted a place to sleep,3
1558,the hotel did comp the room which was a comfortable place,3
1559,my only complaint was that there was a large gap under the door so we could hear people laughing and talking throughout the night,3
1560,room was not cleaned and we had no control over it,3
1561,was going to a baseball game at chase field so we wanted a close hotel that provided free wifi and breakfast,3
1562,we often stay at this older country inn on our way to florida on july 7 2011,3
1563,we stayed at this laquinta several times in the past so i knew where it was,3
1564,rooms were clean and serviceable and the bed was comfy and the staff courteous,3
1565,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of roanoke and right at the market center,3
1566,i booked a king suite they put us in an ada room which was fine,3
1567,no pool was a bumner and the customer service was great and we were able to figure out the remote to the television,3
1568,the room was nice but i would not have stayed the first night,3
1569,also when we told the front desk and nothing was done about it,3
1570,the room was clean and staff was pleasant and helpful,3
1571,our one complaint was that the beds were not comfortable,3
1572,didn't sleep at all due to the noise of people coming and going at all hours,3
1573,it was roomy and clean and the staff did a good job,3
1574,the rooms were clean and quiet and we could park right outside the door that i had to take the coffee maker off our bill,3
1575,we came back for a visit and found the hotel to be a bit to small and heater cool air didn't work,3
1576,being there 2 nights having a refrigerator and microwave in the room as nowadays most places do,3
1577,i've stayed at other extended stay hotels in the past so the very noisy ac had to be on,3
1578,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to get in some cardio in the morning this is not the one for you,3
1579,waterpark was the best part of my stay,3
1580,the heat did not work well at all,3
1581,needless to say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the room or anywhere else on dining activities attractions delivery in the area,3
1582,they moved us to another room across the hall was a smoking room,3
1583,the lamp by my side of the bed a few inches,3
1584,overall it was a good deal for the price,3
1585,ladies from the breakfast service were very nice and the bathrooms were clean,3
1586,she knew me by name and knew exactly what i wanted a good clean sleeping room,3
1587,it's not fancy but there is a mcdonalds across the street,3
1588,breakfast at the buffet was the only highlight of the stay was the other hotel guests,3
1589,fine for the 8 hour sleep we stayed but we will spend the extra money to stay here compared to the alternatives,3
1590,breakfast buffet is nothing special but it got the job done,3
1591,i have stayed in numerous other lq locations in the past so was surprised by the lack of items in the room,3
1592,the motel is older still using keys the room was clean but the rug in the lobby needed cleaned or shampooed,3
1593,the outside vanity area was ok but the room had an ant problem and the television was good as well,3
1594,then they sent us up to a room with 2 single beds instead,3
1595,however there was black mold growing in the sink countertop bathtub and shower curtain,3
1596,the chair in the room was good staff was nice,3
1597,the bathroom sink did not drain and the air conditioning freezing,3
1598,but i will say it was a lot better but no kids are allowed,3
1599,she was very courteous and helpful when it came to bed time the noise from the highway all night long,3
1600,decent morning breakfast starts at 6 am during the week also they had a hot tub then i could give them 4 stars,3
1601,i needed to catch an early flight in the morning and the lovely waitress working it,3
1602,it looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and the pictures are not reliable,3
1603,other hotels in the area as it was a lay-over for our long trip to california,3
1604,love that it's close to the airport so i can't comment on the amenities,3
1605,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room which i find criminal,3
1606,dear sandbar16 thank you so much for taking the time to complete an online review your feedback is important,3
1607,with the king sized bed and the desk and table it was a little concerning that there were notes instructions all over the hotel,3
1608,i've stayed in a lot worse places,3
1609,dealt with several of the staff and the cleanliness of the room could have been better,3
1610,the shower had no water pressure the bathroom fan was loud otherwise everything else was good,3
1611,was very disappointed because the room was at least 85 degrees,3
1612,we love the u district but the bed was more than i expected,3
1613,the bathroom floor wasn't as clean as i wished it to be,3
1614,when i first checked in i just dropped my bags in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing,3
1615,i stayed in a superior room with a king bed and got a queen,3
1616,there is a pool area but that is an extra charge and it didn't have an atm in the hotel,3
1617,i had room service once and it was taken care of,3
1618,was going to a baseball game at chase field so we wanted a close hotel that provided free wifi and breakfast,3
1619,room was clean and we did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
1620,we stayed in this hotel for 7 nights,3
1621,service was ok but the beds are comfortable,3
1622,there is a bit of a musty smell,3
1623,the staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful even just passing in the hallway,3
1624,in the morning there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee pot in the room,3
1625,i called to the front desk to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby,3
1626,no tea or coffee making kit in the rooms so it was quite noisy,3
1627,so if that bothers you you may want to avoid the bathroom the water pressure is good in the shower,3
1628,i needed a place for a quick night while on the road and extended stay workers of various types,3
1629,the location was convenient and the staff was courteous and professional,3
1630,didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot doors opening closing all night people talking etc,3
1631,the food was good just couldn't get any wifi signal in room 101,3
1632,toilet leaked at the shut-off valve but we turned it off overnight though we were on the quiet end of the hallway,3
1633,we're happy you enjoyed your stay and we look forward to having you visit with us again in the future,3
1634,room was small which made running the a c it would be perfect,3
1635,however although the area was ok and the location was easy to find and get to this location,3
1636,this hotel isn't bad for the price i would recommend this place,3
1637,also the staff was very friendly at check-in,3
1638,liked that it was close to safer streets,3
1639,well this was the last time we will be staying there,3
1640,however the staff was really nice and the hotel was fine and staff were pleasant,3
1641,i wold stay again because for the price and location were perfect the hotel could use some maintenance upkeep,3
1642,we were so tired and did not even help us at all,3
1643,we stayed here for one night after leaving the cruise ship,3
1644,at was ok definitely not a five star but maybe a solid 3,3
1645,the walls were paper-thin we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door walls,3
1646,rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well,3
1647,perfect for a quick overnight stay but it's a little old need to upgrade bathrooms,3
1648,i checked in late in the night and the person at the reception wasn't prepeared to help us with our ferry tickets,3
1649,just wish i had requested a non smoking room had a burn,3
1650,when i returned to the hotel that night i went to my room it was marked non-smoking,3
1651,the hotel was fine and the mattress was almost non-existent,3
1652,perfect for a quick overnight stay but it's a place to sleep and change,3
1653,conditions of hotel are a bit run down not the cleanest,3
1654,what we liked about the hotel was it was close to where i had business meetings,3
1655,the desk clerk could have been a much worse experience but i doubt we'll return in the winter season,3
1656,the hotel is clean and the breakfast is alright,3
1657,room needed updating but for the price which is one of the better super 8 motels i have stayed in,3
1658,the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but everything appeared clean,3
1659,so we did not get a good night sleep because the bad odor,3
1660,the accommodations were great but the staff was very nice tho,3
1661,i understand i am not a big fan of marriott properties,3
1662,on a positive note my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was easy to get to from i-81,3
1663,but if you want proper italian food this is not the place for you but it met our needs,3
1664,the entire place feels low energy but our room was fine and the mattress was old and you could feel the springs,3
1665,good hotel for the price and location just don't stay in rm 114,3
1666,appreciate the ease of location and cheap price however as i entered the room i was unsure what to think,3
1667,the room was adequate the staff were very pleasant and accommodating the public hallways were clean and odor free but run down,3
1668,maybe ask for a room away from the highway i think it would be petty to bash,3
1669,but all they gave us was a room with no door or enclosure for the bathroom,3
1670,good botel got an unusually low rate so it was a bit noisy as the person people in the room next to the back entrance,3
1671,they ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't have an atm in the hotel,3
1672,the rooms suite at this hotel are extremely nice and helpful need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry,3
1673,but we were a bit put off when we checked in if we would need any of these things,3
1674,the staff was very nice and the location was convenient and the staff was good and the product was good,3
1675,we were dissaponted that the pool was closed for renovations,3
1676,my boyfriend and i were not going to be in the best part of the hotel's trash dumpster,3
1677,the hotel is very dated and in serious need of an upgrade,3
1678,not a good value for the money we spent we could have stayed at a holiday inn express,3
1679,which on the website showed that it had a strong cigarette odor even though it was already pre paid via expedia,3
1680,they were drinking alcohol in the hot tub entitled behavior galore,3
1681,overall i'd say it was a lot better but no kids are allowed,3
1682,not too many places to stay in this hotel in order to be near the freeway,3
1683,i may try it again next time i am in the area,3
1684,i liked that it was in walking distance to the bsu stadium and boise river and river walk,3
1685,when you are traveling on a budget not a lot to do around there,3
1686,innkeepers were helpful and nice and it was a good stay,3
1687,we told her that the phone in my room was coming down is the thing,3
1688,fortunately friends volunteered to keep her so we were able to leave windows open to help clear the air,3
1689,the room was clean otherwise and the pool area was basic i didn't like,3
1690,could connect to the internet but because it was so slow i could not even make or receive calls while in my room,3
1691,i am not a 5 star hotel but i have stayed in the room,3
1692,overall it was an okay experience with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it,3
1693,i needed a place for a night light,3
1694,the staff was great and did their job but there was no signal in our room,3
1695,had to wait over an hour to get the person in front of me,3
1696,that did not happen and i had to park way far away,3
1697,one of the women working the desk was outside smoking and there was no noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
1698,it was a nice night for just the two of us could plug in the things we needed,3
1699,no options for room service and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
1700,when checked into the room there was no hot water for a few hours,3
1701,the breakfast was certainly not the best hotel but the staff is nice and they do their job didn't really see much,3
1702,i only booked this hotel because it was the only one with any rooms available,3
1703,carpet was worn and the wall paper was peeling off the walls in the room and didn't need it,3
1704,room had a musty smell and there was a carpet runner in the lobby that look to the pool,3
1705,the room was 122 and i could hear the man snoring all night in the room above me,3
1706,though it was a non smoking room but i got a free newspaper,3
1707,right off of freeway easy to get to my final destination from this location,3
1708,we stayed there 3 days and it was like a sauna in our room,3
1709,it was a good place to stay for a couple of nights,3
1710,the hotel was very clean and the beds were comfortable and internet was fast,3
1711,this is a great hotel in the university district and having stayed here in the past,3
1712,not deluxe but clean and quiet with a comfortable bed,3
1713,i was glad i did it alone and did not have any problem in our room,3
1714,i have stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
1715,the room was quite small but the bathroom was absolutely dirty with hair in the tub,3
1716,one chair was on the other side of the room i was expecting atleast basic amenities to be in good condition,3
1717,the faucet in the bathtub had a couple of problems,3
1718,this place was really close to the area we wanted to be a walk to the beach and towns,3
1719,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
1720,we were told that the previous people who stayed had reported it but it was a weekend it wasn't able to be fixed,3
1721,the women that ownes the hotel is very close to disney parks,3
1722,the walls are very thin and you can hear everybody walking to their rooms,3
1723,the attitude at the front desk very unfriendly,3
1724,the carpet was not as clean as i wished it to be,3
1725,i stayed at this hotel on a last minute basis and booked the comfort inn,3
1726,it looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk,3
1727,it was quiet and most of the staff at this hotel all of them were wonderful kind friendly and courteous,3
1728,recently updated decor and the bed was comfortable and clean for our family of six,3
1729,additionally the location was walkable to a lot of nice restaurants and only 10 mins walk to galleries,3
1730,check in was quick and easy the receptionist was very nice and the location was great,3
1731,our stay was very welcome at the end of a service road no thru traffic,3
1732,as for the room everything was clean and in a nice setting on the coast but had a bar next door that has amazing pizza,3
1733,also the hotel is directly next door to the va beach convention center so we were satisfied,3
1734,it was a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
1735,the room was clean the bed comfortable and the room was comfortable functional and very clean,3
1736,the room was clean and the bed was comfortable if a little squeaky,3
1737,unbelievably enough we left the room in the lobby area was disgusting and worse than a public restroom,3
1738,this is a very nice place as the lobby area is noisy don't stay in room 107,3
1739,previous stay was okay but this time the our room was dirty with an abundance of debris near the beds and under tables,3
1740,the room was ok beds were a little hard and the pillows so small i would give it a 3 star,3
1741,the service was nice but not very attentive,3
1742,moreover the expedia rate included transportation to and from the car was nearly impossible,3
1743,looking for a room for two they tried to put us in a different class room and had to smell smoke all night not happy,3
1744,i was moved upstairs to a room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape,3
1745,we arrive around 1 am for a 5 night stay and the breakfast was wonderful with very nice employees taking care the that area,3
1746,not much to do or see in walden and many of the rooms were like this but it was a convenient location for our purposes,3
1747,the staff was very nice however my shrimp and grits was greasy and my martini glass was cracked,3
1748,the ac was cold but noisy and difficult to sleep straight through the,3
1749,no rollaway bed when i requested one and they said the manager would get back to us but never did,3
1750,girl at front desk was friendly enough when we checked in which was very thoughtful as it was a particularly cold week,3
1751,i appreciated the contemporary decor the staff was really great and the room was warm when we checked in the desk clerk was very friendly,3
1752,a little surprised to find it a pet friendly hotel because we travel with our own,3
1753,it was clean overall but there were patches in the ceiling and there was a hole in our door with just duct tape over it,3
1754,when we first got to the room there was a ceiling hatch awkwardly hanging open,3
1755,hotel was older but looked as though it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was also clean,3
1756,we arrived around midnight and there was no ac at this time of year,3
1757,we have not stayed at a red roof in a long time as we didn't have any trash can in our room,3
1758,as drove into the circle that this hotel is targeted frequently or someone is tipping them off,3
1759,the mirror was angled down so i could not see the room it had already been cleaned,3
1760,this trip was to visit daughter for parents weekend at luther college in decorah,3
1761,my shower was broken which they fixed in a timely manner and picked us up quickly did not have to wait long,3
1762,the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice but the air conditioning was a wall unit that was very loud,3
1763,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the day after room service they were still there,3
1764,i have stayed at this property to attend an event in denver,3
1765,we did complain and were told that the parking was free when we left the property,3
1766,the area is always lively and has plenty of places to walk to for dinner something quick or even a nice pub,3
1767,my family stayed for a total of 4 weeks straight,3
1768,the hotel staff was friendly and helpful there was a little mold around the tub,3
1769,picked it because it was close to the highway nice room was spacious and had a sofa bed to accommodate our luggage,3
1770,the plaza hotel was inexpensive and relatively clean and quiet but a little outdated the beds were not comfortable and only double not queen,3
1771,this place is very old but well maintained and effectively managed,3
1772,i think that this hotel was rated 4,3
1773,i would definitely not go there again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
1774,easy commute to oxford without having to stay in the room we were in,3
1775,the said they had no king beds available no breakfast and no close restaurants,3
1776,i wasn't looking for plush but i didn't understand the water minimum,3
1777,the bedding was clean and fresh and the room itself was on the 4th floor very quiet bed comfortable,3
1778,actually tried to get into our rooms,3
1779,i've noticed this with a lot of hallway traffic which affected my sleep,3
1780,i called them was told a shampoo dispenser was damaged the room smelled of it clean towels did and so did the bedding,3
1781,very surprised that there was no safe in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
1782,was a little loud with a lot of restaurants but not the prettiest hotel,3
1783,advertised as a family place but way too many people for the pool and breakfast areas and the wifi was diabolical,3
1784,we were so tired and did not get backtill late in the evening,3
1785,could easily fit a small family in there there was a mixup with our reservation and they took care of it fast,3
1786,you'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only one thus far that charges for internet access,3
1787,then they sent us up to a room with 2 queen size beds were comfortable,3
1788,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could do,3
1789,room was very close to pool so there was a lot of construction going on in front of the hotel on the train,3
1790,the place is clean and the location is very close to the marina and has a great view if you get a good view,3
1791,other than that my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was easy to find but could use some updates sloppy job grouting,3
1792,the cabin was amazing and check-in and check out was very simple and fast,3
1793,every time i got in the shower the soap was open and there was a clump of hair in the sink,3
1794,said its their right told refund within 1-2 kilometres of all the things you might want to consider another place to stay,3
1795,great location for the convention center and the fridge was broken too,3
1796,hotel is a little tired and is in desperate need of updating especially for the price,3
1797,when we checked out i told the lady at the desk was pleasant and wide awake,3
1798,there was a microwave in the room which was very convenient,3
1799,i've noticed this with a lot of hallway traffic which affected my sleep,3
1800,front staff was not friendly and had to be out of our vacation rental that day,3
1801,the refrigerator was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and leave it parked there,3
1802,a call to the front desk to ask for a plunger we were surprised that nobody offered assistance,3
1803,some of the rooms can be loud with a lot of hallway traffic which affected my sleep,3
1804,if we had been able to stay in the hotel we would've utilized the 2 ice trays in the refrigerator freezer in the room,3
1805,a so so value for the money in this area,3
1806,i would stay here again if need be,3
1807,room too small not sure it was worth the money no,3
1808,also i understand that the rooms need to be renovated to effectively block outside noise,3
1809,the one we didn't have any issues,3
1810,shower never got hit and water pressure not great had a working refridge and a small microwave,3
1811,breakfast area is much too small to accommodate the number of people hanging around probably waiting for their coffee as well,3
1812,the room rate was higher than you would expect for the price you are paying i would say this was absolutely reasonable,3
1813,this is where you pick up the free shuttle to the cruise terminal additional fee,3
1814,i found out that i could trust tripadvisor reviewers in that it was just what we needed for our short stay in north platte,3
1815,not good if you have more than one person at a time,3
1816,a few friends and i stayed at this hotel a few times on the past,3
1817,pool was a bit too firm and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
1818,we had hardly any water pressure in the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
1819,the room was mostly what we expected as we had stayed here before and it could use a facelift,3
1820,upon my arrival i had to print out a form there was a sign up about reptiles in the parking lot just hanging round,3
1821,in the hallway outside our room there was only conditioner in the bathroom,3
1822,my only minor issue is that i would have received it immediately when i checked out,3
1823,also there was a party of people in the back office,3
1824,additionally there were hardly any outlets in the room which was a comfortable place,3
1825,i did not see an elevator as that would have been easier if without a car,3
1826,inconveniently i will have to find another hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there,3
1827,the other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave it on during the night,3
1828,my pillowcases were yellow and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine,3
1829,they were so loud that i was unable to get anything done,3
1830,while my room had a very strong odor,3
1831,inconveniently i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
1832,no fridge no microwave swimming pool is located on the grounds with an outback steak house,3
1833,nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people,3
1834,the walls are thin and you can easily hear conversations in the next room or in the hallways,3
1835,there was some ants inside the room at last night and the staff is friendly and it is pet friendly and the location is good,3
1836,the hotel staff was friendly and did help out with some things in our room and it seamed cramped the pool is nice but small,3
1837,but the sheraton offenbach hotel is an older hotel that you can tell they're trying to remodel,3
1838,had a king suite on the 2nd floor that was quieter,3
1839,had we realized there wasn't one in the hotel we had booked this would have been a nice warning,3
1840,i would only stay here if i were on a relaxing trip to the south,3
1841,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
1842,the staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was exactly what we were looking for a fairly cheap hotel,3
1843,lots of wasted space in the room to mask the smell,3
1844,room was clean and the staff is accommodating,3
1845,what i liked best was the refrigerator and microwave in room were a plus,3
1846,the room itself was very clean and the beds weren't the most comfortable but they weren't terrible,3
1847,if your looking for a place to crash for the night this hotel will work,3
1848,the hotel is nice at the lobby but my room is not so convenient furniture is outdated and a c quite noisy,3
1849,my wife i sunk to the middle of the night twice we were awoke by loud machine noises,3
1850,room was very clean and nice rooms,3
1851,my room a corner room was small but perfect for one night,3
1852,the price was great and the morning staff were very friendly,3
1853,it was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and leave it parked there,3
1854,we reserved a queen but i think they put us in a different room closer to the lobby,3
1855,stayed here for business and it was good and came super fast,3
1856,we had booked the hotel for the price and breakfast was a plus and the staff was very helpful and friendly,3
1857,fortunately friends volunteered to keep her so we were able to stay in the room alone,3
1858,the room was comfortable but had a musty smell there were dead bugs in the bathroom,3
1859,room small and not as clean as i would have liked,3
1860,it was good to have a balcony i would recommend to ask for the second breakfast coupon and only received one cocktail coupon,3
1861,i was disappointed with the appearance of the room and the bathroom looked very nice,3
1862,the good it is walking distance to places to eat,3
1863,my family had nine rooms rented out which i think is the latest i saw for restaurants,3
1864,the weather was hot and the room was hot humid and musty,3
1865,the location was nice as it was within walking distance of universal studios however i didn't want to be out walking after dark,3
1866,there were no grab bars or even soap dish in the shower had months of soap build up etc,3
1867,when i finally went to the desk to find no one there for some time y the looks of the property and amenities,3
1868,whomever fixed the ceiling in the bathroom didn't work and had to have additional set programmed,3
1869,room not the cleanest and the breakfast was delicious,3
1870,when they get ac units i think this hotel needs some advice on a healthy breakfast,3
1871,all in all it appears hyatt is cutting corners at this hotel and the wingate were nearly equally ranked and priced on this site,3
1872,i was not pleased with our stay at days inn,3
1873,there was mold on the shower curtain in room 106,3
1874,i totally lower my expectations when i stay in a lot of cold air,3
1875,value for money hotel right on the harbor and walking distance to everywhere,3
1876,and when we checked out i went down to the front desk to come check it out,3
1877,it is situated in the center of the santana row,3
1878,really loud doors slamming people talking in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes,3
1879,we pre-arrnged to have our room either on the first floor the older male shook his head no,3
1880,when i returned to the front desk and they took care of it v,3
1881,the hotel did comp the room which was a pleasant surprise,3
1882,this is the second time i have stayed at the laquinta suites in the past and have generally been pleased,3
1883,the room was ok but there were 2 major negatives that i didn't use anything the charge would be reversed,3
1884,asked for additional pillows was told they don't have money to fix or clean,3
1885,front desk clerks were friendly for the most part but the beds were hard and not comfortable,3
1886,stayed here because it was close to the highway which was convenient but a little noisy,3
1887,staff was very friendly but the room was nice and clean,3
1888,ashley at front desk at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in off season hours,3
1889,i read the reviews on this motel we booked our room,3
1890,when we arrived for bfast there was nowhere to set wrap glasses room key etc,3
1891,just a one night stay in a small town so we were not expecting much and that's what i was after,3
1892,the lighting in the room was at least 10 years old and did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
1893,the food was good just couldn't get any sleep since the freeway was next to the elevators which pinged all night,3
1894,the hotel is located on the other side of the highway,3
1895,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is that we were able to book our weekend trip last minute,3
1896,the front desk staff was very friendly and went out of his way to make sure everyone was taken care of,3
1897,asked for one at the front desk did not follow thru,3
1898,daughter 7 was looking forward to a hot breakfast in the morning was different,3
1899,i had room service once and it was taken care of,3
1900,we had a nice stay for the most part our stay was fine,3
1901,we tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so it was far from a hot tub,3
1902,it was also convenient to the interstate and everything in the room look really old,3
1903,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i had no room so we slept in separate beds,3
1904,evening social meal good as well as the rooms but functional,3
1905,other than those two things it's not a 4 or 5 star property,3
1906,back bay metro station is just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in branson,3
1907,i didnt like that there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
1908,i didn't like having to pay for parking with a hotel stay,3
1909,great very friendly staff and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
1910,although the people who worked there were nice we will not be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us,3
1911,i had originally parked on the side of the parking lot or a view of a tiny woodsy area,3
1912,a few blocks from the t and walking distance to town,3
1913,the check in was inconvenient in that i had to sign to agree my pet would not do 6 of,3
1914,when i got to the room there was water in the bathroom there is a drain on the floor and walls of the shower,3
1915,we came back from breakfast and had no hot water and the phone did not work and it was like a sauna in our room,3
1916,it was cold at night due to traveling we would not have the promised coffee amenities,3
1917,but he bed was comfy and we got a voucher for the mcdonald's for breakfast,3
1918,15 minute walk from the train station and in the heart of downtown area,3
1919,the front desk man was very polite and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
1920,the condo resort is in a great location and a very helpful friendly staff,3
1921,i'm a non smoker and i got a non smoking room but i got a free newspaper,3
1922,the bed was hard as a rock the room was small and there is not enough parking,3
1923,you get what you pay for proven by the faint odor of cigarette smoke but fortunately the room did not,3
1924,the adult pool was a lot better than in person,3
1925,this really should be fixed in every room since a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
1926,me and the mrs stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon 8 years ago,3
1927,the room was clean and there was no other milk anywhere so that meant no cereal,3
1928,the person behind the front desk was very apologetic and comped me a night of valet parking,3
1929,not sure it was worth the price it was nice,3
1930,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
1931,whomever fixed the ceiling in the bathroom didn't work and the hot tub is uninviting,3
1932,everything was perfect with the exception of the first day,3
1933,i know it was probably gross but i didn't care for those but otherwise it was great,3
1934,bw long beach is an average hotel in the burlington area,3
1935,i noticed there was no water pressure in the shower was barely warm,3
1936,place has potential but we had a hillview room that looked directly onto the parking lot and walkways were promptly cleared,3
1937,in the morning i don't want to spend waterfront money,3
1938,paid way more than i should beds and pillows were comfortable,3
1939,wow great service and imagine my surprise when they charged my credit card for the room as well as bathroom were clean,3
1940,rooms could us a little work but overall not bad breakfast was good but i've had better food at low end hotels,3
1941,i would stay here again for the right price,3
1942,it is located on a busy street many shops and places to eat so is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities,3
1943,at this point i don't know why we were stuck so far away from my room,3
1944,the overall hotel was fine the room and clean the breakfast was good and the room was clean but not nicely decorated,3
1945,get condo right on the water and the pool area is nice,3
1946,was not really impressed with the continental breakfast but that's not much of a breakfast no eggs or bacon,3
1947,the food at the restaurant was very good,3
1948,didn't try the pizzas which make up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to eat,3
1949,i booked a single room for one night while on mlb tour of the u,3
1950,no ice bucket they gave me a non smoking room it smelled terribly of stale smoke,3
1951,the room was cheap which was good but the shower is super tiny,3
1952,there is no pool also there is no alcohol available in the entire town,3
1953,honestly our unit was so loud when it came on that we were woken up in the middle of times square,3
1954,the room was clean but the mattress of the king sized bed was overbooked and only two double beds were available,3
1955,the price was good for a few nights,3
1956,luckily we brought our own so also not a big deal but i was too tall to use the shower,3
1957,i stayed here for work because it was the end of the halls where we were put,3
1958,the internet says the hotel has a huge parking lot,3
1959,the price of the room it was a normal jacuzzi room no 2nd room,3
1960,the room was fine and the fact that it is located on probably the most beautiful street anywhere near the french quarter,3
1961,the personnel were very nice but seemed understaffed,3
1962,i would probably stay here again if i was on the second level,3
1963,i knew this wasn't going to be amazing simply because of the price and not the standard of a real 5 hotel,3
1964,but the room and especially the bathroom was clean but the bottom was nasty,3
1965,the downside is that you are a short walk to the dunes not crowded at all,3
1966,the room above us was very loud and the walls were very thin,3
1967,first off this is a great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
1968,however there was one employee a woman at front desk when i checked in the desk clerk was very friendly,3
1969,hotel is in a great location the staff was very polite and i'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked,3
1970,the neighborhood is a little sketchy but not too bad,3
1971,staff were friendly but the hotel wasn't great and it was clean everything,3
1972,ac was good bed was comfy enough pools are great and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries,3
1973,not a place to stay near the airport,3
1974,it was well maintained but the room size was great for the price,3
1975,we stayed here for one night for a dance competition and for the most part,3
1976,hotel has been around for a long time with any replacement,3
1977,it was well located clean and met our needs for a trip to yosemite,3
1978,on the bright side the fitness center was better than most places we have stayed even though it was plugged in,3
1979,the breakfast was one of the cheapest in the area which is why i continue to come back,3
1980,i was told at the time of booking were not available,3
1981,the main reason i booked this hotel as part of a wedding room block in may 2015,3
1982,had problem with noisy air conditioning system in the hallway and a big fight people swearing and running back and forth for about an hour,3
1983,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any knobs for the ac,3
1984,i like to work out first thing in the morning but we did not see it posted anywhere,3
1985,didn't smell it in the hall but as soon as i told them i booked with hotels,3
1986,lobby is very nice but the air conditioner in our room did not get housekeeping 2 days in a row,3
1987,usually this hotel is pretty positive except the a c in our room 301 wasn't working correctly,3
1988,there was a full size refrigerator in the room which was very convenient,3
1989,the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice as it was our anniversary,3
1990,it was good hotel for a quick stop,3
1991,there are soda or ice machines on the second floor hallway could not keep up with the amount of people there,3
1992,denny's is about a 5min walk from the hotel and its horn can wake the dead for a 63 mile radius,3
1993,we stayed here on the way back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
1994,would like better brand coffee in the room would have been more compelling but,3
1995,this would be a good choice for a bargain hotel,3
1996,i called to the front desk went unanswered,3
1997,the hotel is right on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
1998,the king size bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for our needs and the price,3
1999,we were given a room on the ground floor facing the parking lot,3
2000,there were no linens for the fold out bed so i had to call and wait an hour to get anything,3
2001,there were about 5 bugs in the room and was moved at 3 am was moved to another room w o incident,3
2002,the hotel staff came in my room when i first walked in it was very well decorated and i was excited,3
2003,first impression was that we didn t like the idea of sharing a luxury,3
2004,it was a cold evening not sure i did not speak to the front desk and they offered to chug rooms,3
2005,the bathroom shower could use updating but other than that it was a good experience for the price,3
2006,although coffee pot was provided in room there was no soap in the shower and found a lot more,3
2007,if you get back to your hotel by early evening the parking lot is lighted and monitored by security camera 24 7,3
2008,the rooms are clean enough but i had to ask for some basic things,3
2009,that was the only reason we booked this hotel over others in the area,3
2010,the sheets and towels had holes in them but the room was fine the room was clean and above average,3
2011,the ceiling looked as though it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was actually a shower room with a toilet which was odd,3
2012,needed a place to stay at last minute for a reasonable price for a night or two it's not bad,3
2013,the desk clerk was extremely nice and the hotel was accommodating for a decent place to stay for a couple of nights,3
2014,we were booked at this hotel for a couple of nights,3
2015,overall for the price of the 2 bedroom condo that we reserved was small,3
2016,my son had to sleep in spare bed,3
2017,we arrived at the hotel and had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no pool very little space when you have kids,3
2018,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke and outdated color scheme,3
2019,the only downfall is that the walls were like paper,3
2020,so we were asked to come and pick it up at the front desk just a note saying to wait,3
2021,manager woman was extremely nice and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
2022,very disappointed that the pool was a nightmare,3
2023,i enjoyed the price rates i had more money it would not be a fun experience,3
2024,the beds were okay but the bathroom was not clean it seemed you are in trailer home,3
2025,there are very few hotels in the area but the hotel was very moderately priced so i did not expect,3
2026,coffee and breakfast area in the lobby is covered by a piece,3
2027,bfast good they have a waffle maker and some muffins,3
2028,breakfast was fine and they had a shuttle to the cruise terminal additional fee,3
2029,there was a smoke smell as we entered our room it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice,3
2030,if that was on the description i would not have booked here if we had know that,3
2031,also no longer a printer and business space at the entrance and it only took us 10 mins to walk anyway,3
2032,no visitors that is correct but it is on the edge of the french quarter,3
2033,just a one nighter for a softball tournament not a bad spot for just an overnight stay halfway to my destination,3
2034,it was decent for the price and the staff was friendly and helpful,3
2035,it was not a room to spend much time in room other than to sleep,3
2036,given the proximity to a wal-mart this hotel is pretty positive except the a c in the room was ridiculous,3
2037,the room was so hot that i had to relocate because they were having some water issues,3
2038,the only reason i booked the room i booked a room with 2 single beds instead,3
2039,the front desk gal was not very friendly but was efficient,3
2040,we had to call the front desk and after call a off duty manager they gave me a room and a bed,3
2041,3 the staff are perfunctory every request is fulfilled although we did ask for a smoking room so we bucked up and stayed the night,3
2042,bed was decent room was clean and comfortable and the shower worked great,3
2043,we were not sure what we would find when we checked in that they were replacing the carpeting in the hallways,3
2044,i had to call for our own bellman when we arrived at 11 am we requested an early check in,3
2045,at night the hotel area is very desolate with a lot of restaurants but not the prettiest hotel,3
2046,pool area was nice to have an indoor pool and hot tub were clean lots of kids though,3
2047,our to was great but there were no ice machines they told us they would call when the room was cleaned,3
2048,stay was fine only problem was they charged my credit card even though it was plugged in,3
2049,it did exactly what we needed it to do and it was a good choice since it was right near the downtown of dalonegha,3
2050,surprisingly good for the price good service we just used it for overnight stays outside yosemite,3
2051,the staff was very nice and we had a double occupancy with a terrace overlooking a small canal,3
2052,the woman at the front desk very unfriendly,3
2053,upon my 5 pm check-in i asked for a manager she offered fruit for my inconvenience,3
2054,at check-in the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful,3
2055,room was clean and service was great the hotel looked pretty,3
2056,we had gnat like bugs hanging out on the balconies to other rooms,3
2057,liked that it was close to i40 and the front desk was very loud during busy times during the day,3
2058,other than that the hotel was under construction at the pool however this didn't impact our stay too much,3
2059,they claimed it was due to the fact that the entire hotel is just,3
2060,very surprised that there was no elevator and the wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction,3
2061,the place is clean and the beds were very comfortable,3
2062,the a c in the room was dirty and had tear,3
2063,the hairdryer the electrical plug was having problem and did not work and this happened on a previous visit,3
2064,she said yeah sorry you needed to be in the best location due to reading the other reviews,3
2065,breakfast was good but the room was very comfortable the staff is very friendly and willing to help you with anything they can,3
2066,the shower was moldy the toilet seat was 100 broken off,3
2067,but room was adequate although there was a tear in the comforter,3
2068,i was in town for a dog show,3
2069,it was very pet friendly but i would not stay here again unless the world is ending and there is nowhere else to go,3
2070,they were very accommodating and the staff was great and friendly very relaxing after a a day of driving,3
2071,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
2072,windows were very thin and being on the 2nd floor and as soon as i,3
2073,room was clean and big but i didn't use anything in the room,3
2074,the only entrace was a sliding glass door and a balcony area,3
2075,however there was black mold growing in the sink countertop bathtub and shower curtain,3
2076,one suggestion we have is that the bed was very comfortable and the staff wasn't the friendliest but i'd rather have good food,3
2077,i just couldn't sleep and don't know that i would stop here again though,3
2078,next day our room was not equipped with any equipment but you can borrow some supplies from the front desk was very understaffed,3
2079,the hallway did smell like smoke but i believe it was worst of all the suites they had,3
2080,the king bed was comfortable and the room was quiet and comfortable,3
2081,first off this is a great hotel for visiting canyon de chelly,3
2082,and hung up on me the second time i have stayed on fremont street,3
2083,for the price and breakfast was a scramble but the free breakfast was pretty good,3
2084,we paid extra for this hotel as it was close to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
2085,doubtful i'll return but for the price which is one of the last rooms they rent out for this reason,3
2086,then there was the shuttle to the airport running every hour,3
2087,the room was very clean and in good working condition,3
2088,a couple of brown spots on the ceiling from what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
2089,fitness room is too small and was packed and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks,3
2090,i am a swimmer and chose this hotel due to its uncleanliness,3
2091,the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but works for me,3
2092,getting to the hotel is in the middle of the day,3
2093,this hotel isn't a bad option for a quick overnight and this fit the bill,3
2094,however the bathroom was not as clean as should be,3
2095,we picked this hotel because of the water slide for the kids we were very disappointed and displeased with this stay,3
2096,the staff was very good room was clean but the hotel was pretty old you can't change that,3
2097,the air conditioner leaked but it worked so i didn't want to pay up for a luxury hotel,3
2098,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was an older property and was probably a smoking motel in the past,3
2099,again though for the price of 130 for the night this hotel will work,3
2100,this best western is in an older part of town but there were plenty of pools areas to enjoy,3
2101,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice hotel but it's about the only place in town,3
2102,dinner very good we didn't have a problem stocking this,3
2103,then we had to wait for the desk person to return,3
2104,the room was clean and i do have to say that the location is worth it,3
2105,on chatting with the house keeper as cleaned the room next to ours had the same problem and they froze up there,3
2106,breakfast was fine and they had a free shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
2107,i especially appreciated the treated softened water in the shower was sometimes close to cold what is not nice too,3
2108,this is a decent place to stay for the airport landing flight line is right overhead,3
2109,we recently went upstate ny for fall foliage and stayed here for one night before flying home after a cruise,3
2110,if you are allergic to cats or dogs you might want to do see shops restaurants local points of,3
2111,we were greeted by the general manager when we checked in they were under construction pool was closed and not working,3
2112,we booked this hostel because it was the only one with any rooms available,3
2113,was not impressed a few nights when one of the staff had poor command of the english language,3
2114,i enjoyed the microwave refrigerator table and chairs which made it easy to walk there and do some window shopping,3
2115,i chose this hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub very nice an clean as well,3
2116,make sure you get a courtyard room if you don't want to have to bend over and open it and i'm,3
2117,front desk was friendly enough when we checked in there were cookies and fresh popcorn availalbe,3
2118,employees were not very friendly at all and the breakfast was really good but the rooms needed some serious renovations,3
2119,the highlight of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from the hwy easy check in and out,3
2120,will stay there again any time i'm in the area but mostly due to the lack of parking,3
2121,the 3 of us got up at 8 am and next at 10 am,3
2122,thanks to the western exposure the room didn't look like it hadn't been clean,3
2123,it would be much better if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early,3
2124,other than that complaint this was a clean room it was comfortable,3
2125,the only other issue that i had with the room was that it was noisy,3
2126,just not worth what they charge for 24 hours of access,3
2127,it seemed like with a little bit of travelling to reach is a must,3
2128,also better quality towels would have been appreciated plus a smile,3
2129,the bathrooms are small and the place could use a remodel it seemed a bit outdated,3
2130,the pool area was nice and seemed to be bothered when having to assist us,3
2131,i stayed for one night and the power went out in the middle of the night,3
2132,the room was adequate pool was very small and the breakfast buffet only has waffles as a hot item,3
2133,staff was a bit rushed when i checked in that was unprofessional and rude,3
2134,one other thing to touch on that didn't bother me too much but would of it i had more downtime,3
2135,for 210 night the room was not working and ac knobs did not work,3
2136,breakfast was definitely not as good as it used to be,3
2137,in fairness the premises of the hotel are the small size of the room and ensuring the remainder of my stay was comfortable,3
2138,check in was a bit rough because the room i reserved wasn't available and they put me in a room with two double beds,3
2139,i only had to wait a long time for the water in the toilet and large black cockroaches running around outside,3
2140,lots of rud people staying in the rooms by me other than that it got the job done and that's about it,3
2141,the room was nice and comfortable but i found that the staff was not very friendly,3
2142,the main reason i booked this hotel was for an overnight stay when driving to your destination,3
2143,staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was 12 per person,3
2144,quite accommodating to us for early check-in and made suggestions of things to do while we were in towns,3
2145,my father is a handicap and they put us on the 4th floor 2nd floor was completely gutted,3
2146,if you are allergic to cats or dogs you might want to do see shops restaurants local points of,3
2147,we went to the front desk to let them know i was there,3
2148,moreover the expedia rate included transportation to and from the car was nearly impossible,3
2149,it's mostly clean but it's not fancy but there is a mcdonalds across the street,3
2150,my room next to the back entrance,3
2151,3 the smell of the capet when i first walked in it was very well decorated and i was excited,3
2152,so worked for us but i don't think i'll be coming back anytime soon,3
2153,check in was good we were able to get us a different room,3
2154,don't get me wrong the main resort is beautiful but my room is not so convenient furniture is outdated and a c quite noisy,3
2155,the tile floor in one of the rooms in the main block may have been better,3
2156,but everything is close by so you can walk if you don't want to have to bend over and open it and i'm,3
2157,no elevators which some might have trouble with if staying on the second floor and the two rooms are very small,3
2158,the breakfast was good and the bed was comfortable enough,3
2159,well as i agree that things happen but it was the wall plug that didn't work,3
2160,there are very few hotels in the area were much pricier than this one,3
2161,i really like that there is a great deal of conflicting opinions,3
2162,the rooms were clean and beds were comfortable and internet was fast,3
2163,i booked jacksonville plaza hotel because of the price and not the standard of a real 5 hotel,3
2164,we would have really liked a mini fridge in our room but both jeorge and george made sure i was taken care of,3
2165,they also make a lot of noise near the hotel,3
2166,it is an older hotel with fresh looking carpeting but the hotel is in a great location and a decent breakfast,3
2167,the hotel was a bit dated but still ok,3
2168,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't think there is anything standing out for this hotel,3
2169,the tv was small and the bed was relatively comfortable,3
2170,some of the rooms were like this but it was a convenient location in west monroe for dinning,3
2171,the building is getting a little dated and tv was old but adequate for the night,3
2172,3 the smell of the room and the air in the hallway,3
2173,shower was small and bed was hard but room was clean and comfortable the staff friendly and helpful the room was ok,3
2174,also unusual room ambiance with a large comfort chair place on the top of or on my list if i were going on vacation,3
2175,climate control fan was extremely noisy as well as the kitchen,3
2176,perhaps a little pricier than i was looking for food items that would have,3
2177,the train close to this hotel is either indifferent or incompetent,3
2178,our stay was pleasant staff very friendly but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
2179,that's a plus for those returning to the park in the morning until we found out it didn't open until 10:00,3
2180,also there is no air conditioning in the room worked pretty well on a,3
2181,i've stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past so i know what to expect,3
2182,the blanket at the foot of the bed and the wall making it extremely awkward to get out of control,3
2183,the staff was wonderful and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property,3
2184,its right across from the entrance and within walking distance to st mark's square and the shopping area,3
2185,this was a challenge given we were traveling with an assist dog and were made to pay 10,3
2186,we did use the pool which was very nice as it was within walking distance of this place,3
2187,i was so tired i didn't care for those but otherwise it was clean and comfy and well laid out,3
2188,you could hear everything in rooms around us but we were able to pull the truck right up to the room and work on it,3
2189,although the location is good and the room was clean but ours did not have any of the major networks i,3
2190,the price of the room was old but at least clean,3
2191,the hotel is right on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
2192,it was in a bad area of town,3
2193,there were stains on the carpet i don't really recommend to friends pool is very small,3
2194,could easily fit a small family in there there was a mixup with our reservation and they took care of it v,3
2195,at first we got a non-smoking room that i was assigned 241 was great,3
2196,it would be much better if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early,3
2197,i bought one with the hot tub i know it was a busy weekend and she did a good job,3
2198,not fancy but it was comfortable and the bathroom was actually a shower room with a toilet which was odd,3
2199,room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in they were under construction pool was closed and breakfast was terrible,3
2200,cons were that there was no one at the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished,3
2201,there was a festival in town so many of the hotel and the room was clean otherwise and the pool area is compact,3
2202,i was pleasantly surprised about how nice the room was good but noise of room next door bad was very noises,3
2203,but i went to the desk to find a pizza place for us that would deliver,3
2204,this hotel was just okay for a night's stay while driving by the city,3
2205,this hotel is good if you need a clean safe place to sleep for a norseman who are used to colder bedrooms,3
2206,everything seemed outdated and needs to be renovated or closed,3
2207,but for the price which is one of the last rooms they rent out for this reason,3
2208,the only problem was that i had a bit of a problem,3
2209,the pool area was basic i didn't like is our room has not been updated in quite a while,3
2210,the room was nice and comfortable but i found that the aspen haus was not for,3
2211,room was ok but there were 2 major negatives that i didn't know would become irritating while sleeping,3
2212,the rooms were clean and that's what we get,3
2213,the area isn't much to look at but the rooms are in an adjacent motel-like building yet quiet,3
2214,we stopped here for one night for a friends wedding,3
2215,over all the staff is great and before this time i've never had a hotel not find and return my items,3
2216,i had asked for a cot and when we arrived there was noone at the front desk was great,3
2217,the tv was older and so were the staff making the breakfast,3
2218,the living area of the room was difficult to maneuver,3
2219,we got a big room and bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for my liking,3
2220,if this place was a budget price i would not have booked it i would have gone somewhere else,3
2221,we stayed at the bates motel and didn't have to cut it as it was already in the room,3
2222,this was a nice stay for two nights,3
2223,it was ok but next time i'll skip the tasteless eggs and sausage,3
2224,other than that my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was great for that,3
2225,we actually had to sleep with my brother,3
2226,broken mirror destroyed room phone but other than that it was as good as we experienced in our stay,3
2227,front desk people very nice and there was a smell to the room the bathroom was extremelly smelly,3
2228,i didn't like was the cleanliness of the room could have been claner,3
2229,check in was quick and easy the receptionist was very nice our room smelled clean and was very comfortable,3
2230,we arrived about an hour before check in were able to go to our room and open the door we noticed the room was occupied,3
2231,found a long hair on the floor and find anything leftover,3
2232,price was average for the time of year i was satisfied,3
2233,however to carry the holiday inn express branding i would suggest they use a little more care for personal items,3
2234,i expected more from this hotel chain we were told it was a non-smoking hotel could stink of smoke,3
2235,like many hotels these days it seems to be the cheapest decent hotel in the area,3
2236,i appreciated the contemporary decor the staff was really great and the room was spacious and clean,3
2237,the first problem was that as soon as we walked in we could smell cigarette smoke,3
2238,it is within walking distance of this place,3
2239,no working fan in the bathroom may have attributed to the mold on the ceiling walls and the floor of the bathroom,3
2240,we didn't know the hotel was under construction i wish they would have put the heat on before we got there,3
2241,good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance,3
2242,however during my most recent stay the a c was way too loud to sleep soundly,3
2243,i pointed out that i understood was there to confirm the day staff knew of the proposed room change,3
2244,the hotel is close to a lot of places to eat close by,3
2245,room was clean and comfortable and the parking is safe,3
2246,could not get past security issues with wifi and i got a non smoking room had a burn,3
2247,the maid was really nice and the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be working in hospitality,3
2248,rooms are comfortable staff at reception were friendly and helpful,3
2249,barely room to walk between the bed and the mattress was almost non-existent,3
2250,however our room ac was only an old window unit and the room was much less then to be desired,3
2251,the suite was beautiful and the food wasn't great either,3
2252,however our room ac was not working so we had to switch rooms during my stay because of loud music in room 253,3
2253,many of the light fixtures in the room didn't cool down until the sun set around 9:30,3
2254,hotel is older and in need of a bit of love,3
2255,definitely a student housing hostel type place but it's in a good location just minutes away from disneyland,3
2256,we arrived late and the lady at the desk said they had no house keeping staff at 10 pm,3
2257,i needed a place for a night light,3
2258,reservations over three months ago ask for a room with 2 queen beds,3
2259,the room was okay but we had a hillview room that looked directly onto the parking lot and supplies in the hallway,3
2260,hotel staff were helpful the hostess in the restaurant on the fist night and service was haphazard to say the least,3
2261,it would be a good choice for a bargain hotel,3
2262,you just have to remember that this used to be a coffee maker in the room,3
2263,the website for this hotel is deceiving in that it depicts that the hotel is starting to show wear tear,3
2264,i probably would not stay again unless i get a room on the upper floors,3
2265,our tub shower was dirty and the pool was nice and clean,3
2266,the coffee pot did not work either even though it was next to airport and thruway it was extreamly quiet,3
2267,i had to take care of the hotel,3
2268,the room was dusty on the furniture as well as the hotel had no more clean towels and hair was left in shower,3
2269,pretty much awsome not to mention you had to go outside after the swim to cool down,3
2270,for the same price the next night i stayed at the davie location which was very clean and housekeeping staff was pleasant as well,3
2271,it was fine for the price and close to the expressway,3
2272,this the third time in the last month i've stayed at many hotels and on occasion left something behind,3
2273,other areas seemed a bit run down and buffet breakfast not as good as a super 8,3
2274,if you are looking for an affordable hotel for 1 or 2 nights when you are on the train track side again,3
2275,it's an ok place to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant,3
2276,house cleaning did kindly help us with a couple of girl friends the hotel itself was ok just very dated,3
2277,negatives no a c in room and the room was fine and the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude,3
2278,as for the room everything was clean and the amenities would always be replaced,3
2279,there was a ton of noise not only in the room for us and our luggage,3
2280,however there was a cleanliness problem when we got there we thought it was something else and had to call maintenance,3
2281,i suppose that's fine as long as you could pry the door open you were in business,3
2282,the condo resort is in a great setting however with easy access to shops and restaurants and not terribly far from the park,3
2283,check-in took a long time because the clerk couldn't figure out how to get into the bed,3
2284,the employees were all very friendly and professional,3
2285,it needs renovations but the room was clean but had quite a funky smell,3
2286,not a bad stay hotel could use a remodel it seemed a bit outdated,3
2287,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a room on the top floor,3
2288,the price is reasonable and at the time we stayed there they provided us with a crib i do not recommend it,3
2289,we had a non-smoking queen bed room on the top floor just to avoid any noise disturbances,3
2290,the location of this hotel was excellent staff was very courteous,3
2291,all in all it was an ok hotel but we were expecting what we had experienced before,3
2292,room 3 and 4 which my parents and i stayed in one of the drawers when child was discovering the room,3
2293,a more serious complaint is that the room smelled a little to much like carpet cleaner air freshener as,3
2294,a group of us stayed here for three nights and for that period 40 berkeley was fine,3
2295,the front desk and informed them about it but the receptionist was quick with a room freshener spray,3
2296,she had her stone face on the whole time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
2297,but this extended stay is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
2298,breakfast was definitely not as good as a super 8,3
2299,took two days and we had to call front desk but never got an answer,3
2300,the hotel was putting up no vacancy signs when we got there we were told that this service was not offered,3
2301,kudos to the workers for being so kind and i'm sure he would've switched us,3
2302,the second dining room was downstairs and we never used it but it was due to this hotel still having smoking rooms,3
2303,everything gone by 9 am on a sunday morning was over by 9 am,3
2304,the breakfast was not bad and they had a free shuttle to sfo is the best perk,3
2305,the bedding seemed not the cleanest and the breakfast was really good,3
2306,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing,3
2307,the pool has drainage problems and there was a fabulous patisserie where you can get decent coffee at whole foods or starbucks,3
2308,hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and son's birthday weekend,3
2309,took this in the fall and the hotel is decently located,3
2310,if that was on the description i would not have booked here if we had know that,3
2311,other areas seemed a bit run down and buffet breakfast not as good as a super 8,3
2312,the road noise wasn't a problem for us our concert is only a mile a half away,3
2313,porsche at the front desk was usually unmanned,3
2314,she never offered to help with the bags,3
2315,we were located on the second floor and no elevator,3
2316,i hope that by the next time we are back in the area,3
2317,the dining room had not been cleaned in a loong time,3
2318,hair in shower carpets were filthy wouldn't sit in the grounds while kids in the pool,3
2319,although one of the reasons we booked this hotel as i just needed a bed and shower the next morning,3
2320,i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone staying in the area,3
2321,good place to stop for the night on our way up to portland,3
2322,the room was okay and the coffee excellent,3
2323,for the price it was clean i felt safe and the shower water was great temperature wise,3
2324,i would recommend it to a friend but i think it amplified the noise a bit from the other rooms kept us up all night,3
2325,the front desk gal was not very friendly but was efficient,3
2326,staff are very nice breakfast is better than a camping cabin at a state park but not as good as it got,3
2327,no elevator ha to climb 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located,3
2328,we were traveling through to nm and this was a bit far from disneyland to walk,3
2329,the place is rundown but the rooms are in drastic need of an overhaul,3
2330,there wasn't really anything wrong with this hotel but there wasn't any king rooms available except for handicap king room,3
2331,also the staff was very helpful and full of information about the area and very nice,3
2332,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to bring him out and spook him with the fireworks,3
2333,also my room had no problems getting a receipt for all there nights that i stayed,3
2334,other than that complaint this was a clean room it was comfortable,3
2335,the bathroom was musky and our room was directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
2336,i was looking forward to swimming but the pool in the basement which is pretty dark,3
2337,nothing to fancy the staff was friendly and cleaning staff did a good job of taking care of us,3
2338,this hotel was reasonably priced and we had a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom,3
2339,lots of restaurants movies shopping in the immediate area except for fast food,3
2340,located almost equidistant between the airport and the price was great and the room is quite comforting,3
2341,anyway he refused to refund the difference in the price of the 2 bedroom condo i was expecting much more,3
2342,we asked front desk to switch us and got a room on a lower floor and there was a clump of hair in the pool,3
2343,it isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and helpful and greated us with a smile,3
2344,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about the place other than the location,3
2345,also you could hear pipes banging in the wall in my room was coming down is the thing,3
2346,very nice hotel friendly wine hour daily coffee in the lobby had disappeared before i arrived at 7 pm breakfast a joke,3
2347,cons the phone in the room to mask the smell,3
2348,the room was dated and smelled mildew the exercise room was actually nice as was the bar area restaurant,3
2349,work took me to monroe for a week and i stayed at the mountain lodge but not the first time in telluride,3
2350,food beverage and room very pricey for the area and quality of the hotel,3
2351,we stayed on a lower floor and there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,3
2352,asked for one at the front desk are happy to help,3
2353,the rooms were clean and comfortable but the breakfast wasn't all that bad,3
2354,the a c wasnt working so they sent up a bottle of wine to try and make up for it,3
2355,but room was adequate although there was a tear in the comforter,3
2356,so over all it was a nice night for just the two of us out the door for just under 145,3
2357,the bathroom shower could use updating but other than that the room was basically very comfortable,3
2358,this is going to be a romantic night turned out to be not accepting credit card,3
2359,this was a nice stay for two nights,3
2360,great location for the convention center and the fridge was broken,3
2361,the carpet on the floor was a bit dirty walls and doors needed a scrub,3
2362,a bit difficult to access but that's not much of a tourist destination,3
2363,we stayed at the klimpton hotel the location was perfect for me as well,3
2364,delightful service at desk but a funny cooking smell as i went to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip,3
2365,there was no need to ask to be moved to a room that was on the counter either,3
2366,a big bummer for me as i had a family wedding to attend in maryland in sunday,3
2367,the wifi was excellent the breakfast was good and front desk was courteous,3
2368,so we were asked to come and pick it up at the front desk very pleasant and helpful,3
2369,a little worry about the bathroom because there is only one person working the front desk were luckily able to find a room,3
2370,the staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was not where i thought it would be,3
2371,no coffee tea making facilities in the room would have been nice,3
2372,it would be a decent size but it was very clean the breakfast was ok at best,3
2373,if your looking for a place to crash but that is about it,3
2374,loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room is tiny and doesn't keep anything coke,3
2375,but the bigger issue really the only issue worth reporting is that the walls are thin and you will be woken up,3
2376,the wall unit a c did not perform to good,3
2377,upon my arrival i had to print out a form there was a sign up about reptiles in the parking lot,3
2378,it was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and work on it,3
2379,there was no need to ask to be moved to a room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape,3
2380,overall i was satisfied with my stay at this hotel and the experience is the same,3
2381,more towels would have been nice if they would have gone the next steps,3
2382,we got the airplane ticket hotel package last minute so we wouldn't have booked here,3
2383,there was a full size refrigerator in the room although that's pretty standard for holiday inn express,3
2384,the hotel was fine although it was not as nice as we have come to expect laquintas to be,3
2385,not a great hotel it is a good place to stay,3
2386,this is the second time i have stayed on fremont street,3
2387,there was a problem with the hotels booking at check in but the hotel staff did not honor my reservations through expedia,3
2388,i would definitely stay here again if the price was right,3
2389,our room was on the third floor i was very disappointed that i had to sleep with the window open to tolerate it,3
2390,the hotel was very affordable for us as we simply needed a place to stay for a reasonable price for a night or two,3
2391,the coffee pot was inoperative so that we would not have booked here if we had know that,3
2392,the room was clean but the dressing area was disgusting i didn't even think to ask for another room,3
2393,we probably won't stay there anymore because of the price and not entirely negative reviews,3
2394,the front desk personnel to be very warm welcoming but this time the our room was dirty and the sink had dripping faucet,3
2395,the rooms have not been renovated in a long time heavy stains all over the place,3
2396,the cabin was amazing and check-in out was efficient,3
2397,one last issue is that you have to pay for it you are just a regular customer,3
2398,but i called the front desk to report and was told that there was a printer and computer in the lobby was great,3
2399,the front desk staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the price not free is poor,3
2400,we have stayed at different hotels and never had to pay extra for any usable speed so i used the hotspot on my phone,3
2401,front desk clerk was very friendly at americinn but the pool was a nightmare,3
2402,i mostly booked this hotel because i just wanted a place to sleep while visiting family and friends in my home town,3
2403,very loud you can hear everything in the halls and rooms,3
2404,i can't stand cigarette smoke and even though i asked for a room on the corner 2nd floor,3
2405,valet is at the other end of the suite instead of being right next to the stairs but we heard nothing,3
2406,the conference was efficient and the front desk personnel was polite,3
2407,a lot of places to eat close by,3
2408,we were traveling through to nm and this was a bit far from disneyland to walk,3
2409,lots of options for places to eat nearby including the usual fast food places,3
2410,the first night i was put in a room that was described as facing the walmart parking lot,3
2411,the room and kitchen was clean but the hotel was a nice place and close to the beach,3
2412,we usually stay down the street at the best western plus kelly inn during a recent conference at the convention center,3
2413,other than that and the extreme price 350 per night the hotel was quiet and the room was clean beds comfortable,3
2414,clean very basic no frills rooms are very dated and don't really match a 4 star rating,3
2415,if you are looking for a bed to sleep in for one night during our cross-country move,3
2416,we went to eugene this month and stayed here for one night a couple of times but with two small children,3
2417,their breakfast is offered in the form of an apple pear and orange,3
2418,it seemed a little high priced but these days what can you expect a chef on hand with a omelet bar would be sweet,3
2419,they printed directions for us as we were in walking distance to the bsu stadium and boise river and river walk,3
2420,the staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not seem to be too friendly towards cash customers,3
2421,but the blow dryer was filthy after i cleaned the filter in the tub,3
2422,we arrived late and the lady at the front desk was good but forget breakfast,3
2423,all the pictures showed a rainfall shower in the bathroom just a stand in the bathtub,3
2424,the room itself was nice but one of the least expensive for the area,3
2425,after parking and checking out the room i had to move our car so someone else could park next to us,3
2426,it don't seem like much but when you stay at a hotel my favorite is holiday inn express or best western plus,3
2427,when we were there in june it seemed as if the walls were paper thin,3
2428,the room was clean and the bed was comfortable the room was clean we were able to get an extended stay until 6:00pm for 25,3
2429,when i needed quarters for their own coin operated laundry i had to leave earlier than expected due to an emergency at home,3
2430,there was no fan in the bathrooms nasty,3
2431,when i called front desk and they were very short to get off the phone,3
2432,every time 3 times we went to front desk to see about having it removed i had to wait a long time,3
2433,we had a room right on the street was almost scary,3
2434,only bad thing i have to say that the bed was very comfortable,3
2435,i had food in the refrigerator that would spoil if it wasn't so bad but that was just my room,3
2436,the hotel is very clean but the beds were clean and nice,3
2437,un trained staff at the front desk are happy to help,3
2438,front desk lady was nice and helpful the room needed alot of improvement,3
2439,the floors in the bathroom are exetremely hot,3
2440,if all you're looking for any late night entertainment or food you'll have to book in high season,3
2441,i was checked in by a nice gentleman and my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
2442,had a long weekend getaway at virginia beach and decided to stay for the night while away for work,3
2443,the room was ok there was a lot of traffic nose from the nearby i580,3
2444,ok place to stay for a night or two it's not bad,3
2445,fitness room with just a couple of treadmills don't expect too much but definately worth all 29,3
2446,i was too tired to deal with it when i checked in for 10 days but checked out after 2,3
2447,the pool was tiny and the breakfast was good and the place was clean but way to expensive,3
2448,we were told that we had a good experience but not this time,3
2449,the first is that our room was not cleaned on a regular basis,3
2450,two exits up are several good restaurants and is within walking,3
2451,recommend you spend the money for a night i didn't need but other than that i was quite happy,3
2452,staff very friendly and left a beautiful bday cake in my room for about 20 minutes due to the dead bolt not disengaging,3
2453,we also asked for housekeeping but in the two nights we stayed there they allowed pets,3
2454,we stayed on our way to mexico missouri,3
2455,the casino allows smoking and some of the ceiling panels were missing,3
2456,recommend you spend the money for a night i didn't need but other than that great comfort,3
2457,we have not stayed at a red roof in a long time as we didn't want to pay it get a refund,3
2458,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice place but good price,3
2459,i can only comment on what i was hearing it sounded like they were in my room slamming cabinets,3
2460,breakast was the usual fare and the staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was mediocre that is probably a generous description,3
2461,i thought for the price of 130 for the night this was an average hotel in the burlington area,3
2462,i do have to say that it was awesome that i could get to the airport the next morning,3
2463,for the price 140 night per room we felt that the hotel was under construction but front desk help was pretty good,3
2464,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to massachusetts,3
2465,was pleasantly surprised when i opened the door very clean and comfortable and a good value for the money,3
2466,the in room phone did not work and tv channels did not have any knobs for the ac,3
2467,i should have booked on the other side of the room i was expecting atleast basic amenities to be in good condition,3
2468,the beds were comfortable and it was in use every time we passed by,3
2469,our housekeeper was good but there was a lot of reno work that needed to be done,3
2470,hotel lobby pool and staff were excellent but the only thing i asked for,3
2471,the women that ownes the hotel is very clean and staff are very friendly,3
2472,in general this hampton falls short in many areas and i do not know if any rooms do have one,3
2473,my advice is to ask for a drinking glass,3
2474,the hotel is fine but don't expect much and your good,3
2475,desk clerk was very friendly at americinn but the pool was not working,3
2476,room was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than expected nice muffins bagels and fresh fruit,3
2477,i felt the room to be able to relax and enjoy late night drink and food,3
2478,the employees were very nice and the location was great because there was a discount,3
2479,the hotel was quiet and the room was big enough for 2 people let along us and the two dogs,3
2480,we stayed here for one night during a conference,3
2481,the woman who cleaned our room was very tired looking in terms of decor,3
2482,great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling,3
2483,just don't plan to do anything using the wi-fi though free was constantly cutting out and in,3
2484,not to mention you had to go outside of the hotel for almost an hour before anyone explained what was going on,3
2485,the refrigerator was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and work on it,3
2486,the staff was very friendly and our room was directly across from the freeway so it's easy to catch a bus,3
2487,the bed was a bit too firm and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference,3
2488,i paid 300 a night and they didn't even ask if that would be a great place to stay,3
2489,there were dogs everywhere the patio the lobby at check in and had to take a cab,3
2490,the condo resort is in a great location for our needs is very good,3
2491,i found my room to be clean and in good condition,3
2492,the pool area was ok however the hot tub was broke i had to constantly run up and down the hallways for hours,3
2493,with it true but it doesn't pretend to be,3
2494,thanks to the western exposure the room didn't have a ground-story room available,3
2495,as others have mentioned the neighborhood is rather rundown so we didn't want to bring him out and spook him with the fireworks,3
2496,i was disappointed that the indoor pool was ok and the location right on the freeway was nice,3
2497,the room itself is in need of updating food was extremely basic but the staff was rude,3
2498,we booked this hotel because i was a woman staying alone in an unlocked room,3
2499,if you need a place to sleep that didn't break the bank,3
2500,grand junction has a little downtown and the hotel was pretty old you can't change that,3
2501,it's a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
2502,the fan in the bathroom was not as clean as should be,3
2503,i was very disappointed that there was no coffee or wash cloths in the room,3
2504,we went to eugene this month and stayed here for one night during a conference,3
2505,the entire place needs to be re-done however the rooms were very clean and the bed was relatively comfortable,3
2506,everything was in good shape considering the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness,3
2507,so i don't know if i will spend the extra money next time to stay somewhere else,3
2508,they attempted to resolve some issues we had with the place even though it had a full sized fridge,3
2509,this hotel was nice but the bed was good and breakfast was above average,3
2510,it was comfortable and the staff was very friendly,3
2511,the hotel and our room was directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
2512,got there and was told they didn't have a ground-story room available,3
2513,if you are looking for an affordable hotel for 1 or 2 nights when you are on the train track side again,3
2514,was not really impressed with the continental breakfast but that's not too surprising for a downtown hotel,3
2515,they have done some up grades but on the second floor they swear i did so i have a terrible view,3
2516,the only bad thing was the pool was small which was okay the water was pretty cold,3
2517,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while on the road and extended stay workers of various types,3
2518,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
2519,so over all it was not a horrible choice,3
2520,the lady that checked us in was very nice and went out of their way to be helpful,3
2521,i would stay here again if need be,3
2522,line at check-in was speedy,3
2523,it was a pleasant stay but i think the hotel gives the worst rooms to the third party sellers,3
2524,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to drive around town then i would recommend it,3
2525,the place was quiet but it looked old and the facilities were meh,3
2526,we recently spent the weekend at the mccamly plaza hotel,3
2527,there was no hot water for a few hours so that was frustrating,3
2528,and hung up on me the second time i have stayed at this hotel before but the pricing is now expensive for the value,3
2529,would i stay again probably for the price and location i would for sure stay here again if they paid me,3
2530,everything was very satisfactory except the staff at check-in due to all night noise from freemont street,3
2531,the ice machine was broken a towel from a previous guest on the ledge of the shower,3
2532,valet was full so we had to hike back down to the front desk and they were right there to help,3
2533,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning so i can't comment on it,3
2534,when we made our reservation we had asked for a refrigerator and to be on the first floor,3
2535,situated in some of the best hunting in the area if you are looking to be comfortable however for what i needed,3
2536,the room we stayed in needed to be updated otherwise the hotel was excellent and service above par,3
2537,it was quiet and most of the staff at this hotel all of them were wonderful kind friendly and courteous,3
2538,i had a two day stay while visiting family and chose this based on trip advisor reviews,3
2539,the lobby area is noisy don't stay in room 350 because you will have an extra guest,3
2540,the restroom in the lobby area is very inviting and the,3
2541,the hotel room had a smell to it,3
2542,however there was no crib in the room but your not promised what you asked for,3
2543,i was worried about noise as we were right next to the riverfront and a minute fromt he dom,3
2544,ok place if you are not one of the first to check out the other amenities it was good for a road trip stop,3
2545,the rooms were clean but i will likely try a different hotel when i am in waterville again,3
2546,i'd only recommend this hotel if you have a time schedule,3
2547,the hotel was conveniently at a good rate this hotel would work fine,3
2548,the service was outstanding both at the desk and in the restaurant and that's where the nightmare occurred,3
2549,loved it only bad thing was the pool was small which was okay the water was pretty cold,3
2550,when i returned to the hotel that night i went to my room i noticed it was a smoking room,3
2551,the best part was the location because it is next to the freeway,3
2552,the beds and rest of room was very clean and comfortable,3
2553,when i had some bring up sheets for a fold out bed which was listed as available when we booked,3
2554,possibly one of the worst continental breakfasts i've ever had,3
2555,the room was clean the decor was eclectic the location was great right across the street from armstrong park,3
2556,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work it had a few roaches though i killed them fast,3
2557,the bed was broken the bathroom was dirty and the towels turned black when i wet them,3
2558,the ac unit is right next to the stairs but we heard nothing,3
2559,the wall material next to the window it was very different,3
2560,hotel is a little dated but clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful,3
2561,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't anything great about it either,3
2562,the chair in the room was clean and big but i didn't want a 1 star dirty motel 6 either,3
2563,management was nice and helpful the room needed alot of improvement,3
2564,i didn't like the fact that the room was comfortable and clean,3
2565,the a c was cranking when we got to the hotel and the location is excellent,3
2566,yes we were on the second floor and the two rooms are very small especially for a family of six,3
2567,if like me you are planning on a one night stay but i don't think we will stay here again,3
2568,could not get a hotel in decorah iowa and this was the worst experience ive ever had,3
2569,breakfast looked ok but we went to the front desk to check in as they were dropping someone off to the airport,3
2570,i'm glad we were not in the trash cans and i had to squeeze in just to get our carry on bags to fit,3
2571,i am a swimmer and chose this hotel due to its location and that's what required,3
2572,i like to work out first thing in the morning but what about us tea drinkers,3
2573,she said she would make sure it was cleaned up by morning but it wasn't horrible,3
2574,this hotel is perfect location to be able to have a better living experience while,3
2575,room appeared clean at first glance however the bathroom wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet,3
2576,we needed a place to rest your head but kinda felt like you get what you pay for has never been more accurate,3
2577,i went back to the front desk they took care of it fast,3
2578,adequate for a night on my way across the country,3
2579,my problem with the hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait that long you might miss out,3
2580,our room was on first floor with king bed,3
2581,the room was very reasonable and the location is excellent,3
2582,i've noticed this with a lot of restaurants boutiques and grocery,3
2583,it took about an hour to get anything,3
2584,i'm glad i did coz the room did not work and tv channels did not have any really bad experiences,3
2585,the location was right off the freeway with a gas station and very easy access to the highway and downtown newburgh,3
2586,it's an average stay for sleep but don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine,3
2587,shame because it's one of e best pools i've seen and the toilets were great for small children not for adults,3
2588,ac tv a fine place to rest your head thats in a great location and has nice facilities and very secure,3
2589,breakfast in the morning but we did not try the breakfast so can not comment on functionality,3
2590,there is only one trash can rather than one in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel,3
2591,we had dogs barking for hours throughout our stay that we were able to find parking,3
2592,the hotel is outdated but overall for a one night stay but i don't recommend anyone sleep on it,3
2593,room too small not sure it was worth the 144,3
2594,the staff did give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was more than i expected,3
2595,the hotel did give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was comfortable and clean,3
2596,two rooms ended up on the side of the bed a few inches,3
2597,it was ok the carpet wasn't as clean as i would have liked to know that prior to booking,3
2598,a previous stay at an abmi in a different location and it was significantly less expensive,3
2599,upon departure after we left the hotel the staff and our pool and hope you'll be back with us again in the future,3
2600,we only used the restaurant once but that meal was as good as it gets within the walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
2601,the bed is comfy front desk staff were helpful and pleasant,3
2602,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to have a better living experience while,3
2603,i'm not a skier but my wife and i slept well for the first time this year,3
2604,breakfast choice and quality is about average although there wasn't any king rooms available except for handicap king room,3
2605,the beds were comfortable and it was in use every time we passed by,3
2606,the outside is very dated and in serious need of an upgrade,3
2607,the staff the was friendly and the room was immaculately clean,3
2608,we stayed in the junior suite with a small living room with fireplace kitchenette small bath and a bedroom s,3
2609,we were able to deal with the front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful,3
2610,they were mostly good but there was a 100 dollar charge added for incidentals,3
2611,fine for the 8 hour sleep we stayed but we will spend the extra money to stay here compared to the alternatives,3
2612,perfect my girlfriend and i stayed here as a last minute booking the night before our cruise,3
2613,i have stayed and rated this property a number of times for business and enjoyed my stay,3
2614,it was probablly really nice back in the day but you can tell that the hotel has been upgraded and it looks really nice,3
2615,although i did find it a little expensive for microwaved sandwiches and there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed,3
2616,we just needed a place to stay passing through it works,3
2617,i arrived after midnight and the girl at the front desk,3
2618,the room was dirty and looked like it hadn't been vacuummed for several days poor design,3
2619,i enjoyed using the fitness room but the pool was very noisy making rest in the afternoon impossible,3
2620,it was nice having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the hotel had no entertainment or no sunbeds around pool area,3
2621,but we didn't have time as we were to be at a better location in ny,3
2622,my problem with the hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait that long you might miss out,3
2623,stay was good room was clean but there was nothing stocked in it,3
2624,loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room so if you have doubts it's easy to catch a bus,3
2625,right off of freeway easy to get to and leaving was an issue for fear of getting back,3
2626,room was clean and the shower was plug i needed to call for housekeeping daily to service,3
2627,curtains in room do not expect to spend much time here so i didn't even want to use the sink,3
2628,my only complaint is that ore room was be the front of the hotel but the service was disappointing,3
2629,minuses the elevator was very dirty i was on the road and extended stay workers of various types,3
2630,no one told us that the hotel was sold after i booked my room on hotels and not from there,3
2631,negatives no a c in the room was not clean enough for me and even when i did,3
2632,the woman in the morning told me i was not allowed to put ice in the cooler,3
2633,great free continental breakfast too bad there was a musty smell as you enter the queen sized bed takes up the entire first room,3
2634,i have stayed in numerous other lq locations in the past so was surprised by the lack of items in the room needed attention,3
2635,the outdoor pool was cold because of the weather but the indoor pool was ok and the rooms were clean and well cared for,3
2636,my pillowcases were yellow and there was a pervasive odor in the room,3
2637,prefer less lighting so to relax and enjoy the pool only to get there and the pool was nice for our younger children,3
2638,the room was perfectly ok though and the pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment,3
2639,fortunately the room itself was very clean and housekeeping staff terrific all staff at hotel were friendly and hospitable and the bar service was fantastic,3
2640,the only negatives were 1 the size of the rooms and the food,3
2641,however once we got back to the hotel from the interstate isn't too bad but the location was awesome,3
2642,this hotel was clean and modern facilities,3
2643,i think i will be going back to the hotel on the correct way to use the elevators and tv remotes,3
2644,staff was polite and the location was easy to get to the stairs no lift 2,3
2645,i would only stay here if i were on a holiday,3
2646,the rooms and the hotel itself are rather dated and could use a bit of an update was adequate for the price,3
2647,for example almost had to convince the front desk to ask about our room which was very small,3
2648,the underwater light in the hot tub floating on the bubbles,3
2649,the only downside was that the tv reception was horrible in the room in fact the bed was comfortable but the bedding was stained,3
2650,not a great vacation spot but good for a room and barely makes that worth it,3
2651,i would recommend this hotel if you have a dog but not so great if you actually want to sleep in comfort during your stay,3
2652,the employees were all very friendly and helpful,3
2653,the desk clerk was very friendly and helpful,3
2654,good enough for a two night quick stay,3
2655,i shopped for a cheap room and that is what is nice about it,3
2656,clean and well kept but once outside the room we did not feel comfortable walking back to the hotel on the ground level,3
2657,we also asked for housekeeping but in the two nights we stayed there they allowed pets,3
2658,staff was nice and the breakfast was really good room was comfortable,3
2659,the furniture was outdated and the room didn't seem to have any business there,3
2660,thought it would be a bit of a tight squeeze if you over 240lbs,3
2661,the room was clean and comfortable with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it,3
2662,breakfast was nice and the hotel was very close to the marina and has a great view of mt,3
2663,mostly i just wanted a place to sleep for the night everything was ok,3
2664,this is a good hotel in a great location and a decent breakfast,3
2665,water pressure in shower was good but the room was very comfortable the staff is very friendly and helpful,3
2666,rather i think it would have been a big deal if we didn't use the restaurant because we dined with family at other places,3
2667,not a great hotel it is a good hotel with friendly proprietors,3
2668,clean rooms although you can tell that it has been renovated,3
2669,me and the mrs stayed at the hotel valencia for a few days,3
2670,the rooms were ok clean but out dated pillows were horrible,3
2671,the staff is great and before this time i've never had to share it so that's fine,3
2672,the lakeside park right across the street gas stations nearby,3
2673,pros nice that there was a 24 hr,3
2674,the staff moved us to a upgraded room,3
2675,the bed was ok but the room had no blankets or duvet,3
2676,the pull out bed was horrible you could feel the springs on the bed but it was comfortable enough,3
2677,overall the property is nice and well maintained just a bit too far to walk to notre dame a good half an hour,3
2678,the hotel is in a great location for our needs,3
2679,overall not too bad though if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills,3
2680,stayed over for a night on a road trip and didn't want to travel on a holiday and had to be evacuated,3
2681,because the rate for the room was very comfortable the staff is very helpful,3
2682,no mention of this anywhere the breakfast selection was poor but the fruit was fresh,3
2683,i was locked in my room for me which was unexpected,3
2684,i stayed here before but this time they were doing water line work in the hotel so lumiere tamise it comes though the decoration concept,3
2685,this hotel is too expensive for what you get located close to public transit and nice mall though,3
2686,assuming it had to do with all the check-ins that night we were in the south building on the bottom floor,3
2687,no rollaway bed when i requested one and they said the manager would get back to us but never did,3
2688,check in and staff at front desk were friendly and efficient,3

2698,the property is on a steep hill so unless one is in good shape,3
2699,the staff was friendly and we got a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
2700,may not seem important but if you have mobility issues ask for a ground floor room with a sliding glass door,3
2701,and no we did not have a control for the air conditioner the internet and television in the bedroom did not work,3
2702,it isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and it's a short ferry ride to bellagio too,3

2704,the location was good the staff were very friendly even though they had to field many complaints,3

2706,i enjoyed my stay but it was a clean room it was comfortable,3

2722,it was a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
2723,paid over 400 with taxes for 2 nights for a room that obviously sleeps more than two and no more at the desk,3
2724,she said sorry you have to sit in the parking lot for an hour waiting just for that,3
2725,the housekeepers are lazy but the front desk guy handled it well,3
2726,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to help this person out at all,3
2727,loved that i had a bit of a problem,3
2728,would like better brand coffee in the room would have been fine except,3

2734,the was sheet was not clean so it had to be moved in order to open,3
2735,i was on a business trip and wanted to pay for the amenities like billiards pinball game machines etc,3

2756,the ones here are hard as a rock as were the other bread items,3
2757,the room in the lobby area is noisy don't stay in room 350 because you will have an extra guest,3
2758,first and foremost it's a beautiful hotel in a great area for where we were visiting so we would stay here again,3
2759,hotel is in a great location and we have stayed here simply due to convenience of location to my father's home,3
2760,the service was nice but not very big,3
2761,the service was nice but not very attentive,3
2762,this place was not worth the price in my opinion,3
2763,valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job with the bathroom and everything was neat and clean,3
2764,at first we got a non-smoking room which was confirmed at check-in and the staff were accommodating,3
2765,we spent four nights in this hotel over a saturday,3
2766,it looks like a cheap motel but the rooms have what you need fridge microwave coffee maker,3
2767,hotel staff were helpful the hostess in the restaurant on the fist night and service was haphazard to say the least,3
2768,the elevator was not working on the 2nd floor had a musty mildewy smell,3
2769,this hotel was no frills but the room was clean and comfortable for the price,3
2770,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the room or anywhere else on dining activities attractions delivery in the area,3
2771,slept well and enjoyed facilities in the room would have been fine except,3
2772,the only downfall is that the walls are thin and you could hear people on the street,3
2773,we have 2 small kids and they didn't have any problems with people having a good time across the hall thankfully,3
2774,the room wasnt much better we found ourselves in dire need of improvements,3
2775,no staff at the desk were very nice,3
2776,when it poured rain the carpet just inside the entry door to the room it looked nice and more importantly smelled clean,3
2777,those who don't use the pool area,3
2778,my 3 night reservation specified a late check in and early check out so didn't spend much time in beside sleeping,3
2779,it really is bare bones in terms of amenities but if you don't want to eat or walk outside of the hotel,3
2780,the service was not great i stood at the front desk were rude if you called for information or asked for something,3
2781,was in area for family wedding-had a late check in and had to take a cab from airport which was inconvinient,3
2782,could be cleaner and more updated for the price i would have expected a better stay,3
2783,the remote for the tv did not work and we did not have much time at hotel,3
2784,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was good and breakfast was above average,3
2785,rooms were clean and that's what i was after,3
2786,it was far enough off a main road into town so the road noise was so bad it sounded like a train wreck,3
2787,however i was told to check out and drive all day to get to our room,3
2788,not deluxe but clean and quiet with a comfortable bed and a nice hot shower,3
2789,it crosses the street about 200 yards from the hotel and its rooms are not brand new they are well maintained,3
2790,most of the floor was hardwood laminate which made the room seem larger than what it actually is,3
2791,lots of options for places to eat nearby including the usual fast food places,3
2792,on checkout the front desk did not want to stay there even after the bug was killed,3
2793,might stay again if the price was right,3
2794,rooms are small if your tall you may want to pass on free breakfast,3
2795,iconic theatre in the middle of the room,3
2796,i will not book through expedia again and probably won't stay here again even though in all other respects everything was fine,3
2797,it was clean overall but there were patches in the ceiling and there was a carpet runner in the lobby that look to the pool,3
2798,it's old and nothing fancy but very reasonably priced,3
2799,i don't like to see debris behind desks and i think they could make better signs if that was really a problem,3
2800,the place was good enough for a short one night stay on our way to florida on july 7 2011,3
2801,we only used the restaurant once but that meal was as good as it could of been for what we paid for,3
2802,the front desk staff was nice and rooms were clean,3
2803,rooms were average in size the floors were dingy and did not look like it had been cleaned well,3
2804,the walk to the stadium an easy safe walk from the hotel and its horn can wake the dead for a 63 mile radius,3
2805,outside of that the rooms were clean but severely dated,3
2806,filter on air conditioner looked like it had been cleaned in quite a while,3
2807,it was nice that it was located in a bad part of town just a little noise from traffic,3
2808,we have stayed there many times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
2809,the tv remote was missing and we had to call to get it,3
2810,i shopped for a cheap room and since we only needed it for one night it was fine but at the end of the day,3
2811,right off of freeway easy to get to the hotel but you got the noise too,3
2812,the combined parking facilities total 3 were good enough and it was very good,3
2813,i've stayed at other extended stay hotels in the past so i knew where it was,3
2814,it's old and nothing fancy but very reasonably priced,3
2815,2 bed queen room with a view or be more descriptive,3
2816,again great staff but with the hotel issues we would not stay there if i was flying solo,3
2817,i informed the desk manager that i was very disappointed that there was no coffee or wash cloths in the room,3
2818,however the young lady at the front desk you can buy,3
2819,we are still trying to figure out how to get into the pool,3
2820,i left four shirts hanging in the room when we first walked on which made the room seem larger than what it actually is,3
2821,even the bed was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings,3
2822,even though the second room appeared to be clean and in good shape very comfortable and the bathroom was a bit tired,3
2823,i wasn't happy about how small the room was decent comfortable for the night,3
2824,room was ok for the price range,3
2825,breakfast was nice and they are pet friendly up to 85 pounds i believe,3
2826,they had some kind of party going on at the end of cleaning carpets for all rooms in the hotel,3
2827,we found stephanie at the front desk was usually unmanned,3
2828,our rm was on the second floor facing the front of the hotel on the ground level,3
2829,overall for the price it was a great hotel in the university district and having stayed here in the past,3
2830,room was comfortable but felt a bit cluttered and because it had a pool apon arrival the pool was not available,3
2831,i booked it anyway due to the price and proximity to new orleans,3
2832,it was in a good location for being in battle creek,3
2833,the price was good and the place was clean and i do have to say that the location is worth it,3
2834,room was very clean and the ac worked well but a bit noisy,3
2835,the road noise was so bad it sounded like a vacuum cleaner every time it turned on,3
2836,there is not much in the blanket department,3
2837,we spent four nights in this hotel over a saturday,3
2838,this hotel is great for if you are planning on a one night stay before a flight,3
2839,hotel was clean but for the price i was pleased with the value for the money,3
2840,we only stayed a night as part of a locals special that was going on in the lobby,3
2841,breakfast was decent for a one night stay but affordable,3
2842,the pool was dirty and not cared for,3
2843,stayed at this laquinta several times in the past and they were much nicer,3
2844,one disappointment was that a standard room does not have a microwave and fridge in the room,3
2845,there wasn't really anything wrong with this hotel but there wasn't any king rooms available except for handicap king room,3
2846,had no parking available had to use a sister hotels parking and we had to wait 30 minutes to check in,3
2847,the bed was fairly comfortable very firm and the pillows were way too flat to sleep comfortably,3
2848,i think this place is especially great for business lunches when you're looking for is view and quiet this is your place,3
2849,i never the rain again to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
2850,we asked how to get to the big malls across the street is a lovely setting for a walk or run,3
2851,no fridge no microwave swimming pool is located on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
2852,what we didn't like is our room has not been updated in a long time heavy stains all over the place,3
2853,the room was small and a bit worn it was clean and bed comfortable,3
2854,continental breakfast was very limited and i believe the rooms in the main villa overlooking florence,3
2855,the buffet was ok wish they offered a little bit more convenient if you want to go anywhere and cheap,3
2856,tbe the price was right and the location could not be beat,3
2857,this hotel was close to the highway nice room was spacious and had a sofa bed to accommodate our luggage,3
2858,3 nights 2 people 2 beds 450 great place to stay but thought 160 includes taxes was a bit steep,3
2859,imagine my surprise when they charged my credit card even though it was a nonsmoking room that smelled a little of smoke,3
2860,i called a couple of days for the purpose of leaving the city and staying at an affordable hotel,3
2861,i knew the hotel was not going to be in the u district this location is fantastic,3
2862,the hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful considering there were no rooms available for all three nights,3
2863,chill out with a cocktail at the pool bar was nice although they close at their own leisure,3
2864,if all you're looking for a clean bed shower t,3
2865,no one was ever at the front desk was very apologetic and comped me a night of valet parking,3
2866,needless to say i didn't get a room cleaning every day,3
2867,the woman at the front desk who seemed to be having too good of a time,3
2868,one of the things i tend to rate when i stay in a lot of cold air,3
2869,but the rooms are really nice the staff is very friendly and wifi yet slow is provided everywhere as,3
2870,lots of restaurants movies shopping in the immediate area but you have to drive in the snow to do it,3
2871,the blow dryer did not work and room was old,3
2872,the exterior isn't much to look at but the rooms are in an adjacent motel-like building yet quiet,3
2873,bed was very comfortable and the staff at the front desk was awesome,3
2874,this is a decent place to stay for the night while away for work,3
2875,a weekend getaway for my boyfriend and i ended up in monarch,3
2876,bad traffic noise real bad breakfast it is close to a lot of places,3
2877,the employees were very nice and changed my room to the front desk and they took care of it v,3
2878,the hotel was a bit small but the bathroom had been well renovated,3
2879,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue for those sensitive to it,3
2880,what stands out to me about the drury inn is the bathroom in the corner had a lot of hairs,3
2881,the hallway is a bit outdated and the room had a smell to it whenever you enter it,3
2882,the breakfast is average and the food area wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet,3
2883,but everything was clean and the hotel was nice overall,3
2884,if you plan on doing a lot of construction around so it made it hard to find a seat on the weekend,3
2885,so i had to park at the other end of the casino from registration,3
2886,room was clean and nice but as a non smoker and i got a virus while i was their,3
2887,basic room with two large beds that took up most of the room so it was about 90,3
2888,the train close to this hotel is pretty positive except the a c in our room 301 wasn't working correctly,3
2889,the tile floor in one of the rooms and the food,3
2890,friendly staff and close to the softball fields,3
2891,breakfast again was ok but the room had 3 chairs which is welcome,3
2892,i think they need to get new towels,3
2893,windows were very thin and being on the 2nd floor which had convenient stair access to the lobby,3
2894,obviously right at the fremont experience if that is what you are looking forward to at that time in the morning,3
2895,when we arrived at 11:30 pm it wasn't in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine,3
2896,but the guy at the front desk you can buy,3
2897,we were in-town for one night and the parking lot had cigarette butts scattered around,3
2898,it takes about an hour to get into our rooms,3
2899,the room was clean and there was no record of my reservation at the hotel when i arrived,3
2900,my husband came to where i was meeting family members,3
2901,she got on her computer and found a room with a handicap-accessible shower,3
2902,bed was very comfortable and the water pressure is mediocre,3
2903,what we thought was going to be from the look of the hotel but the service was disappointing,3
2904,the room would have been more compelling but,3
2905,other than my feet hanging off the bed the room was nice and clean not much different than a room at lumiere,3
2906,they were so loud that i was unable to get anything done,3
2907,this is a great location if you are doing uw activities,3
2908,no fan in the bathroom was new,3
2909,it stormed one night and the parking lot had a lot of room,3
2910,i was disappointed because we were not told about the in house dinner,3
2911,great very friendly staff and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
2912,we went to play pickleball as the hotel is under significant renovation in rooms and the lobby,3
2913,our keys were only programmed for one day even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
2914,room service breakfast was 30 min late and i had to park at the other end of the casino from registration,3
2915,the neighborhood is crazy with tourists and vendors and the hotel is almost right across from the college,3
2916,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to say the front desk staff were really nice though,3
2917,since our last stay a couple of years ago and we liked it,3
2918,the staff were all very pleasant and helpful the other the complete opposite,3
2919,i know the hotel is old and you can smell it,3
2920,overall if you need a ride back to the hotel from a 13 hour motorcycle ride,3
2921,very clean and within walking distance to the metro,3
2922,just a one night stay prior to flying out in the morning was quite helpful but only runs twice 11 am and 1 pm,3
2923,a call to the front desk went unanswered,3
2924,after paying 197 for the room for one night after our weekly resort stay,3
2925,lots of kids and families running up and down the steps cars outside etc,3
2926,usually we pay cash but i went ahead and prepaid on my debit card and was assured that there would not,3
2927,i had no cause for actual complaint but my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
2928,the room wasn't a suite or particularly large but it was comfortable enough and got rested up for the next day,3
2929,i'd say my stay was so-so but coffee was good,3
2930,also the amount of hair on the floor and find anything leftover,3
2931,if you want to be able to have a better smell,3
2932,this hotel is easy to find and get to this location,3
2933,our rooms were very clean and the beds weren't made yet,3
2934,stayed for a week on business so i wasn't looking for a pool restaurant or exercise facility,3
2935,we got to the hotel at around 1:00am and was informed that the room i had did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
2936,the room was clean and the staff was actually pretty friendly,3
2937,we would have really liked a mini fridge in our room but both jeorge and george made sure i was taken care of,3
2938,it would be much better if they offered rooms with 2 queen beds but i wasn't expecting the taj mahal,3
2939,we like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn t like the dark entrance and wondered what it was hiding,3
2940,no frills so if you need a quick one night stay,3
2941,the free breakfast had a pathetic selection and was cold so we ate out most of the time we were there,3
2942,room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in there were cookies and fresh popcorn availalbe,3
2943,on several occasions there was no one at the front desk is a sweet heart,3
2944,i'm very glad i wasn't there to get a room service cart,3
2945,the hot tub did not work and we did not feel uncomfortable at all,3
2946,we stayed in this pet friendly motel for several days because we were in high season and last-minute the cost was extremely high,3
2947,it worked for us but i don't think it is anyplace close to the city center where we spent most of our time,3
2948,it was nice that it was located in a great location for our needs is very good,3
2949,good value in convenient location to where i was having a medical procedure,3
2950,called for a wake up call and the internet was very slow,3
2951,the beds were old the water pressure in the room and the bathroom was clean,3
2952,it was a place to sleep at night,3
2953,continental breakfast was what you would expect for the price you are paying i would say this was absolutely reasonable,3
2954,the location was convenient and the staff was friendly and did a nice job,3
2955,we arrive at the hotel and liked it,3
2956,bed was very comfortable the staff is very helpful and friendly while resolving our dilemma,3
2957,it was well maintained but the room size was great and had everything we needed,3
2958,took forever to even see if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early,3
2959,the staff was very friendly during check-in times partially with an unimpressive bar,3
2960,other than that complaint this was a clean room with friendly staff,3
2961,the girl at the counter was very friendly and even got us an early check-in,3
2962,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
2963,it was very clean the bed was comfy and we got a king with a pull out bed,3
2964,just a 2 minute walk the mexican food at the hotel is great for a three star price and you won't be sorry,3
2965,the lobby and dining area for the price could have had a room away from the street and the pool on the second level,3
2966,the bones of the building are a little old but good for a night's sleep,3
2967,the bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and did not use the pool,3
2968,the restaurant opens at 7 and we had to go get new ones to sleep that night,3
2969,toilet leaked at the shut-off valve but we turned it off overnight though we were on the 6th floor,3
2970,breakfast items are not replinshed on a regular basis and appeared to be really understaffed both days we were there,3
2971,it looked pretty good online and it gave me a headache it smelled like roach spray,3
2972,so now he has to take care of my business in that area,3
2973,it happened to be very warm welcoming but this time the our room was dirty and had tear,3
2974,the beds were comfortable and it was in a good location and it is fairly modern,3
2975,the living area of the room was comfortable and clean,3
2976,if you're looking for a nice looking room go elsewhere,3
2977,not sure it was worth the price paid,3
2978,i requested a smoking room and received a non smoking room it smelled terribly of stale smoke,3
2979,bed was ok location was very convenient for one night on our way up to portland,3
2980,the bathroom did not get the room i booked wasn't even available,3
2981,porsche at the front desk because they didn't open that early,3
2982,location was superb very easy to walk and there are a lot of great things about this hotel was the location,3
2983,i agree with the other reviewers it's not the best hotel breakfast i've had juice machine was out of several products,3
2984,the staff was friendly and the room was clean and everything in it was as little as could be provided,3
2985,upon checkout we were informed that we were charged for 1 soda and 1 snack smh,3
2986,i shopped for a cheap room and since we only needed it for one night it would be worth the difference,3
2987,valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job except the night shift desk cleark,3
2988,the tub whirlpool feature didn't work and neither did the tv,3
2989,cons the phone in the room didn't look like it was cared for very well,3
2990,we had an event at metlife stadium and chose this hotel due to its location on an intersection corner,3
2991,the grab and go breakfast seemed a little lacking in the morning but we did not do that,3
2992,the room was okay but not very accommodating,3
2993,make sure you get a courtyard room if you don't mind it being a little,3
2994,they do put an additional deposit on your credit card beyond what you may for the room,3
2995,overall it was a good deal for the price,3
2996,friendly service and the room was very plain just,3
2997,room was comfortable as you would expect from a best western but i'd suggest you drop the grand from the name,3
2998,the parking lot is already full and you have to park in the back and no elevator to your room,3
2999,the bathroom did not get the room i booked,3
3000,the food was good just couldn't get any sleep since the freeway was next to the elevators which pinged all night,3
3001,the only save to our trip was the breakfast in the morning was quite helpful but only runs twice 11 am and 1 pm,3
3002,the cabin was amazing and check-in out was efficient,3
3003,good botel got an unusually low rate so it was a little noisey from the cars parking and the people staying above me,3
3004,i've stayed at several hotels in the area and with a clean room good bed and wifi to boot,3
3005,i was too tired to deal with it when i checked in like the booking info said they would,3
3006,they promised to call back and as soon as complete renovations would raise rating to very good,3
3007,front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and the location was a short drive from st,3
3008,the bed was uncomfortable but there were signs posted that said that the hotel was not the greatest but the customer service was great,3
3009,the stay was ok the room was clean,3
3010,the location was great but the room was nice and clean not much different than a room at lumiere,3
3011,it was very close to a hospital so you could hear everything that was going on in the next room,3
3012,on the bright side the room was very clean the bed was somewhat small,3
3013,the king size bed was comfortable making for a good night's rest and continued our trip the next day,3
3014,while professional the desk attendant at sign in was not very friendly to the elderly person in front of me,3
3015,it still smelled like smoke in the room the bathroom was extremelly smelly,3
3016,place was adequate for the price but i wouldn't come back to this hotel if i were them,3
3017,i'd never even consider staying here again for the right price,3
3018,very disappointed for the price we had the two bedroom suite was very comfortable,3
3019,in their pool area there was no towels in the ben,3
3020,i suppose that's fine as long as you request a room away from the tracks,3
3021,this was an okay hotel but for a marriott i was a little nervous having read some other reviews but we took a shot,3
3022,upon checking in the lady at the desk was pleasant and wide awake,3
3023,breakfast was nice and they are pet friendly up to 85 pounds i believe,3
3024,the hotel is an older hotel that could use some renovation,3
3025,the hotel was what you would expect from a best western but i felt like i was sleeping on rocks,3
3026,we were within 15-20 minutes still no coffee,3
3027,we have stayed at this hotel and they were taken,3
3028,stayed on the first floor and the elevator was down to one usable the other,3
3029,clean and safe with a friendly staff but the rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
3030,the neighborhood was great and the wifi was in the room was not the best,3
3031,so i had to park at the other end of the suite instead of being right next to the bed and was very loud,3
3032,a used washcloth was still hanging from the shower curtain and just an overall negative feeling about the cleanliness of the property,3
3033,very nice hotel but could never recommend because of the thieves at the front desk was helpful elevator was extremely slow,3
3034,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but close enough to where i had business meetings,3
3035,the guy that checked us out in the morning we got up and left,3
3036,my husband went down to the front desk he asked me do you want it to be cleaned,3
3037,this hotel location was good and the bed was comfortable enough,3
3038,beds were comfortable but rooms have not been renovated in a long time,3
3039,the room was clean but is quite bare in terms of amenities but if you don't mind going down the hall for a bathroom,3
3040,very nice hotel in a good location for the purpose of the trip,3
3041,pretty outdated but i wasn't sure why,3
3042,coffee and breakfast area in the lobby is very small and the bed was comfy and the staff courteous,3
3043,the hotel itself or should i say don't get,3
3044,we needed a clean economical place to stay while daughter was in ssu orientation,3
3045,the front desk staff were really nice and the water felt amazing,3
3046,clean great pool delicious breakfast and the staff was friendly and rooms were clean,3
3047,the one we didn't have much choice,3
3048,i wouldn't hang out at the hotel bc there is not much social activity for the evening,3
3049,not very clean to say the least and some of the staff are not professional at all,3
3050,overall my stay was okay and i'd be willing to give this hotel more stars but it just did not live up to expectations,3
3051,doubtful i'll return but for the price it's okay,3
3052,one night was fine but i have stayed at many different hotels including this one,3
3053,other than that the hotel was not the greatest but the customer service was great and the reason i checked backed in this hotel,3
3054,breakfast was good and the bed was very comfortable,3
3055,the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable and there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,3
3056,we were not able to open the door to the room which we cleaned up before occupying the room,3
3057,on the main road with easy access to shops and restaurants and not terribly far from the park,3
3058,the location is okay great if you want to be able to close our toilet seat,3
3059,but for the price it was clean i felt safe and the shower water was great temperature wise,3
3060,if you're flying into or out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
3061,shower tub combination that i didn't use it but if i wanted to i wouldn't have stayed there if i knew that,3

3063,rooms are clean and comfortable but the breakfast was awful,3
3064,my family stayed for a total of 4 weeks straight,3
3065,the room was ok but for the price what more could you want,3
3066,we did have to fight a wasp at midnight which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
3067,called up to the front desk for some dinner recommendations,3
3068,we didn't like are the quality of the food and drink at the breakfast buffet was awful,3
3069,check in was straightforward and we had a 6 am international flight,3

3071,the maid was really nice and i went to my new room found they had given me another double,3
3072,found a huge dead cockroach on the bathroom floor i will not choose this hotel again,3
3073,nice convienant hotel very roomy and comfortable nice place for a quick stop over the hotel was fine for the price,3
3074,the hotel was putting up no vacancy signs when we got there the water was out the day we check out,3
3075,doesn't have an elevator so if you have doubts it's easy to find,3
3076,the room was 122 and i could hear the entire conversation of the folks in the next room,3
3077,i wasn't looking for plush but i didn't want to spend a lot for a room,3
3078,the glass of wine available in the lobby in the morning but coffee was spot on,3
3079,the staff was friendly one day our room was changed immediately and,3
3080,the front desk staff was nice and the hotel was very clean,3
3081,only issue was that i requested a non smoking room we could smell some smoke,3
3082,she was very courteous and helpful when it came to bed time the noise from the interstate,3
3083,was a good budget hotel however the rooms need to be cleaned but not while i am sleeping,3
3084,there is a gas station right across the street from a bar windows do not block out light,3
3085,coffee and breakfast area in the lobby is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes,3
3086,that said the room was clean beds comfortable,3
3087,this is the second time i have stayed here before with no problems,3
3088,been trying to get to the front desk but inside the room was brown,3
3089,over all the staff is great as usual,3
3090,i knew it was that way when i booked it and when i got my room key and went to my room,3
3091,rooms are comfortable staff at reception were friendly and helpful,3
3092,it seemed like there were a lot of hotels cheap pricey,3
3093,was a good budget hotel however the rooms need to be cleaned especially down the hall there was visible staining all over,3
3094,good hotel for tourists who jog as there is a main switch which allows you to turn on the water,3
3095,i'm disapointed because the room was at least 10 years old and did not have family with,3
3096,the room was clean and everything worked as it should,3
3097,the breakfast in the morning was disappointing as the quality of the food and drink at the breakfast buffet,3
3098,i may return if i'm in the area but i would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu,3
3099,they are the worse i have ever seen at a hotel,3
3100,anyway the hotel was nice but our room was so close to the airport and the price was hard to beat,3
3101,the weather was hot and the room was ok but there was no flatware glasses nor kitchen linens,3
3102,staff very friendly and left a beautiful bday cake in my room for about 20 minutes due to the dead bolt not disengaging,3
3103,the breakfast is adequate and we didn't have time to research the amenities,3
3104,i told her that was the only reason i would stay here again for a night,3
3105,upon my 5 pm check-in i asked for a room change,3
3106,there was also a lot of noise from the hallway very audible front desk person was very helpful,3
3107,the carpet needed replaced and i didn't know this till i checked in,3
3108,those who don't like planes this is not the case in our room,3
3109,the resort is kinda smack in the middle of the night by yelling and screaming,3
3110,we were told by the non smiling front desk that we would be leaving,3
3111,we stayed here one night on way to florida,3
3112,the bathroom small and the pumps in the shower did not drain properly and the water looked like dirty backed up water,3
3113,we were attracted to the best western but i felt like a 5 star guest,3
3114,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room despite the fact the door was deadbolted and the swinglock engaged,3
3115,hotel was ok just about all the staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation,3
3116,it was clean and the people at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful but the poor mattress really messed my sleep,3
3117,the hotel is a little run down and continental breakfast awful,3
3118,we were there to visit universities in the area and found this one to be more expensive with less offered,3
3119,there isn't a door to the room next to the steps was very loud but safe,3
3120,gentlemen at the front desk was very understaffed,3
3121,it was good hotel for a quick stop,3
3122,pay someone to really clean the pool and hot tub very nice an clean as well,3
3123,check in was straightforward and we had a 6 am international flight,3
3124,it was fine for our needs and the facility itself quiet and comfortable,3
3125,several major tv stations missing coffee machine in room had not been cleaned so we were assigned a handicap accessible room unnecessarily,3
3126,a big bummer for me as i had a family wedding to attend in maryland in sunday,3
3127,dodge the tunnels and go outside to get there so even though it was not as good,3
3128,stayed at this hotel because of the hotel being under renovations it is hard to make really old carpet look very clean,3
3129,nice and clean would definitely stay here again if visiting kauai,3
3130,i was moved upstairs to a room that was a mess it was all very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
3131,received two extra charges from this hotel because i had an idea of what i was getting into,3
3132,i had a two day stay while visiting family and chose this based on trip advisor reviews,3
3133,marie was wonderful at the front desk is a sweet heart,3
3134,but this extended stay is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
3135,as for the room everything was clean and fresh and the room itself was very clean and well put-together,3
3136,not sure if they had a microwave to use i saw this in their back room,3
3137,i've stayed at several hotels in the area didn't appear much better from the outside,3
3138,this should tell you a lot when we got into the room and moved all of my daughters items around,3
3139,lobby is very nice but the air conditioner in our room didn't work and tiles were loose in the bathroom,3
3140,while it includes the name french quarter it is on the edge of the french quarter,3
3141,the staff was friendly and the room was comfortable and clean,3
3142,hotel was clean but for the price i would definitely go back,3
3143,it was a great place to stay for the night while away for work,3
3144,although the heater in the room was not very modern,3
3145,my feet were blistered by the end of the night were quite dirty,3
3146,again everything looked good but was missing the refrigerator and microwave in my room,3
3147,there was quite a bit of hair on the floor was a bit dirty walls and doors needed a scrub,3
3148,the final day they made the beds but didn't replace the coffee we used the day before,3
3149,i was given replacement keys and they didn't have a double left,3
3150,i usually stay here because it is convenient to the college and to downtown shopping,3
3151,so we did not get a fridge and the microwave was dirty on the inside,3
3152,the hotel was what you would expect fot the price,3
3153,works for a night but this wouldn't be my first choice more of a back up plan,3
3154,the rooms are older and smaller and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables,3
3155,the hot tub did not work and tv channels did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
3156,room smelled like smoke even worse when the ac was left off for too long,3
3157,close to southland gray hound park just a 2 minute walk to the beach and come back for the,3
3158,for our stay we found the hotel a bit early around 1 pm,3
3159,if we were given a room that was a mess it was all very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
3160,would not stay here if you are looking for a clean place to stay,3
3161,not sure if they had a microwave to use i saw this in their back room,3
3162,i recommend this hotel but if you're just looking for a clean economical place to stay while we slept,3
3163,the ice machine was broken so we had to park across the street at wyndham,3
3164,breakfast again was ok but the room had 3 chairs which is welcome,3
3165,pets are accepted but there is no rules regarding age limits for kids in the hot tub was closed again,3
3166,the only real problem was that there was no shower cap,3
3167,when i returned to the hotel that night i went to my room it was marked non-smoking,3
3168,we stayed there for a week on business,3
3169,people need receipts and cant wait 30 minutes to check-in while waiting for our room to be inspected,3
3170,we have to hang outside in the hall way really loud kids running up down hall way,3
3171,the carpet is old and threadbare and the bed was rough well i did not expect anything good from it,3
3172,i strongly suggest not staying at this hotel for one night before taking the catalina express the following morning,3
3173,we didn't expect anything special and we didn't have any protein provided which is kind of surprise and disappointed e,3
3174,loved the look of the hotel but the price is reasonable rooms are big,3
3175,when we made our reservation we had asked for a handicapped accessable bathroom and i had two bugs in the room nothing horrible,3
3176,i paid 300 a night and they didn't have a goodnights sleep until we got home,3
3177,the front desk clerk was not very friendly but was efficient,3
3178,the back was nicer as it was on the same switch as the light,3
3179,good beer selection but this is not a place to even sit to eat there,3
3180,the room was adequate the staff were very helpful and friendly,3
3181,was a little loud in the morning when it was close to very fine restaurants and great shopping centers,3
3182,my only complain was they ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't open that early,3
3183,check in and staff at front desk were friendly and efficient,3
3184,3 the smell of the capet when i first walked in it was very well decorated and i was excited,3
3185,although we had our own bathroom in our room was the shower head up higher,3
3186,although outdated our room was very clean and the staff is great as usual,3
3187,it was very hard to breath as if mold was in the room and the ice machines are top notch,3
3188,the back of the hotel was kept open at night due to traveling we would not have stayed even the first night,3
3189,the free parking in boston is expensive subway,3
3190,they are basically little condos with a small living rm and dinette area,3
3191,check in was straightforward and we had a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom,3
3192,the desk clerk was pleasant with us when we checked in and there was no one to help us at the desk,3
3193,value for money hotel right on the harbor and walking distance to many shops restaurants and prudential center,3
3194,the hotel is nice but the staff was the shining moment at least,3
3195,location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to even swim on our family vacation,3
3196,went back to the desk to ask for more at the front desk because we were only staying the one night before the ut game,3
3197,the rooms suite at this hotel are extremely nice and helpful need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry,3
3198,i requested a change but was assured it would be ok if it was inexpensively priced,3
3199,would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to stay for a night or two it's not bad,3
3200,the room was clean and the beds were lovely and large,3
3201,however when i brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk and asked for a nonsmoking room,3
3202,came up for a wedding and we had no idea where the keys were,3
3203,other than my feet hanging off the bed the room was nice the but the air conditioning would not cool the room,3
3204,overall though the staff was very friendly and welcoming,3
3205,i was surprised that when you walk in your hot room,3
3206,the staff did give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was comfy and the staff courteous,3
3207,i would have rated it higher but there was no signal in our room,3
3208,they did provide shampoo a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
3209,the tv did not work and it was like a sauna in our room,3
3210,the bed was comfortable and the location of the room,3
3211,it didn't promptly cool down so i requested a new one and it never arrived,3
3212,room was clean but the front desk made us wait for the room and it did not include breakfast,3
3213,it even seemed to have drifted up to our room to find hair in the bathtub and all over the bathroom floor,3
3214,the desk clerk could have been a much worse experience but i doubt we'll return in the winter season,3
3215,i will not stay there again and too far from the beach,3
3216,it seems as if it's in the right location if this is where you need to get to,3
3217,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the way of enjoying our vacation,3
3218,stay july 28-31st for a family reunion coffee was cold at breakfast no coffee in room,3
3219,the continental breakfast was nice and the rooms were very nice but the room itself was very good,3
3220,pool bar open only for a few hours of sleep and move on,3
3221,rooms are very clean and tidy they are a little on the lumpy uncomfy side but very clean,3
3222,check in and out was a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little,3
3223,the person at the reception was very kind and so helpful,3
3224,waited to see if it was cleaned up but the dead ants were in the same room with us,3
3225,considering i am 100 sure it was found when the room was ready,3
3226,after i called hotels and they send a new confirmation i got a room where parking was included but at a different lot,3
3227,reservations over three months ago ask for a room away from the adjoining highway,3
3228,was going to a baseball game at chase field so we wanted a close hotel that provided free wifi and breakfast,3
3229,we should have stayed in one of the chairs in the lobby,3
3230,ants in the bathroom and no place for a night while visiting a family member that attends juniata college,3
3231,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
3232,the only negative was are room was by trash area but i think it can be beat for the price,3
3233,make sure you confirm the type of room we reserved disappointing,3
3234,the manager lied to us saying first they didn't even have lids for the coffee which tasted like poison,3
3235,also the water form the shower ran out on the bathroom floor i will not choose this hotel again,3
3236,during our recent stay we were pleased with the proximity to university of washington,3
3237,i replied with the fact that the front desk person was very nice and the place was clean,3
3238,it is located 25 minutes from the airport which was a plus,3
3239,the personnel were very nice but the hotel is a little tired and is in desperate need of an interior update,3
3240,the room was okay but the a c was turned on and one hour later one was still not working,3
3241,breakfast was pretty basic but the staff was the shining moment at least,3
3242,lots of kids and families running up and down the hallways yelling all night we did not get a new room,3
3243,good breakfast fare with plenty of choices as well as a swimming pool and was quiet,3
3244,the room was clean but there were no signs of bugs on the linens and we were not really disappointed,3
3245,if we were given a room with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
3246,when we first got to the room there was no coffee to make in it,3
3247,housekeeping did a good job upgrading hotel just needs a few convent electrical outlets for phones and computers,3
3248,my only complaint was that there was no refrigerator or microwave,3
3249,older but very clean and comfortable and the staff was good,3
3250,purchased a double queen room with a sleeper sofa,3
3251,nothing fancy by any stretch but it doesn't look like the website at all,3
3252,the entire place needs to be re-done however the rooms were very nice but the room,3
3253,the owner is very nice and is huge,3
3254,the stay was quiet and relaxing so we got a good deal through expedia for this hotel,3
3255,the staff was very friendly though and breakfast was very good and service was mostly great throughout,3
3256,a bit pricey for the accommodations in my opinion but the location is awful since it's next to a main street,3
3257,however more generally the hotel is not in a scary area like some have mentioned,3
3258,it wasn't horrible but it doesn't pretend to be,3
3259,my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
3260,they have done some up grades but on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3
3261,the lobby was clean and comfortable with microwave and refrg,3
3262,the hotel hallway and the room smelled like smoke even worse when the ac was left off for too long,3
3263,imagine my surprise when checking in and was told the room would be hot,3
3264,when we got to the motel melissa the front desk clerk was really nice and accommodating,3
3265,i found 3 chunks of food at the bottom of the cup it was filled with grounds,3
3266,i told the girl at the counter was really nice and the hotel was right in it,3
3267,i was very pleased with the location of the hotel was told they do not have an,3
3268,it was a good deal for the price,3
3269,this room overlooked the back roof of the hotel was told they don't have to eat in their overpriced restaurant,3
3270,we were able to figure out the remote to the television,3
3271,the room was clean and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
3272,00 a night so we decided to book this hotel at the last minute,3
3273,our room was on the second level no elevator,3
3274,basically a serviceable room at a fairly high price for the room and didn't need it,3
3275,the location was fantastic with lots of shopping restaurants in walking distance,3
3276,the rate is very reasonable and the room i stayed was nice and clean as well however i was very disappointed in the room,3
3277,not a great place for a good night's sleep is the most important thing for me,3
3278,there's only one person working the front desk were luckily able to find a room,3
3279,the new clerk couldn't figure out how to turn the temperature down,3
3280,the shower was moldy the toilet seat was also in need of replacement,3
3281,they people at the front desk was nice,3
3282,the hj staff were very accommodating to my needs,3
3283,not quite what i was expecting at all we got there at 9:50am and it was closed,3
3284,this time we stayed it was cleaner except the coffee pot was inoperative so that we would not have stayed the first night,3
3285,this hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and i have driven up the mountain just for the views,3
3286,when you are traveling on a budget not a lot to do around the hotel but the service was great,3
3287,bed was not very comfortable but weren't horrible and the rooms were average but clean with some upgrades,3
3288,the staff that did try and make up the breakfast were very nice and there was no pool very little space when you have kids,3
3289,clean great pool delicious breakfast and the staff wasn't overly friendly but it was clean and quiet with friendly competent staff,3
3290,for the price it was not worth it compared to other hotels in bali,3
3291,some of the rooms can be loud with a lot of hallway traffic which affected my sleep,3
3292,the rooms have not been renovated in a long time that missed several marks,3
3293,was a good place to stay if ur just wanting a quick place to sleep for a norseman who are used to colder bedrooms,3
3294,the only thing that i had a problem the last day as i was told i was upgraded,3
3295,my issues with this place are that there was no fridge in the room we were in was clean enough,3
3296,after spending one night there i realized the sliding glass door it did not go away,3
3297,it was super small we had a full kitchen it had no utensils or plates or anything in the room tv phone etc,3
3298,bathroom in my room was clean and beds were comfortable,3
3299,the staff moved us to a new room which was much better newer and cleaner,3
3300,didnt hear bell so i had to explain i was a guesst and it was just for a night or two,3
3301,the first floor which we walked through to get to the pool above the parking garage,3
3302,the hotel staff was very nice and price good,3
3303,waited to see if it was cleaned up but the dead ants were in the same room with us,3
3304,but on our stays it was clean and i felt safe there with my family,3
3305,so we were asked to come and pick it up at the front desk did not follow thru,3
3306,there is no daily housekeeping for us that wasn't a problem but she should have mentioned that they take a little extra for incidentals,3
3307,i would pay attention to this hotel is pretty sketchy though,3
3308,furniture was from the 80's as well as the fact as i had already paid taxes on the room when i walked in,3
3309,our view was the roof with the sound of the elevator hydraulic pump cycling on and off,3
3310,the breakfast they offer was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than i expected,3
3311,my daughter will be starting school there in the fall and the hotel is just above the water taxi stands creating noise at all times,3
3312,would've been a nice place for a short stay overnight only,3
3313,needless to say the unit worked better after i cleaned the handle for like 5 min i was not happy with that obviously,3
3314,room was so so and the bed was kind of sagging in the middle,3
3315,the building is getting a little dated and needed some detailed touches,3
3316,the suite was beautiful and the lobby was clean and inviting,3
3317,overall it is not the worst possible experience but it is not well maintained if it is,3
3318,the only complaint was that the beds were not very comfortable and the staff was friendly one was not,3
3319,the outside of the hotel is worth the money considering,3
3320,we booked this hotel was for an overnight stay after a wedding,3
3321,the room is old but clean and comfortable,3
3322,overall wouldn't stay again unless i had my dog,3
3323,in other words they try to get rid of smell good thing was atleast it worked,3
3324,when we checked in which was very thoughtful as it was a lay-over for our long trip to california,3
3325,we arrived and were told by the lady at the desk that was not the room we were moved to was in much better condition,3
3326,however i was there for 7 hours and my room was clean but smelled of smoke,3
3327,we ordered room service and there was a good variety of food choices,3
3328,cracker barrel restaurant right across the parking lot so that is convenient as well,3
3329,it's an older building but everything was clean everything was in working order,3
3330,my husband and i stayed here for a conference in town,3
3331,check in was straightforward and we had a double occupancy with a terrace overlooking a small canal,3
3332,the room itself was nice but the bedding looked old,3
3333,the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable and there was a dealer that i could resolve the problem,3
3334,for the price i paid i expected the room to be a bit more than ordinary,3
3335,we were disappointed in our weekend at this holiday inn express several timesaver the past 5 years,3
3336,this should tell you a lot when we got into the second room it smelled like cheap cologne,3
3337,i have stayed here multiple times over the past 20 years,3
3338,probably won't stay there anymore however the staff was very friendly and my family love the free breakfast,3
3339,a previous poster noted that it was located very close to where i needed to be,3
3340,150 after 2 pm and we were told yes they all pretty much were loud,3
3341,however considering the beachfront location i'm sure it was well past time for it,3
3342,in a rough neighbourhood but that's not much of a breakfast no eggs or bacon,3
3343,there was a ton of noise not only in the room the bathroom was extremelly smelly,3
3344,the hotel is also close to the airport and affordable,3
3345,typical country inn and suites brand cause we had stayed there many times before with out these problems,3
3346,for our stay we found the hotel a bit early around 1 pm,3
3347,didn't smell it in the hall but as soon as i entered the hotel it smelled of smoke,3
3348,you can either walk if feeling energetic or it's easy to bring your own bowls plates etc,3
3349,nice motel the only thing i didn't like that it was across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses,3
3350,the staff was friendly and the room was clean with comfortable beds and great air conditioning,3
3351,said breakfast was included but they didnt have enough sheets to give us any for,3
3352,we stayed at best western mainly for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
3353,check in was straightforward and we had a comfortable stay as we traveled north to ontario,3
3354,they turned off the water for a few hours of sleep and move on,3
3355,we just needed a place to stay when visiting someone from west point,3
3356,only a one night stay in a small town so we were not expecting much and that's what i was most concerned about,3
3357,hotel is in an excellent location right next to canyon entrance,3
3358,the hotel room had a smell to it,3
3359,otherwise it was cheap and convenient for a same day booking on a friday night with the option to pay or leave,3
3360,it was a no-smoking room but was given a smoking room and had to smell smoke all night not happy,3
3361,it wasn't that bad but it wasn't dirty and that's what i was after,3
3362,i was only in the room above us had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
3363,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
3364,the rooms were very noisy and you could hear everything that was going on,3
3365,there are plenty restaurants and stores and attractions tours to make your stay comfortable including a mini fridge,3
3366,the beds were comfortable better than most and everything work it had a few roaches though i killed them fast,3
3367,the room was dusty and the mattress was hard but i can sleep anywhere,3
3368,front desk people very nice and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
3369,this is a hotel so you have to go to the truck stop c-store to register,3
3370,breakfast was fine and they had a free shuttle to sfo is the best perk,3
3371,i grew up in boone and stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise so the location was great for shopping and getting around,3
3372,however it is showing its age and is in need of some updates paint but the staff was very nice and accommodating staff,3
3373,some kind of mix up there i have stayed here for years on our travels from ar to ga,3
3374,and the cost of my overnight stay was fine and i would stay here,3
3375,the place was very nice but the hotel is in a great location,3
3376,the desk clerk was extremely nice and the hotel was nice our room was spacious and very clean and comfortable,3
3377,nothing fancy but it was comfortable and the room was spacious and comfortable,3
3378,the first morning there was a lot of noise near the hotel,3
3379,i had no cause for actual complaint but my room was very adequate for the price,3
3380,my main complaint is the noise from the other guests or the neighborhood,3
3381,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but we were hoping for some protein either eggs or peanut butter,3
3382,no a c in room and the room was fine with a few minor inconveniences,3
3383,we were unable to get it fixed next day never done,3
3384,there is no mirror outside of the bathroom in the middle of times square,3
3385,if you're just looking for a cheap place to stay on our way to the cma festival in nashville,3
3386,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is starting to show it's age around the edges,3
3387,but if you are looking for soundproof rooms this is not the case in our room,3
3388,i arrived after midnight and had to use the dumpster located at the neighboring bank parking lot,3
3389,no staff at the desk were nice and so were the furnishings but all in all i had a good visit,3
3390,this comfort inn however must have been there for a long time while we were checking in,3
3391,just stayed here to sleep on a pull out couch to sleep 2 plus the king bed,3
3392,not fancy but it was clean and everything worked well,3
3393,he told me to start calling them the next day at 5 pm we took it,3
3394,but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference,3
3395,this time we stayed it was cleaner except the coffee pot was inoperative so that we would not have the promised coffee amenities,3
3396,it was ok for the money i think that it was overpriced for the area but then again all the hotels were overpriced,3
3397,this hotel had a clean room it was very small and strangely carpeted in red with no hot tub,3
3398,we arrive around 1 am for a 5 night stay and the breakfast was very basic but it was ok,3
3399,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
3400,it was just a stop over on our way to florida,3
3401,the wi-fi didn't work at all called the front desk assured me if it was found housekeeping would have it,3
3402,while i was happy to see a brand new bed in our room and was apologetic about it,3
3403,for a smoke free facility room smelled like smoke but beds were comfortable,3
3404,i was happy it had a microwave and refrigerator to make guests more comfortable,3
3405,the staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was clean didn't smell and was comfortable,3
3406,the front desk clerk was very friendly and it's a short ferry ride to bellagio too,3
3407,three more times we came back to the room it looked nice and more importantly smelled clean,3
3408,checkout was good and i told the lady at the front desk,3
3409,however my bed was creaky and didn't appear to happy to be there,3
3410,one set of friends had to move rooms from 1st floor to 2nd,3
3411,the restaurant staff was very nice and quickly accommodated my request,3
3412,at 6 in the morning i heard what sounded like a manager going over schedules,3
3413,rooms have all amenities but really need to be updated but for the price it was an acceptable stay,3
3414,it appreared there had not been a flag there for some time then got a very unfriendly person,3
3415,we had a nice stay for the most part the room was pretty quiet,3
3416,got there 1 hour after check in they was sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra,3
3417,3 nights 2 people 2 beds 450 great place to stay while in osage beach well i highly recommend this property,3
3418,our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker and low-sugar syrup,3
3419,the bathroom didn't work and the bathroom needed a little msintenance tiles were missing along the shower wall,3
3420,the tv was nice and having a fridge and microwave but could have been better,3
3421,although the location of this hotel works well as you have easy access to the highway and not overly expensive and this fit the bill,3
3422,however the price was good for a road trip stop,3
3423,the view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
3424,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about this place is the staff,3
3425,only have us new towels once and that was the reason for my rating is due to the,3
3426,the hotel was quiet and the location was good it was easy for me to make my own meals and sit comfortably and watch tv,3
3427,its just on the west side a bit out of date but the people were very friendly,3
3428,on a positive note the room was comfortable and clean but nothing fancy,3
3429,when we checked in they were under construction pool was closed and not working,3
3430,i had to argue for a non-smoking room that reaked of smoke,3
3431,hotel was clean and a good value for the price,3
3432,i stayed at this hotel due to its location on an intersection corner,3
3433,this place is cute but we expected more out of the name than what i got,3
3434,i rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the rooms and check out the bathrooms,3
3435,my 3 night reservation specified a late check in and early check out so didn't spend much time in room other than to sleep,3
3436,but this extended stay is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
3437,then we had to wait again at the front desk are happy to help,3
3438,2 the location is convenient to the shopping area and restaurants,3
3439,we'd just come from a hilton garden inn which is a very good option in boston's overpriced hotel market,3
3440,i was glad that our room did not smell like smoke,3
3441,overall the hotel was nice but the pool was super dirty,3
3442,employees were not very friendly at all and the breakfast was very minimal and they did not have chips and stains on them,3
3443,the remote for the tv did not work and i had to sit up for an hour in the middle of the day,3
3444,stayed here in april 2016 for one night only and felt that it was very clean and housekeeping staff was pleasant as well,3
3445,upon arrival tv remote was missing and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive,3
3446,i may try it again next time i am in the area,3
3447,overall not a bad place to stay when visiting someone from west point,3
3448,furnishings older and carpet is worn but was okay for a one night stay it was okay,3
3449,the room was basic but the location was great for that,3
3450,little problems we had with the place even though it had a full kitchen to prepare meals and not always had to eat out,3
3451,pros good location in the middle of tourist paradise 15 min,3
3452,this hotel was in an excellent location right off 475 macon bypass,3
3453,i wasn't happy about how small the room was and looked forward to a good nights rest,3
3454,hotel staff was friendly and helpful there was a little bit of travelling to reach is a must,3
3455,nice hotel great location and a decent breakfast,3
3456,pre-packaged breakfast food but it was free so what can you say,3
3457,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was an older property and was probably a smoking motel in the past,3
3458,the hotel had a promotion going on so we were able to stay in the fifth but i want improve and they can do,3
3459,the restaurant is too loud and without much of a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little,3
3460,very crowded the food is not as good and the staff cleaning and front desk were professional,3
3461,line at check-in but otherwise it was clean and the employees quite friendly,3
3462,in fairness the premises of the hotel are the small size of the room and ensuring the remainder of my stay was comfortable,3
3463,floors were beyond disgusting wear shoes at all times and the bed linens were clean as were the bathroom and towels,3
3464,clean hotel friendly staff but the rooms are small and rather cramped,3
3465,over all the hotel is a little outdated but very spacious and accomodating,3
3466,on our last day the power went out in the middle of the night after several hang ups,3
3467,we could not keep the water in the area has a strong sulfur smell,3
3468,great trip help at the hotel was great for the price,3
3469,there is alot of fresh food for breakfast and it was swamped with people,3
3470,the room itself was a good size for a family of five the two bedroom suite was very comfortable,3
3471,i was told downtown had decent places to eat and we booked it because it was recently remodeled,3
3472,we were promised two room next to each other and on the first floor or near an elevator on floors 2 or 3,3
3473,there were no linens so i had to book this hotel at the last minute,3
3474,room was clean and spacious the hotel restaurant was one of my favorite stops when in the area,3
3475,elevator shaft in the lobby is very small and limited stuff,3
3476,i enjoyed my stay but it was not on when we arrived,3
3477,loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room so it was about 90,3
3478,stood there with my wife kids to see a concert at the verizon ampitheater now irvine meadows,3
3479,the bones of the building are a little old but good for a room and a bed,3
3480,the bathroom small and the pumps in the shower did not drain properly and the water looked like dirty backed up water,3
3481,this hotel is good if you need a ride back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
3482,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
3483,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
3484,a regular type dining chair was in the room was good staff was nice,3
3485,though the hotel was older and a bit worn but the bed was good and breakfast was above average,3
3486,staff was friendly just on checking in the individual check in did not know how nor have any instructions on hand to set it up,3
3487,rose the assistant manager went above and beyond because of him i didn't have a ground-story room available,3
3488,so friendly here they go out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face,3
3489,not a bad stay hotel could use a bit of updating,3
3490,other than that the hotel was okay the hotel was fine but worn,3
3491,it is an ok place they gave me a white garage bag for my ice,3
3492,the staff that did try and make up for it by putting balloons in the room but wouldn't set it up,3
3493,the 3rd floor room has a lot of traffic noise but i should have known that since it was a one way driveway,3
3494,i had food in the refrigerator that would spoil if it wasn't so bad but that was just my room,3
3495,this hotel was reasonably priced and we had a 6 am international flight so that wasn't something we wanted to do,3
3496,microwave in room was a nice size clean and the tv was the oldest grainiest model i've seen in years,3
3497,lady at desk nice but had to apologize that the hotel had just charged us a 50 fee,3
3498,place is very low cost and walking distance to the beach shops and dining,3
3499,in a rough neighbourhood but that's not much of a breakfast no eggs or bacon,3
3500,it really is bare bones in terms of amenities but if you don't have a coffeemaker ask it at front desk,3
3501,it wasn't the cleanest and the breakfast was mediocre that is probably a generous description,3
3502,it's literally 60 seconds from the convention center so the location was great and the rooms were tiny,3
3503,the hotel was nice our room was spacious and very clean and comfortable,3
3504,i saw this place and it was a big plus that there was a printer and computer in the lobby was wonderful,3
3505,i stayed here because it was close to the plant i was working at,3
3506,great stay because of staff especially betty and karla at the front desk they said they would bring one right down,3
3507,breakfast fare was not good but overall it was clean and there was no available plug for the coffee maker it had to be changed,3
3508,nearly half are located across the street in an abandoned poorly lit parking lot which was a little discomfiting,3
3509,i picked this hotel as it was close to where his family's house,3
3510,we always try to stay at another hotel across the freeway it was full,3
3511,she was irritated that i wanted plates at a late hour we slept good and we left early,3
3512,enjoyed our stay at the jayakarta but the facilities in the room and told her the beds had not been made either,3
3513,the hotel is outdated but overall for a one night stay on a trip to walt disney world,3
3514,it snowed one night and the price we paid for it,3
3515,the tub whirlpool feature didn't work and the hot tub did not work and i was told it did upon arrival,3
3516,we have been coming here for years and never had a complaint,3
3517,i stayed here on a casino trip because the other hotels were full so they raised their prices,3
3518,normally we stay at another hotel next year,3
3519,as you know new orleans can get a lot of noise from the highway,3
3520,it had a smell and we didn't want to be out walking after dark,3
3521,shower was ok it had an old box tv and everything in the bathroom was pretty bad,3
3522,overall a pretty nice place to stay for the price,3
3523,the wifi never connected and we had to wait 2 hours in the parking lot,3
3524,rooms are a bit small but the bathroom had been well renovated,3
3525,rooms were clean but i will likely try a different hotel when i am in waterville again,3
3526,i booked a king suite they put us in a room directly across from the freeway so it's easy to catch a bus,3
3527,the staff is very friendly and the room was very dated but it was nice,3
3528,i've stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past and had no complaints,3
3529,ac was good bed was comfy enough pools are great and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries,3
3530,no amenities such as coffee maker in the room but your not promised what you asked for,3
3531,for the price of the room was difficult to maneuver,3
3532,my stay there was for the convenience to take care of any need i may have had,3
3533,overall it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
3534,room too small not sure it was worth the 144,3
3535,the most convenient place to stay in the hotel we had booked this would have been a big deal if we didn't use,3
3536,the breakfast provided was good a variety and we liked that it had a swimming pool and fitness center as well as valet parking,3
3537,other than that it got the job done and that's about it,3
3538,its not fancy but for the most part but the beds were very worn out but the room looked very dated,3
3539,there was rust spots on the bottom of the bathtub also looked very dirty,3
3540,the new clerk couldn't figure out why the front desk person was friendly and helpfull,3
3541,price was about 20 higher per night than i thought it would fall down on us so i turned,3
3542,room we were given was fine but can't figure out why the front desk person on duty,3
3543,people need receipts and cant wait 30 minutes to check-in while waiting for our room to be inspected,3
3544,i understand i am not a smoker and neither is my sister,3
3545,room was spacious and clean the only problem was the bathroom,3
3546,there's a little pantry of a place in the shower to lay your soap or to set you shampoo,3
3547,denny's is about a 5min walk from the hotel and its rooms are not brand new they are well maintained,3
3548,overall it is a good place to stay for a night at a reasonable rate,3
3549,the room was next to the elevator which made for a great night's sleep,3
3550,cons it was very noisy and propped open,3
3551,the building is well kept and the room wasn't bad but we did not do that,3
3552,we did not get a good night's sleep because the bed was comfortable the room was clean and well maintained,3
3553,valet parking is mandatory as there is no a c but we were fine,3
3554,this visit was for a family get together for a night and best thing off that exit,3
3555,my wife stayed at this hotel recently when attending a concert at the webster theater on 3 26 16,3
3556,the biggest problem we had was that the double beds are awfully small so i asked for a microwave they would give one,3
3557,my wife and i were in philly for an evening and just needed a bed and shower the next morning,3
3558,turned out there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and were told that this was a great hotel in a terrific location,3
3559,there was quite a bit of hair on the floor was never cleaned up,3
3560,first the positives casino and buffet staff were very friendly even though they had to field many complaints,3
3561,the walls are very thin and you can see the tourists,3
3562,the pool was ok but i wouldn't stay there again,3
3563,number of people handling breakfast was very less and were not able to open the door to the bathroom,3
3564,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice,3
3565,my biggest problem was just the fact that it is located on a side street so it's not a 4 or 5 star property,3
3566,the room was okay but not very accommodating,3
3567,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the room or anywhere else on dining activities attractions delivery in the area,3
3568,since the tables are in the middle of tourist paradise 15 min,3
3569,the bathroom tub so old we didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1,3
3570,blanca at the lodge was extremely friendly and the rooms were freezing and the heaters did not work very well,3
3571,room was what we expected for the money,3
3572,the only soda and ice machines available were on the first floor in the back room which was a comfortable place,3
3573,rooms were clean and the staff extremely friendly and room large clean,3
3574,it was in front of the tv was very good it had a frig and microwave,3
3575,i was told downtown had decent places to eat and we booked it because it was recently remodeled,3
3576,and the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet that was free but opted to go across the street to another place,3
3577,the air conditioning control was nonfunctional the alarm clock did not work and tv channels did not have any really bad experiences,3
3578,the neighborhood is nice and there was a big crack in the bathroom wall,3
3579,the hotel is in dire need of a place to stay passing through it works,3
3580,hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and i needed a basic hotel near sfo for one night,3
3581,because i went through a 3 rd party they said i had to wait until 3 pm,3
3582,the hotel staff came in my room when i first arrived but it was switched to another,3
3583,no frills so if you need a place to stay for the price,3
3584,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue,3
3585,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was because there was a discount,3
3586,we stayed here specifically for the location between the airport and the price was hard to beat,3
3587,it was exactly what i wanted every morning,3
3588,this was ok for a night's sleep,3
3589,the staff was friendly and helpful and the location was great and the reason i checked backed in this hotel,3
3590,our room on the first floor and the elevator was extremely dirty and our bathroom door did not close or lock properly,3
3591,i stayed at this hotel several times before and probably will not stay at a casino resort again,3
3592,in the second room the tub had no plug so there was no way that regular size luggage would have fit in it,3
3593,the in room guest showed only one ice machine and it is on 1st floor,3
3594,we stay there because of the pool situation,3
3595,in order to get ice you have to go to the truck stop c-store to register,3
3596,but i will say it was a lot better but no kids are allowed,3
3597,bathroom had no shelf in the shower and found a lot more,3
3598,on the plus side rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
3599,the location was great directly off the highway which was convenient but a little noisy,3
3600,probably won't stay there anymore because of the price and not the standard of a real 5 hotel,3
3601,the decor was a bit dated and breakfast was limited but the help was very helpful and friendly,3
3602,i never the rain again to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
3603,pool was locked after it was supposed to be ok if they did not have anyone they could send up to look at it,3
3604,service could be better concierge didn't give us the wi-fi on a laptop not on my mobile devices,3
3605,indicating it had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk people were nice,3
3606,room was clean and the customer service was good despite the obstacles that made for an uncomfortable stay,3
3607,continental breakfast was very limited and i believe the rooms in the main villa overlooking florence,3
3608,as others have mentioned the neighborhood is rather rundown so we didn't want to spend a lot for a room,3
3609,room was not cleaned or towels replaced but we found out the pool was not available because of maintenance,3
3610,my husband and i stayed one night 8 2 before spending the next day at about noon to see if one would be available,3
3611,very loud you can hear everything in the halls and the fridge was cold,3
3612,it is the best part of town but there were plenty of pools areas to enjoy,3
3613,ill stay here again if visiting kauai,3
3614,the road noise was so bad it sounded like a vacuum cleaner every time it turned on,3
3615,we stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise so the location was perfect for me as well,3
3616,one of which we had tried before had a bad experience with my room when i wasn't there to get a room service cart,3
3617,for 50 for 2 ppl i would expect a clean room room without debris on floor,3
3618,wow what an awesome view from our room except the roof of the convention center and not far from downtown by car to waterville,3
3619,the stay was good but the pool was super dirty,3
3620,no lights in the swimming area or around the restaurant in the hotel as well as the rooms,3
3621,room was nice and comfortable with a nice view of mountains out our room window,3
3622,lobby is very nice but the room itself was very nice and helpful,3
3623,the breakfast was ok make your own waffles was great and the airport shuttle was good to have,3
3624,chose this hotel for the price and that was certainly delivered,3
3625,i stayed at this hotel several times before and probably will not stay at a casino hotel again,3
3626,i actually ended with this hotel based on the price i was pleased with the size and comfort of the room,3
3627,took much too long for someone to notify us that it was a good place outside needs a little fixing up,3
3628,i've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the room was clean and the staff was very helpful,3
3629,room was very comfortable the room was clean and comfy beds close to airport with free shuttle,3
3630,small room and bathroom but overall it was clean and the fridge empty,3
3631,upon checkout we were informed that we were charged for 1 soda and 1 snack smh,3
3632,dear erincorbo thank you so much for taking the time to complete an online review your feedback is important,3
3633,the condo resort is in a great location and we have stayed here many times and really like this place,3
3634,it has a fairly decent breakfast and our room was still available no problems at all,3
3635,the staff was friendly and check-in and check out was very simple and fast,3
3636,just spent one night but it was a nice hotel but not friendly,3
3637,i could even hear the couple in the room next is complaining,3
3638,other than that and the extreme price 350 per night the hotel was quiet as not fully open yet,3
3639,they have a microwave and small fridge in the room and a kitchenette which we didn't use the gym or the pool etc,3
3640,breakfast wasn't stocked after several attempts to get the key card to work perhaps because it was a pet friendly motel,3
3641,i stayed here for the price and location,3
3642,the manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for 50 mins to get picked up at the airport,3
3643,good to stop and rest after a long day in the sun followed by a car crash in a parking lot,3
3644,a previous stay at an abmi in a different location and it was significantly less expensive,3
3645,i put the do not disturb sign up,3
3646,the included continental breakfast was what you would expect to get in motel,3
3647,which i was cool with but there was only one water glass and one coffee cup,3
3648,i asked that it just be cleaned returned to our room at nearly 10:00pm all we wanted to do,3
3649,we decided to book two rooms at this hotel for a stop during our move cross-country,3
3650,only bad thing i have to say the front desk staff were really nice though,3
3651,it was a comfortable enough room to come back to after a day of sightseeing or at the beach,3
3652,once manager came all she kept saying was that's why we don't have a coffeemaker ask it at front desk,3
3653,doesn't have an elevator so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own bowls plates etc,3
3654,very loud you can hear everything in the halls and being farther away would probably help,3
3655,lovely town plenty of restaurants within walking distance applebee's and chili's,3
3656,the bedroom was clean and the staff were helpful and pleasant,3
3657,televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
3658,no longer having any fight left in me as this was supposed to be a non smoking room we could smell some smoke,3
3659,therefore before i could officially check out i had to go down to the lobby where it was warm to await by friends,3
3660,others at the front desk who seemed to be having too good of a time,3
3661,the hotel was very clean as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
3662,i felt as if i was given the bottom of the cup it was filled with grounds,3
3663,the air conditioner didn't work and bed was extremely hard,3
3664,it's very much a you get what you pay for but i've had better 60 rooms,3
3665,the room we were given was so small we couldn't get room cold enough and the gym was dirty,3
3666,the line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of the worst hotels for shuttle service,3
3667,it's not fancy but there is a sports bar next door that was extremely noisy which made sleeping difficult,3
3668,at the time we stayed there they provided us with a crib i do not recommend this to tourist good for needing somewhere to stay,3
3669,room was small and the internet was free,3
3670,possibly one of the worst continental breakfasts i've ever had,3
3671,the bed was comfortable although there was a small roach in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel,3
3672,average room for an average price just a stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
3673,i could feel the springs on the bed but it was comfortable enough and got rested up for the next 6 weeks,3
3674,after i called hotels and they send a new confirmation i got a room where parking was included but at a different lot,3
3675,with it true but it doesn't affect the rooms,3
3676,clean convenient and close to the exit,3
3677,i'd only recommend this hotel if you have a moving truck,3
3678,you really can't beat the price and the staff was pleasant,3
3679,overall this is a great hotel in the university district,3
3680,for the rate it was a good experience the room looked very nice,3
3681,not an attractive building and not an attractive location but rooms are large and it was quiet at night but some daytime remodeling noise,3
3682,outside of that the rooms were clean but severely dated,3
3683,front desk staff was very courteous and helpful during my stay,3
3684,it snowed one night and the power went out in the middle of everything,3
3685,we stayed here while visiting the university of washington hospital so location was key and we were close to the lobby and check out,3
3686,we stayed at this hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub we're large perfect temperature and enjoyable,3
3687,it appreared there had not been a flag there for some time then got a very unfriendly person,3
3688,we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel if you're planning on spending the whole day at the pool,3
3689,since we didn't spend much time in room other than to sleep,3
3690,the fan in the bathroom was curling along the front of the hotel on the ground level,3
3691,we only stayed a night as part of a wedding room block in may 2015,3
3692,i was surprised that when you walk in your hot room,3
3693,typical country inn and suites brand cause we had stayed there many times before with out these problems,3
3694,negatives even though it is in maryland the price was good and the ladies were really nice who did the breakfast,3
3695,however the bathroom was not very clean and the bed was comfortable,3
3696,overall it was an okay experience with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the road noise from i-95,3
3697,access to the room was a real disappointment,3
3698,stayed here a couple of years ago the property is showing some wear but the room and bed were fine for one night,3
3699,the pool has drainage problems and there was a crackel barrel with in walking distance,3
3700,the room was okay but the a c wasnt working so they sent up a bottle of wine,3
3701,in addition there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and a malfunctioning heating cooling unit,3
3702,we did not find the room as clean as i would have liked,3
3703,the walk to the stadium an easy safe walk from the hotel and its rooms are not brand new they are well maintained,3
3704,however we had a room with a handicap-accessible bathroom,3
3705,the hotel and rooms could use some updating but we had a bad experience with best western,3
3706,when we arrived our room smelled of smoke and needed to be updated,3
3707,just wish i had requested a wake up call for 6:30 am,3
3708,nevertheless he went out of his way to make sure everyone was taken care of,3
3709,the hotel itself was ok but it was a weekend it wasn't able to be fixed,3
3710,i will choose this again next time i'm that way,3
3711,i didn't get much sleep here the walls were thin and i was woken by neighbors turning on water,3
3712,we sat around and waited until 11 when all we wanted to do and see and it was mostly quiet and comfortable,3
3713,we enjoyed the indoor pool which was warm and inviting with jazz music being piped in and the front desk was very helpful,3
3714,clean room great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
3715,airport shuttle and when we checked in the front desk staff was great and accommodating,3
3716,i strongly suggest not staying at this hotel if you're looking for a nice looking room go elsewhere,3
3717,lots of restaurants movies shopping in the immediate area except for fast food,3
3718,hotel is dated but it is clean and the breakfast is ok continental,3
3719,room 3 and 4 which my parents and i stayed in one of the rooms in the main villa overlooking florence,3
3720,the beach cove resort hotel is an older hotel that has had some cosmetic improvements but,3
3721,they draft your card as soon as you opened the door,3
3722,the hotel was in a great location though and there aren't a lot of options in this immediate area,3
3723,we needed a hotel convenient to the ny thruway for a quick overnight stay but it's a great hotel for the money,3
3724,at 6 in the morning i don't want to hear traffic noise all night like i read in other reviews,3
3725,this is a shame because the bed was comfortable and everything was clean,3
3726,when we went to the ip for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it,3
3727,carpet was spotted and did not feel safe or clean,3
3728,it was a decent experience at this hotel was only 25,3
3729,i told her that was the only reason i would stay here again,3
3730,if you wanted air flow you had to leave the room and cross the hall at the top of my list for accommodations,3
3731,i really appreciated not having to deal with the front desk and request a change which i would probably not stay here again,3
3732,my only complaint was that there seemed to be something wrong with the card reader on the door,3
3733,the hotel met our needs for the night,3
3734,i asked for a refrigerator and to be on the higher end of what we have to choose from in lavonia ga,3
3735,the room was appointed like an innner city loft except it was the size of our room which was finally ready,3
3736,the back of the hotel was kept open at night due to the lack of any sun light,3
3737,what we didn't like the really high valet parking and there was no ac at this time of year,3
3738,checkin was swift once we were able to complete watching a program,3
3739,but the price of the 2 bedroom condo that we reserved was small,3
3740,so on a whim we checked in and was informed that the elevator was not working on the second day we stayed two nights,3
3741,they were so loud with people going in and out of rooms all night,3
3742,the tv remote was missing and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive,3
3743,the lobby is nice the rooms are what you can expect from the area,3
3744,the arion resort and spa hotel is not a bad choice for a one night stay,3
3745,the wall material next to the window it was very different,3
3746,upon my 5 pm check-in i asked for a manager she offered fruit for my inconvenience,3
3747,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
3748,this hotel is under new management again and many of the commerces appeared closed for good which is,3
3749,don't forget you can be one of the first we saw and it a little late in the evening,3
3750,nothing fancy by any stretch but it doesn't hold enough so we had to switch rooms,3
3751,the staff were all very friendly and helpful and greated us with a smile,3
3752,room was fine but the amount of noise in the room was not cleaned and ready for check in at 6 pm,3
3753,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about the place other than the location,3
3754,the pictures from the website made the room seem more clean and modern,3
3755,check in was quick and easy the staff was friendly and overall we had a nice stay,3
3756,beautiful view great market a short walk away we had a nice stay for the price,3
3757,sofa bed cushions were getting pretty flattened and need to be brought up to the condition of the lobby,3
3758,all in all it appears hyatt is cutting corners at this hotel and to return home to nc early in the morning,3
3759,basic room with two large beds that took up most of the room so it was about 90,3
3760,due to other reservations we were upgraded to a suite with a fireplace steamboat suite for the evening celebrating my husband's birthday,3
3761,coffee maker is stored under the sink in the room had a light musty smell,3
3762,the stay was quiet and relaxing so we got a good quiet sleep every night there,3
3763,i also had to wait a long time for a shower which i really enjoyed,3
3764,a large bathroom but the sink is too high square sink on top of the head boards and the lights,3
3765,the hotel was very nice however we booked a room for a weekend in a couple weeks,3
3766,they also make a lot of noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
3767,she got on her computer and found a room that smelled of cigarette smoke,3
3768,there were also a lot of naked old men hanging out on the ceiling of the bathroom all weekend also,3
3769,however the staff was very friendly at americinn but the pool was very small and not very fluffy,3
3770,but the problem i had was i specifically asked for a room with windows on the other side,3
3771,when we asked a manager if we could change rooms but they were completely booked,3
3772,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room would benefit from serious renovation,3
3773,i felt when i asked for some they didn't have a room for you,3
3774,i shopped for a cheap room and that is what is nice about it,3
3775,the rooms are clean and comfortable but nothing particularly special,3
3776,room service breakfast was 30 min late and i had to squeeze in just to get our carry on bags to fit,3
3777,when i had some bring up sheets for a fold out bed which was listed as available when we booked,3
3778,my fiance and i stayed at palm suites for the first time in telluride,3
3779,hotel is too close to the highway nice room was spacious and very clean and comfortable,3
3780,the hotel is great and as advertised is right on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
3781,unfortunately when we arrived we were assigned to the second floor from the first,3
3782,but front desk was very helpful and friendly,3
3783,website for this hotel is deceiving in that it depicts that the hotel is starting to show it's age around the edges,3
3784,good deal breakfast was not great but we were tired and did not even think to ask but he did,3
3785,breakfirst is very soso and rooms have not refrig and one of the best values and had availability,3
3786,it was clean and comfortable and the parking is safe,3
3787,my feet were blistered by the end of the building nearest a large truck parking area,3
3788,the hotel was located in a bad area of town,3
3789,the handicap room did not have a control for the air conditioner the internet and television in the bedroom did not work,3
3790,staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was clean but the rug in the lobby needed cleaned or shampooed,3
3791,service is excellent rooms are clean and comfortable but we could hear footsteps from the floor above all night,3
3792,the hotel was clean and the fridge empty,3
3793,the rooms are older and smaller and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables,3
3794,hotwire indicated a resort fee for the stay but it is what it is,3
3795,this hotel is ok for the price but no extras,3
3796,the hotel was not going to be in the dining area without any tv's,3
3797,i liked that it was close to i40 and the front desk clerk was empowered to make me the customer satisfied,3
3798,the hotel was conveniently at a good rate this hotel would work fine,3
3799,also the bed was very comfortable the staff is very friendly and,3
3800,convenient when you rent bring a car but not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were,3
3801,breakfast was ok but the room was great reception and fast,3
3802,the room was a nice size clean and the tv was too tiny for the room,3
3803,the room was fine and the staff was friendly and prompt with the reservation,3
3804,we were charged a smoking fee for a room that obviously sleeps more than two and no more at the desk,3
3805,shower never got hit and water pressure not great had a working refridge and a small microwave,3
3806,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice,3
3807,this was my first stay at this motel and for one night it was not a good selection for breakfast the ice machine on the,3
3808,i chose this hotel because i didn't call ahead i had to wait awhile at the front desk who was very sweet and professional,3
3809,my fianc and i stayed here for the night and the person at the front desk,3
3810,we were not going to be in the best part of the hotel is very clean,3
3811,first they don't have non-smoking rooms had on the last visit,3
3812,they were drinking alcohol in the hot tub this is not good for them,3
3813,the internet at the hotel is great and as advertised is right on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
3814,no hot water on the 4th floor very quiet bed comfortable,3
3815,when she checked in we were told we were on the doggie floor,3
3816,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any of the major networks i,3
3817,the first room we were given was dark and gloomy didn't have a problem with got way to hot,3
3818,the asian guy at the reception wasn't prepeared to help us with any concerns that we had,3
3819,the staff for the most part the room was pretty good,3
3820,our room rate with hotels was very reasonable so i am not a 5 star person by any any,3
3821,as soon as you opened the door to the balcony did not lock,3
3822,perhaps a little pricier than i was looking for a day spa while traveling to colorado springs,3
3823,this hotel was reasonably priced and we had a 1st floor room near the pool,3
3824,i probably won't be staying here again,3
3825,hotel was clean but for the price i just couldn't get any wifi signal in room 101,3
3826,the meal was okay but not very accommodating,3
3827,but it's done so with a fairly blank face with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the road noise from i-95,3
3828,the room itself was nice but the pool was very welcoming clean very relaxing,3
3829,other than that the room was in the detached block and i believe the owner's wife,3
3830,unless you know the access to the street didn't feel the cleaning was sufficient as the room was being cleaned,3
3831,room had a fridge and microwave was convenient,3
3832,worth on i 30 west is an older property that is adequate but not especially good,3
3833,also you could hear pipes banging in the wall in my room was broken,3
3834,the first room we were given was so small we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit,3
3835,it does have a microwave and fridge in the room is noisy we asked to have a cot in the room,3
3836,i went to branson for 4th of july so there were very few guests at all so not sure why the short memory,3
3837,me and the mrs stayed at the hotel valencia for a few days,3
3838,some of the rooms have a refrigerator and microwave in the room,3
3839,we only used hj for an overnight stay but wouldn't want to spend,3
3840,also we were under impression we were getting a room with a queen or king size bed as opposed to two doubles,3
3841,were not happy about the parking our only option was responded to as if i was ungrateful about getting a room,3
3842,older hotel that could use some updates sloppy job grouting,3
3843,not a big deal but i felt like this hotel was run down and tired,3
3844,there were stains on a pillow carpet was filthy and there was a sports bar which must be why the cost was so much,3
3845,we rented a room with a view of a tiny woodsy area,3
3846,called up to the front desk clerk was not very friendly to the elderly person in front of me,3
3847,well the hotel has a amazing views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
3848,we stayed one night at the beginning of the stay that i was not told about contruction when i made reservations,3
3849,there was too many flies in the room that wasn't pleasant,3
3850,it was convenient for us but we probably won't stay again unless there wasn't another choice,3
3851,helpful employees room very small advertised a queen size bed and got a double bed,3
3852,hotel and staff were excellent but the walls are very thin and you can see the tourists,3
3853,and we were asked to come and pick it up at the front desk was helpful elevator was extremely slow,3
3854,the pool was dirty but i didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of year,3
3855,however there are some logistics problems the entrance to the hotel is slightly tricky but not bad,3
3856,my son had to sleep in spare bed,3
3857,parkside inn looks nice and inviting from the outside however the rooms are very small especially for a family of 4,3
3858,little old lady at the front desk no one answered,3
3859,the only complaint was the mattress was very hard and the pillows were very thick and hard,3
3860,i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks and give this place a better review than a 3,3
3861,not a bad place i've stayed but not the best,3
3862,this hotel was very convenient to the airport and affordable,3
3863,we rented a room with a whirlpool bath and i remembered the pool area was very small and the bed was comfortable enough,3
3864,needless to say my family and i had to walk around the lobby and casino in bathing suit because of pool location,3
3865,need to update this whole place as we will not be coming back to this horrible hotel,3
3866,the rooms are not much but it is clean with a fridge microwave and airconditioning,3
3867,we also were told there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
3868,room was clean and the beds were dirty so we had to wait for 15minutes to get to my room,3
3869,no pool or exercise room and located in a seedy neighborhood but the room was very dated but it was nice,3
3870,the owners are nice enough but don't expect any bells or whistles here,3
3871,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room would have been fine except,3
3872,the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it's dust cigarette smoke or mildew,3
3873,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was because there was a discount,3
3874,i selected this hotel because of its close proximity to the beach and shops and in this respect we were pleased,3
3875,some construction guys were in and out a lot that night and don't know that i would stop here again though,3
3876,i have stayed here before and it's a short ferry ride to bellagio too,3
3877,i needed a place to stay for a second night,3
3878,i immediately called the office as soon as i told them about it and nothing was done to fix it,3
3879,i was so tired and i couldn't get on line to see what the problem was,3
3880,woman at the desk was very nice and our check-in was speedy,3
3881,at 6:30 i gave up showered and went down to the front desk he asked me do you want it to be cleaned,3
3882,hotel is convenient for us and close to the beach but not really good either,3
3883,we were in-town for one night and no cc on its tv,3
3884,the hotel was a nice place and close to the colleges,3
3885,despite that the staff was very helpful and friendly,3
3886,there was a festival in town so many of the hotel chains did not provide any shuttle service,3
3887,the reception staff was very polite and helpful,3
3888,wifi access coded given upon check in rather than having to call the front desk for several things and they were very nice and clean,3
3889,shower and bathroom while appeared to be clean and in good working condition,3
3890,i was only in the room above ours,3
3891,that is the nicest thing i can say it's clean in the room but wouldn't set it up,3
3892,they are in the process of being updated,3
3893,that said the room was clean but very cheap,3
3894,unless you know the access to the hotel can be difficult to communicate with if you do not speak spanish,3
3895,the gentleman at the front desk named jonathan,3
3896,anyway the room we were placed in a no smoking room,3
3897,the back of the hotel was as far away from the beach and an easy location to the highway,3
3898,poor internet service and the different channels on the tv and nothing for kids to watch,3
3899,the carpet was not as clean as it should have been that bad,3
3900,the pool area was nice but they didn't have a room for you,3
3901,1 there was a dead roach in the middle of the mattress to avoid any discomfort,3
3902,the room was spacious and clean the only issue i had with the room was an odd musky smell,3
3903,i selected this hotel because of the hotel,3
3904,i thought the hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a one night stay,3
3905,it was not the worst place i've ever stayed great people and the guy at the front desk,3
3906,the majority of staff were very nice but seemed understaffed,3
3907,spare blanket in closet needed for pull out sofa had to be moved and the tv unplugged in order to use it,3
3908,i would definitely not go there again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
3909,the club car is nice but the staff was very friendly and it's a nice comfortable hotel,3
3910,cracker barrel restaurant right across the parking lot so that is convenient as well,3
3911,hotel is older and in need of a good sprucing up,3
3912,walls were paper thin and you could hear people in the hallways and rooms,3
3913,also there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room as nowadays most places do,3
3914,first and foremost it's a beautiful hotel in a great location on lake and has great rooftop restaurant and bar,3
3915,the hotel was adequate for that but the room was clean,3
3916,but the air conditioner in our room didn't work properly but i didn't want a 1 star dirty motel 6 either,3
3917,with it true but it doesn't affect the rooms,3
3918,the room was great for the price i would recommend this hotel if you have any intention of using wifi,3
3919,there were no extra blankets available in the room and told her the beds had not been made although the towels were replaced,3
3920,i was also not used to the water which seemed to have a renovated bathroom the walls desperately needed a coat of paint,3
3921,the hotel staff was very nice but the hallways are dingy,3
3922,she was very courteous and helpful when it came to bed time the noise from the highway all night long,3
3923,i should have booked on the other side of the room i was expecting atleast basic amenities to be in good condition,3
3924,overall the hotel was clean and the employees were friendly,3
3925,hardly anything was up to date the walls looked beat up and there was a big crack in the bathroom wall,3
3926,overall central location to a lot of great things about this hotel was the closest i could find so i gave it a try,3
3927,not really any refrigeration available no breakfast and no close restaurants,3
3928,room was fine but the breakfast was one of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a couple days,3
3929,bfast good they have a waffle maker and some muffins,3
3930,dinner very good we didn't have enough people on staff,3
3931,the room and bathroom were clean and warm,3
3932,it was also convenient to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
3933,staff at reception were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was really good but the rooms needed some serious renovations,3
3934,one complaint would be the breakfast area is much too small,3
3935,the was sheet was not clean so it had to be moved in order to open,3
3936,on a positive note the room was comfortable and clean but nothing fancy,3
3937,room was nice location but hotel was in need of updating with patched holes scuffed walls a cigarette burn in,3
3938,the bedroom was clean and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
3939,this hotel is clean and beds are confortable,3
3940,but if you are looking for soundproof rooms this is not the case in our room,3
3941,i had food in the refrigerator that would spoil if it wasn't so bad but that was just my room,3
3942,advertised as a family place but way too many people for the pool and side doors etc,3
3943,there is only one person working the front desk and he was awoken from his nap because of this,3
3944,next time i will ask for a cc for incidentals even if you are a guest,3
3945,although we didn't need it except for a place to rest and sleep a while this motel is very acceptable,3
3946,i would stay here again because of the proximity to what we were visiting and other was full,3
3947,the hotel rooms were a little out dated,3
3948,personnel at desk were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was pretty boring,3
3949,the hairdryer was missing the towels were rough and scratchy and there was leftover beard trimmings on the bathroom sink,3
3950,overall not too bad though if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills,3
3951,turns out there was a bus stop at the entrance and no more fresh fruit there either just tacky,3
3952,the room did not have a control for the air conditioner the internet and television in the bedroom did not work,3
3953,this hotel is convenient for us and close to the colleges,3
3954,i was told at the time of booking were not available,3
3955,there was a refrigerator in the room which i had already bought,3
3956,the room was very outdated and for the price i'd recommended this hotel,3
3957,i wasn't luxurious but that wasn't the view i had planned for a vacation,3
3958,after the second night i stayed i was in a bit of shock when we saw it as we wondered if the,3
3959,the hotel is outdated but overall for a one night stay on our way to visit family,3
3960,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
3961,we had asked for a cot and when we arrived there were several people outside in the parking lot,3
3962,so it was taxi time on the way back to the hotel near the republique next time,3
3963,the hotel was clean and well appointed,3
3964,people need receipts and cant wait 30 minutes to check-in while waiting for our room to be inspected,3
3965,so my guys had to sit in the dining area and then we could go to the beach and towns,3
3966,one set of friends had to move rooms from 1st floor to 2nd,3
3967,for the most part however i think the room could have some mechanical work done but our stay was enjoyable,3
3968,breakfast is eh but the wine and cheese offering in the evening was dreadful,3
3969,right off i-96 easy to get to easy to get to,3
3970,room had urnine dirty towels when i go there but i called and they wanted to charge me 20 per day,3
3971,my advice is to ask for a few things and it felt like air-conditioning,3
3972,the lobby was a bit offputting because it had a pool apon arrival the pool was not available because of maintenance,3
3973,but almost every day we had to get our keys reprogrammed each day,3
3974,but the ac also made a horrible racket so we couldn't leave them open so we used the ac a lot,3
3975,front desk clerk was very friendly at americinn but the pool was very pretty and the food good,3
3976,desk clerk was wonderful he went above and beyond to help us set up a shuttle,3
3977,a place to sleep so it served its purpose for good rest and shower,3
3978,although the hotel is in a great location with great views of the ocean,3
3979,overall fine place for a stop over it was clean but we wouldn't stay there again,3
3980,they people at the front desk was very understaffed,3
3981,the room was cheap and clean but my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
3982,2 the hot breakfast was a plus and the staff was very friendly amd accommodating,3
3983,the only good thing i could say is the bed was comfortable and the staff is accommodating,3
3984,lots of restaurants movies shopping in the immediate area but you have to walk a couple blocks from here,3
3985,there � � �s no sound proofing and you can hear people walking down the hall,3
3986,if this place was a budget price i would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu,3
3987,i booked bayside because we stayed here before we booked it,3
3988,we were traveling through to nm and this was a bit far from disneyland to walk,3
3989,i was happy to see a brand new bed in our room and it seamed cramped the pool is nice but small,3
3990,this is my second stay at this hotel in 3 years,3
3991,here i was a woman travelling alone and i liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows,3
3992,the location is not bad as it is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from venice,3
3993,there are soda or ice machines on the second floor next to each other,3
3994,but when i arrived i was given a double bed standard,3
3995,we did not have a control for the air conditioner the internet and television in the bedroom did not work,3
3996,the breakfast staff was very friendly and helpful,3
3997,however the staff was really great and the room was ok there was a lot of construction being done to the hotel,3
3998,room too small not sure it was worth the price,3
3999,i had to argue for a non-smoking hotel could stink of smoke,3
4000,the included continental breakfast was what you would expect from a comfort inn,3
4001,although this room seemed to have a slight odor to it,3
4002,the rooms are sadly out dated and in need of a good nights rest for the the expensive price you will pay,3
4003,you just don't know what else to say but trip advisor is making me use 200 characters,3
4004,they have a microwave and small fridge in the room and are using extension cords to accommodate all the lights,3
4005,no one was ever at the front desk was extremely helpful kind,3
4006,i was the last one to check in for yiur flights was down but the check in was fast and polite,3
4007,best things bed was firm and comfortable front desk staff was very nice with restaurants all around,3
4008,they assigned us a smoking room and had to move us 2 days later,3
4009,just to have a place to rest in between a long road trip because hotel ratings were higher than area i was closets too,3
4010,there was construction going on in front of the tv was very nice,3
4011,an attempt has been made to update it but the rooms are in drastic need of an overhaul,3
4012,we have stayed at this hotel as it was close to where i needed to be patient,3
4013,the hotel itself is welcoming the staff friendly and helpful the bed was comfy and the climate in the room was ridiculous,3
4014,access to the room was very comfortable the staff is very helpful and friendly,3
4015,the hotel was clean and quiet however the staff was really nice and accommodating,3
4016,it is an ok place to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant,3
4017,and our room was directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
4018,highly recommend this as the place to stay in livermor and where we will stay in the future,3
4019,otherwise we were thankful to have a place to stay for the night while away for work,3
4020,yes we were on the end of the freemont street experience,3
4021,the restroom in the lobby area is beautiful,3
4022,could easily fit a small family in there there was a mixup with our reservation and they took care of it,3
4023,the first floor which we walked through to get to the rooms that needed the service more than we did,3
4024,we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel if you are to stay in irvine area,3
4025,but for the price which is one of the last rooms they rent out for this reason,3
4026,the hotel is very dated and rather unappealing,3
4027,valet parking is mandatory as there is no a c but we were fine,3
4028,great property we have stayed here multiple times,3
4029,it was great that there were enough beds for a family of five the two bedroom suite was very comfortable,3
4030,this really should be fixed in every room since a good night's rest with the loud fan,3
4031,i understand colorado's marijuana laws make it difficult for hotels in the same price range and see if it gets better,3
4032,the television in room didn't work and tiles were loose in the bathroom,3
4033,the hotel and our room was directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
4034,the employees kids seemed to be running all around the hotel stay could have been better food was cold breakfast and dinner,3
4035,hardly any of the rooms have a refrigerator and microwave in my room,3
4036,valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job with the bathroom and everything was neat and clean,3
4037,i was disappointed the pool and hot tub very nice an clean as well,3
4038,there was no phone in the room to drown out the noise,3
4039,i needed cash to pay a taxi fare and they didn't have much room to move around without bumping into things,3
4040,the hotel rooms themselves need work but they are clean and comfy the rooms are not very clean and the employees were friendly,3
4041,the con is that the water pressure was terrible for showering,3
4042,what i couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and bathroom walls had hair dye on them,3
4043,should find cheaper hotel just to stay one night so it was good to have,3
4044,checked in around 1-2 am so it was a very decent hotel with no frills,3
4045,air conditioner was not working properly i also ask if they had a room as they were having internet problems,3
4046,the breakfast was nice and the room was warm when we checked in kind of small but overall not bad,3
4047,the room wasn't bad but we did not do that,3
4048,the tv was small and the bed was rough well i did not expect much other than comfort and cleanliness,3
4049,the website stated that the room had been wet at one time,3
4050,it was ok nice room for the money that i spent,3
4051,the maintenance man came to the room but did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
4052,they said the beds were very comfortable but the rooms were dark and 70s looking,3
4053,after paying 197 for the room for one night while the issue was being attended to,3
4054,my only complaint was that the pool was closed,3
4055,again i was only in the room the bathroom could have been much worse and the room was as advertised,3
4056,the only negative was are room was by trash area but i think it amplified the noise a bit from the other rooms,3
4057,right next to hon'l's beach and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
4058,the water pressure was poor and the shower had plenty of water and very hot,3
4059,the location was excellent if you are visiting the universal studios parks,3
4060,so we were asked to come and pick it up at the front desk to go through the effort to sell me another night stay,3
4061,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work it had a few roaches though i killed them fast,3
4062,the elevator was not working on the 2nd floor you could still hear everything outside,3
4063,i would definitely not go there again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
4064,the first floor which we walked through to get to the hotel was closed and the detours were not clearly marked,3
4065,the paint could use a fresh coat but overall it was a good place outside needs a little fixing up,3
4066,we asked how to get to the stairway to the room,3
4067,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
4068,chill out with a cocktail at the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be working in customer service,3
4069,bathroom had no shelf in the shower and found a lot more,3
4070,it was surprisingly quiet area must say i was surprised by the lack of items in the room,3
4071,there often is no one in the check-in counter was quite high,3
4072,pools were nice but if you have mobility issues ask for a ground floor room with a sliding glass door,3
4073,desk clerk allowed us to check-in a few hours early,3
4074,i had one issue with my stay which was one day my room was not serviced until nearly 7 pm,3
4075,just needed an overnight after a long day in big sur,3
4076,i didn't feel as if i was ungrateful about getting a room,3
4077,not sure we would stay here again but it wasn't,3
4078,we did complain to management and they agreed to ship it to us,3
4079,granted this hotel is situated in the center of everything we needed to do which was nice,3
4080,i took my wife there for her birthday we stayed one night in mestre before flying out of venice,3
4081,loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room so if you have a pet,3
4082,i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks and give this place a better review than a 3,3
4083,the room in the lobby area was nice,3
4084,i also had to wait a long time if i needed my car as i sat with my yellow ticket in hand,3
4085,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to massachusetts,3
4086,room was small but very nice and clean,3
4087,probably the best thing about the hotel is the classic holiday inn so big or bad surprises,3
4088,hotel was nice rooms were nice the breakfast was great though awesome because we could eat then be on our way,3
4089,clean room great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
4090,disappointed that hair dryer did not work and i had to call to get it,3
4091,had modern furniture and the room was spacious the bathroom clean but basic,3
4092,location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to even swim on our family vacation,3
4093,reported to the front desk and nothing was done until end of day,3
4094,i haven't stayed at a comfort inn in a long time as we didn't want to comp me for checking out early,3
4095,the hotel was fine although it was not as nice as some other la quinta inns in which i've stayed,3
4096,room appeared clean but there was a lot of noise from the highway all night long,3
4097,the staff was very helpful making sure that the room was clean had a nice tv and refrigerator,3
4098,good place to stay if you don't mind the construction in the lobby but the rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
4099,the employees kids seemed to be running all around the hotel stay could have been better,3
4100,room is old and outdated but it was clean and smelled good but the television reception was fuzzy and disrupted,3
4101,while its in the middle of the day,3
4102,we didn't get the room i booked wasn't even available,3
4103,although this room seemed to have a slight odor to it,3
4104,we would stay here again but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
4105,we spent one night in this hotel and that's unfortunate,3
4106,i asked the staff member for a good view and he was able to find a decent rate at this hotel,3
4107,the hotel is will located with a lot of hallway traffic which affected my sleep,3
4108,beds were not very comfortable and the pillows just right,3
4109,however the next morning i mentioned problem upon checkout and the front desk had nothing to offer,3
4110,was a good budget hotel however the rooms need to be cleaned but not while i am sleeping,3
4111,i just couldn't sleep and don't know that i would stop here again though,3
4112,some of the staff was rude and incompetent,3
4113,as the conversation went on she was able to give us a room with a whirlpool bath and i remembered the pool area was sloppy,3
4114,the ones here are hard as a rock as were the other bread items,3
4115,pool was nice but the bed was comfortable,3
4116,we ended up having a good time across the hall thankfully,3
4117,found a couple bugs in the room which was very small,3
4118,also the rooms aren't bad but the hallways get loud in the morning when we went to bed,3
4119,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to get in some cardio in the morning this is not the place for you,3
4120,the overnight stay the room in very dirty and when we told the front desk and he was awoken from his nap because of this,3
4121,it wasn't quite the relaxing weekend i was hoping for when i had to sign she finally told whoever hold on a minute,3
4122,we were outside most of the time so it's not a bad hotel would probably stay,3
4123,holiday inn has become one of the most unique setups i've ever experienced,3
4124,my family stayed the weekend at the sf mandarin oriental,3
4125,that said the rooms are fair at best,3
4126,the eggs didn't look very appetizing and it was hard to move around the parking lot and not any hills,3
4127,the room was clean and comfortable the staff friendly and helpful the bed was comfy,3
4128,no elevator so i had to explain i was a guesst and it was just for a night so yeah,3
4129,the reception lobby area was warm and inviting as well as the rooms,3
4130,was a little loud but really not a bad place when we checked in,3
4131,you can either walk if feeling energetic or it's easy to bring your own bowls plates etc,3
4132,i didn't expect 5 star but i didn't feel comfortable walking on the carpet,3
4133,was nice but jacuzzi tub in room was not swept on far side of 2nd bed from entrance,3
4134,the lobby and dining area for the price could have had a room away from the adjoining highway,3
4135,this review must be 200 characters long but i really have nothing else to say but trip advisor is making me use 200 characters,3
4136,rooms are dated and front desk staff was friendly and helpful,3
4137,a previous poster noted that it was located in a separate building then the main hotel,3
4138,reservations over three months ago ask for a room situated in an upper floor,3
4139,neighborhood seemed a little sketchy when coming in at night but the hotel was a great value for our stay and overall i was pleased,3
4140,the pool was ok but i wouldn't stay there for a long time,3
4141,there was some hair on the floor and it smells bad,3
4142,had to call and wait an hour to get to the stairway to the room,3
4143,i would have thought that the service would have been better if the pool was open,3
4144,i am in this area several times a year for events in indianapolis you can't beat that,3
4145,very clean and nice staff was friendly and check-in and check out was very simple and fast,3
4146,it had an old box tv and everything in the bathroom was the thing making the room accessible,3
4147,i would recommend staying up the street at the best western plus kelly inn during a recent conference at the convention center,3
4148,accommodations were good the room was clean however the clerk juan was very rude,3
4149,it wasn't the greatest hotel stay ever but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
4150,you just have to remember that this used to be a really well kept hotel with consitant quality,3
4151,accommodations were good the room was clean we were able to control the temperature in the room no problem,3
4152,this place is cute but we expected more out of the name than what i got,3
4153,when i got their was told i had to pay more to accommodate my guest,3
4154,the staff were very pleasant and accommodating the public hallways were clean and odor free but run down,3
4155,there were several stands in the room that i almost asked for a room on the first floor,3
4156,i called the 1800 to complain about the amenities as the hotel was booked full,3
4157,i would recommend this hotel if you have a time schedule,3
4158,our room was nice but i would not recommend this hotel to a friend i suppose that depends upon what friend,3
4159,i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone staying in the area,3
4160,the hotel is fine but don't go expecting courteous service,3
4161,broken mirror destroyed room phone but other than that it is a motel we had an exterior entrance,3
4162,however the breakfast staff was very friendly and helpful,3
4163,i think the price was a little high for what it was,3
4164,it was nice that it was located very close to where i needed to be,3
4165,room was clean and quiet however the staff was very eager to help in any way,3
4166,i asked for a change from king to 2 double beds one sofa bed suite room,3
4167,great mexican restaurant right across the parking lot for an hour waiting just for that,3
4168,i had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk and they took care of it right away,3
4169,please someone clean the pool area and hot tub is extremely nice and well kept and the room was ok,3
4170,pros good location in the middle of everything,3
4171,took two days and we had to go to my mobile hot spot,3
4172,my family 2 adults 1 kid stayed for 3 nights on labor day weekend for a family event,3
4173,we would stay here again because of the poor service,3
4174,the room was clean but not nicely decorated,3
4175,doors to our room were quite thin so it was quite hot and stuffy in the hall,3
4176,there was dust on top of the sink in the bathroom was the thing making the room accessible,3
4177,they ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't have an atm in the hotel,3
4178,this hotel had a clean room it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice,3
4179,but the biggest problem was enjoying the sound of the card being slide to unlock the door,3
4180,not enough towels or pillows given this time for a room that was on the counter either,3
4181,the building is getting a little dated and needed some detailed touches,3
4182,i would not come back to the hotel late that night that is,3
4183,my daughter and i recently stayed 2 nights the front desk was very rude about me being a kimpton member,3
4184,only about 15 channels on the tv were cloudy or fuzzy and the breakfast wasn't worth eating,3
4185,there was no phone in the room didn't have a ground-story room available,3
4186,only issue was that i requested a non smoking room both at booking and at check in,3
4187,one which you had to park separately pay for this and then had to walk up 2 flights of stairs to climb,3
4188,in the morning i heard what sounded like a manager going over schedules,3
4189,my routine questions about whether the room we were in had a fireplace and it was very quiet and private,3
4190,our first two nights were great but saturday there was a lot of dirt along the edges of the bathtub,3
4191,this was a one night stay in a small town so we were not expecting much and we were not told at check in,3
4192,the place is clean and the beds were very comfortable great mattresses,3
4193,staff was very friendly though and breakfast was very good with a nice selection,3
4194,the staff is always helpful the rooms are comfortable however the wifi is weak is some areas,3
4195,it is a hostel so obviously it's not the best hotel breakfast i've had juice machine was out of several products,3
4196,also the bed wasn't clean it all,3
4197,the room was ok but for the price it was nice,3
4198,not the greatest hotel in the world but it does have a microwave and fridge,3
4199,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't recommend for anyone with expectations re above,3
4200,not the worst place i've ever stayed great people and the guy at the front desk very polite and helpful,3
4201,for that i would not stay here again,3
4202,actually tried to get into the martin mason,3
4203,for example almost had to convince the front desk to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby,3
4204,also the check-in process took a long time for a shower which i really enjoyed,3
4205,the tv was small and the bed was comfy,3
4206,this motel represents reasonable value for money but the area is nice and courtyard is very nice as well,3
4207,the people on that side had a hard time believing this was same hotel,3
4208,we visited alexandria va over the 4th of july we didn't want to spend a lot for a room,3
4209,we had a c issues at 3:30 am and it woke us up every time it cycled on and off,3
4210,it was easy to find but could use some more counter space,3
4211,overall a great value but the hotel staff were friendly and accomodating,3
4212,it was a place to stay one night,3
4213,they are renovating the new rooms are very nice and the place was clean,3
4214,the staff however were helpful when i asked for something they kind of mean,3
4215,my issues with this place are that there was no safe in the room for security,3
4216,the resort was ok but i wouldn't get it if i was staying in wine country,3
4217,said breakfast was included but they didnt have enough sheets to give us any for,3
4218,i was glad we were only staying 2 nights in the hotel but didn't affect our stay,3
4219,we booked this hotel for a couple of nights,3
4220,pros the room was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful,3
4221,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about this hotel,3
4222,after paying 197 for the room for one night while waiting for a flight from lax,3
4223,i will choose this again next time i'm in alamosa the rooms are clean etc but the bathroom needs an upgrade and the,3
4224,the bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and no cc on its tv,3
4225,it was very uncomfortable for my husband and to have a room on the 2nd floor and it stank when the humidity was high,3
4226,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones,3
4227,asked about local seafood recommendation we were given a coupon to redeem for 1 of 4 offered breakfasts,3
4228,stayed here one night the bed was very comfortable but the rooms were nice spacious,3
4229,we picked this hotel because it has such great potential,3
4230,ok place if you are not one of the first we saw and it a little late in the evening,3
4231,their breakfast is offered in the form of an apple pear and orange,3
4232,not too many places to stay in this hotel in order to be near the freeway,3
4233,overall not too bad though if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills,3
4234,recently updated decor and the bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well,3
4235,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
4236,the hotel was nice enough its been taken over by choice i had wanted to stay at the hampton inn oceanfront north,3
4237,spent a night here on a business trip and i travel often,3
4238,hotel was older but nice staff was very friendly but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
4239,the check in procedure was a little inconvenient to have to trek across the parking lot so that is convenient as well,3
4240,i think they need to get new towels,3
4241,we were attracted to the best western of long beach is in a older section of town directly across from a public transportation train stop,3
4242,the front desk staff were very nice helpful lovely breakfast but we found the breakfast selection to be totally unacceptable,3
4243,i think i will be going back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
4244,i was there for 7 hours and my room was clean but out dated pillows were horrible,3
4245,however when we arrived they were in the shape of squares,3
4246,other than that staff was friendly and helpful especially julio at the front desk just a note saying to wait,3
4247,the guy at the reception wasn't prepeared to help us with any concerns that we had,3
4248,i recommend this hotel if you have a time schedule,3
4249,i would stay here again but if i had more money to enjoy downtown san antonio tx,3
4250,i appreciated the contemporary decor the staff was really great and the room was clean,3
4251,we had a great stay at our hotel and will be going back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
4252,overall the hotel was fine i with the shower specifically the shower head was so low that i hit my eye on it while rinsing,3
4253,we ended up in a room with king size bed,3
4254,the parking area was dirty but the room was clean but in bad condition,3
4255,it was very rude and for that reason i would not recommend to a friend without the caveats i have mentioned,3
4256,very poor layout there is another chair at the opposite end of the hotel as you walk in behind them,3
4257,didn't try the pizzas which make up half of the restaurant and you had to drive around town then i would recommend it,3
4258,the door was paper thin and i could hear the entire conversation of the folks in the next room over all night long,3
4259,the place was quiet but it looked old and the facilities were meh,3
4260,i spent one night in this hotel and hotel point or 10 coupon,3
4261,our view was the roof with the sound of the card being slide to unlock the door the first time we accessed the room,3
4262,the woman at the front desk was extremely helpful kind,3
4263,we wanted to stay in the room for a short time breakfast was very good,3
4264,the gentleman placed us in a room meant for just one,3
4265,no elevator ha to climb 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located,3
4266,we originally planned 2 nights for our family of four the room was small and dated,3
4267,the air conditioner didn't work very well,3
4268,what we did not like was we had two rooms with an adjoining door,3
4269,staff was a bit rushed when i checked in i was given a handicapped room,3
4270,also the water form the shower ran out on the bathroom floor i will not choose this hotel again,3
4271,other than that the stay was good great location need inproventment on room service never had towels the whole time we were there,3
4272,that was the only reason i booked this hotel as part of a business trip,3
4273,a bit pricey for the accommodations in my opinion but again they made an effort and the service at the ip,3
4274,we stayed here on our way to texas we stopped at this hampton inn and found it very nice,3
4275,when checked into the room there was no coffee or wash cloths in the room,3
4276,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but that is usually expected in nyc,3
4277,right next to hon'l's beach and walking distance to many shops restaurants and prudential center,3
4278,big fan i have stayed at howard johnson,3
4279,it was cheap and that was all i needed but i wouldn't stay there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
4280,the location of this hotel is its location,3
4281,when you go to hi you need to understand that it is not a place to hangout or people-watch,3
4282,the hotel was not all that impressive and the area is a little sketchy but surrounding area was quiet enough,3
4283,the food wasn't that good for sleeping,3
4284,and with the king street trolley you can easily get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
4285,this is a non-smoking hotel absolutely reeked of smoke as you walked into and out of the,3
4286,as for the property other than the lobby and outside temperature even with the ac in full force,3
4287,there was nothing spectacular about the room but it was booked for the festival on friday,3
4288,i neglected to note there was no elevator so we had to move rooms from 1st floor to 2nd,3
4289,service was great and the bed was comfortable clean towels each day,3
4290,i was only staying for 2 nights and attempted to cancel the 3rd night,3
4291,however there were plenty of tables available at breakfast time and staff took no notice when complaints were made,3
4292,the room was worn and needs to be freshened up a bit,3
4293,there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room and a kitchenette which we didn't get to stay in the area,3
4294,i will say the hotel staff did not meet my prior experiences with the hampton brand,3
4295,but when arriving our condo's floor was very filthy and did not look too clean breakfast was average but the neighborhood was not safe,3
4296,the price was decent but i wish i'd paid another 20 to stay in a smoke-free property,3
4297,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of a service road no thru traffic,3
4298,the options are limited so we had no programming to see,3
4299,we stayed at this hotel over a couple of days,3
4300,would i stay again probably for the price and the staff was actually pretty friendly,3
4301,they still knocked on my door even though do not disturb sign out prior to my shower,3
4302,came in at the end of the hallway,3
4303,i replied with the fact that the room was clean but the bathroom was not impressive at all,3
4304,we wanted to stay on the top floor,3
4305,it took forever for the room to warm well after midnight,3
4306,for a basic one night stay this place is just fine,3
4307,for the price 140 night per room we felt that the hotel was not all that impressive and the area is a little sketchy,3
4308,hotel is close to uofo about 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk,3
4309,this is the second time i have stayed on fremont street,3
4310,the in room guest showed only one ice machine and it is on 1st floor,3
4311,the hotel has been updated so don't let that keep you from staying here,3
4312,room and furnishings were a bit worn but adequate for the price,3
4313,what we liked about the hotel was it was close to the interstate and cheaper than downtown rooms,3
4314,we stayed here for a night on my way across the country,3
4315,my room was more than adequate and looked like it had a bit of a disappointment,3
4316,overall the room was clean the decor was eclectic the location was great in a nice neighborhood and not to far from the beach,3
4317,my family of four stayed in a double room with a shared bathroom,3
4318,the room was nice and comfortable but i found that the staff was extremely friendly and the rooms were decent,3
4319,the hotel is very stylish and is very conveniently located just off the interstate,3
4320,the woman at the front desk was very unfriendly and not at all helpful,3
4321,staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the room price so i didn't have to pack these,3
4322,when we got to our room the odor was gone,3
4323,there were semi's that looked like they had been washed and dried and were small squares,3
4324,i was in town for a dog show,3
4325,even though the second room appeared to be clean was just dingy and worn,3
4326,the staff was great and did their job but there was no signal in our room,3
4327,loved the garden and it was very convenient to the dmacc campus,3
4328,but it was very small for the size of the room and ensuring the remainder of my stay was comfortable,3
4329,the biggest surprise was when we were hit with a very pungent odor,3
4330,but he bed was comfy and we got a voucher for the mcdonald's for breakfast,3
4331,there was no hair dryer and when we went to go sightseeing the door would not close unless i pushed it shut 140,3
4332,was there on a friday and saturday night and few cars in the parking lot pulling in late they came out to check on us,3
4333,then when we got there we had to return to desk for new electronic key,3
4334,we have stayed at this hotel for one night as we were passing through,3
4335,got there 1 hour after check in they was sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra,3
4336,the rooms were clean and serviceable and the bed was rough well i did not expect much other than comfort and cleanliness,3
4337,yes there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it to make sure no one could get in,3
4338,but when you asked for it they didn't have our reservation from when i booked 9 line at hotels,3
4339,after they put us in a different class room and had to smell smoke all night not happy,3
4340,staff was extremely friendly and helpful staff,3
4341,i wasn't informed until check in that it was just what we needed,3
4342,then of course the elevator breaks down and the front desk clerk pam was very friendly and courteous,3
4343,we asked for a transfer to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
4344,rooms are comfortable staff at reception were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was wonderful with very nice employees taking care the that area,3
4345,little old lady at the front desk very polite and helpful,3
4346,there was no one to help you with any need you have,3
4347,we would stay again if travelling through the area by train,3
4348,should find cheaper hotel just to stay one night so it was all about location,3
4349,service is excellent rooms are clean and seem newly renovated,3
4350,but that's not an issue if you have a card you get a discount,3
4351,the other hotels in the area are horrible,3
4352,i think i will be going back to the hotel late that night that is,3
4353,there is a nook in the room which i find criminal,3
4354,staff was very nice however we booked a room with one bed and one room with two,3
4355,didn't smell it in the hall but as soon as i sat on the mattress it depressed 3-4 inches,3
4356,the breakfast restaurant commanded beautiful views of the ocean and sunset,3
4357,the motel is close to the highway and very convenient,3
4358,the room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door left the tv on all night,3
4359,wasn't expecting much for breakfast but it was pretty much what i expected for the price,3
4360,additionally there were hardly any outlets in the room and throughout the hotel,3
4361,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
4362,the hotel is in the process of renovating the lobby area,3
4363,after parking and checking out the room i had to move our car so someone else could park next to us,3
4364,i enjoyed my the service at the restaurant was not good and the service was worse,3
4365,overall the hotel was clean and the staff is very helpful and friendly,3
4366,affordable for the price but this last stay was very stressful,3
4367,breakfast was nice fruit make your own waffles was great and the rooms were very nice newly renovated but not clean,3
4368,but otherwise it was clean and i felt safe and the staff was quiet,3
4369,when we went up to our room we had to escorted and wait for someone to bring ice up to us,3
4370,we were given a room on the second day we stayed two nights,3
4371,didn't not supply extra pillows and blankets in the closet,3
4372,this was my first stay at this motel and for one night it's ok no people when you go late night people nice,3
4373,a nightmare to say the least and some of the side walks,3
4374,i have stayed 2 other times at this hotel and the experience is the same,3
4375,you just don't know what you are going to pay dearly and wait a long time,3
4376,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but we did let the maid know,3
4377,everything was clean and the staff was actually pretty friendly,3
4378,he eventually clarified that since i had booked a room suite with 2 double beds,3
4379,the hotel staff was very nice and went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable,3
4380,the room was in the detached block and i believe the owner's wife,3
4381,the whole place could use a good overhaul,3
4382,however once we got back to the hotel from the airport,3
4383,i know what to expect on this level of hotel but it was the same everyday a waffle mini muffins and drink,3
4384,the first non-smoking room but it wreaked of smoke the minute i opened the door very clean and comfortable,3
4385,average room for an average price just a stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
4386,it is pet friendly which is the reason i hesitate to try new places,3
4387,the room was clean but there was nothing stocked in it,3
4388,they had coffee out but i didn't care for those but otherwise it was fine,3
4389,no elevator so 2nd floor wasn't so great i got a standard room,3
4390,hotel was nice rooms were nice the breakfast was great and the reason i checked backed in this hotel,3
4391,the front of the hotel but did not,3
4392,it isn't the easiest getting in to and out of due to its location and that's what we get,3
4393,she put me on the third floor didn't work,3
4394,our toilet leaked so there was a lot of noise,3
4395,the motel is further from the highway so it wasn't hard to find,3
4396,all inclusive is a scam as they don't have a data plan and need to check a flight,3
4397,were not happy about the parking our only option was responded to as if i was given the bottom of the bag,3
4398,i am glad i didn't had to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10,3
4399,the hotel was right off the freeway so it's easy to bring your own bowls plates etc,3
4400,however it was not too bad of a mattress it did the trick and was fairly close to a nice shopping dining district,3
4401,the lakeside park right across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses,3
4402,we stayed for two nights and they did not refill much from day to day,3
4403,great staff lots of traffic in out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
4404,the rate for the room was very clean and nice rooms,3
4405,the table in the room was dirty and the towels turned black when i wet them,3
4406,i knew this wasn't going to work for us,3
4407,it was terribly difficult to maintain a decent temperature and i had to duck to wash my hair,3
4408,however it is comparatively inexpensive to other newer hotels in the immediate 60 mile radius area,3
4409,young woman at front desk when i checked in the desk clerk was very friendly at americinn but the pool was a nightmare,3
4410,however i was there for 7 hours and my room was quiet and comfortable,3
4411,the rooms were clean and that's what more important for me and my sheltie shelby,3
4412,check in and out was a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little,3
4413,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a plunger we were surprised that nobody offered assistance,3
4414,we stayed at this hotel as it was close to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
4415,the room was tiny but it was clean and generally fine,3
4416,clean hotel friendly staff but the rooms are really nice the staff is very nice,3
4417,pwe felt that it was very clean and comfortable,3
4418,we just needed a clean quiet room and we got that,3
4419,the hotel price was good but hotel needs some cosmetic work,3
4420,check in was fast and friendly as well,3
4421,overall the hotel was nice but our room was shabby and the carpet was torn in places,3
4422,what stands out to me about the drury inn is the bathroom in the corner had a lot of air freshener,3
4423,it was noisy and difficult to adjust temp,3
4424,the staff were all very friendly and helpful and the breakfast wasn't worth eating,3
4425,valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job with the bathroom and everything was neat and clean,3
4426,though the hotel was full the night we stayed on a lower floor and there was a strong odor of cat urine,3
4427,didn't arrive until 10:30 pm front desk clerk was rico and he was awesome,3
4428,i picked this hotel as it was close to where i needed to be,3
4429,on a trip through md i was able to put it back on,3
4430,we love the u district but the bed was not what we were excpecting,3
4431,it was ok my girls wanted to jump in the pool but another guest had explained to me that the hotel was okay to me,3
4432,it was close it had a microwave and refrigerator to make guests more comfortable,3
4433,the recliner and table in front of the grand canal and within walking distance of key shopping dining and beach areas,3
4434,this hotel is just what you should expect for the price you are paying i would say this was absolutely reasonable,3
4435,the reservation process for this hotel was excellent for our needs,3
4436,the walk to the stadium an easy safe walk from the hotel and you could always order in,3
4437,it was really hot in the room when i walked in,3
4438,quite frankly i expected more for a room that was within the complex,3
4439,we are recovering from back issues after spending the weekend at this hotel as we do every year,3
4440,hotel has a no smoking policy as soon as we got into the second room it smelled like cheap cologne,3
4441,i had to go in sideways into the bathroom and found an extremely long piece of hair in the pool,3
4442,got there and was told they didn't have enough people on staff,3
4443,bed was a little high for what it was 180 night this was one of the worst ever,3
4444,i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
4445,there was hair in the bathtub and all over the floor still,3
4446,i booked ahead as the weekend was a big big disappointment,3
4447,this time we got a 1-br unit and it was small but adequate and clean as was the en-suite bathroom,3
4448,all in all the room was much cheaper than other hotels in the area will validate comp parking for hotel guest,3
4449,i may try it again next time i am in the area,3
4450,for a last minute booking and on a friday night with the option to pay or leave,3
4451,great trip help at the hotel was great for the price,3
4452,people were smoking in the dining room and we wanted to watch the game while we had dinner and some drinks,3
4453,the worst part i was on a business trip and i travel often,3
4454,cobwebs could be seen in the car outside,3
4455,the location is okay great if you want to use it you need to leave the room for several hours,3
4456,i enjoyed the price rates i had more money it would not be a fun experience,3
4457,i had to stand with my 2 kids at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do,3
4458,i drove from montreal to woodbury for shopping and it was a big plus that there was a great deal of conflicting opinions,3
4459,there was no available plug for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink,3
4460,rooms could us a little work but overall not bad breakfast was good but staff allowed eggs and sausage to run out with very light,3
4461,for both visits my reservation was for a room with 2 double full sized beds,3
4462,it is a little hidden from the view of the river in your room,3
4463,we later found out they were short staffed,3
4464,unfortunately king bed was hard and the pillows had needed to be changed out also,3
4465,basic place good for a place to sleep overnight and the bed was comfortable the room was clean,3
4466,the downside is that you are a short walk to the dunes not crowded at all,3
4467,� � � excellent accomodations parking breakfast pool nice staff and very close to the winery we went too as well as occ,3
4468,many of the light fixtures in the room didn't have a double left,3
4469,great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling,3
4470,we were on the west side and it was noisy and the breakfast ran out and was not refiled,3
4471,i am only 5'3 and i had to sit up for an hour in the middle of the night after several hang ups,3
4472,the bedding was dirty we had to go back down very inconvenient when your tired from traveling,3
4473,the rooms while clean were very plain and simple i dont think you can beat this place,3
4474,great for the price i paid it would have been a better stay if our room had been clean,3
4475,we had to walk to another hotel to see what they had,3
4476,i am from singapore so i am not concerned about it,3
4477,the hotel was okay for short stays close to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult,3
4478,i shopped for a cheap room and that is what is nice about it,3
4479,i knew there was construction but the price was fair for that time of the year with everyone moving out,3
4480,motel is clean clerks are helpful and friendly next time i'll book somewhere with working aircon and no noise,3
4481,the room is plain but very clean with a modern decor and it had all of the essentials and they all worked find,3
4482,the hotel was according to the manager recently remodeled but it must have been from the rain the night before and set out for sometime,3
4483,i was in town for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel,3
4484,i have stayed at this hotel due to its proximity to that,3
4485,nonetheless it was very convenient for one night on a road trip and didn't want to give because she said the dog was big,3
4486,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to pay a tax on the pet fee,3
4487,i had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk and explained that their were no knobs to turn,3
4488,i knew there was construction but the price was fair for that time of the year with everyone moving out,3
4489,in addition there is room for a chair in the room and was moved at 3 am was moved to another room,3
4490,i was pleasantly surprised about how nice the room was good but noise of room next door and people kept us up all night,3
4491,we needed an extra blanket and the lady in the room was terribly loud,3
4492,we went to breakfast at 7 am the same 2 pieces of fruit in trays in a very tiny lobby area,3
4493,the air conditioner in our room did not smell of smoke,3
4494,decor was nice but the stove partly worked couch is broken and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
4495,lots of kids taking advantage of the pool if you want to be able to make one trip up the stairs,3
4496,lots of teens hanging around in the parking lot it's a steep incline and there wasn't even toast,3
4497,i explained everything when we checked in and there was no smell,3
4498,i've stayed at the turf hotel 4 times twice in a room with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
4499,went on a mini getaway with my husband and 3 little ones and we had plenty of space,3
4500,clean room great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
4501,we booked this hotel as part of a wedding room block in may 2015,3
4502,u can't ask to be at a higher overall level,3
4503,the carpets are in need of a bit of love,3
4504,but i called the front desk and the check in process was efficient and friendly,3
4505,the breakfast was certainly not the best hotel but the staff is exelente and probebly the best place to stay in the jr,3
4506,my pillowcases were yellow and there was a fabulous patisserie where you can get decent coffee at whole foods or starbucks,3
4507,i've stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
4508,the hotel manager came to the room but did not have any headboards or pictures over the beds,3
4509,building looks dated we had room right by the pool area and it was rusted making retrieving water from there undesirable,3
4510,the staff were really nice and the water felt amazing,3
4511,the bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and the parking lot and supplies in the hallway,3
4512,staff are very nice and the place was clean and i do have to sya this was fixed prior to my departure,3
4513,we did not complain to the front desk and he and everyone there did it with a smile,3
4514,the ac unit is right next to the lion king show,3
4515,just needed to stay the night near the port then i would recommend this hotel for short stays,3
4516,the location was not easy to get the complimentary breakfast,3
4517,it was clean quiet a good value and really close to disneyland,3
4518,for a last minute booking and on a friday night lucky for us there was a perkins across the street,3
4519,we changed rooms but still the beds are comfortable and the pool set up is fantastic for both adults and children,3
4520,the maid was really nice and i went to my room it was marked non-smoking,3
4521,rooms were clean and comfortable but we could hear the people walking upstairs,3
4522,the lighting in the room was at least 10 years old and did not have any knobs for the ac,3
4523,they had some kind of party going on at the end of the halls where we were put,3
4524,room was nice and comfortable but i found that the wifi is rubbish,3
4525,the condo resort is in a great location and we have stayed here many times over the years,3
4526,the hotel itself was quiet and the room was immaculately clean,3
4527,when i first went to check in i could hear voices of people in the lobby drinking beer with additional beer's in coolers around,3
4528,i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone staying in the area,3
4529,the stay included a voucher for mcdonald's which is right next door and has the best hawaiian food around,3
4530,the room was small and a bit worn but adequate for the price,3
4531,we were not that happy at this hampton inn and found it very nice,3
4532,its not fancy but for the most part clean however just very old reminded me more of a small older condo,3
4533,the only downfall is things close early around rockafellar center so you have to go to the 3rd floor it,3
4534,i'd say my stay was so-so but coffee was good,3
4535,the room was nice and there was a bunch of sand under the pillows on the sofa,3
4536,the evening person gave me towels to put on the cream cheese as not everybody likes only sweet in the morning,3
4537,the staff is very friendly and the room was hot humid and musty,3
4538,the restaurant and the food was above average,3
4539,the bathrooms are small and the place could use a remodel it seemed a bit outdated,3
4540,if i wasn't traveling by myself maybe i wouldn't have stayed there if i knew that,3
4541,it was awesome that i could get to the airport the next morning,3
4542,the sheets are very thin and you can easily hear conversations in the next room or in the hallways,3
4543,i'm very glad i wasn't there high season as the hotel is under significant renovation in rooms and the lobby,3
4544,not bad for the price but no extras,3
4545,nice updates but very thin walls could hear conversation of people in the room next door if it was family,3
4546,we ended up having four rooms and had the same problem and they froze up there,3
4547,it looks like they tried to update the tub area but didn't do a very good job on changing out an old,3
4548,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke and outdated color scheme,3
4549,we sat around and waited until 11 when all we wanted to do and see and it was mostly quiet and comfortable,3
4550,hotel does not seem to be in the u district this location is fantastic,3
4551,rooms are very clean and surprisingly they really do look like the pictures on the website looked a lot better than in person,3
4552,the head of the bed wasn't so hard and the pillows tiny,3
4553,a couple of brown spots on the ceiling from what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
4554,the ceiling looked as though it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was actually a shower room with a toilet which was odd,3
4555,easy to find and our room was clean except for the bed,3
4556,the hotel is in a great location the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
4557,had a pet and felt like i was put in a room that had very good reception,3
4558,was there on a friday and saturday night and few cars in the parking lot adjacent to the access door and the smoke filtered in,3
4559,i don't really recommend to friends pool is very small good for little kids but not tweens or teens,3
4560,we stayed her because we had an early flight next day the location is great walking distance to lots of great restaurants bars and sights,3
4561,most personnel were very friendly and helpful at check in,3
4562,the problem was it was rite next to the elevator and the noise was continual,3
4563,i rarely stayed in the room so i didn't need but other than that all was good,3
4564,the only reason i would stay here again but it wasn't a huge issue,3
4565,the a c didn't work and the bathroom needed a little msintenance tiles were missing along the shower wall,3
4566,when i mentioned that it is not a great hotel,3
4567,it was on a hill and has a great view of the beach and the ocean,3
4568,beds were fine and it was just what we needed,3
4569,the hallway on the 6th floor i believe it was worst of all the suites they had,3
4570,if noise bothers you request a room off of the first floor if you don't mind it being a little dated,3
4571,the room was cheap and clean but my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
4572,the bed wasn't so hard and the pillows had needed to be changed out also,3
4573,the room was cheap which was good but i've had better food at low end hotels,3
4574,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of a service road no thru traffic,3
4575,no hot water there was a smell of smoke in the room,3
4576,the room was nice and big very clean but the tv was between the sitting area and the sleeping area,3
4577,the air conditioner in our room did not face the picnic party area,3
4578,no free wifi you have to pay for the meter anyway,3
4579,room was clean and the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a little difficult to use,3
4580,the clerk was great and friendly during check-in times partially with an unimpressive bar,3
4581,didn't sleep at all due to the noise of people coming and going at all hours,3
4582,the hotel is far away from the main city but we were able to throw,3
4583,when i arrived and went to my room it was a good deal and worked for what i needed,3
4584,she was very nice but the air conditioner had to run,3
4585,very close to the hotel is not in,3
4586,in the morning we had to wait for the long line,3
4587,we were traveling i-35 and needed a place to stay passing through it works,3
4588,what i liked about the hotel was it was close to the plant i was working at,3
4589,valet is at the other end by entrance,3
4590,the room was fine and the staff was friendly and accommodating,3
4591,and the price was great and the room is quite comforting,3
4592,the young lady at the front desk when i checked in,3
4593,rooms and reception are ok value for money but the area is nice and staff to,3
4594,we had a non-smoking queen bed room on the top floor just to avoid any noise disturbances,3
4595,hotel is nice and clean but very small,3
4596,the rooms were clean and that's what i was most concerned about,3
4597,i left four shirts hanging in the room when i walked in i noticed an unpleasant odor,3
4598,also little things like the paper towels and toilet paper are like sandpaper,3
4599,overall i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks and give this place a shot,3
4600,this is a very old hotel but it was a last minute decision to go,3
4601,unfortunately i have to say that the bed was pretty comfy,3
4602,the hotel was clean enough but i would recommend a room not facing the street side it was noisy at times,3
4603,room had a mini fridge and microwave in the room,3
4604,i stayed in a superior room with a king bed fridge and microwave for 70,3
4605,beware if you want to be able to make one trip up the stairs,3
4606,pros bedroom and bathroom were clean and warm,3
4607,stayed here while doing some lake fishing for a few nights as our mini honeymoon getaway to atlantic city,3
4608,the staff was friendly and helpful and the location was good for what i needed,3
4609,after complaining they moved us to another room,3
4610,also there was no refrigerator in my room and i could not get the tub to drain,3
4611,the pool was dirty and not cared for,3
4612,we had to park across the street in their overflow parking lot which was frequented by bums who called it home,3
4613,we have stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past so was surprised by the lack of items in the room,3
4614,would not recommend for solo females just because of the service im giving it a 3,3
4615,however i stood at the front desk take all the questions,3
4616,room was nice for the price just because of the number of male construction workers,3
4617,got there and was told they didn't have the 150 on me i would have not been able to stay in the same place,3
4618,the first problem was that as soon as we got into the room and moved all of my daughters items around,3
4619,this is an older hotel that could use some refreshing its getting kind of tired and run down,3
4620,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is now smoke free,3
4621,we stayed at this hotel due to its proximity to that,3
4622,unfortunately no one told us that the hotel was under construction i wish they would have put the heat on before we got there,3
4623,but flat screen tv in the room in fact the bed was comfortable the place was clean,3
4624,vanity and shower had lots of hot water,3
4625,i would definitely stay here again if visiting kauai,3
4626,what i couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and bathroom walls had hair dye on them,3
4627,we've told everyone we stayed at the hotel for a business trip,3
4628,my reserved room was not ready when we arrived at 11 am we requested an early check in which was great,3
4629,bed was hard pillows were small and not very fluffy,3
4630,the only thing that was a problem was that there was no coffee maker fridge or micro in the room,3
4631,for people who want to work out the hotel has a cool vibe and the price is right,3
4632,upon entering the casino area to check in we were hit with the 130 cleaning fee for our 3 day stay,3
4633,toilet was clogged when we checked in the desk clerk was very friendly and helpful,3
4634,it was a fair hotel for an overnight stay or two as we did,3
4635,the elevator still doesn't work and they could not fix it,3
4636,they draft your card as soon as you opened the door to the outside 20 degrees for a smoke break,3
4637,rooms are comfortable staff at reception were friendly and helpful,3
4638,we left the room in the morning and the lovely waitress working it,3
4639,all can say is i do not know if any rooms do have one,3
4640,the room had a fridge and microwave was convenient,3
4641,poor internet service and the different channels on the tv and nothing for kids to watch,3
4642,no microwave refrigerator in the room would have been fine except,3
4643,i asked for a change from king to 2 double beds one sofa bed suite room,3
4644,this is a very old hotel with a fresh coat of paint it serves it purpose but i thought should be cheaper,3
4645,when we arrived there were several people outside in the parking lot adjacent to the access door and the smoke filtered in,3
4646,my room was on the main floor and was told that they were having a party in the basement and my room on the first,3
4647,the hot tub was decent and the people were helpful,3
4648,the room itself was nice but one of the least expensive for the area,3
4649,the evening person gave me towels to put on the front and sent maintenance,3
4650,nothing fancy but it was comfortable and the climate control worked well,3
4651,booked room here due to most other rooms in the area were much pricier than this one,3
4652,my husband and i stayed here for our trip to hershey park,3
4653,dodge the tunnels and go outside to get there so even though it was supposed to open,3
4654,i've stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
4655,there is a lot of people not enough room too crowded had to wait to place our order while our waiter bypassed us several times,3
4656,the room i was in a frat house,3
4657,older hotel bathroom was very run down in need of overhaul,3
4658,room was clean and neat but there was a lot a late night parting going on in hotel but it was the same price,3
4659,it states they have an indoor pool and hot tub was available,3
4660,we have not stayed at a red roof in a long time as we didn't want to be out walking after dark,3
4661,we stayed in a family suite like a little apt which was located in a bad part of town just a little noise from traffic,3
4662,the room was adequate and about what you would expect for the price you pay,3
4663,when we arrived there were several people outside in the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler,3
4664,however there were plenty of tables available at breakfast time and staff took no notice when complaints were made,3
4665,we got a delux suite for same price as suite but come to find out they never sent me a taxi,3
4666,the hotel was clean and very comfortable,3
4667,but it was 3 in the morning when people were leaving,3
4668,but when arriving our condo's floor was very filthy and did not look too clean breakfast was average but the neighborhood was not safe,3
4669,i read the reviews on trip advisor and after speaking with the front desk attendant was having trouble with the computer,3
4670,the adult pool was a lot better than in person,3
4671,all-in-all the stay was ok but we wouldn't return,3
4672,it was clean and there was no pool as advertised,3
4673,price was good but the room was clean and the people at the front desk was very helpful,3
4674,as others have mentioned the neighborhood is rather rundown so we didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of year,3
4675,no frills hotel that met our needs for the few days we needed,3
4676,the breakfast was okay but we had a hillview room that looked directly onto the parking lot and supplies in the hallway,3
4677,the hotel staff was very helpful and friendly while resolving our dilemma,3
4678,i was only there for a place to sleep,3
4679,this was an okay hotel but for a marriott i was a little worried what we would find,3
4680,someone found my credit card and i had a good experience but not this time,3
4681,the one night we stayed there and went to the family dollar store to pick up some toilitries,3
4682,being the biggest location in town for a work event at ung,3
4683,told it was no pet floor but there was a lot of music noise,3
4684,i think this place is especially great for business lunches when you're looking for is view and quiet this is your place,3
4685,just a 2 minute walk the mexican food at the hotel is great and as advertised is right on the beach literally steps away,3
4686,no wi-fi and when i went to front desk no one answered,3
4687,it took me 2 hours to air out the room before costomers are placed in them,3
4688,the room was nice but the pool was not available because of maintenance,3
4689,the price was great and the room was comfortable and very adequate,3
4690,the second dining room was downstairs and we never used it but it was due to this hotel still having smoking rooms,3
4691,i stayed here because it was one of the worst rooms they could,3
4692,delightful service at desk but a funny cooking smell as i went to my new room found they had given me another double,3
4693,all in all it was a great place to stay for one night so i could get a replacement phone,3
4694,got there and was told they didn't have any protein provided which is kind of surprise and disappointed e,3
4695,hotel was close to the metro station is a huge plus,3
4696,checkout was good and i would stay at this hotel again,3
4697,a couple of brown spots on the ceiling from what i would expect the base room type to look like,3
4698,i certainly don't have any more rooms,3
4699,a quick one night stay this hotel was ok but needs more parking,3
4700,the room was clean and everything worked as it should,3
4701,clean rooms although you can tell that it has been renovated,3
4702,the personnel were very nice but they could really use a microwave and refrigerator which was handy,3
4703,this is the first hotel we have stayed at this hotel at least 7 times over the past several years,3
4704,that smell seeps into all areas of the hotel and there is a microwave and a refrigerator with a freezer,3
4705,this hotel has potential but as is i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone,3
4706,hotel was clean but in need of a bit of love,3
4707,got there and was told they didn't have a ground-story room available,3
4708,bed was comfy and the climate in the room was clean and well stocked,3
4709,additionally the walls are paper thin and i could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall,3
4710,pluses close to lackland afb 7 mi 10-15 min and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip,3
4711,not an attractive building and not an attractive location but rooms are large and it was quiet at night but some daytime remodeling noise,3
4712,our only complaint is that it was noisy,3
4713,it's an older hotel what can i say budget price is a budget stay,3
4714,it was very crowded and not well lit i didn't feel the safest,3
4715,once in our room there was a slight smell but nothing to complain about,3
4716,the inn is not a budget motel by comparison to others in the area due to a prior positive experience,3
4717,hotel was a good choice for us because it was close to where i needed to be,3
4718,we were tired from traveling all day and needed a pet friendly option and this modest motel filled the bill,3
4719,in the morning when it was close to the interstate and cheaper than downtown rooms,3
4720,no elevator so i had to explain i was a guesst and it was just for a night or two,3
4721,nice convienant hotel very roomy and comfortable nice place for a relaxing evening out with friends,3
4722,my husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the day we were checking out,3
4723,overall we would have rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the daily breakfasts,3
4724,location was superb very easy to walk for anything you need,3
4725,the mattress is very firm and even though i asked for a double bed and i had 2 single beds,3
4726,we think that when the facility completes the renovation project it will be a very nice hotel go here otherwise skip it,3
4727,good comparison is that for less money per night i had a two day stay while visiting family and friends in my home town,3
4728,we were not happy with the location of the hotel is smash burger and their olive oil and basil french fries,3
4729,we called expedia and they were able to get us additional towels as there was only one water glass and one coffee cup,3
4730,the king size bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for our needs and the price,3
4731,they lady that checked me in was very nice and helpful,3
4732,clean convenient and close to the exit,3
4733,they had some kind of party going on at the end of the world but also not what you expect from a holiday inn,3
4734,staff very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was nothing to talk about,3
4735,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to help this person out at all,3
4736,very nice hotel friendly wine hour daily coffee in the lobby had disappeared before i arrived at 7 pm breakfast a joke,3
4737,the room was ok but the beds were very comfortable,3
4738,the train close to this hotel is either indifferent or incompetent,3
4739,there was construction going on in front of the grand canal and within walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
4740,the room was cheap which was good but i wish we would have looked more at the b w at the convention center,3
4741,some of the rooms were like this but it was a nice but aging hotel,3
4742,the lobby was quite small and cramped for the price we paid it was worth it,3
4743,if you like to sleep till late my suggestion is to ask for one of the rooms and the food,3
4744,this visit i found a cockroach in one of the elevators was broken so we had to change rooms,3
4745,the property is on a steep hill so unless one is in good shape,3
4746,good deal breakfast was not great but we were tired and had to get back into the room,3
4747,check in was straightforward and we had a 1st floor room near the pool,3
4748,cracker barrel restaurant right across the street from boardwalk bowl,3
4749,one chair was on the other side of the bed had the socket broken,3
4750,for the price it was a great place to stay,3
4751,large room with a whirlpool bath and i remembered the pool area was very small and strangely carpeted in red with no hot tub,3
4752,being on the ground floor nice spacious and clean the problems with the hotel are not the rooms,3
4753,she got on her computer and found a room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape,3
4754,we did not have a reservation but they were able to get an extended stay until 6:00pm for 25,3
4755,be sure to check directly with the hotel were not recognised,3
4756,here's a plus out the window from the room i was staying in but i managed to hobble around there,3
4757,the room was clean and comfortable but we could hear all the conversations music and tv thru the door cracks,3
4758,we were outside most of the time we were there,3
4759,it is situated in the center of the santana row,3
4760,only have us new towels once and that was the reason we choose the hotel,3
4761,i didn't want to travel on a holiday and had to be found and asked to replenish items,3
4762,morning staff was very friendly at check-in was a snob,3
4763,but on our stays it was clean and the shower was difficult to maintain,3
4764,my wife started complaining about her allergies from the smell in the room and there was no one at the front desk,3
4765,the hotel is supposed to be new but it is not one i would recommend for most people,3
4766,the bed sheets didn't look like it had been cleaned in quite a while,3
4767,the rooms while clean were very plain and simple i dont think you can beat this place,3
4768,my family and i had to ask for biscuits,3
4769,overall it was serviceable for our needs and was clean and comfortable,3
4770,rooms and reception are ok value for money but the area is not particularly attractive,3
4771,the pros nice view of the river in your room,3
4772,over all the hotel is a walking distance from the cemetery and french quarters,3
4773,when we arrived there was noone at the front desk was extremely friendly helpful and courtliest high marks,3
4774,will stay here again since we did not get an early start to our day,3
4775,the hotel is fine but in need of some detail cleaning,3
4776,we needed an extra blanket and the lady in the room was at least 10 years old and did not have any really bad experiences,3
4777,stayed a night with my kiddo it was a good choice since it was right near the downtown of dalonegha,3
4778,have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its close proximity to where i was meeting family members,3
4779,we have never had a problem with the thermostat in our room,3
4780,the neighborhood was great and the room was clean and nicely furnished,3
4781,we were able to find the free van to the hotel which was alright overall but nothing special,3
4782,great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling,3
4783,there was a microwave in the room which was handy,3
4784,we go there because of the pool for my youngest however we did not have any ac or heat so that sucked,3
4785,the exit door near our room had a horrible chemical smell,3
4786,slept well and enjoyed facilities in the room and told her the beds had not been made either,3
4787,the pool was down the hall but the door was propped open when i went to check out no one was in the lower class,3
4788,i had a car situation and there was a smell of smoke from people standing outside in the parking lot,3
4789,but overall a good stay but was a little disconcerted when i went to my room it was marked non-smoking,3
4790,it is a big house that needs work but we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,3
4791,i have stayed here multiple times over the past 20 years,3
4792,many different elevators to get to our next destination and they didn't even ask if that would be a great hotel to stay in,3
4793,the staff for the most part it does the job for a good price for one night for a softball tournament,3
4794,this place was easy to find but could use some more counter space,3
4795,room primarily just used to sleep and prepare to go back to the counter and that's only after i hollered at someone cleaning,3
4796,the beds in our room and it was an adjoining room where i could hear the ice machine and everything being said in the hallway,3
4797,room was clean and the room smelled like stale smoke,3
4798,they lady that checked me in was very nice and brought batteries on request,3
4799,recommend you spend the money for a night i didn't need but other than that all was nice,3
4800,but for the price and breakfast was a scramble but the free breakfast was pretty minimal but adequate,3
4801,there was very little parking and there was no noise from the highway all night long,3
4802,our toilet leaked so there was a lot of dirt along the edges of the door,3
4803,my room ac didn't work very good,3
4804,we were tired and it was a comfortable and pleasant stay,3
4805,i thought the room was a little disconcerting we had to walk to another hotel to see what they had,3
4806,disappointed that there was no fridge in the room which was a non smoking room both at booking and at check in,3
4807,ask for a room with a balcony which we stayed in was extremely hot the ac was barely working,3
4808,not good if you have more than one machine in a 4 story hotel,3
4809,i was moved upstairs to a room that was within the complex,3
4810,the shower was moldy the toilet seat was up and the water in the area has a brown tint,3
4811,we were tired and it was a good but not great hotel experience,3
4812,they were doing construction remodeling when we went therefore it wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet,3
4813,when we don't want to eat or walk outside of the hotel for just that occasion,3
4814,however there was a cleanliness problem when we got there we were told that the orange juice was done for the day,3
4815,way too expensive for being the save a lot of money since it was just me and wasn't for a vacation,3
4816,this is the second time i have stayed here several times,3
4817,one of the lamps next to the bed and was very loud,3
4818,a bit pricey for an older hotel the room was quite loud we had to keep shoes on or washing kids feet,3
4819,there is a gas station right across the street is westfield valley fair which is a big shopping mall,3
4820,nice hotel and service but the price was the best part,3
4821,the hot water stays hot for a long time while we were checking in,3
4822,dear valued guest thank you for taking the time to write a review and for choosing to stay with us,3
4823,another down side about this hotel is the reason i chose laquinta inns and suites,3
4824,everything was perfect with the exception of the first day,3
4825,staff was polite and accommodating being i was traveling with a very budget conscious group for a conference in town,3
4826,i had to take care of the hotel,3
4827,close to the airport and the cruise terminal,3
4828,you could hear traffic and people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1,3
4829,the hotel is fine but the beds are too small the water in the bribe was either really hot or really cold,3
4830,don't come here expecting a fantastic experience but it's a bit of a musty smell,3
4831,i said they accepted people but they are not allowed to enter the ocean because of the dangerous rip currents,3
4832,the blankets were really thin so i recommend asking for a room on the 2nd floor etc,3
4833,was pretty reluctant to bring out the cart and stood there till i filled out the cart,3
4834,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
4835,the front desk clerk pam was very friendly and the hotel as a whole was clean,3
4836,carpets need to be replaced in the hotel and they were mostly positive,3
4837,was great to stay here but i did not get anything remotely resembling breakfast,3
4838,no free wifi you have to pay for transportation if you are on a budget this is as good place to stay,3
4839,we were traveling i-35 and needed a place to sleep so it served the purpose,3
4840,had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of you in a polite way,3
4841,the hotel itself was nice it is right off the highway not too loud in the mornings,3
4842,hotel was ok but there was no good night here,3
4843,we stayed one night so if u just looking for one night you would think some sort of breakfast option,3
4844,trivago was sporting a room with a fireplace and jacuzzi,3
4845,conditions of hotel are a bit run down not the cleanest,3
4846,the lighting in the room was very spacious,3
4847,we won't stay again unless i had my dog,3
4848,there was not a micro fridge or microwave in the room as nowadays most places do,3
4849,it was cold at night due to traveling we would not have booked it i would have gone somewhere else,3
4850,you could hear traffic and people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1,3
4851,rooms on first floor near pool had a bad odor coming from the plumbing,3
4852,kids had a blast shower was hot had a good time but the elevators were always such a long wait,3
4853,the hotel prides itself on water conservation but there was an old apple core in the cup with the coffee condiments,3
4854,good accommodation and clean the only issue i had with the property regarded their policy on security deposits,3
4855,i would use this hotel again if i am able to get a milk even in the evening,3
4856,the downside for us was the size of our room which wasn't the case for others,3
4857,not value for money and not what you would expected from a nice hotel,3
4858,fridge and microwave in the room and there was no pool very little space when you have kids,3
4859,booked a 2 night stay and i don't think there is anything standing out for this hotel,3
4860,what was expected for the price but this last stay was very stressful,3
4861,i can only comment on what i was hearing it sounded like they were in my room slamming cabinets,3
4862,the food in the breakfast bar was not very good and only cost 7,3
4863,our view was the roof with the sound of the card being slide to unlock the door,3
4864,the staff are very nice and comfortable and wifi worked fine,3
4865,when we checked out i went down to the front desk for several things and they were very helpful,3
4866,my family stayed the weekend at the sf mandarin oriental,3
4867,may not seem important but if you have a car and,3
4868,the beach cove resort hotel is an older hotel only one in area,3
4869,we had to take time to go to the hotel the next week to get corrected,3
4870,the lights flickered for the first night of the honeymoon,3
4871,all i can say is this was our first visit to virginia beach and we wanted to stay in the heavy traffic,3
4872,it did have a very nice pool and they keep it very clean,3
4873,stay was ok check in and charged a bit of a take it or leave it attitude from the hosts,3
4874,tv blaring office women gossiping and blaming others in the back office in order to check out,3
4875,i signed up for pay at hotel and realized that the hotel charged for wi-fi and internet connection,3
4876,if you are looking for a bed to sleep in for one night during our cross-country move,3
4877,my daughter will be starting school there in the fall and the hotel is just above the water taxi stands creating noise at all times,3
4878,no one in the check-in process was laborious,3
4879,we didn't have a problem stocking this,3
4880,had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel,3
4881,the hotel is located on the beach with good ocean view,3
4882,even when i stayed in a superior room with a king bed and got a queen,3
4883,the room was fine and the mattress was old and sagged in the middle,3
4884,the room was small albeit with a great view of the beach and the ocean,3
4885,the breakfast is adequate and we didn't get to enjoy a swim before being laid up for the next day,3
4886,1 there was a dead roach in the middle of the action swimming pool well room established motel,3
4887,the sound-proof needs to be improved upon but other than that very nice stay,3
4888,one exit up is a lot of noise when they arrive after work,3
4889,as the title said it was not the hotel's fault is that we were able to leave windows open to help clear the air,3
4890,it was also fairly quiet considering the place was full and we had a small issue with the condition of the rooms this is extreme,3
4891,although the room was clean and good sized,3
4892,we stayed at this laquinta several times in the past and have generally been pleased,3
4893,offerings at the breakfast buffet was average,3
4894,i would stay here again if i had to ask three times for them to come to the room and leave it parked there,3
4895,love that it's close to the highway,3
4896,my family of four stayed in a double room with a shared bathroom,3
4897,it was decent for the price and location,3
4898,it was nice the staff was very friendly and checked me in very quickly,3
4899,valet was full so we had to go get ice,3
4900,we don't drink and drive and it is easy to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
4901,we were there for the miss usa pageant so we weren't picky about where we chose to stay here at the last minute,3
4902,didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot doors opening closing all night people talking etc,3
4903,the only thing wrong with the room was the matteress it was old wore down and needs to be renovated or closed,3
4904,it was very pet friendly but i would not have seen it had it not been for the big sign,3
4905,the woman at the front desk because we were only staying one night so were looking for a fairly cheap hotel,3
4906,the hotel itself was very nice and wanted to help,3
4907,we stayed there for a week on business,3
4908,got over 100 a night wasn't all that impressed with the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness,3
4909,prefer less lighting so to relax and enjoy the pool only to get there and the pool was closed during most of our stay,3
4910,the hotel was very nice and very clean,3
4911,only part we didn't like the 4,3
4912,it's right off the highway which was convenient for us,3
4913,nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people,3
4914,my coworkers 30 plus guys and i stayed here for our weekend visit to burlington,3
4915,other than this small the room was and smelled clean,3
4916,have stayed here for one night for a dance competition and for the most part,3
4917,i had to persuade the front desk to get fresh ones,3
4918,i booked this hotel because it was close to very fine restaurants and great shopping centers,3
4919,we stayed here because it was close to the plant i was working at,3
4920,at least four times i had to ask for more at the front desk,3
4921,spent saturday night here with my daughter while in town for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel,3
4922,the room was nice and clean would stay there again for the price,3
4923,the building was renovated but there was a 100 dollar charge added for incidentals,3
4924,at first the front desk clerk was really nice and accommodating,3
4925,the hotel was perfect for a quick stay,3
4926,the lobby area was clean and well maintained,3
4927,breakfast was a plus and the staff was courteous but sparse,3
4928,breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for what you get,3
4929,hotel was very clean as well as the hot tub,3
4930,the front desk staff was very friendly and even let us check in early,3
4931,but everything in the room that wasn't ready,3
4932,the young lady at the desk that we had 2 rooms,3
4933,the location was fantastic with lots of shopping restaurants in walking distance,3
4934,my family stayed for a week choosing this hotel because of the location friendly staff good price seeing the time of year,3
4935,the road noise was so bad it sounded like a marching band had checked in directly above our room,3
4936,but the bigger issue really the only issue worth reporting is that the walls are thin and you will be woken up,3
4937,rooms are very clean and tidy they are a little on the lumpy uncomfy side but very clean,3
4938,i'm glad i did coz the room did not work and tv channels did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
4939,fitness room with just a couple of treadmills don't expect too much but definately worth all 29,3
4940,the room that we were given permission to use near the pool and we heard all of the late night swimmers,3
4941,the hot tub was decent and the dining room was packed,3
4942,but i would not stay here if you are looking for a reasonable price,3
4943,called around 1-2pm to ensure my room100 was going to be from the look of the hotel,3
4944,on several occasions there was no one to help you,3
4945,pets are accepted but there is no elevator in or near the lobby,3
4946,got to the hotel our room was not cleaned on monday morning,3
4947,bed was not very comfortable but it wasn't actually dirty,3
4948,great location for the convention center and the fridge was noisy,3
4949,the room was clean but ours did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
4950,additionally the location was walkable to a lot of nice restaurants and only 10 mins walk to galleries,3
4951,the first impression is that this is a very nice hotel go here otherwise skip it,3
4952,no coffee tea making facilities in the room would benefit from serious renovation,3
4953,they attempted to resolve some issues we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged,3
4954,i knew this wasn't going to work for us,3
4955,if we could have had a room away from the street and the pool on the second level,3
4956,the room that we were given permission to use near the pool and we heard all of the late night swimmers,3
4957,the front desk was rude when he checked us in it was as if they had not ever done the breakfast before,3
4958,the hotel has a amazing views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
4959,when we return we hope to stay in the fifth but i want improve and they can do,3
4960,room was clean it served its purpose for just sleep,3
4961,when i arrived and went to my room it was a good choice for a bargain hotel,3
4962,a word of advice to other travelers book a room on the 2nd floor had a musty mildewy smell,3
4963,upon checking in the lady at the front desk that i had a problem the last day as i was told i was upgraded,3
4964,i was told at the time of booking were not available,3
4965,it was an ok hotel but we were expecting what we had experienced before,3
4966,there is alot of fresh food for breakfast and it was swamped with people,3
4967,this is a non-smoking room and the king size bed was okay,3
4968,we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel to the travelers on the budget,3
4969,it happened to be very warm welcoming but this time the our room was dirty and had tear,3
4970,for the price i paid it would have been open the night we were there,3
4971,a patio would have been nice if they would have gone some where else and so would we,3
4972,therefore it was a bit run down but clean and functional,3
4973,the breakfast was good and the rooms were comfy,3
4974,the breakfast is great views are spectacular staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great though,3
4975,good hotel if you don't want to spend a lot since we knew we would be getting ourselves into,3
4976,we would have really liked a mini fridge in our room but both jeorge and george made sure i was taken care of,3
4977,would like better brand coffee in the room and didn't need it,3
4978,room ac could have been better but it was quiet and most of the staff were impatient and crude,3
4979,personnel in general very friendly and helpful at check in,3
4980,waited over an hour just to check in i could hear voices of people in the back office in order to check out,3
4981,hotel was fine and the bed was comfortable and the room was big and the bed confortable,3
4982,the hotel room was decent for the price we paid,3
4983,fortunately friends volunteered to keep her so we were able to stay in the room for security,3
4984,it was clean quiet a good value and really close to disneyland,3
4985,my only complaint was that there was a large red stain on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home,3
4986,very diasppointing for the cost in comparison to other hotels in the area as it is a tourist area,3
4987,the anglers inn is an older property but is nice,3
4988,main hallways were clean and welcoming and the room was very nice for the price just because of the pool situation,3
4989,here's a plus out the window from the room i was in which was not a pleasant experience,3
4990,we were just getting back to the interstate and everything in the room was very spacious with a separate sitting area from the beds,3
4991,east cambridge is not glamorous but this hotel is very convenient in its location to all the stuff in old town,3
4992,the hotel itself was very nice and helpful,3
4993,the smoking area right outside the door that i had to take the coffee maker off our bill,3
4994,room was nice the pool was ok and the fridge was cold,3
4995,had an issue with elevator didn't work properly in our room and in the hall,3
4996,the room we stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise so the location was perfect for me as well,3
4997,a bit difficult to access but that's not much of a problem,3
4998,the restaurant opens at 7 and we had to stand and wait until they decided to take care of any need i may have had,3
4999,bathroom is fairly newer but still could use an upgrade but they keep it clean,3
5000,we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the room,3
5001,after seeing room we decided that we did not want to stay there even after the bug was killed,3
5002,beautiful view great market a short walk away we had a nice stay for two nights,3
5003,harry and jim shuttle drivers were very nice and the bathrooms were clean,3
5004,a few friends and i stayed at this place years ago and really enjoyed our stay,3
5005,the guy at the front desk and at that point we didn't want to spend extended time there,3
5006,as they didn't fix the lamp light issue in the room it was pretty standard for an economy type hotel,3
5007,the good great location restaurants nearby you can walk to ihop and a short drive to bertuccis olive garden shopping,3
5008,the room was definitely old and the bathroom was very nice just a little small,3
5009,also the exterior room i was in which was not a local station,3
5010,minuses the elevator was very dirty i was on the 2nd floor 203 was superb very clean and had a fully working kitchen,3
5011,great free continental breakfast too bad there was a musty smell as you enter the queen sized bed takes up the entire first room,3
5012,pool room was so cold that we didn't get the room they thought they booked,3
5013,be sure to tack on add'l time if you have a car or are taking the metro,3
5014,if your looking for a place to crash but that is about it,3
5015,i will say the hotel staff did a great job with the bathroom and everything was neat and clean,3
5016,the hotel staff is friendly and housekeeping too,3
5017,there are a lot of kids so don't stay if you are looking for a reasonable price,3
5018,there often is no one in the family slept well,3
5019,also the tv remote did not work the entire time we were booked,3
5020,it was nice that there was a lot of traffic and was woken up a lot with the i-83 traffic,3
5021,but overall i would probably not be provided,3
5022,this hotel isn't a bad option for a quick overnight and this fit the bill,3
5023,i had room service once and it was taken care of,3
5024,the staff however were helpful when i asked for some they didn't have hot water,3
5025,we went down to breakfast and the staff was friendly and did a nice job,3
5026,the hotel itself is welcoming the staff friendly and helpful the bed was comfy and we got a voucher for the mcdonald's for breakfast,3
5027,had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel,3
5028,gentleman at the front desk no one was there and we had to wait more than 45 minutes for shuttle service,3
5029,the beds in our first room squeeked so much we had to ask for the second breakfast coupon and only received one cocktail coupon,3
5030,the hotel staff was very nice and brought batteries on request,3
5031,that did not happen and i had to grab bfast elsewhere,3
5032,it was more like we were an inconvenience not painv customers,3
5033,the pool was nice but the room itself was actually nice updated well,3
5034,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i stayed in one of their cabins instead,3
5035,however the staff was really nice and the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be held against the hotel,3
5036,the 3rd floor room has a lot of traffic and was woken up a lot with the desk staff and showing my reservation confirmation,3
5037,a previous stay at an abmi in a different location and it was significantly less expensive,3
5038,glad it was pet friendly and didn't charge for a pet to stay,3
5039,the final day they made the beds but didn't replace the coffee we used the day before,3
5040,in addition to the overall residual smell of smoke in a non-smoking room smelled of smoke and toilet paper stuck in exhaust fan,3
5041,if you're looking to save a few bucks and it was fine for that,3
5042,i like the fact that i booked this hotel because it was the end of the hallway,3
5043,it was someplace to sleep and the access to the hotel can be difficult to communicate with if you do not leave them,3
5044,many of the light fixtures in the room were very uncomfortable and on top of it they have a ridiculous pet policy,3
5045,this hotel was nice but the room itself was nice but the room itself was comfortable and was,3
5046,they brought us the plunger but they didn't have the kids with us,3
5047,they assigned us a smoking room and i have asthma problems,3
5048,they are the worse i have ever seen at a hotel,3
5049,the staff treated us as if we were an inconvenience not painv customers,3
5050,the room was nice the pool was ok and the free breakfast was so-so but coffee was good,3
5051,spent saturday night here with my daughter while in town for a race at texas motor speedway,3
5052,i liked the room however it had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in it,3
5053,room was small which made running the a c it would be perfect,3
5054,we had booked the hotel for the price and breakfast was a bit lacking but restaurants close by so not a big deal,3
5055,we booked for a family with two small children 5 and 7 we did find that the pool was closed and not working,3
5056,very pricey for what you get or should i say tried to eat,3
5057,we were comfortable for the most part it does the job for a good price this is an acceptable place to stay,3
5058,the recliner and table in front of the hotel is worth the money considering,3
5059,only a one night stay but affordable,3
5060,the room needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose and we near a lot of restaurants boutiques and grocery,3
5061,the first room i was in a frat house,3
5062,when i arrived the hotel was under construction i wish they would have put the heat on before we got there,3
5063,i booked a queen single bed and they put me in a cab to go to another hotel,3
5064,with the expansion of the 5 freeway the hotel can't control the noise level of other people,3
5065,it was pretty comfortable but the walls are so thin we heard every word and were awakened,3
5066,otherwise kids loved the pool overall it was good for what we planned the courtyard was nice and coffee was always available,3
5067,we did not complain to the front desk to come check it out,3
5068,the manager of the hotel was as far away from the center of krefeld but we'll connected if you have a pet,3
5069,chairs were too sinkable for me but overall it was good but little bit like 5 miles far from vegas strip,3
5070,parking is available on-site in their garage for the duration of the week and since it was high in the area,3
5071,this hotel has no room service and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference,3
5072,this is my second stay at this hotel in 3 years,3
5073,not sure i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks it's worth it,3
5074,the lobby and dining area for the price could have had a room away from the adjoining highway,3
5075,we stayed on a lower floor and there was a lot of construction being done to the hotel,3
5076,staff was all very friendly and helpful and this was a definite plus,3
5077,the staff that did try and make up for it by putting us in a parlor suite,3
5078,and hung up on me the second time i have stayed at the laquinta suites in the past and have generally been pleased,3
5079,no rollaway bed when i requested one and they said the manager would get back to us but never did,3
5080,staff were friendly but the hotel is clean and comfortable,3
5081,one exit up is a lot of noise when they leave early in the morning then enter,3
5082,terrible housekeeping staff do not care about their role in this hotel and hotel point or 10 coupon,3
5083,booked the room for one night so i could get a replacement phone,3
5084,the room was beautiful and the food was not nearly as good,3
5085,we used the indoor pool for a short time so i did not have it,3
5086,clean hotel friendly staff but the rooms are a bit small but comfortable,3
5087,also did not not like the charge for the safe in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
5088,our room was very clean and the beds weren't the most comfortable but they weren't terrible,3
5089,it seemed as if the walls were paper-thin we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door walls,3
5090,so over all it was not a great solution particularly for the cost,3
5091,overall the property is nice and well maintained just a bit too far to walk to notre dame a good half an hour,3
5092,i complained about my room to the front desk and they told him none was available,3
5093,rooms were ok but carpets didn't seem to be all that busy either,3
5094,yeah its the cheapest in the area but mostly due to the lack of any sun light,3
5095,easy commute to oxford without having to stay in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
5096,i grew up in boone and stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise so the location was great to hit fremont street,3
5097,the only complaint that i have is that the bathrooms could use more counter space,3
5098,we will try to stay at another hotel across the freeway it was full,3
5099,i brewed coffee and place coffee cups in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't,3
5100,the club car is nice but the staff was the shining moment at least,3
5101,i only booked this hotel because it has such great potential,3
5102,unfortunately the curtains do not close in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing,3
5103,the staff was notified we were checking in late and it was not a good selection for breakfast the ice machine on the,3
5104,conditions of hotel are a bit run down not the cleanest,3
5105,we were in town for march madness and were told that the parking was free when we left the property,3
5106,for a last minute booking and on a friday night in downtown seattle,3
5107,when i needed quarters for their own coin operated laundry i had to leave earlier than expected due to an emergency at home,3
5108,every time we called the front desk and we were told we were calling direct,3
5109,we had 2 beds in our room were creaky and old,3
5110,the other elevator was missing the covers for the lights in the bathroom sputtered and flickered for a while after we turned them on,3
5111,the property is inspected three times a year for events in indianapolis you can't beat it for the price,3
5112,it isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and it's very clean,3
5113,another down side about this hotel is that it was very clean and appeared to have been recently updated so no complaints with that,3
5114,the room we had was not as nice as we have come to expect from super 8 motels,3
5115,wow great service and imagine my surprise when checking in and was told the room would be ready when we got there,3
5116,perfect my girlfriend and i stayed here for pacific university family weekend,3
5117,hotel is very clean but the beds were comfortable one king one full,3
5118,the exterior isn't much to look at but the rooms are made for people over 6 feet tall,3
5119,the tv was older and so were the staff making the breakfast,3
5120,stayed here because it was one of the poorest offerings for similarly priced hotels,3
5121,we had to call front desk but never got an answer to that question,3
5122,we found that the tv remote did not work the entire time we stayed,3
5123,when checked into the room there was no coffee tea maker,3
5124,he allowed us to check-in a few hours early,3
5125,our room was okay but one of the reasons we booked this one and it was closed,3
5126,but the problem i had was i specifically asked for a room with a king bed fridge and microwave for 70,3
5127,either the hotel is a little dated but still functional,3
5128,bug big was found in one of the rooms that we were promised,3
5129,overall the hotel is nice but the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
5130,just needed a hotel for just one night over the july 4th weekend,3
5131,clean great pool delicious breakfast and the staff were great especially during check in,3
5132,great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling,3
5133,other than that it was as good as we experienced in our stay,3
5134,check in was good we were able to complete watching a program,3
5135,kids activities in the evening but unless you eat at the hotel restaurant bar was delicious although a little pricey which should be expected,3
5136,very clean and nice staff was friendly and the bed was comfortable clean bathroom and the decoration was ok,3
5137,tube hadn't been cleaned in some time,3
5138,hotel room clean beds comfy advertised free wi-fi but at no point could i actually connect to it,3
5139,room service is only once a week so you would have to get back to the hotel when it was getting dark,3
5140,our room was in a separate area and there was no one to help you,3
5141,bed was comfortable bathroom was clean carpet was not very clean the bathroom is tiny and the decor is very very dated,3
5142,our shower drain was soooo slow that you had to pay a separate fee to use the pool,3
5143,it has a beautiful stretch of beach however you are not allowed to keep others awake she shrugged,3
5144,no shampoo leaking toilet no running water in our shower tub,3
5145,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room although that's pretty standard for holiday inn express,3
5146,clumpy pillows felt like they had been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
5147,some of the rooms can be loud with a lot of boarded up factories,3
5148,the handicap room did not have a control for the air conditioner the internet and television in the bedroom did not work,3
5149,we checked in later in the evening from venturing out for dinner we were unable to get it fixed next day never done,3
5150,we are not too picky and for the most part clean however just very old reminded me more of a small older condo,3
5151,the club car is nice but the staff was friendly,3
5152,the rooms have not been updated in a long time,3
5153,when we arrived for bfast there was nowhere to set wrap glasses room key etc,3
5154,everything was great except for the staff that checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly,3
5155,the downside is that you are also close to the elevator and the stairwells,3
5156,ashley at front desk at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in off season hours,3
5157,well actually 5 because there was a starbucks n stores right across the street from the beach,3
5158,no much to choose from in lavonia ga,3
5159,i have to say the front desk staff was very friendly and it's very close to galcier national park,3
5160,hotel semmed like what you would expect from a best western but i felt like a 5 star guest,3
5161,if all you're looking for any late night entertainment or food you'll have to book in high season,3
5162,the biggest problem with the room was the matteress it was old wore down and needs to be freshened up a bit,3
5163,given the proximity to a wal-mart this hotel is pretty good but not this time,3
5164,the major issue i has was that after booking and prepaying for a room for you your mate for couple of nights this is it,3
5165,this hotel still needs a lot of refurbishing but we still had a good time here but it wasn't the cleanest,3
5166,free coffee available in the lobby for an hour each evening is a nice touch but then charged without my knowledge for the upgrade,3
5167,this is a decent hotel for the price and that was certainly delivered,3
5168,the room was nice and comfortable but the breakfast was one of the least expensive for the area,3
5169,i booked it anyway due to the price and proximity to new orleans,3
5170,i was very pleased with the location of the hotel and there is a lot of fast food,3
5171,was a little loud with a lot of restaurants boutiques and grocery,3
5172,the hotel is reasonable the location is good several shopping centers nearby,3
5173,very nice hotel friendly wine hour daily coffee in the lobby friendly staff cons the bed and pillows were very,3
5174,however the staff was really great and the room was clean and the bathroom fixtures were acceptable,3
5175,so much to see and do didn't use anything the charge would be reversed,3
5176,the bathroom tub so old we didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1,3
5177,this hotel is easy to get to easy to get to,3
5178,not even sure why because it was not so far from casino del sol,3
5179,that why a lot of people not enough room too crowded had to wait to place our order while our waiter bypassed us several times,3
5180,the breakfast in the morning but we did not see it posted anywhere,3
5181,the room were clean and breakfast was good but limited other options particularly for kids,3
5182,the area isn't much to look at but the rooms are spacious and staff is very helpfull,3
5183,be advised that the units are privately owned so there can be a wide range of received value for 125 per night,3
5184,if you are on a budget this is as good place to stay after riding motorcycles all day,3
5185,we have been coming here for years and never had a complaint,3
5186,i didn't feel as if i was ungrateful about getting a room,3
5187,the room was ok and the free breakfast was a plus,3
5188,let me start by saying i travel a lot and that was a plus,3
5189,the room was clean the decor was eclectic the location was great because there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,3
5190,the housekeeping could have been better but it was quiet and we slept well each night,3
5191,but i called the front desk they did put us on the 4th floor very quiet bed comfortable,3
5192,bed is what you would expect from a residence inn however our room was showing it's wear,3
5193,some good food in the area but the hotel was pretty the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
5194,beautiful view great market a short walk away we had a nice stay and for about half the price as anywhere else in town,3
5195,outlet mall is right next door to the freeway so there is road noise,3
5196,it is located 25 minutes from the airport it's very clean and the staff were very helpful and polite,3
5197,we were on the second floor hallway could not keep up with breakfast and refilling items,3
5198,the location was not easy to get the complimentary breakfast,3
5199,when i finally checked in the room was inadequate,3
5200,every simple request required multiple phone calls and they placed us in a quieter room but didn't do a good job of it,3
5201,personnel at desk were very friendly and willing to help you with anything they can,3
5202,overall the hotel was nice but our room was so close to the highway which was convenient but a little noisy,3
5203,the general feel of the hotel was told they do not have extra pillows,3
5204,15 minute walk from the train station and in the heart of roanoke and right at the market center,3
5205,this hotel is nothing special but it got the job done and that's about it,3
5206,no ac too hot in the room when i walked in,3
5207,the second night i stayed i was in a room that had not been remodeled yet that was a former smoking room,3
5208,the place itself was fine clean quiet all the employees were very nice and attentive and the food was not nearly as good,3
5209,we booked here because the rate was reasonable i did not find the property up to the standards of other best western hotels,3
5210,however on the night i stayed they were having a problem or not but the water was cold,3
5211,the tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise,3
5212,our favorite part was the location-very close to the hotel is convenient,3
5213,food was ok for the money i think that it was overpriced for a hampton inn,3
5214,they gave me a room and a bed i can sleep in,3
5215,hotels website indicated that a complimentary breakfast was not included as written,3
5216,the staff is super friendly and the beds are very comfortable and the pillows just right,3
5217,my boyfriend and i were not going to spend much time in room but it was just okay,3
5218,you really can't beat the price and the breakfast was 12 per person,3
5219,the food in the breakfast bar was sub-par,3
5220,we booked this hotel as i just needed a bed and shower the next morning,3
5221,after spending one night there i realized the sliding glass door it did not go away,3
5222,got there and was told they didn't have my reservation when i arrived,3
5223,whomever fixed the ceiling in the bathroom didn't work and they could not fix it,3
5224,all in all it's good enough for a two night stay,3
5225,my biggest disappointment was the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups,3
5226,the signal for the free wifi was not very good,3
5227,it's ok for a night and it was fine,3
5228,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke but the room did not work well though it did keep my room slightly comfortable,3
5229,beds were not very comfortable and the room was spacious the bathroom clean but basic,3
5230,would i stay again probably for the price and that was certainly delivered,3
5231,needless to say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the room or anywhere else on dining activities attractions delivery in the area,3
5232,the first day at the loby they tried to charge us for our stay after we had already paid,3
5233,it looked pretty good online and it gave me a room where i did not have opportunity to experience anything other than the room itself,3
5234,just needed a place for a quick stop,3
5235,there was some hair on the floor of the room,3
5236,prefer less lighting so to relax and enjoy the pool only to get there and the pool was nice the bar had a pleasant tender,3
5237,well on a whole the room was clean and comfortable and the staff was actually pretty friendly,3
5238,when she checked in we were told that there is one provided in the room,3
5239,overall central location to a lot of great things about this hotel,3
5240,the first floor which we walked through to get to the hotel was closed and the breakfast bar was not available,3
5241,new tv did not work and front desk was courteous,3
5242,we paid extra for this hotel as it was close to universal studios,3
5243,very quick and efficient check-in and check-out could not have been nicer nor tried harder to assist us in,3
5244,we originally planned 2 nights for our family of four the room was small,3
5245,also i didn't like is that the walls are thin and you will be woken up,3
5246,the hotel is in a great location near the cruise ship terminal,3
5247,hotel is older and in need of a deep clean,3
5248,our expectations for this hotel were to find a cheap room to get some sleep,3
5249,it is an older property but clean,3
5250,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
5251,i only needed a place to stay for the price,3
5252,the staff was pretty nice and the rooms were freezing and the heaters did not work very well in the room,3
5253,i specifically requested a room for 5 adults i was given a room with a king sized bed by the time we got there,3
5254,that said it was our first visit to virginia beach and we wanted to stay on the top floor just to avoid any noise disturbances,3
5255,this time we got a 1-br unit and it was small but adequate and clean as was the en-suite bathroom,3
5256,the service was nice but not very big,3
5257,the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice as it was within walking distance of the hotel,3
5258,place is very low cost and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
5259,the only reason i booked this hotel mainly for a continental breakfast and even a pool,3
5260,stay was ok check in and charged a bit of a tight squeeze if you over 240lbs,3
5261,i was there for 7 hours and my room was not cleaned and i had to call and fix it not the motel,3
5262,the room was small albeit with a great view of the rocks in the park,3
5263,when we first got to the room from the drive,3
5264,the lights next to the bed were not working at all on the 5th floor which if you get a balcony room,3
5265,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
5266,for the price i was pleased with the size and comfort of the room,3
5267,way too many people for the pool and breakfast areas and the wifi was in the room was terribly loud,3
5268,when i went to check out no one was in the lower class,3
5269,the pull out bed was at the other end of the street and although there is a good size,3
5270,we stayed for 2 nights the room was clean beds were very comfortable,3
5271,the bed was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friends,3
5272,i went back to the front desk they took care of it v,3
5273,i am not sure why it hasn't been professionally cleaned in some time,3
5274,our biggest complaint was that there seemed to be a good rate,3
5275,overall ok but i wouldn't stay there again but not for extended stay,3
5276,we opened up the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the receptionists who was also much friendlier,3
5277,everything was in good shape considering the age of the place it was pretty nice i will say i found the bed very comfortable,3
5278,at 7 am we were woken by the noise of the beach,3
5279,it is a walking distance from the cemetery and french quarters,3
5280,getting there is a little kitchen but the oven didn't work at all called the front desk and they took care of it v,3
5281,nice cheap place to stay for a couple of hours on my way from nc to ky,3
5282,the rooms were ok but there was no flatware glasses nor kitchen linens,3
5283,we had a room with a king sized bed by the time we got there,3
5284,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to drive around town to make connections,3
5285,it was a decent stop over on our way to the cma festival in nashville,3
5286,not a bad place wouldn't be on the top of the range for its hotel bracket i expected a more comfortable bed,3
5287,the only real problem was that there was no mirror outside of the bathroom in the middle of the night by yelling and screaming,3
5288,i only had to wait a good 30 minutes to check-in while waiting for our room to be inspected,3
5289,the hotel was fine and the staff was friendly and there's a dunkin donuts across the street,3
5290,i neglected to note there was no elevator so we had to use the hotel room service,3
5291,kudos to the workers for being so kind and i'm sure he would've switched us,3
5292,the rooms were ok but there was no microwave and we had a double room with 4 people,3
5293,angelina's is an ok place they gave me a non smoking room on the second day we stayed two nights,3
5294,it was a good place to stay for the weekend 4th of july festivities,3
5295,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
5296,on a positive note the room was comfortable but carpeting needs to be cleaned or replaced,3
5297,some of the staff were friendly but asked if i needed to check out of a room i already paid for,3
5298,the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was plug i needed to call for housekeeping daily to service,3
5299,the living room was ok it had an old box tv and everything in the room looked new,3
5300,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is located in is not great,3
5301,had to move rooms because they didn't have a problem stocking this,3
5302,i felt as if i was given the bottom of the inner shower curtain was light reddish,3
5303,on a more positive note the staff was very nice however we booked a room for a weekend in a couple weeks,3
5304,furnishings were only average and there were no bars of soap,3
5305,i tried to call the front desk for several things and they were very helpful and polite,3
5306,fitness room is too small and was packed and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive,3
5307,location was superb very easy to walk for anything you need,3
5308,the hotel itself was nice the rooms were nice and clean i saw three of them,3
5309,there a lot of great things about this hotel was the closest i could find so i gave it a try,3
5310,super solid well-maintained but nothing to write home about but it is an ok place they gave me a new room,3
5311,the bed was ok but the room had an odor to it,3
5312,there is no daily housekeeping for us that wasn't a problem for us our concert is only a mile a half away,3
5313,the room was decent and clean as was the bathroom so no complaints there,3
5314,but if you want a hotel near crossgates mall you can't beat the bar and grill kitty corner delicious,3
5315,i would not have minded it's faults but i was disappointed with my stay at this hotel,3
5316,the floors in the bathroom are exetremely hot,3
5317,entering room found no towels and coffee in the room and are using extension cords to accommodate all the lights,3
5318,if you are planning on a one night stay prior to flying out in the morning,3
5319,however when we arrived they were in the shape of squares,3
5320,parking is tight and some is located on a busy road so noisy,3
5321,i thought the room was ok beds were a little soft for our liking,3
5322,the location was not easy to get to,3
5323,dear erincorbo thank you so much for taking the time to write a review and for choosing to stay with us,3
5324,we should have stayed in one of the elevators was broken so we had to park was kinda scary to walk thru at night,3
5325,rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are staying at the hotel we never heard any of them,3
5326,location was great very easy to walk into the old town,3
5327,i really appreciated not having to deal with all the security issues,3
5328,my only complaint is the mattress was old and sagged in the middle,3
5329,the wall unit a c did not perform to good,3
5330,my husband and i stayed here for our visit to the bourbon trail,3
5331,the second room was comfortable and clean but room was very small without any place to tidy clothes,3
5332,the ceiling in our room was gross old and the shower liner needed to be replaced as there was nothing offered that appealed to me,3
5333,inconveniently i will have to find another hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there,3
5334,rooms are small if your tall you may want to pass on free breakfast,3
5335,we have stayed here several times because of the size of the room and ensuring the remainder of my stay was comfortable,3
5336,granted i should have done more research but it was a nice night for just the two of us,3
5337,bottom line the room was nice and clean,3
5338,many of the light fixtures in the room were quite uncomfortable,3
5339,the only thing wrong with the room in fact the bed was comfortable if a little squeaky,3
5340,and diane went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable,3
5341,they assigned us a smoking room and i have asthma problems,3
5342,all can say is i do not know if any rooms do have one,3
5343,the price was good and i told the lady at the desk was very helpful,3
5344,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to say that the location is worth it,3
5345,the overnight stay the room in very dirty and when we told the front desk but no cleaning of our rooms for 2015 and 2016,3
5346,i should have booked on the other side of i-95 take a cab,3
5347,another down side about this hotel is that it's about 35-45 minutes from downtown austin,3
5348,its very close to ac and we stayed there for one night on our way up to portland,3
5349,i had a problem the last day as i was told i would have two rooms on the second floor,3
5350,also there was one bed mine directly close to the window and it was very quiet which i did not request,3
5351,there was a fan in the room that are non-smoking rooms available,3
5352,kids loved the pool overall it was good but could have been better,3
5353,air conditioning in room 114was so loud that i couldn't even here the lady checking me in,3
5354,the maid was really nice and i went to my new room found they had given me another double,3
5355,breakfast was minimal but for the price i completely recommend this hotel,3
5356,the hotel was very close to a hospital so you could hear everything that was going on in the lobby from this room,3
5357,we reserved a non-smoking room and the king size bed was okay,3
5358,our room was on the first floor in the back room which was a pleasant surprise it was clean friendly and comfortable,3
5359,there were not very many selections with the continental breakfast but that's not too surprising for a downtown hotel,3
5360,pool was nice but there is no elevator so if you have a car and,3
5361,make sure you get a courtyard room if you don't need much then it's a fine place to stay,3
5362,updated from the old fashioned room it used to be a coffee maker in the room etc,3
5363,upon check in we were told there was a new manager,3
5364,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
5365,room was old and not fresh there was a mild displeasing odor probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing,3
5366,the room was clean and the beds were lovely and large,3
5367,although the location of this hotel was breakfast,3
5368,it is good to get to the hotel through a very weird access road,3
5369,it wasn't that bad but it wasn't dirty and that's what i was after,3
5370,you need to park in the fire lanes,3
5371,best part was the price 50 on a friday night the price was very high,3
5372,a group of us stayed here for three nights and we would definitely stay here again,3
5373,this visit was for a family get together for a night and needed a place to sleep like us,3
5374,one chair was so soiled that we did not want to stay there even after the bug was killed,3
5375,you'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only one thus far that charges for internet access,3
5376,the rate is very reasonable and the location is great and within walking distance of key shopping dining and beach areas,3
5377,i was not exactly impressed with that but overall it was a good place outside needs a little fixing up,3
5378,the mattress is very firm and even though i asked for a wet towel to wash off the filthy breakfast tables,3
5379,rooms are small if your tall you may want to just use the complimentary airport shuttle to get to the elevator reeked of cigarette smoke,3
5380,very run down rooms smell breakfast is the worst of any hotel i've stayed in there was no shower cap,3
5381,it is clean breakfast is included in this price range,3
5382,room is old and outdated but it was clean and everything in it was as little as could be provided,3
5383,it was a few blocks further away from the beach and an easy location to the highway,3
5384,some good food in the area but mostly due to the lack of follow up by this hotels management team,3
5385,it looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk,3
5386,always enjoy having a refrigerator in the room despite the fact the door was deadbolted and the swinglock engaged,3
5387,the area was ok and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
5388,too many people so it was a bit noisy as the person people in the room next to us fighting for awhile,3
5389,the hotel was clean and in good shape very comfortable and the staff was friendly highly priced for the hotel you were getting,3
5390,this is the second time i have stayed on fremont street,3
5391,not a great hotel it is a good place to stay for the price and location,3
5392,on the plus side rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
5393,unfortunately king bed was hard and the pillows were way too flat to sleep comfortably,3
5394,our room was freezing so i went to turn down the air because the room was at least 85 degrees,3
5395,they close very early the pool area the hotels eating area,3
5396,we literally couldn't drive anymore so we needed to book a hotel and it is simply not as good as a super 8,3
5397,the only problem i had with the hotel was room size particularly bathroom size,3
5398,hotel is very clean and staff friendly however the hotel is a little run down but conveniently located just off the interstate,3
5399,this is the third time that i stay at this hotel but ask for a room in the upper floors breathtaking sight,3
5400,ants in the bathroom and were told that the orange juice was done for the day,3
5401,place was great room next to us fighting for awhile,3
5402,our room rate with hotels was very reasonable so i am not a 5 star but comfortable for an overnight stay,3
5403,on one day my room wasn't cleaned before she checked in,3
5404,the staff was very helpful making sure that the room was clean but hot initially ac worked well to make it comfortable,3
5405,the staff was friendly and the place was clean and i will say i found the bed very comfortable,3
5406,if you are going to stay at the comfort suites on business trips and it meets my needs,3
5407,they also make a lot of noise near the hotel,3
5408,the bed is comfy front desk staff were very nice but the hotel is clean and beds are comfertable cheap rooms,3
5409,there were not very many selections with the continental breakfast but that's not too surprising for a downtown hotel,3
5410,how do you check in we had to wait more than 45 minutes for shuttle service,3
5411,average room for an average price just a stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
5412,the shower was moldy the toilet seat was up when i got there,3
5413,however the price was good for a few nights as our mini honeymoon getaway to atlantic city,3
5414,the room was in need of a deep clean,3
5415,on first glance the breakfast area seems small for the size of the rooms and my daughter did not want to stay in the jr,3
5416,i was wearing flip flops and ended up throwing them away because they were so old and rusted they fell off,3
5417,no elevator so 2nd floor wasn't so great i got a standard room,3
5418,everything was fine except when we went into the room it seems ok since it was really late and we were exhausted,3
5419,i stayed in this hotel for one night before heading into st,3
5420,the rooms are clean and offer a microwave fridge setup but don't expect the service to wow you,3
5421,the lights were a bit confusing as there is a nice run along the bay,3
5422,what i liked best was the refrigerator and microwave that i expected to see,3
5423,the location was very convenient for one night on my way across the country,3
5424,breakfast at the buffet was the only highlight of the stay was the other hotel guests,3
5425,we got the airplane ticket hotel package last minute so we wouldn't have to climb steps,3
5426,they are the worse i have ever seen at a hotel,3
5427,could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable pool area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
5428,she was irritated that i wanted plates at a late hour we slept good and we left early,3
5429,ashley at front desk at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in off season hours,3
5430,was a good budget hotel however the rooms need to be renovated desperately,3
5431,also the exterior room i was in which was not a pleasant experience,3
5432,it don't seem like much but when you stay at a hotel my favorite is holiday inn express or best western plus,3
5433,we found that the tv remote did not work the second evening i stayed here,3
5434,generally a good overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
5435,the decor is in dire need of a place to stay for a night on my way to a wedding,3
5436,upon arrival tv remote was missing and we had to go out for breakfast the rooms were not impressive,3
5437,the meal was okay but not very accommodating,3
5438,the first night we checked in one of my pets went under the bed and it looked like it was recently renovated,3
5439,this is an old resort clean as much as possible but in need of some updates paint but the staff was very helpful,3
5440,ok place to stay for a night on a road trip and didn't want to travel on a holiday and had to be evacuated,3
5441,we asked for a new bedspread and we were given a choice of 2,3
5442,air conditioning in room 114was so loud that i was unable to lower the water temperature in our shower,3
5443,concersations from other rooms were plainly audible in our room and it seamed cramped the pool is nice but small,3
5444,bed was hard pillows were small and not very fluffy,3
5445,we were promised rooms on the first floor in the back room which was a pleasant surprise it was clean friendly and comfortable,3
5446,however the bathroom was small we couldn't even put our suitcase opened anywhere,3
5447,the staff were friendly but the front desk made sure it was well past time for it,3
5448,we found ourselves in dire need of a place to stay with clean bedding and a free breakfast,3
5449,the desk staff were very nice and helpful,3
5450,great trip help at the hotel was great for our quick 3 day trip to seattle,3
5451,i had to stay at the hampton's or la quinta,3
5452,i've stayed here 3 times and all 3 units seem to be for pets very pet friendly,3
5453,the hotel has free parking and is literally less than a block from the embarcadero and view bay side balcony,3
5454,the only problem was my key card didn't work but the front desk guy handled it well,3
5455,when we checked in the front desk staff was friendly and the room was hot humid and musty,3
5456,i read the reviews for this hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park,3
5457,advertised as a family place but way too many people for the pool and side doors etc,3
5458,it was so bad i felt like i was inconveniencing her,3
5459,also unusual room ambiance with a large comfort chair place on the top of or on my list if i were going on vacation,3
5460,the front desk was on the phone with what sounded like a machine gun coming from up stairs,3
5461,i would have thought that the service would have been better if the pool was open,3
5462,the club car is nice but the staff was friendly,3
5463,in their pool area there was no towels either and they don't have to eat in their overpriced restaurant,3
5464,kids loved the pool which is a good size but a little old,3
5465,my west facing room did not have a shower curtain,3
5466,nothing super special but we were there only for a quick night while on the road but not great condition,3
5467,nothing wrong with the room was that it was noisy,3
5468,great staff lots of traffic in out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
5469,only four things in the room and a kitchenette which we didn't want to wait,3
5470,the h c room 123 is in the middle of everything that can be a bad thing as well,3
5471,staff was accommodating though and printed for me from the front desk person was friendly and helpfull,3
5472,he was very pleasant and helpful with this and the room was spacious and the breakfast filled you up,3
5473,we came back for a visit and found the hotel to be a bit to small and heater cool air didn't work,3
5474,have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its modest rates,3
5475,we stayed in april i can't imagine anyone sitting in it,3
5476,and when we checked out they had no idea where we were going,3
5477,bug big was found in one of the rooms that we had booked was not available,3
5478,i am a non-smoker and i thought the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke esp by the door and bathroom,3
5479,this really should be fixed in every room since a good night's rest and continued our trip the next day,3
5480,it was what i expected but they did not have chips and stains on them,3
5481,the service was nice but not very big,3
5482,parkside inn looks nice and inviting from the outside however the rooms are very nice and the place was clean,3
5483,we were unable to get the shuttle van to pick us up from a catalina excursion after the shuttle hours were over,3
5484,overall fine place for a stop over it was clean but we were disappointed by uncleanliness and lack of housekeeping,3
5485,the heat did not work well at all,3
5486,i would stay there again if there are no rooms on the street side,3
5487,the hotel is very clean and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries,3
5488,they need a curtain or door between the sink mirror and the sleeping area which made it easy to get around branson,3
5489,the food was ok and wasn't worth the amount you pay to stay in it,3
5490,this place has a great location and close to family,3
5491,rooms are small if your tall you may want to just use the complimentary airport shuttle to get to the metro,3
5492,the bathroom was clean but there were no towels in the pool,3
5493,even though the hotel is officially rated as a 4 star hotel furniture is old and there are spots where the stain has fallen off,3
5494,overall it was good but could have been better the beds were comfortable,3
5495,there was a damp smell in our room which i thought was pretty weird for a hotel,3
5496,the room was clean and pristine aside from the musty smell and room service was always happy to deliver more pillows with a smile,3
5497,i ordered a burger from room service and it was good could have more cable chanels,3
5498,i was not pleased with our stay at days inn,3
5499,upon arrival spare blanket was soiled and we had to go outside after the swim to cool down,3
5500,that was the only reason i booked this hotel mainly for a continental breakfast and a pool,3
5501,the recliner and table in front of the grand canal and within walking distance of key shopping dining and beach areas,3
5502,the pool area was nice and the map provided from the front desk and they told him none was available,3
5503,nothing fancy but it was comfortable and the shower was great,3
5504,would not stay again unless i get a room on the second floor right out my window the hotel dumpsters,3
5505,we loved being right on the water and the pool area was very small for the size of its rooms and value,3
5506,it is not the worst possible experience but it is not well maintained if it is,3
5507,room was clean front desk clerk was really nice and the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be held against the hotel,3
5508,one was the inability to be able to breathe at night,3
5509,they claimed it was due to the renovations,3
5510,the internet at the hotel is not bad but needs to be updated,3
5511,it wasn't the greatest hotel stay ever but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
5512,i enjoyed my stay but it was not a terrible stay but i will probably not be returning,3
5513,when we stayed the first time we accessed the room,3
5514,not the hotel's fault is that we were on the second floor they swear i did so i have a terrible view,3
5515,well this was the last time we stayed was in july,3
5516,we went to eugene this month and stayed here for one evening on way to florida,3
5517,the tv was small and the bed was comfy,3
5518,when i went to check out there was a nasty odor in the lobby,3
5519,there's a little pantry of a place in the shower to lay your soap or to set you shampoo,3
5520,this was a great hotel in the university district and having stayed here in the past and have generally been pleased,3
5521,cobwebs could be seen in the car outside,3
5522,we picked this hotel because it was close to key arena,3
5523,hotel room clean beds comfy advertised free wi-fi but this turned out not to be the case,3
5524,i've noticed this with a lot of boarded up factories,3
5525,the bedroom was clean and the location is great and within walking distance,3
5526,also better quality towels would have been nice to have them,3
5527,it would be much better if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early,3
5528,the price was right and i was only sleeping there so i was not spending a lot of time and money into renovating the property,3
5529,fridge was actually cleaner than the one at the 150 hotel we stayed at the mountain lodge but not the first time in telluride,3
5530,bed was uncomfortable and there was a clump of hair in the sink,3
5531,pros the room was clean but the bed was more than i expected,3
5532,an attempt has been made to update it but the rooms are a bit small but that is usually expected in nyc,3
5533,too far from the beach poor wifi that i was charged for a no show while staying there,3
5534,we are spend a lot of money this is a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
5535,if you are only looking for a clean place to stay,3
5536,quiet and clean but hotel was in need of a bit of love,3
5537,i had to stay at the hotel and had to wait for 50 mins to get picked up at the airport,3
5538,best part was the price 50 on a friday night the price was very good and staff was friendly,3
5539,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the building nearest a large truck parking area,3
5540,the hotel room was very clean and nice rooms,3
5541,the first non-smoking room and the king size bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for our needs and the price,3
5542,liked that it was in walking distance to places to eat,3
5543,it's no secret this hotel needs some advice on a healthy breakfast,3
5544,the room rates were not bad considering the proximity to the beach,3
5545,we are spend a lot of time in the room because of being busy out but i will stay again,3
5546,i only had to wait a long time if i needed my car as i sat with my yellow ticket in hand,3
5547,the ceiling in our room was coming apart,3
5548,they did provide shampoo a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
5549,the ones here are hard as a rock but the pillows were comfy,3
5550,if you plan on doing a lot of construction going on in the lobby from this room,3
5551,three more times we came back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
5552,the only things i didn't like that it was across the street from a bar windows do not block out light,3
5553,the ac was cold but noisy and difficult to sleep straight through the,3
5554,i felt the room to be able to relax and enjoy late night drink and food,3
5555,it was nice that there was a lot of noise from the highway,3
5556,we truly thought we walked into the lobby we were greeted with the stink emanating from somewhere,3
5557,the front desk was great the room could have been better,3
5558,we were given the wrong information about the breakfast time and we were not asked what type of bed we wanted,3
5559,one of the elevators was broken so we had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves,3
5560,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and the fridge was a bonus,3
5561,the only problem was my key card didn't work but housekeeping did bring us another one,3
5562,the ice and drink machines broke down while we were there but was a little disappointed with the breakfast,3
5563,check in staff was polite and the location was great,3
5564,evening social meal good as well as the rooms but functional,3
5565,upon entering my room i got a lot of negative pushback,3
5566,breakfast was nice and they are pet friendly up to 85 pounds i believe,3
5567,the front desk staff were very attentive if a little robotic and there were plenty of places to eat,3
5568,this was our first visit to virginia beach and we wanted to watch the game while we had dinner and some drinks,3
5569,room was clean enough i guess beds were not so comfy and breakfast was a scramble but the free breakfast was all about gluten,3
5570,just needed a place for a quick stop,3
5571,the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but works for me,3
5572,it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
5573,i may try it again next time i am in the area,3
5574,this hotel was reasonably priced and we had a 6 am international flight,3
5575,the restaurant closed at 9:00 on a friday night in july right on the boardwalk in santa cruz,3
5576,not very clean to say the least and some of the literature in the room was only decaf,3
5577,no one has cleaned that area in a long time heavy stains all over the place,3
5578,good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance,3
5579,she said yeah sorry you needed to be in the u district this location is fantastic,3
5580,loved it only bad thing was the pool was small but nice,3
5581,i booked a single room for one night so it was nice to have a table for working eating,3
5582,it was a cold night and the room was clean and comfortable with microwave and refrg,3
5583,outside of that the rooms were clean but small and smelled of paint,3
5584,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about this place is the staff,3
5585,refrigerator and free hot breakfast included in the price not free is poor,3
5586,the hotel itself was ok but it was a bit run down but clean,3
5587,its a old building and it was great but the room was much less then to be desired,3
5588,arrived just after 3 pm check in 12 pm check out,3

5603,the breakfast was good and the room was ok the air was cold and beds were comfortable and i heard no,3
5604,our room was right next to a railroad track and you could hear people in the hallways at night very clearly,3

5606,just be prepared to help the staff if you need a quick one night stay for us,3

5611,we went here for my wife and i booked a jr,3
5612,if you are looking for a clean room to spend the night this is a good start,3

5614,waited 30 minutes for someone to show up,3
5615,i needed cash to pay a taxi fare and they didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1,3
5616,the front office manager was very helpful and cleared everything up quickly and got us into a room comparable to what i had booked,3
5617,considering i am 100 sure it was found when the room was ready,3
5618,we didn't realize until we got to the motel after dinner i quickly,3
5619,it is located right across the bridge from shreveport,3
5620,not a place i would stay again but nothing special,3
5621,very nice hotel but could never recommend because of the thieves at the front desk just a note saying to wait,3
5622,i d say overall experience was good though and the room had decent pillows as well as extras which made for a long night,3
5623,was told that my family could check in early but when we got there the hotel power has just come back on,3

5634,after a 30 minute discussion with the front desk staff were rude and acted like helping me was a nuisance,3
5635,the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very hard and uncomfortable i almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress,3
5636,the good the staff here is super friendly and the beds are very comfortable and the breakfast was really good and variable,3
5637,the pictures from the website made the room seem more clean and modern,3

5786,it was ok but the beds are hard,3
5787,my only complaint is the mattress was old and i could feel the springs on the bed but it was comfortable enough,3
5788,we were visiting relatives and simply needed a place to sleep after a long drive,3
5789,it wasn't not what expected but in all it was a nice hotel and the environment was fine,3
5790,lady at desk nice but had to apologize that the hotel had just charged us a 50 fee,3
5791,the hotel was still under construction at the time of booking were not available,3
5792,the price was good and the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated and needs some updating,3
5793,my room stank when i checked in for the first visit i was informed that the hotel was under construction,3
5794,the room was very clean but the beds were great,3
5795,hotel was quiet and i slept well for the first time,3
5796,there is a single diner-style restaurant an easy walk across the parking lot in the back of the building,3
5797,the hotel itself was quiet and the location was a short drive from st,3
5798,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of roanoke and right at the market center,3
5799,not a bad place i've stayed but not the best,3
5800,besides low price nothing to rave about but actually better than i expected given the condition of the room as the hotel was booked full,3
5801,pool room was so cold that we didn't get to enjoy breakfast because of time we needed to,3
5802,however no shampoo conditioner or bath soap unless asked for at the front desk was very helpful and nice,3
5803,the night staff was great and very friendly,3
5804,this year alone i have stayed in numerous other lq locations in the past so was surprised by the comfort,3
5805,did hear a couple of trains during the night ac was a little loud with a lot of boarded up factories,3
5806,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice place which doesn't help,3
5807,my daughter will be starting school there in the fall and found standards had slipped since my trip a year previous,3
5808,it was right off the highway and they'll give you a voucher for mcdonald's which is right next door,3
5809,the room was ok but my advise is don't stay on the bed the tub was soft moved under your feet which was scary,3
5810,it's literally 60 seconds from the convention center so the location was great right across the street,3
5811,the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but works for me,3
5812,no options for room service and the restaurant at the hotel was great for the kids,3
5813,the employees were all very friendly and professional,3
5814,also did not like the fact that there were signs everywhere saying,3
5815,the staff was very good room was clean but warm upon arrival,3
5816,not the nicest motel in the world but for the money spent it's a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
5817,carpet was worn and the wall paper was peeling off the walls in the room and a kitchenette which we didn't get much sleep,3
5818,since we were there over the 4th of july we didn't want to pay up for a luxury hotel,3
5819,other than that staff was friendly and the bed was the kind you can really sink down into and relax,3
5820,i'd like to give this hotel a second chance considering its close proximity to where i was and i followed him to the hotel,3
5821,that's where they were great he said no prob and moved us to a new room which was much better newer and cleaner,3
5822,also sign in room said continental breakfast but there was only one lady working the front desk,3
5823,i had a great time in dahlonega the hotel staff was very accommodating and willing to assist where needed,3
5824,although coffee pot was provided in room there was no hot water when i showered in the morning,3
5825,the room was very small with no place to sit down to eat,3
5826,also there are no restaurants to eat at unless you want to eat every meal at mcd,3
5827,recommend highly for budget-conscious travelers appreciate the free continental breakfast area was jammed,3
5828,i was gone most of the day and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings,3
5829,the breakfast they offer was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than expected nice muffins bagels and fresh fruit,3
5830,windows weren't well insulated so you could hear everything that was going on,3
5831,bed was extremely comfortable and the shower had little water coming out wifi signal was weak,3
5832,the staff were very nice and changed my room to the 5th floor to carry our bags,3
5833,also they didn't have an exhaust,3
5834,no options for room service and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
5835,however it was not one of the first to check out the other amenities it was good for a two night stay,3
5836,just didn't look like it hadn't,3
5837,we asked how to get to the 2nd floor only and then had to check in,3
5838,so hopefully there was a problem with the hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait that long you might miss out,3
5839,our to was great but there was a tear in the carpet and the bathroom were horrible and in need of updating,3
5840,also i was charged for spa services that i didn't know this till i checked in,3
5841,we stopped here for one night after leaving the cruise ship,3
5842,franklin has excellent places to eat and out of the way to offer help,3
5843,we had to ask for towels and the ac did not work which would have helped drown out the highway sound and,3
5844,not the end of the hallway similar to the units in the rooms so room service has to be used,3
5845,dodge the tunnels and go outside to get there so even though it was a little pricey,3
5846,i booked this hotel because it had a door to the bedroom,3
5847,we are travelling with our dog and he was comfortable in the room during the extreme wind and rain,3
5848,i feel that for the price it was an acceptable stay,3
5849,my feet were blistered by the end of the summer but didn't they know that was coming,3
5850,but if u just need a place to sleep at night and shower the location was great,3
5851,stopped here overnight on the way to our final vacation destination,3
5852,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
5853,the motel is further from the highway so it wasn't hard to find,3
5854,the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
5855,many of the light fixtures in the room did not work well the entire stay,3
5856,not sure i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks and give this place a shot,3
5857,we were tired from traveling all day and needed a pet friendly option and this modest motel filled the bill,3
5858,we stayed here two nights the customer service was just okay,3
5859,the hotel itself was very nice and friendly,3
5860,stayed overnight and left early in the morning i went to bed uncomforatble,3
5861,we were in-town for one night and did not use the pool,3
5862,the living area of the room was comfortable but carpeting needs to be cleaned or replaced,3
5863,the room was rather dark and felt like we were hassling them when we checked in,3
5864,old and quite dirty hotel no wi-fi in rm and our rm had no wi-fi not even spg members,3
5865,we were unable to get the shuttle van to pick us up or take us back to the airport,3
5866,this hotel is ok for the price range,3
5867,we had booked the west-room which is on the back of the hotel so it didn't really matter,3
5868,i was traveling for business i found that the staff was not very helpful,3
5869,room was clean and comfortable but entire building could use a bit of an update was adequate for the price,3
5870,but again it was a quick overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
5871,i'd give this hotel a second chance considering its close proximity to where i was having a medical procedure,3
5872,when we also got up to our room to find hair in the bathtub and all over the bathroom floor,3
5873,i used to think i was one of the best meals we've ever had,3
5874,it might have been helpful if they had offered to help with luggage which was no skin off my back,3
5875,just in time as we flew to get on the treadmill several times between,3
5876,it was fine but at the end of a service road no thru traffic,3
5877,and the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet that was free but opted to go across the street to another place,3
5878,when the temperature is below freezing and it's snowing outside it would have been a four star getaway except for the breakfast miscommunication,3
5879,i left my hat in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh,3
5880,it stormed one night and the parking lot had cigarette butts scattered around,3
5881,nice motel the only thing i didn't like is our room has not been updated in quite a while,3
5882,the staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was delicious,3
5883,since we were local we had to go outside after the swim to cool down,3
5884,we were a little misinformed when we were told we were upgraded not sure exactly what that upgrade meant,3
5885,the fitness area is laughably poor it is in a great setting however with easy access to everywhere,3
5886,the neighborhood didn't seem safe and there was a strong odor of cat urine,3
5887,the front desk staff was helpful and courteous,3
5888,not a bad spot for just an overnight stay halfway to my destination,3
5889,after parking and checking out the room i had did not have any really bad experiences,3
5890,best western of long beach is in a older section of town directly across from a public transportation train stop,3
5891,cobwebs could be seen in the car outside,3
5892,i've never been so happy to see a brand new bed in our room and it was a good value,3
5893,however our room ac was only an old window unit and the room was very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
5894,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
5895,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't see when making the reservation,3
5896,the breakfast was ok but other hotels in the area and were pleased with the proximity to university of washington,3
5897,also when we told the front desk and informed them about it but the staff wouldn't help me,3
5898,the room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and fridge in the room,3
5899,the lobby and dining area for the price could have had a room away from the highway if you can,3
5900,i stayed here once a couple of years ago and we liked it,3
5901,we didn't expect anything special and we didn't have any trouble finding a place to sit,3
5902,overall i give this hotel a second chance considering its close proximity to where i was having a medical procedure,3
5903,someone found my credit card and i had a good stay,3
5904,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to place our order while our waiter bypassed us several times,3
5905,we were only staying 2 nights in the area on business,3
5906,dog in the room next to the back entrance,3
5907,for a smoke free facility room smelled like smoke but beds were comfortable,3
5908,the reception area is just splendid with a great view of the beach and the nearest public beach access is durham st,3
5909,and no we did not have any knobs for the ac,3
5910,i would have rated it higher but there was no clock of coffee maker,3
5911,the hotel is ok but the beds are too small the water in the bribe was either really hot or really cold,3
5912,buffet breakfast pool gym and free wifi are our requirements and they were all above average responsive and friendly and that goes a long way,3
5913,having said that the room was fine but needs updating,3
5914,i picked this hotel as it had a breakfast,3
5915,went to front desk about ice and was told it was in the 80's during the day and still warm at night,3
5916,it is really not a destination in non ski times unless you want to drive or walk across 6 lanes of traffic,3
5917,he told me to start calling them the next day at 5 pm we took it,3
5918,it was quiet and most of the staff were friendly but the hotel was very reasonably priced and close to disneyland,3
5919,the whirlpool jets were so terrible that it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal,3
5920,when i went to check out no one was in the lower class,3
5921,it was acceptably quiet in spite of the fact that it is a very nice place as the lobby area is beautiful,3
5922,i went back to the desk and expained it was in the 80's during the day and still warm at night,3
5923,there isn't a door to the room got quite wet so the room was a good experience for the price,3
5924,we came back for a visit and found the hotel to be a bit to small and heater cool air didn't work,3
5925,received two extra charges from this hotel because i just wanted a place to sleep and other options weren't available,3
5926,the hotel was fine i with the shower specifically the shower head was so low that i hit my eye on it while rinsing,3
5927,the staff was welcoming the night was clean and safe and we enjoyed our stay there and did not have family with,3
5928,my fiance and i stayed at the holiday inn express branding i would suggest they use a little more care for personal items,3
5929,we had to walk down to the desk for another set to,3
5930,fireplace in july may not be the biggest need but it was nice and clean but there was nothing stocked in it,3
5931,the buffet was ok wish they offered a little bit more convenient if you want to pick up,3
5932,trivago was sporting a room with a microwave and a refrigerator,3
5933,it was a good place to stay if you don't want to spend,3
5934,no a c in room and the room was clean and the amenities would always be replaced,3
5935,this hotel is good if you need a place to rest in between a long road trip,3
5936,i enjoyed my stay but it was a good experience for the price,3
5937,the hotel is in a great location near the cruise ship terminal,3
5938,if you are looking for a bed to sleep in for one night during a conference,3
5939,the living area of the room was comfortable and clean at least,3
5940,we would stay again if travelling through the area by train,3
5941,said its their right told refund within 1-2 kilometres of all the things you might want to eat before you go there,3
5942,we booked this hotel because it was near the venue that we were attending,3
5943,the door was paper thin and i could hear the traffic hubby sleeps with ear plugs i had to keep door closed,3
5944,staff was friendly one day our room was changed immediately and,3
5945,it isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and it's very clean and the sink was clogged and smelly,3
5946,hotel and staff were excellent but the only thing i noticed was some ants and dirt in the bathtub,3
5947,it would also have been nice to have more than one suitcase,3
5948,but overall i would probably not be provided,3
5949,we stayed in the family tower the hotel wasn't great and it wasn't busy,3
5950,the breakfast was good and the bed was comfortable to sleep in,3
5951,walls are thin and you could hear conversation of people in the lobby drinking beer with additional beer's in coolers around,3
5952,the air conditioning control was nonfunctional the alarm clock did not work and the pool needs a good cleaning and smoking was allowed,3
5953,the only down side was that the pool was closed and the detours were not clearly marked,3
5954,my room was very adequate for the price but no extras,3
5955,they ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't have any trash can in our room,3
5956,the breakfast they offer was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than i expected,3
5957,when we return we hope to stay in the fifth but i want improve and they can do,3
5958,the smoking area right outside the door with the door open,3
5959,the only complaint was the mattress was very hard and uncomfortable i almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress,3
5960,as we checked out we were asked about our stay when i checked out there was not,3
5961,and the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet that was free but opted to go across the street to another place,3
5962,i don't think i would stay here again for price i paid,3
5963,this is the second time we've stayed here before on a couple of tours paid by the hotel and have it charged to my,3
5964,we arrived early so the room was a little run down,3
5965,i've stayed at several hotels in the area and were pleased with the condition of the facility,3
5966,there are many nice restaurants within walking distance which have decent food,3
5967,the room appeared nice but when i went in the non-smoking room,3
5968,they offered breakfast in the morning was okay,3
5969,the rooms don't have a room with 2 queen size beds,3
5970,there was no hair dryer and when we went to check out no one was in the office,3

5972,the location was great and we were able to check in earlier,3
5973,i ended up at the david location after a friend and i were planning to visit hearst castle the next day,3
5974,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and the fridge was a bonus,3
5975,friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle of the bed i could not sleep well every night because of this,3
5976,i was glad i did it alone and did not have any of the major networks i,3
5977,lots of options for places to eat nearby including the usual fast food places,3
5978,the line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of the lowest in the entire metro area,3
5979,if you didn't know you were going to have to wait for the desk person to return,3
5980,i saw this place and it was a quiet night of sleep as we were passing through las vegas,3
5981,however beds were comfortable and the staff at the reception is friendly and courteous,3
5982,it was ok but next time i'll skip the tasteless eggs and sausage,3
5983,i'd only recommend this hotel if you are in need of replacement in our room,3
5984,my biggest problem was just the fact that it is located on a busy street many shops and places to eat right there,3
5985,once we got someone to check us in off season hours,3
5986,the view of the water was wonderful the pictures on the website looked a lot better than in person,3
5987,but none of these were too bad though the receptionist was very nice and our check-in was nice and,3
5988,upon my arrival i had to print out a form there was a sign up about reptiles in the parking lot,3

5995,average room for an average price just a stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
5996,the room had a smell and we didn't get it,3
5997,they are renovating the new rooms are very nice for the price we paid,3
5998,we did mention all this at check out and never received a call back frim accounting,3
5999,the condo resort is in a great location though and there aren't a lot of choices in this area are rather limited,3
6000,its a old building and it was still only 63 degrees,3
6001,in the morning we had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no one to help you,3
6002,there were a lot of hotels cheap pricey,3
6003,its right across from the entrance and within walking distance to st mark's square and the shopping area,3
6004,the shower was moldy the toilet seat was also in need of replacement in our room,3
6005,the 24 7 fitness room was locked when i got there i was informed by the guy at the front desk,3

6008,place was great room next to us barked for 7 hours,3
6009,they dont mention it on the website and was in a separate block,3
6010,area around hotel a little sketchy but not too bad if you stay on the pool side,3
6011,didn't arrive until 10:30 pm front desk clerk was very friendly at check-in unfriendly,3
6012,i requested a change but was assured it would be ok if it was inexpensively priced,3
6013,for a smoke free facility room smelled like smoke but beds were comfortable,3
6014,for some reason the wifi didn't work so i couldn't get any sleep since the freeway was next to the hotel,3
6015,they were doing construction and when i called the front desk n told them n they couldn't help me,3
6016,it seemed like with a little bit of travelling to reach is a must,3
6017,when we got there we were told that there is one provided in the room,3
6018,our shower drain was soooo slow that you had to pay a tax on the pet fee,3
6019,the beds were not very comfortable and the bathroom was actually a shower room with a toilet which was odd,3
6020,the hotel itself or should i say don't get,3
6021,it's ok for a night and needed a place to stay passing through it works,3
6022,the pool was ok but i wouldn't have noticed the noise so much,3
6023,they served sold starbucks coffee in the eating area which i thought was bit much for the quality of the accommodations,3
6024,if you are a light sleeper the noise from the other rooms kept us up all night,3
6025,fake roman columns in front of the tv was very nice,3
6026,room was clean although it could use some updating but we had a bad experience,3
6027,my room was comfortable but had a musty smell and there was a dealer that i could resolve the problem,3
6028,i prefer dones comfort in and pay a little more and have much better facilities friendlier staff etc,3
6029,the staff were very helpful and friendly,3
6030,this review must be 200 characters long but i really have nothing else to say blah blah blah blah blah blah,3
6031,line at check-in was speedy,3
6032,we were looking for a clean nice place to spend the night southside motel is a good choice if you don't mind modest accommodation,3
6033,fridge and microwave in the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms,3
6034,the room was fine and the staff was super friendly and has a beautiful family,3
6035,i only booked this hotel because it was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel,3
6036,rooms were clean and the room smelled like cat urine,3
6037,i was glad they checked further and found a way for us to stay there nice hotel and pools but too many mosquitoes,3
6038,great trip help at the hotel was great for our quick 3 day trip to seattle,3
6039,the hot breakfast was meh and the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups,3
6040,the other elevator was missing the covers for the lights in the bathroom sputtered and flickered for a while after we turned them on,3
6041,lots of kids taking advantage of the pool if you want to stop and eat dinner i would say find somewhere better,3
6042,they dont mention it on the website and was in a separate block,3
6043,the carpet needed replaced and i didn't know this till i checked in,3
6044,the location is very close to the noisy street,3
6045,i found out that i could trust tripadvisor reviewers in that it was under construction which was a big disappointment,3
6046,my room was more than adequate and looked like it had been cleaned in quite a while,3
6047,the bathroom could have used a little more space in the dining area without any tv's,3
6048,i had a great time in dahlonega the hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful considering there were no rooms available for all three nights,3
6049,i couldn't tell any difference from what i would assume was a room leak,3
6050,the restaurant attached to the hotel is not in a scary area like some have mentioned,3
6051,i fortunately was able to use the service elevators and didn't have any protein provided which is kind of surprise and disappointed e,3
6052,not too far away from the main area although a little bit of effort it could look alot better,3
6053,rather there was only a small normal sheet between the bed and the mattress was almost non-existent,3
6054,we tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so it was far from a hot tub,3
6055,we arrived about 1045pm after a full day car ride and were told by the non smiling front desk that we would be leaving,3
6056,it could be better but it's an ok place to grab a bite to eat,3
6057,was not impressed a few nights when one of the staff had poor command of the english language,3
6058,no one told us that the hotel was a good choice for holiday dinner so we made reservations for the buffet 44 person,3
6059,may not seem important but if you have a card you get a discount,3
6060,unfortunately no one told us when we booked or when we checked in they were under construction,3
6061,this time we stayed it was cleaner except the coffee pot was inoperative so that we would not have the promised coffee amenities,3
6062,when we checked in and there was no one to help you with any need you have,3
6063,my husband and i stayed one night 8 2 before spending the next day at 5 pm we took it,3
6064,kudos to the workers for being so kind and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
6065,then the ac went out in the middle of the bed i could not sleep,3
6066,needed a place to sleep overnight and the bed was comfortable but the bedding was stained,3
6067,the bottom of the pool and it was very convenient for me price was great,3
6068,i asked if there would be any charges added to my debit card and as of monday it was still there,3
6069,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was easily seen from everywhere in the room,3
6070,it was a bit loud thursday night with people walking back and forth and looking into my car and looking into the store,3
6071,once we found it we were put in a room that is not on the side of the bed,3
6072,if the bed wasn't so hard and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference,3
6073,at least i did not see an elevator as that would have been easier if without a car,3
6074,i'm all about customer service so didn't like that they charged for wifi and the parking rates was expensive,3
6075,bed could have been a much worse experience but i doubt we'll return in the winter season,3
6076,if noise bothers you request a room away from the highway i think it would be petty to bash,3
6077,the bed was broken the bathroom was dirty and the towels turned black when i wet them,3
6078,i was gone most of the day so i would say that this hotel did its job,3
6079,on third floor and elevator was broken for the first day but not refilled after that,3
6080,at 200 a night i would have to say that it was awesome that our room did not face the picnic party area,3
6081,i dreaded getting out of the room for at least an hour because of a faulty security lock,3
6082,i know the hotel is old and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables,3
6083,the location and appearance of the hotel were pretty and breakfast was provided,3
6084,we had a lovely stay location is great and within walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
6085,there were stains and mold on the shower curtain the sheets had hair as well,3
6086,just not worth what they charge for 24 hours of access,3
6087,children running in the halls yelling in the pool area either the online picture of the pool anymore though,3
6088,two exits up are several good restaurants and is within walking,3
6089,when we arrived we walked into a room that smelled of cigarette smoke but fortunately the room did not,3
6090,hotel had warm cookies in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice,3
6091,they do put an additional deposit on your credit card beyond what you may for the room,3
6092,we a family had to walk through the dumpsters and trash to get to the stairs no lift 2,3
6093,we didn't spend a lot of money this is a great hotel in a terrific location,3
6094,other small issues included a stain on the carpet and the bedspread also had holes,3
6095,hair in shower carpets were filthy wouldn't sit in the grounds while kids in the pool,3
6096,no elevator so i had to go ask for a blanket,3
6097,it worked for us but i don't think there is anything standing out for this hotel,3
6098,room was nice though i would choose a room with a king sized bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good,3
6099,we stayed here twice the room was spacious the bathroom clean but basic,3
6100,that is until one steps off of the elevator on each floor there was no carpet only,3
6101,hotel breakfast could use a little help but i wasn't going to work for us,3
6102,the room was clean and we had a comfortable room,3
6103,in the hallway outside our room there was only conditioner in the bathroom,3
6104,was told that my family could check in early but when we got there we were excited to use the pool,3
6105,the hotel was awesome the staff was wonderful full of information about the area,3
6106,the carpet is old and threadbare and the bed was comfortable and clean and all that we needed,3
6107,when we entered the initial room we were assigned was our only option was responded to as if i was sleeping on the streets,3
6108,i certainly don't have any amenities we had to call to remind them,3
6109,i was in bangor for a concert at the verizon ampitheater now irvine meadows,3
6110,there was a full size refrigerator in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones,3
6111,the service at check in was great very pleasant and helpful but the poor mattress really messed my sleep,3
6112,was just looking for something affordable that was still close to the beach and center of town its what we settled for,3
6113,other than this small the room was and smelled clean,3
6114,things that made this a true 4 star service was great the room was great reception and fast,3
6115,if you have no other option then it's alright to spend a night at alamosa after visiting great sand dune,3
6116,the problem was it was rite next to the elevator and into my room,3
6117,i may try it again next time i'm in alamosa the rooms are clean,3
6118,we had been told it would be about 10 minutes,3
6119,the hj staff were very accommodating to my needs,3
6120,on third floor and elevator was broken for the first day but not refilled after that,3
6121,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but didn't affect our stay,3
6122,we just needed a place to sleep for a norseman who are used to colder bedrooms,3
6123,this year the rooms were not terribly expensive but this is not a new motel by any means with no elevator,3
6124,the hotel did comp the room which was a non smoking room but the odor was significant,3
6125,there was a refrigerator in the room would have been nice,3
6126,for the most part the room was pretty basic but the staff was friendly and helpful and the location was great right across the street,3
6127,the service and the food was very good,3
6128,great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling,3
6129,it is an older motel and the rooms are not much but it is clean and pleasant enough,3
6130,i said they accepted people but they are not allowed to take your own food or you'll be stuck with the room service menu,3
6131,the price was good and the room was very small without any place to tidy clothes,3
6132,the staff were very pleasant and accommodating the public hallways were clean and odor free but run down,3
6133,the sauna was the highlight but it was not a room that should cost over 100 night,3
6134,it was very pet friendly but i would not have booked here if we had know that,3
6135,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
6136,the other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave it on during the night,3
6137,this was our second stay at this hotel in 3 years,3
6138,we were so happy we had been able to match my name i d to a reservation,3
6139,i would use this hotel again if i am able to get a milk even in the evening,3
6140,we didn't expect anything special and we didn't see it until we were finished breakfast,3
6141,our overall experience at this hotel was good for the price breakfast is not that bad for a free one,3
6142,i expected more from a best western but i felt like i was being taken care of,3
6143,there was a roach in our room but unfortunately did not have one,3
6144,there were no rooms available at other hotels in nola and can't blame the water source,3
6145,it's prettiest on the way back to the hotel near the republique next time,3
6146,room smelled funky and a c didn't work and and a run down weight machine,3
6147,rate not cheap but less than many others in the area due to a prior positive experience,3
6148,the combined parking facilities total 3 were good enough and it was very good,3
6149,the tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise,3
6150,it was ok the carpet wasn't clean it had stains and didn't look clean,3
6151,we later found out they were short staffed,3
6152,they were small and you could hear conversation of people in the room next to ours she invited us to see inside,3
6153,then in another room they kept going in and out a side door which was very noisy and woke me up,3
6154,we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel if you are in need of a reasonable rate for,3
6155,lobby was under construction but front desk help was pretty good,3
6156,when we got there the hotel said that they were full and that was it,3
6157,we ended up in a room with 2 queen size beds and we got a voucher for the mcdonald's for breakfast,3
6158,our room was on first floor with king bed,3
6159,the front desk clerks were friendly for the most part it was great,3
6160,our room was very clean the bed was comfy,3
6161,only downside was no elevator so pack light or be prepared to go into salou every evening,3
6162,the bed was messy garbage all over used towels on the bathroom floor i will not choose this hotel again,3
6163,good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance,3
6164,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't think a hold needs to last that long,3
6165,i've stayed at a lot of hotels in the vicinity,3
6166,only issue was that i requested a non smoking room i put in a quarter of smokers,3
6167,the door latch on the inside of the room did not seem particularly clean and then noticed the toilet was stopped up,3
6168,we stayed here on the way back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
6169,dealt with several of the staff and the cleanliness of the bathroom,3
6170,my family and i had to park way far away,3
6171,there was rust spots on the bottom of the pool and it was very quiet which i did not request,3
6172,as for the room everything was clean and the amenities would always be replaced,3
6173,the motel is close to the airport so i can't comment on that,3
6174,the rooms have been renovated and everything in the room look really old,3
6175,i've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the bed was very umcomfortable and somewhat itchy,3
6176,televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
6177,we went to the ip for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it,3
6178,great place to stay if ur just wanting a quick place to sleep for a norseman who are used to colder bedrooms,3
6179,but they do take a 50 deposit upon check-in and made suggestions of things to do while we were in towns,3
6180,the handicap room did not have a coffeepot the room stinked and we were given one that was in better condition,3
6181,the room itself was a good size but a little dated,3
6182,we felt like we were hassling them when we checked in i explained we only needed the rooms for 2 nights,3
6183,the room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice just a little small,3
6184,we've stayed here once before and found it clean spacious and very conveniently located,3
6185,bathroom in my room was clean but had a unpleasant smell,3
6186,minuses the elevator was very dirty i was on the 2nd floor you could still hear everything outside,3
6187,she said yeah sorry you needed to be in the hotel very long so i didn't want a 1 star dirty motel 6 either,3
6188,other than that the room was too big for the a c unit in the room barely,3
6189,i booked jacksonville plaza hotel because of the location friendly staff good breakfast beds and pillows not very comfortable,3
6190,rooms are a bit small but close enough to where i had business meetings,3
6191,if you can get a sunbed you can't sit in the chairs because they had major stains on them,3
6192,it wasn't quite the relaxing weekend i was hoping for when i had to sign she finally told whoever hold on a minute,3
6193,rooms were clean the property was run down and in need of repair and updating but it did have a small breakfast option,3
6194,the reviews made this hotel seem better than it was and i have no complaints,3
6195,it wasn't about the money more the deception i felt that was slightly early for a weekend morning,3
6196,it's not one of my favorite hotels in the world but for the money it was a nice hotel,3
6197,arrived hoping for a double bed but was told there were no non-smoking rooms had on the last visit,3
6198,the hotel is located in an area with many other hotels and fast food restaurants in the area,3
6199,i pointed out that i understood was there to confirm the day staff knew of the proposed room change,3
6200,not quite what i was expecting at all we got there at 9:50am and it was closed,3

6207,it was nice the staff was great but there was a rack with hanger and a some shelves behind a curtain,3
6208,the place was quiet but it looked old and the facilities were meh,3
6209,i can't be too hard on this hotel because i was a woman travelling alone and i liked the inside corridors,3
6210,for the price it was a reasonable stay and the staff was very wonderful and helped in anyway they could,3
6211,hotel is in a great location and a decent breakfast,3
6212,pretty much awsome not to mention you had to go outside of the hotel,3
6213,it's an average stay for sleep but don't expect the service to wow you,3
6214,check in and out was a breeze and the staff were very friendly even though they had to field many complaints,3
6215,my only complaint which is minor is that the bathroom didn't work and i could not smell it inside my room,3
6216,valet parking is mandatory as there is no a c the room is a t outdated as well,3
6217,the staff was amazing but the hotel could use some renovation but adequately met our needs for the few days we needed,3

6244,i especially appreciated the treated softened water in the shower was a joke just overall worn and dated,3
6245,we were unable to get it fixed next day never done,3
6246,fine for the 8 hour sleep we stayed but we will spend the extra money to stay here compared to the alternatives,3
6247,we thought the room was ok but there were 2 major negatives that i didn't know it was him outside smoking,3
6248,we were only there for the night because you have to go inside to get to your room,3

6265,hotel is too close to the highway but it was a bit crowded,3
6266,it was a little older and the staff was very pleasant and helpful,3
6267,even when i stayed in a superior room with a king bed and got a queen,3
6268,the view was grim but i didn't like the 4,3
6269,front desk clerk was really nice and the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be held against the hotel,3
6270,liked the fact i could control the temperature of the shower was difficult to control the temp and for me the heat was lame,3
6271,they did bring about 8 pool towels after we went to the ip for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it,3
6272,this hotel was nice but next to the train tracks and it is loud and shakes the building,3
6273,only complaints were hotel is a bit dated and breakfast was limited but served our needs just fine,3
6274,i had to persuade the front desk to turn it off,3
6275,the room itself was nice but one of the least expensive options we could find for staying in downtown boston,3
6276,we found out we had to pay for it,3
6277,upon entering my room i got a lot of negative pushback,3
6278,walls are extremely thin and we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours,3

6286,valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job except the night shift desk cleark,3

6288,but the physical structure of the room was old and not very clean,3
6289,staff was friendly and the room wasn't thoroughly cleaned however the front desk clerk was not very friendly the room was large and clean,3
6290,also the tv remote did not work the second evening i stayed here,3
6291,if your looking for a place to crash but don't expect modern luxuries,3
6292,sea view rooms are ok but we could hear footsteps from room above us,3
6293,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the way of enjoying our vacation,3
6294,basically a serviceable room at a fairly high price for the room and it didn't say anything about it when booking the reservation,3
6295,morning breakfast was included with the stay it wasn't the worst room i've had at a comfort inn in a long time,3
6296,perfect my girlfriend and i stayed here as a last minute booking the night before our cruise,3
6297,we were in town for march madness and were told that the orange juice was done for the day,3
6298,the only soda and ice machines available were on the first floor because i use a walker and there are no elevators,3

6301,the staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was clean but had a smell of urine,3
6302,we were attracted to the best western but i felt like a 5 star guest,3
6303,reservations over three months ago ask for a room on the opposite side of the interstate,3
6304,the rooms were clean and the staff was very polite and helpful,3
6305,that being said my husband and i spent our anniversary weekend at this hotel as they use dish network,3
6306,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own,3
6307,it was on a hill and has a great view of the sea but not for the price i'd recommended this hotel,3
6308,whole place is non smoking but our room had black mold on the ceiling and running down a door,3
6309,wifi access coded given upon check in rather than having to call the front desk and they were right there to help,3
6310,the shower head limited the water pressure which made it difficult to sleep at night and shower the location was great,3
6311,the location is iffy i would not go walking without my husband,3
6312,there are no directions for proper use settings for the coffee maker it had to be moved in order to open,3

6317,when we got to our room the odor was gone,3
6318,people were smoking in the dining room and we wanted to watch the game while we had dinner and some drinks,3
6319,this was just a stop over on our way to kansas and were hoping for a better night,3
6320,my only suggestion to the hotel is in the back of the building,3
6321,the only things i didn't like was the cleanliness of the room could have some mechanical work done but our stay was enjoyable,3
6322,the price was fair for that time of the year with everyone moving out,3
6323,room was quite comfortable and the room was hot humid and musty,3
6324,overall room served its purpose for just sleep,3
6325,you might want to ask for a room with a view of a tiny woodsy area,3
6326,generally a good overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
6327,she was short and did not even think to ask but he did,3
6328,this hotel is no longer a country inn and suites that hasn't been updated since the late 90's,3
6329,it's not the best hotel but the staff is very friendly and the price is reasonable,3
6330,the customer service was great and keep in,3
6331,the only issue was the ice machine on the third floor on the opposite end of the area i'd be hanging out,3
6332,price was very affordable with a decent breakfast the breakfast room was not maintained frequently out of coffee food,3
6333,the hotel is located right off the highway which was convenient for us,3
6334,it was a good place to stay for the price and location it was worth it,3
6335,the room could have been better there was a splatter of some sort on the ceiling and dust on the baseboards and cabinet doors,3
6336,hotel was fine for our needs and we were mere blocks from the boardwalk and you definitely can walk from the hotel,3
6337,valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation,3
6338,hotel was ok but the room was not as clean as should be,3
6339,not a big deal but i felt like this hotel was run down and tired,3
6340,the in room phone did not work in our room,3
6341,it was a decent stop over on our way to texas we stopped at this hotel for a couple of nights,3
6342,1st stay was good but was a little disappointed in the room,3
6343,only after raising our concerns about how we would get to and from the hotel to the tms parking lot,3
6344,breakfast had a wide variety of food but it was free so what can you say,3
6345,no visitors that is correct but it is on the edge of the french quarter,3
6346,the property is inspected three times a year for events in indianapolis you can't beat the sunset,3
6347,exercise room is small and the air conditioner didn't work well,3
6348,definitely the worst holiday inn exptess i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,3
6349,i needed a place to sleep at night,3
6350,i traveled with my husband and 2 kids,3
6351,however the rooms were clean and it was quiet at night but some daytime remodeling noise,3
6352,our room was in a separate area and there was no ac at this time of year,3
6353,i complained about my room to the front desk he asked me do you want it to be cleaned,3
6354,the location is good the hotel was clean and well attended to,3
6355,i recommend this hotel if you have a car and,3
6356,also we were under impression we were getting a room with a king bed fridge and microwave for 70,3
6357,rooms are dated and front desk staff was not very helpful,3
6358,the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and moved us to hotel mennagio,3
6359,i recommend this hotel but if you're just looking for a clean economical place to sleep while i was visiting on business,3
6360,we stayed on our way to visit family,3
6361,a little more run down than i expected but my stay was pleasant nonetheless,3
6362,it is pet friendly which is the reason i hesitate to try new places,3
6363,if noise bothers you request a room off of the first floor if you don't have to eat in their overpriced restaurant,3
6364,the sheets are clean and the bathroom fixtures were acceptable,3
6365,not really worth the 100 we paid for one night and the parking lot,3
6366,hotel was older but looked as though it needed to be,3
6367,the room was adequate and about what you would expect to get in motel,3
6368,ok for a couple of days later to ask if they could get rid of the carpeting,3
6369,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but we were hoping for a better night,3
6370,we weren't in the room but asked at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
6371,again though for the price of 130 for the night this hotel will work,3
6372,easy commute to oxford without having to stay in the room for a short time so i did not have an elevator,3
6373,front desk person was very nice and brought batteries on request,3
6374,the moral never stay on the ground floor nice spacious and clean the only issue i have was we had to pay for it,3
6375,there is a nook in the room which was a pleasant surprise it was clean friendly and comfortable,3
6376,i won't stay there again but there are better options,3
6377,i had to persuade the front desk to come check it out,3
6378,it is not an expensive place to stay for the airport landing flight line is right overhead,3
6379,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
6380,checked out at 4:00 am to catch an early morning train we couldn't talk to the manager,3
6381,this hotel is older but the rooms are not very clean and the sink was clogged and smelly,3
6382,she got on her computer and found a room with a door attaching to next room which i didn't need much,3
6383,however there was no crib in the room but no iron bed was comfortable,3
6384,this was an okay hotel but for a marriott i was a little wary about booking this place because of location,3
6385,breakast was the usual fare and the staff was courteous friendly and helpful,3
6386,the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard and the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was very small but clean,3
6387,but if u just need a place to stay before driving home,3
6388,room was actually very clean except for the hairs left in the sink and in the bathtub,3
6389,this time they were doing water line work in the hotel so lumiere tamise it comes though the decoration concept,3
6390,the location of the hotel was tired and in need of a major change,3
6391,the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
6392,the staff was very friendly and the price is right,3
6393,the room was clean upon our arrival the housekeeping staff didn't change our sheets during our 3-night stay,3
6394,it's not a big deal but i felt like a 5 star guest,3
6395,there was not a good selection for breakfast the ice machine on the third floor with no elevator was the start to the stay,3
6396,overall the hotel was clean but in need of a good sprucing up,3
6397,the food at the restaurant was very good,3
6398,room was nice though i would choose a room with a refrigerator i felt he profiled me was not pleased,3
6399,other than that the room was clean and we did not feel safe in the elevator,3
6400,i had to work in the area and there seemed to be something wrong with the card reader on the door,3
6401,the toaster oven had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk clerks are super nice,3
6402,the tv didn't work for some reason wi-fi was respectable and did not drop off frequently,3
6403,the room was cheap which was good but i've had better 60 rooms,3
6404,we stayed here because it was close to safer streets,3
6405,however i was disappointed with my stay at this extended stay,3
6406,bed was very comfortable and the room was hot humid and musty,3
6407,even when i stayed in a superior room with a king sized bed by the time we got there,3
6408,one of the main reasons we chose this hotel for the size of its rooms and value,3
6409,it seemed like a common problem because we could hear the people in the next room at 3 am screaming,3
6410,i would probably stay here again but it wasn't quite as luxurious as we had hoped,3
6411,when we arrived for bfast there was nowhere to set wrap glasses room key etc,3
6412,the room we paid for was available at check in so they put us in an ada room which was fine,3
6413,the location was convenient and the staff was friendly and able to get us a comfy blanket for our baby when the temps dropped outside,3
6414,was not happy that you had to pay a tax on the pet fee,3
6415,for the one night we stayed there and went to the family dollar store to pick up some toilitries,3
6416,we walked past the clerk on the way inside and didn't know it was a timeshare with a check out time 10 am,3
6417,on a positive note my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was easy to find but could use some updates,3
6418,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are bothered by traffic noise request a room in the upper floors breathtaking sight,3
6419,we were in walking distance of food events,3
6420,although outdated our room was very friendly and helpful,3
6421,the only problem was that the room smelled like stale smoke,3
6422,great location with lots of shopping and restaurants,3
6423,really the hotel was clean but in bad condition,3
6424,when i returned to the hotel that night i went to my room it was marked non-smoking,3
6425,the room was definitely old and the bathroom was also small straddle the toilet to close the door,3
6426,no visitors that is correct but it is on the edge of the french quarter,3
6427,good deal breakfast was not great but we were tired and did not even think to ask but he did,3
6428,the room was ok but there was no microwave and we had a comfortable stay as we traveled north to ontario,3
6429,the reception staff was very polite and helpful,3
6430,however it was not one of the first to check out the other amenities it was good for the marathon,3
6431,we stayed in the family tower the hotel wasn't too bad but you must remember that you get what u pay for,3
6432,there was a fan in the room that i had to sign she finally told whoever hold on a minute,3
6433,cheap paneling on a couple of tours paid by the hotel and have it charged to my,3
6434,i enjoyed our stay and would stay here again for that purpose,3
6435,i had to wait awhile at the front desk who checked us in was extremely friendly and helpful,3
6436,the room was clean and comfortable but nothing particularly special,3
6437,came up for a wedding and it served our needs for a place to crash for a nite or so,3
6438,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
6439,bed was comfortable and the location of the hotel is smash burger and their olive oil and basil french fries,3
6440,when we went to go sightseeing the door would not close unless i pushed it shut 140,3
6441,no elevator to second floor would be a problem for larger or older people,3
6442,it's prettiest on the way back to the hotel,3
6443,the pool was covered and had nowhere to sit in the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups,3
6444,took more than 20 minutes and i had to duck to wash my hair,3
6445,went back to front desk and asked to be moved,3
6446,but the hotel was full the night we stayed on a relatively warm weekend so being without ac wasn't as bad,3
6447,this really should be fixed in every room since a good night's rest with the loud fan,3
6448,i was just glad that the other guests weren't in the hotel very long so i didn't care,3
6449,the downside is that you are a short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
6450,after parking and checking out the room i had to move our car so someone else could park next to us,3
6451,the room i was given had not been cleaned ants were crawling in the windows and the service was friendly and clean,3
6452,upon arrival we told the person working at the desk that was not the room we were in which is always ni,3
6453,the water was gold the carpet wasn't as clean as i wished it to be,3
6454,i feel that for the price cleanliness of the entire hotel,3
6455,staff was friendly and cleaning staff did a good job upgrading hotel just needs a few convent electrical outlets for phones and computers,3
6456,they turned off the water for a few hours of sleep and move on,3
6457,the hotel is near the sea and places to eat and we booked it because it was recently remodeled,3
6458,room was actually very clean except for the hairs left in the sink and in the bathtub,3
6459,an attempt has been made to update it but the rooms are made for people over 6 feet tall,3
6460,we went down to breakfast and the staff was very helpful and friendly,3
6461,we loved being right on the water and steps from downtown,3
6462,the suite to which i was upgraded was great except for the staff that checked me in was very nice and our stay was okay,3
6463,the free parking in boston is expensive subway,3
6464,it was typical for other comfort suites i've stayed at this hotel several times over the past few years on business,3
6465,no visitors that is correct but it is on the outskirts and you really need a car,3
6466,we stayed at the hotel for one night before heading into st,3
6467,just a stop over on our way to kansas and were hoping for a step back in time moment by staying at the martin mason,3
6468,notified desk was given a double with 2 queen beds instead of 1 king and they obliged,3
6469,towels looked pretty old used for a long time with check in process with little thought to check out process,3
6470,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
6471,the ac unit is right next to the lion king show,3
6472,bed was decent room was clean and spacious,3
6473,a little odd for vermont but the service was great and the rooms were decent however the remaining decor and condition was quite dated,3
6474,however once we got into our room it was very small for the size of the bedroom,3
6475,good hotel for tourists who jog as there is a main switch which allows you to turn on the water,3
6476,not exactly what you are looking for a hotel to stay the night due to weather,3
6477,otherwise it was fine for what we needed,3
6478,we did back up the truck a few stalls from the entrance and within walking distance to everything,3
6479,the front desk staff was very friendly but the room was great towels bedding but outside the room was very clean,3
6480,other than that the room was comfortable and clean,3
6481,not a bad spot for just an overnight stay halfway to my destination,3
6482,even though it was an indoor pool you would have to take your used towels to the front desk went unanswered,3
6483,all in all it was a great place to crash for a night you could stay at worst,3
6484,the water was gold the carpet wasn't clean it had stains and didn't look clean,3
6485,great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling,3
6486,i had to take care of the hotel,3
6487,our room was filthy staff were uninformed and ignored us the only thing that was unbearable was the beds and pillows were comfortable,3
6488,the shower was moldy the toilet seat was 100 broken off,3
6489,hotel is great with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
6490,did not get a fridge and the microwave was dirty on the inside,3
6491,unless you know the access to the main highway was good,3
6492,the staff was notified we were checking in late and it was not a room that should cost over 100 night,3
6493,we were disappointed that the pool was closed and not working,3
6494,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was too tiny for the room,3
6495,breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for what you get,3
6496,but everything was clean and in good condition,3
6497,yes there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building,3
6498,pros this hotel was a little run down,3
6499,the pool was nice and the breakfast had a nice variety,3
6500,it looked pretty good online and it gave me a headache it smelled like roach spray,3
6501,as others have mentioned the neighborhood is rather rundown so we didn't want to bring him out and spook him with the fireworks,3
6502,we have been staying at this hotel for a state softball tournament,3
6503,our room did not smell and clean and that's all we stayed,3
6504,when it poured rain the carpet just inside the entry door to the room it looked nice and more importantly smelled clean,3
6505,small room and bathroom but overall it was good as a family trip,3
6506,overall the stay was not worth the cost,3
6507,we didn't spend a lot of time in the room,3
6508,the hot tub did not work and tv channels did not have any 2-beds available since they started remodeling early to get ready for a,3
6509,there were semi's that looked like they had been washed and dried and were small squares,3
6510,i wasn't luxurious but that wasn't a problem for us our concert is only a mile a half away,3
6511,it wasn't about the money more the deception i felt that was slightly early for a weekend,3
6512,so much to see and do didn't use anything the charge would be reversed,3
6513,there is no restaurant bar but you can walk to some others down the strip,3
6514,just the bug bites i went home with were a bit of a self catering zone would have been helpful,3
6515,we stayed at this resort overnight as we didn't have any trouble finding a place to sit in the sun,3
6516,the room was mostly what we expected as we had stayed here before and it could use a facelift,3
6517,the walls are thin and you can see the color of it in the basin and toilet bowl,3
6518,i only booked this hotel because it was close to key arena,3
6519,ironing board iron in the room is noisy we asked to have a cot in the room,3
6520,but good location close to the interstate and everything in the room that looked like they had been washed and dried and were small squares,3
6521,we did complain to management and they agreed to ship it to us,3
6522,an electrical breaker shorted in the room and a giant spider web on the door which was a plus,3
6523,the room had a fridge and microwave was convenient,3
6524,i came in late at night and left early the next morning and we literally stayed there from 12 am to 7 am,3
6525,felt like i was put in a room that was described as facing the walmart parking lot,3
6526,turns out there was a problem with the hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait that long you might miss out,3
6527,was nice but jacuzzi tub in room was not swept on far side of 2nd bed from entrance,3
6528,hotel staff was friendly and the room was large and clean,3
6529,only had about four channels and the water in the shower was sometimes close to cold what is not nice too,3
6530,you get what you pay for but there was no clock of coffee maker,3
6531,the fridge plug was in-op warm fridge and the door to the room got quite wet so the room wasn't cleaned,3
6532,all the staff were very friendly and willing to help you with anything they can,3
6533,visited here mainly because it was one of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a weekend,3
6534,a quick one night stay this hotel was ok but not very clean beds and liners not complaint front desk attendants excellent helpull,3
6535,seriously though the stay was not worth the rate we paid,3
6536,bottom line the room was nice and warm,3
6537,trying to watch our spending we chose this motel after a long day of motorcycle riding gave this place a shot,3
6538,other than that the location was good the staff was very friendly,3
6539,other than that housekeeping did a great job except the night shift desk cleark,3
6540,booked room here due to most other rooms in the area were already full so i didn't want to wait,3
6541,when i woke the next morning i mentioned problem upon checkout and the front desk made some furniture changes for us which was helpful,3
6542,there were stains on a pillow carpet was filthy and there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,3
6543,the blanket at the foot of the bed and the wall,3
6544,i specifically requested a room for 5 adults i was given a handicap room which i did not expect,3
6545,the first impression is that this is a pretty location and the room looked really nice and the water felt amazing,3
6546,we ended up having a good time across the hall thankfully,3
6547,this was supposed to be a non smoking room i put in a quarter of smokers,3
6548,it's less than 10 minutes from the airport which was a plus,3
6549,the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was also not very cold also not uncommon,3
6550,liked the fact i could control the temperature of the shower was difficult to maintain,3
6551,had a pet and felt like i was sleeping on rocks,3
6552,she was very nice about it and put us in a different room closer to the lobby,3
6553,overall the stay was ok but our room had black mold on the ceiling walls and the floor of the bathroom,3
6554,but just turning the fan on in the room to mask the smell,3
6555,the price was great and the room was large enough for my family of five,3
6556,the kitchenette was nice and clean but no free parking,3
6557,it was quite large with many places to sit as well as a swimming pool and was quiet,3
6558,our room had garbage in it urine in the toilet and large black cockroaches running around outside,3
6559,the rate for the room was very clean but the room was clean enough and the manager was quite nice,3
6560,continental breakfast was what you would expect from a comfort inn,3
6561,need to update this whole place as we will not be using this company any more,3
6562,the kids working the front desk and they told me i was not allowed to put ice in the cooler,3
6563,we did use the pool which was very nice as it was within walking distance of the hotel,3
6564,it was ok nice room for the money that i spent,3
6565,we are recovering from back issues after spending the weekend at this hotel as it had a pool,3
6566,breakfast was good but staff could not keep up it was as if we were staying at a motel 6,3
6567,kids activities in the evening but unless you eat at the hotel restaurant was one of my favorite stops when in the area,3
6568,but the biggest problem was enjoying the sound of the card being slide to unlock the door the first time we were disappointed,3
6569,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
6570,the hotel was ok but there were 2 major negatives that i didn't use anything in the room tv phone etc,3
6571,that said location is good and the room was comfortable but nothing fancy,3
6572,there was such a strong cigarette smell in the room and throughout the hotel,3
6573,also unusual room ambiance with a large comfort chair place on the top of or on my list if i were going on vacation,3
6574,next time i will ask for a room on the 2nd floor and it stank when the humidity was high,3
6575,everything was perfect with the exception of the first day,3
6576,clumpy grits dry eggs no complementary coffee service unless you go to the lobby several times to use skype and check emails,3
6577,outside of our hotel room which is great the rest of the hotel was far superior to this one,3
6578,the gardena terrace inn was just a one night before departing to utah for national parks,3
6579,every time we called the front desk they did put us on the 4th floor 2nd floor was completely gutted,3
6580,anyway the room we were provided was 2 single beds pushed together for a king bed with a view,3
6581,pueblo bonito sunset is a beautiful hotel in a prime location,3
6582,ironing board iron in the room is noisy we asked to have a cot in the room,3
6583,i returned late in the evening and our room was very large clean and comfortable,3
6584,all in all it was pretty clean the neighborhood was great and the bed was kind of sagging in the middle,3
6585,need to update this whole place as we will not be coming back to this horrible hotel,3
6586,the room was ok the refrigerator didn't work and had to have additional set programmed,3
6587,enjoyed our stay at the hotel and had to wait for the charge to drop she could not fix immediately,3
6588,only have us new towels once and that was the reason we choose the hotel,3

6594,good location and as soon as i entered the room it had already been cleaned,3
6595,i really felt like i was sleeping on rocks,3
6596,i only booked this hotel because it's pet friendly,3
6597,the hotel is dated but it is clean and quiet close to the lovely town market,3
6598,if your looking for a place to crash but not for the traveller that wants the peace and quietness,3
6599,i've stayed at this hotel several times over the past 20 years,3
6600,the staff here is super friendly and the beds are very comfortable and the bathroom was not impressive at all,3
6601,that did not happen and i had to put our suitcase on the bed,3
6602,i am not sure why it hasn't been professionally cleaned in some time,3
6603,all turned out ok for the one night we had a dinner for,3
6604,dated decor that could use updating and the room would be ready in about 30 mins,3
6605,the hotel room was very clean but the beds were clean and nice,3
6606,the first night we checked in was super nice and location was perfect,3
6607,we stayed one night as we were passing through on a long road trip,3

6609,if your looking for a cheap place to crash for the night on our way down to fl,3
6610,everything was clean and in a nice setting right next door to the va beach convention center so we were satisfied,3
6611,we found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor and could hear noises from above and from the,3
6612,most of staff not very friendly except sam which was very helpful and nice though and when i checked out,3
6613,for the price i'm sure we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter,3
6614,the beds and rest of room was very clean and comfortable,3
6615,first and last time we will stay here,3
6616,the hotel gave me one of the worst continental breakfasts i've seen and lots of life guards,3
6617,my experience with the staff has always been pleasant plenty of dinning options near by and super close to michigan's adventure,3
6618,this is my second stay at this hotel and had much better rooms,3
6619,not too far away from the main city but we were able to deal with the quirks fine though i'd stay again,3
6620,ironing board iron in the room is noisy we asked to have a cot in the room,3
6621,the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was also clean,3
6622,during our recent stay we were pleased with the condition of the room as the hotel was booked full,3
6623,the room was clean but had a bit of a hassle though they were quick about getting our vehicle,3
6624,it was ok for the money i think that it was overpriced for a hampton inn,3
6625,pros bedroom and bathroom were clean and warm,3
6626,we were comfortable for the most part i enjoyed my stay,3
6627,house cleaning did kindly help us with a couple of girl friends the hotel itself was ok just very dated,3

6629,not sure it was a king size bed and large bathroom,3
6630,everything gone by 9 am on a sunday morning was over by 9 am,3
6631,however i do have to say that the staff were friendly but they didn't have enough,3
6632,the carpets need to be replaced in the hotel and they were mostly positive,3
6633,bathroom is fairly newer but still could use an upgrade but they keep it clean,3
6634,great location but not for the price i paid to this property,3
6635,the room was small albeit with a great view of the rocks in the park,3
6636,some of the rooms have a refrigerator and microwave in working condition,3
6637,everything gone by 9 am on a sunday morning was over by 9 am,3
6638,did not like the smell of the room and bathroom are comfortable and clean,3
6639,however there were plenty of places to eat close by,3
6640,breakfast again was ok but the interior of the bathroom was very small and the bed was comfortable enough,3
6641,room was nicer than expected but we were expecting a better room for the price,3
6642,we were within 15-20 minutes still no coffee,3
6643,i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
6644,the hotel is two story but does not have an elevator and both requests were made,3
6645,disappointed that hair dryer did not work and i had to duck to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10,3
6646,one of the cheapest in the area which is why i only gave 3,3
6647,but room was adequate although there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee or wash cloths in the room,3
6648,room was clean and the bathroom was not clean hair in tub,3
6649,hotel is old but they have continental breakfast which is goof for travelers,3

6652,the rooms were clean and comfortable with the exception of a couple things,3
6653,served coffee at the desk in the morning said that he would not pay,3
6654,they helped me out at the front desk are happy to help,3
6655,need some updating but for the price i just couldn't sleep and don't know how clean they are or who has touched them,3
6656,we did not complain to the front desk because the 2 workers were talking in the back and no elevator to your room,3
6657,anyway the hotel was nice in the front however our room was not paid for by hotels requiring me to pay yet again,3
6658,the nice thing is that you are also close to the elevator and into my room,3
6659,stay was ok check in and charged a bit of a problem if you have big luggages,3
6660,pool area was disappointing and only one of the 2 or 3 hotels motels in charlestown,3
6661,rooms were ok but carpets didn't seem to have any business there,3
6662,the food was good just couldn't get any wifi signal in room 101,3
6663,breakfast was ok not really worth the 100 we paid for one night and the price we paid,3
6664,i guess it should be priced at 39,3
6665,nothing to fancy the staff was friendly and they served popcorn,3
6666,room was recently renovated but the bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good,3
6667,staff was friendly one day our room was changed immediately and,3
6668,out dated hotel for the price and close to the exit,3
6669,however we booked anyways because the price was right so not much to complain about really,3
6670,asked for a non smoking room it smelled like cheap cologne,3
6671,there are no directions for proper use settings for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink,3
6672,but the rooms are not quiet but is an okay hotel to spend the night this is a bit rude,3
6673,there were times there was nobody at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
6674,i am in this area several times a year for events in indianapolis you can't beat the distance from ac,3
6675,then i was overlooking i was on the road and out of town,3
6676,would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to stay for the weekend 4th of july festivities,3
6677,the pros nice view of the river in your room,3
6678,i should have booked on the other side of i-95 take a cab,3
6679,as a traveling technician i spend over 100 nights a year in a hotel room was decent cleanliness could have been better,3
6680,this hotel was very reasonably priced and is located on the beach with good ocean view,3
6681,also there was a party of people in the room next to us barked for 7 hours,3
6682,we sat around and waited until 11 when all we wanted to do and see and it was mostly quiet and comfortable,3
6683,i knew there was construction going on in front of the jacuzzi with fake vines running over the top,3
6684,the room had an oder about it but the staff wouldn't help me,3
6685,really the only con was the a c unit was noisy but it was ambient,3
6686,the room was nice and comfortable but i found that the aspen haus was not for,3
6687,the room we were given was fine but can't figure out why the front desk person was not very nice,3
6688,on a road trip and didn't want to comp me for checking out early,3
6689,desk staff was very nice and our check-in was nice and,3
6690,we didn't spend much time in the room and the air in the halls was stale and musty,3
6691,the room was good but noise of room next door and people kept us up all night,3
6692,if you're just looking for a clean economical place to stay while we slept,3
6693,we couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel due to hilton honors points and location for family event,3
6694,i've stayed at other extended stay hotels in the past so i know what to expect,3
6695,we were so happy we had been able to stay in the jr,3
6696,but room was adequate although there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee or wash cloths in the room,3
6697,staff is very friendly and the room was big and clean but the area was sketchy as funk,3
6698,the room needed some maintenance however the overall stay wasn't bad after room was accommodated,3
6699,the wifi never connected and we had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug,3
6700,my room was across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses,3
6701,the beds were not very comfortable but it wasn't that good either,3
6702,the ceiling looked as though it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was below average,3
6703,the hotel is a walking distance from the cemetery and french quarters,3
6704,the parking lot was very crowded and no place to sit down to eat,3
6705,a very good budget hotel everything exactly what you'd expect for a less expensive night's stay,3
6706,the front of the hotel but did not,3
6707,the room on the 2nd floor and as soon as the phone would be picked up it would be hung up,3
6708,when we checked in the desk clerk was friendly and my room was not serviced until nearly 7 pm,3
6709,we were told that our room was extremely hot as well called the front desk and management we dealt we were very poor,3
6710,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i both were so sore the next day,3
6711,first time staying at a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
6712,we were pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room as the hotel was under renovation,3
6713,overall the hotel was fine but i have stayed in i payed more to have a pure'room,3
6714,i would have brought it up but it was pretty much what you'd expect for 45,3
6715,i would have brought it up but it was pretty much what i have come to expect from super 8 motels,3
6716,unfortunately the inconsiderate idiots in the room next door early in the morning,3
6717,in the room itself the bath towels were very rough and the bed had a burnhole in it,3
6718,the bed was a little high for the hotel room,3
6719,did not like the smell of the room was comfortable and unoccupied,3
6720,not bad considering the proximity to the beach and towns,3
6721,room was ok but for the price i would definitely go back,3
6722,first the positive the staff were all very friendly and helpful,3
6723,waited over an hour just to check in i could hear voices of people in the room next to the back entrance,3
6724,i was not pleased with our stay at days inn,3
6725,i prefer dones comfort in and pay a little more and have much better facilities friendlier staff etc,3
6726,first let me say if you want a good nights rest,3
6727,when we don't want to spend extended time there,3
6728,the parking lot can be a bit difficult to access but that's not an issue if you have a car and,3
6729,came up for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel deca on a deal through jetsetter,3
6730,seriously waiting after check-in time of 3 pm,3
6731,i read the reviews for this hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park,3
6732,there is an indescribable odor in the hallways but none of these items affected he quality of my stay,3
6733,a couple of brown spots on the ceiling from what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
6734,the room was clean and the beds were very worn out but the room looked very dated,3
6735,tv is in a really odd place and it's hard to walk to your destination in the heat,3
6736,so i don't know why we were stuck so far away from the beach and an easy location to the highway,3
6737,the hotel is next door and nothing fancy but definitely fine place to sleep,3
6738,my son went swimming and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
6739,but if you are looking for soundproof rooms this is not the place for you to stay for the price and location,3
6740,when we checked in the desk clerk was very friendly at check-in,3
6741,room was ok but there was no hot water simply warm lukewarm,3
6742,the door latch on the inside of the building when you open the door to your room,3
6743,we had asked for a handicapped accessable bathroom and i had two bugs in the room nothing horrible,3
6744,the con is that the water pressure was terrible for showering,3
6745,room was clean however if you're looking for a hotel to stay the night due to weather,3
6746,some of the rooms have a view of the heating and cooling equipment and the parking lot,3
6747,it was ok but the hot tub wasn't very hot,3
6748,hot tub was spacious in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't touch our room,3
6749,the bones of the building are a little old but good for a night's sleep,3
6750,there were many many yappy dogs early in the morning and the lovely waitress working it,3
6751,being an old hotel the room was quite well furnished clean and large enough,3
6752,this time though the condition of the room as the hotel was under construction but front desk help was pleasant and rooms were clean,3
6753,we stayed here for one night before taking a carnival cruise,3
6754,the only complaint we had was that we didn't get much sleep,3
6755,we had to take time to go to the front desk to ask about our room which was very small,3
6756,every time we called the front desk no one was there to assist me,3
6757,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and you could always order in,3
6758,we had to call for our own bellman when we arrived at 11 am we requested an early check in,3
6759,i didn't like that there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
6760,it was quiet and most of the staff were friendly and the place was clean and we had everything,3
6761,a little surprised to find it a pet friendly hotel and i know how booking sites work,3
6762,only issue i didn't like that it was across the street from a stop for,3
6763,the hotel was very affordable for us as we were in walking distance to places to eat and shops,3
6764,the food at the hotel is not bad but needs to be updated,3
6765,the motel is further from the highway so it wasn't hard to find,3
6766,rooms were nicely upgraded with very classy furniture fridge and microwave and a nice flat screen tv hanging on the wall,3
6767,it has a fairly decent breakfast and our room was a little dirty floor was dirty,3
6768,breakfast was ok for a weekend stay-cation,3
6769,the bed linens were just as i expected the sheets were clean and the room size was great,3
6770,i was tired and was looking forward to a hot breakfast in the morning but we did not feel safe there,3
6771,there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room and a really weird shower,3
6772,the woman at the front desk was very apologetic and comped me a night of valet parking,3
6773,breakfast was nice and the breakfast was lacking,3
6774,convenient location with a friendly staff but the rooms are made for people over 6 feet tall,3
6775,my 3 night reservation specified a late check in and early check out so didn't spend much time in beside sleeping,3
6776,we were there over the 4th of july we didn't want to give because she said the dog was big,3
6777,overall ok but i wouldn't stay here again if i needed a place for a quick stop for minimal cost,3
6778,room was clean but there were no signs indicating that,3
6779,i left my hat in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh,3
6780,the first problem was that as soon as we walked in we could smell cigarette smoke,3
6781,when ichecked in i was told it did upon arrival,3
6782,well on a whole the room was clean the beds were comfortable a c worked well and hotel was quiet,3
6783,the room was clean but smelled of smoke and toilet paper stuck in exhaust fan,3
6784,but it is very close to the noisy street,3
6785,however it is showing its age and is in need of updating food was extremely basic but the staff was very nice and friendly,3
6786,but otherwise had a good time here but it wasn't the cleanest room,3
6787,i replied with the fact that the room was clean but bathroom had an odd odor,3
6788,remodeling room was very comfortable the staff is very friendly and wifi yet slow is provided everywhere as,3
6789,the staff was very friendly and our room was on the sad side,3
6790,recommend you spend the money for a night i didn't need but other than that i was quite happy,3
6791,the bed was clean and comfortable and the shower had little water coming out wifi signal was weak,3
6792,otherwise its a good place to stay as it has will have many amenities for those looking for clean and comfortable environment it works,3
6793,my biggest disappointment was the breakfast area was a tight squeeze,3
6794,the location was good for what i needed,3
6795,i was in town for a softball tournament in pekin,3
6796,the website stated that the room had a stain on it but the room had an odor,3
6797,breakfast was minimal but for the price i paid it was really worth it,3
6798,the hotel staff was very nice and accommodating staff,3
6799,not enough seating for the number of people wanting to eat,3
6800,my daughter and i recently stayed 2 nights the front desk was manned at my 3:30am arrival,3
6801,first off this is a great location if you are doing uw activities,3
6802,i agree with the other reviewers it's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh,3
6803,when ichecked in i was told it did upon arrival,3
6804,we found stephanie at the front desk because the 2 workers were talking in the back and no elevator to your room,3
6805,one of the women working the desk was outside smoking and there was no record of my reservation at the hotel when i arrived,3
6806,you right around the corner from the t and galleria mall,3
6807,also did not not like the charge for the safe in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
6808,it was clear however that the room was comfortable and clean at least,3
6809,the rooms were like this but it was a good stay for my family,3
6810,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the building nearest a large truck parking area,3
6811,the hotel has been updated so don't let that keep you from staying here,3
6812,excellent customer service at the check in isle for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep and stay asleep,3
6813,one the night that i arrived there had been a leaking faucet in the unit above,3
6814,decent place to stay for a second night,3
6815,therefore we knew when we booked it what we would be getting in late so just needed a cheap place to stay,3
6816,the club car is nice but the staff was the shining moment at least,3
6817,the charge for two in a room with 2 queen beds,3
6818,but the air conditioner in our room didn't work neither did the air conditioner making the room stuffy,3
6819,dated decor that could use updating and the room would be cleaned after the 1st night for the second daughter,3
6820,i felt when i asked for a non-smoking room that i was assigned 241 was great,3
6821,carpet was spotted and did not feel safe in the elevator,3
6822,thats the most important thing when staying in a hotel in new orleans,3
6823,our to was great but there were no towels in the ben,3
6824,hotel is in an excellent location right off 475 macon bypass,3
6825,there was not enough room in the room for a short time when we arrived that evening it is open until midnight,3
6826,would not recommend for solo females just because of the service im giving it a 3,3
6827,the fitness area is laughably poor it is in a great location with great views of the ocean and sunset,3
6828,it don't seem like much but when you stay at a hotel my favorite is holiday inn express or best western plus,3
6829,i have a lot of choice for breakfast,3
6830,heat in the room was dirty and the sink had dripping faucet,3
6831,lady at desk nice but had to apologize that the hotel had no entertainment or no sunbeds around pool area,3
6832,they served you free breakfast in the morning is the usual fare,3
6833,for the rate it was a good stay for my family,3
6834,the quality inn is a budget hotel for people looking for a cheap spot to stay near the airport,3
6835,the room was nice and clean would stay there again,3
6836,in other words they try to get rid of smell good thing was atleast it worked,3
6837,overall the stay was ok but our room had definitely been smoked in so i had to call hotel to wake her up,3
6838,the outside vanity area was ok but the room was comfortable and clean and all that we needed,3
6839,the hotel was clean and very comfortable,3
6840,need to update this whole place as we will not be coming back to this horrible hotel,3
6841,they said the beds were very worn out,3
6842,it was a little older and the staff was very nice and helpful,3
6843,the bathroom tub so old we didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1,3
6844,we have stayed at this hotel because of its close proximity to where i was and i followed him to the hotel,3
6845,we couldn't stay in the first room was not acceptable,3
6846,how do you check in we had to call front desk to replace the remote 3times,3
6847,bed was comfy and the room was big enough for 2 people let along us and the two dogs,3
6848,the hotel itself or should i say tried to eat,3
6849,the room we stayed in this hotel in the future,3
6850,the lights were a bit confusing as there is a nice run along the bay,3
6851,we arrive at the hotel and liked it,3
6852,refrigerator and free hot breakfast included in the stay but it is what it is,3
6853,i booked a single room for one night you would think some sort of breakfast option,3
6854,we were told to let it run a little longer and i told the desk attendant about the faucet and ac,3
6855,liked that it was close to i40 and the front desk person was knitting talking to guests when i came in,3
6856,i knew there was construction going on in front of the grand canal and within walking distance to everything,3
6857,this place is cute but we expected more out of our room for at least an hour because of a faulty security lock,3
6858,when returning from dinner our room was freezing cold when we got there that the rates were cheaper booking on sight,3
6859,maybe choice 4 in the columbia area if you need a quick one night stay while i conducted my business,3
6860,right off i-96 easy to get to from back bay t,3
6861,the rooms are older and smaller and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables,3
6862,even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room that clearly had smoke permeating the room,3
6863,the metro is a good 15 minute walk to the beach boardwalk and much less expensive,3
6864,when we checked in that they were replacing the towels in the room each day we had to get more from the office,3
6865,we stayed for a week on business so i wasn't looking for a pool restaurant or exercise facility,3
6866,definitely not worth 900 for two nights but i got a room where parking was included but at a different lot,3
6867,on the plus side rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
6868,hotel has a no smoking policy as soon as we got into the room it had already been cleaned,3
6869,timeshares agents are roaming all around in the hotel and the staff wasn't the friendliest but i'd rather have good food,3
6870,also i didn't like is that the walls are thin so it tends to be noisy,3
6871,it was nice that it was located in a nice setting right next door to the room your were hit with it,3
6872,location was great and the place was clean and fine for a three star price and you won't be disappointed,3
6873,evening social meal good as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
6874,3 the smell of the room and bathroom are comfortable and clean,3
6875,we were comfortable for the most part we enjoyed our stay,3
6876,i booked a single room for one night so it was all about location,3
6877,the only complaint that i have is that the bathrooms could use more counter space,3
6878,the food was terrible so we ate out most of the time so it's not on the expedia website,3
6879,hotel is close to uofo about 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk,3
6880,the sound-proof needs to be improved upon but other than that a good stay,3
6881,the hotel manager came to the room but did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
6882,hot tub in pool area did not work but there was no hot water when i showered in the morning,3
6883,also the second room we were given was so small we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit,3
6884,the ice machines are far away and the freeway a lot of noise from the highway in my room,3
6885,the rooms were clean but the outside was not cleaned on a regular basis and appeared to be very disorganized,3
6886,problem with this hotel is the reason i chose laquinta inns and suites,3
6887,not luxury hotel but for those looking for extras in their hotel stay,3
6888,the rooms while clean were very plain and simple i dont think you can beat this place,3
6889,we come to san antonio often and really like this hotel for its proximity to the mall of america,3
6890,i recommend this hotel but if you're just looking for a clean but cost effective stay this is your place,3
6891,the hotel is fine but the beds are not very comfortable,3
6892,booked a 2 night stay and i don't really want to know of what,3
6893,we were so tired and did not even help us at all,3
6894,she never offered to help with the baggage,3
6895,we had a lovely stay location is great and right outside the park so that's a plus,3
6896,i am glad to see you had an excellent stay at our hotel and will be going back there next year,3
6897,one of the things i tend to rate when i stay in dc i am now staying elsewhere,3
6898,no staff at the desk were very nice,3
6899,i'd definitely stay here again if they paid me,3
6900,when i finally did get my king room there was no coffee pot in the room,3
6901,dated decor that could use updating and the room would definitely benefit from a fresh coat of paint,3
6902,overall the room was fine and the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
6903,staff was very nice and went out of his way to find a vacant room for me,3
6904,unfortunately we had a room in the back building,3
6905,stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise so the location was perfect for me as well,3
6906,no exhaust fan in the bathroom may have attributed to the mold on the ceiling above the air conditioner,3
6907,we knew we would be there less than 10 hours don't know that we will be returning again though,3
6908,good breakfast fare with plenty of choices as well as a bottle opener,3
6909,a little more run down than i expected but my stay was pleasant nonetheless,3
6910,inconveniently i will have to continue to call about it to make sure it is an active account then they automatically put the money back,3
6911,i am a swimmer and chose this hotel due to hilton honors points and location for family event,3
6912,there was blood on the shower curtain on the inside,3
6913,one exit up is a lot of construction being done to the hotel,3
6914,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of old cologne steps from the river dom restaurants etc,3
6915,they still knocked on my door even though do not disturb sign out prior to my shower,3
6916,it wasn't horrible but it doesn't hold enough so we had to go elsewhere,3
6917,we booked this hostel because it was the most expensive room on our trip and it was by far the worst of the lot,3
6918,our mirror was cracked which wouldn't have been an issue if we were given the choice between older,3
6919,the place i'd clean and comfortable but we could hear the tv from the hallway,3
6920,not the nicest motel in the world but it does have a good location for the shakespeare festival,3
6921,when we arrived at 11:30 pm it wasn't in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine,3
6922,had to call for our own bellman when we arrived at 3 pm so we waited at the indoor terrace which,3
6923,it is not the worst possible experience but it is clean and the location is excellent,3
6924,unless you know the access to the main highway was good,3
6925,rooms and reception are ok value for money but the area is nice and staff to,3
6926,having said that there are some drawbacks there is no coffee maker in room but motel coffee is in the breakfast room till 7 am,3
6927,i knew this wasn't going to work for us,3
6928,fine for the 8 hour sleep we stayed but we will spend the extra money to stay here compared to the alternatives,3
6929,stayed here for business and it was good for a few hours so that was frustrating,3
6930,2 bed queen room with a view of the hotel's amenities,3
6931,i think they could step it up just a bit considering the price you pay you would expect a little more,3
6932,you hear people in the hallways and rooms were dirty,3
6933,but the beds and pillows were comfortable and clean,3
6934,the suite room was great for the price,3
6935,the key element in any hotel is the good night's sleep is the most important thing,3
6936,probably as good of a hotel as you will find in this price range kind of hotel but the hotel is in need of updating,3
6937,walls are very thin and the maids cleaning at 7:30am made a very loud noise all night even from the 22 floor,3
6938,okay to sleep for the night but the a c was cranking when we got to the destination,3
6939,this would be a good option but next time i'll skip the tasteless eggs and sausage,3
6940,didn't smell it in the hall but as soon as i got off the elevator to go to my mobile hot spot,3
6941,would've been a nice place for the price but our room smelled of sewage,3
6942,we were not given the type of room you are requesting with the hotel,3
6943,this was supposed to be a non smoking room had a burn,3
6944,remote control for the tv did not work properly or at all at times,3
6945,i was disappointed because we were not told about the in house dinner,3
6946,the hotel is right in front of the tv was very nice,3
6947,told it was no pet floor but there was a rack with hanger and a some shelves behind a curtain,3
6948,thank goodness we had a iphone to provide room light as the front desk but inside the room was brown,3
6949,advertised as a family place but way too many people for the pool and breakfast areas and the wifi was diabolical,3
6950,my four night stay at this hotel in 3 years,3
6951,this was a quick one night stay this place was solid,3
6952,they said they would put the crib in the room but asked at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
6953,i'm a non smoker and i got a non smoking room and got a smoking room,3
6954,as for the property other than the lobby and outside temperature even with the ac in full force,3
6955,however the room was fine the room and clean the breakfast was good with decent choice of food,3
6956,the hotel was a bit dated but still ok,3
6957,if you are going to stay at the sleep inn also a choice hotel but it was late and we needed to get some sleep,3
6958,situated in some of the best hunting in the area if you are looking for soundproof rooms this is not the hotel for you,3
6959,my biggest problem was just the fact that it is located on a busy street many shops and places to eat right there,3
6960,for our stay we found the hotel a bit early around 1 pm,3
6961,upon check in we were told there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
6962,our biggest disappointment was the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups,3
6963,we chose days inn because of the pool and hot tub,3
6964,nothing fancy just a quiet room and an bed for a quick trip to see family it did the job,3
6965,we asked the front desk to turn it off because of marijuana smell blowing into room,3
6966,the location of this hotel is its location,3
6967,i would stay here again because of the proximity to what we were visiting and other was full,3
6968,location was very close to the beach and come back for the,3
6969,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could,3
6970,also did not not like the charge for the safe in the room for a short time breakfast was very good,3
6971,i arrived after midnight and the girl at the counter was really nice and accommodating,3
6972,eventhough we stayed in the junior suite with a small living room with fireplace kitchenette small bath and a bedroom s,3
6973,the hotel staff was very nice and the location was a short drive from st,3
6974,glad it was pet friendly and didn't charge for a pet to stay,3
6975,the night staff was great and very friendly,3
6976,many other hotels and places to eat so is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities,3
6977,rather dated but our room was shabby and the carpet was torn in places,3
6978,the location was great very easy to walk and there are a lot of great areas,3
6979,hotel was very loud and spoke to the front desk for some dinner recommendations,3
6980,i guess this place suits people looking for a cheap place to crash for a nite or so,3
6981,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't see any breakfast offered unless it was made to order for free,3
6982,i ended up leaving my car at the check in isle for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep,3
6983,very nice hotel lots to do in the area and invited my significant other to stay with me,3
6984,after paying 197 for the room for one night so it was all about location,3
6985,i have stayed and rated this property a number of times for business and enjoyed my stay,3
6986,the breakfast was nice and the map provided from the front desk clerk was very attentive,3
6987,a few friends and i stayed here for our visit to the bourbon trail,3
6988,don't think i would stay here again if the price was right,3
6989,the hotel was fine for our needs and was clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly but very stingy,3
6990,this hotel is great for location to the convention center and 3-4 blocks from the beach,3
6991,morning staff was very friendly but the breakfast service was great,3
6992,every simple request required multiple phone calls and they placed us in a quieter room but didn't,3
6993,i will have to find another hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there,3
6994,its clean but past its prime needs an upgrade fresh coat of paint on it and call it good,3
6995,the pool was down the hall but the door was propped open when i went to tell the front desk others had already complained,3
6996,i called the front desk and asked for another room,3
6997,our room was ok but my advise is don't stay on the 3rd floor had the same problem with all but one,3
6998,i agree with the reviewer who complained about the noisy a c and the good is gone,3
6999,all-in-all the stay was fine and i would stay at another property,3
7000,i honestly don't think that is the normal there but it was the wall plug that didn't work,3
7001,negatives no a c in the room was half naked when we opened the door to find a empty room without washing machines,3
7002,new carpet in hallways so it looks like they tried to update the room but did not have any options for a room,3
7003,it's very much a you get what you pay for so overall not too many down sides,3
7004,the lavatory is in the bathroom and one in the bedroom,3
7005,then they next day we had the do not disturb on the door and it was taken care of,3
7006,there were several stands in the room that are non-smoking rooms with king or queen size beds,3
7007,even though the hotel is officially rated as a 4 star hotel furniture is old and needs replaced and could be alot cleaner,3
7008,the room rates were not bad considering the proximity to the highway,3
7009,the underwater light in the hot tub floating on the bubbles,3
7010,the staff was nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
7011,i had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk and have me towels to put on the floor,3
7012,although the room was clean but we wouldn't stay there again but not for a long stay,3
7013,the location is good and the lobby is no exception,3
7014,but i called the front desk about the shuttle i booked,3
7015,the table in the room was very comfortable,3
7016,disappointed that there was no refrigerator in my room and it's now a non smoking hotel,3
7017,rooms are dated and front desk staff was very friendly and always asked if anything was needed in my room,3
7018,no elevator ha to climb 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located,3
7019,room smelled funky and a c didn't work and neither did the tv,3
7020,the living area of the room was old but at least clean,3
7021,it's ok for a night and needed a place to stay for the night while away for work,3
7022,on a positive note the breakfast was nice the basics with omelette sand bacon,3
7023,this hotel is near the freeway the room and bathroom were small but comfortable,3
7024,rooms were clean but the bathroom floor was severally cracked,3
7025,i felt as if i was given the bottom of the tub revealing a thick layer of black and white muck,3
7026,everybody was very friendly for the most part it was great,3
7027,she knew me by name and knew exactly what i wanted a good clean sleeping room,3
7028,no one has cleaned that area in a long time that missed several marks,3
7029,this place was a budget price i would not have booked it i would have gone somewhere else,3
7030,the floors were disgusting rarely vacuumed and i don't really have a problem with got way to hot,3
7031,however the bathroom wasn't the cleanest room,3
7032,although clean i will not stay here again,3
7033,there was no fan in the bathrooms nasty,3
7034,stayed here one night on our way to gulf shores al,3
7035,nice convienant hotel very roomy and comfortable nice place for a relaxing evening out with friends,3
7036,00 a night so we decided to book this hotel at the very last minute,3
7037,the room does have a refrigerator and some don't,3
7038,cleanliness is an issue from the dried food on the outside of the hotel needs a long overdue update,3
7039,nice updates but very thin walls so you need to go downtown or to the waterfront to eat,3
7040,the room was ok the refrigerator didn't work and it was like a sauna in our room,3
7041,it was fine for a stop over it was clean but we were disappointed by uncleanliness and lack of housekeeping,3
7042,a very good budget hotel everything exactly what you'd expect from a luxury airport hotel and it doesn't hit that mark,3
7043,the food at the hotel is great for its convenience to the airport,3
7044,me and the mrs stayed at the hotel valencia for a few days,3
7045,it as worth the money i saved over the weekend to stay there again at least until they renovate,3
7046,i've stayed at other extended stay hotels in the past so i know what to expect,3
7047,we were traveling i-35 and needed a place to sleep overnight and the bed was comfortable,3
7048,however there are some logistics problems the entrance to the hotel is in a great location lots of restaurants bars and cool shops,3
7049,also it was too crowded to get into the hottub and it was cold and dirty,3
7050,although the room was clean and the staff was very courteous,3
7051,the continental breakfast was good and the bed was very hard and resulted in constant pain from pinched nerve in my hip,3
7052,staff was great the room was clean in excellent condition,3
7053,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice hotel but they are in the process of being updated,3
7054,we have stayed at this hotel because it was dog friendly,3
7055,per night this is a good option,3
7056,asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't a relaxing place to stay,3
7057,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could,3
7058,the rooms in the back at least although the a c makes a bit of noise however grounds are lovely with a terrific breakfast included,3
7059,the desk staff were very nice and friendly,3
7060,i suppose that's fine as long as you request a room facing away from,3
7061,the room was clean and neat but there was a lot of noise,3
7062,it was decent for the price and the fact that they accept pets is a plus,3
7063,upon checking in the lady at the front desk was very helpful,3
7064,the bathroom tub so old we didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1,3
7065,the bed was clean and comfortable but nothing particularly special,3
7066,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't think a hold needs to last that long,3
7067,i would have brought it up but it was pretty much what i have come to expect from super 8 motels,3
7068,it would have been nice just to stay at the comfort suites on business trips and it meets my needs,3
7069,the hotel is at the edge of the french quarter,3
7070,nice convienant hotel very roomy and comfortable nice place for a relaxing evening out with friends,3
7071,bug big was found in one of the rooms that we were promised,3
7072,it had a smell and we didn't get robbed or sick but that is about it,3
7073,this use to be my go to hotel when i stay in santa cruz because i want to walk everywhere,3
7074,it was a nice night for just the two of us out the door for just under 145,3
7075,when i went to check out there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel,3
7076,i can't be too hard on this hotel because i was a woman staying alone in an unlocked room,3
7077,we drove around the block twice trying to figure out the remote to the television,3
7078,the room were clean and breakfast was good but get in early room fills up fast,3
7079,bed was hard as a rock the room was small but clean and adequate for our needs,3
7080,one window was completely covered by ivy so we couldn't leave them open so we used the ac a lot,3
7081,granted this hotel is situated in the center of everything we needed to do which was nice,3
7082,the bed felt as if i was given the bottom of the pool and whirlpool,3
7083,the mattress was not great but we were tired and had to get back into the room,3
7084,nonetheless it was very convenient for one night on my way across the country,3
7085,desk clerk was wonderful he went above and beyond to help us set up a shuttle,3
7086,it still smelled like smoke in the room the bathroom could have been cleaner,3
7087,however i did hear a lot of traffic noise but i should have known that since it was a one way driveway,3
7088,just to have a place to stay for a couple of days,3
7089,although the hotel is in need of update,3
7090,first and foremost it's a beautiful hotel in a great location on lake and has great rooftop restaurant and bar,3
7091,we were told yes i know you've prepaid but we don't have a data plan and need to check a flight,3
7092,it's not that fancy but it's about the only place in town,3
7093,valet was full so we had to go back down very inconvenient when your tired from traveling,3
7094,no microwave pool was nice and clean but no free parking,3
7095,once we walked into the lobby we were greeted with the stink emanating from somewhere,3
7096,the hotel prides itself on water conservation but there was an old wash cloth left on the shower rod,3
7097,the room was clean but it is hard to rate the condition as it is obvious that it's an old hotel,3
7098,the hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a stop over ya get what ya pay for,3
7099,very crowded the food is not as good and the staff was friendly and cleaning staff did a good job,3
7100,i repeatedly tried to call back and nobody did it,3
7101,pool area was nice to have an indoor pool but they don't tell you that parking costs 8 per night,3
7102,the signage with instructions for the hot tub was again dirty and cold,3
7103,as in previous stays i have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in new orleans,3
7104,my only real complaint was that i had a bit of a funky smell oldish maybe a bit moldish,3
7105,i would assume that since it was so close to the beach,3
7106,we found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor because i use a walker and there are no elevators,3
7107,overall for the price of the room it was pretty standard for an economy type hotel,3
7108,i believe it's because we booked through expedia so she couldn't help us,3
7109,we have stayed at in a while that does not have a fridge or microwave so we had to go elsewhere,3
7110,the food was great as was the people in the next room at 3 am screaming,3
7111,but other than that i would stay here again for price i paid,3
7112,the only entrace was a sliding glass door and a balcony area,3
7113,no much to choose from in lavonia ga,3
7114,lots of restaurants movies shopping in the immediate area except for fast food,3
7115,hotel room was nice very spacious only problem is the front desk service and the breakfast,3
7116,i was disappointed because we were not told at check in,3
7117,check in was straightforward and we had a 1st floor room near the pool,3
7118,but it does have a microwave and fridge in the room so it was about 90,3
7119,our first visit the room didn't seem to know where anything in town was,3
7120,towels looked pretty old used for a long time for a shower which i really enjoyed,3
7121,there were times there was nobody at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
7122,it has a fairly decent breakfast and our room was directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
7123,we did ask for a smoking room so we bucked up and stayed the night,3
7124,aside from that the room was too big for the a c unit was too noisy,3
7125,the only complaint that we had was the beds were super comfortable but the bathroom on the other hand needs replaced,3
7126,we were not sure what we would find when we checked in we were told we were calling direct,3
7127,being there 2 nights having a refrigerator and microwave in the room which was a non smoking room it smelled like smoke,3
7128,over all the staff was very friendly and checked me in very quickly,3
7129,when we return we hope to stay in the room for us and our luggage,3
7130,room and breakfast were fine pretty much what you'd expect from a luxury airport hotel and it doesn't hit that mark,3
7131,outside areas nice close to the beach but it's a bit dingy,3
7132,otherwise it was cheap and convenient for a same day booking on a friday night lucky for us there was a perkins across the street,3
7133,room had urnine dirty towels when i go there but i called and they wanted to charge me 20 per day,3
7134,room for vending ice machine was locked key didn't work the pizza place that the guest services book said delivered did not,3
7135,the room seemed kind of out dated and i wouldn't have noticed the noise so much,3
7136,the room was clean and the staff were all very friendly,3
7137,i traveled with my husband and 2 kids,3
7138,i repeatedly tried to call back and nobody did it,3
7139,we have to hang outside in the hall way really loud kids running up down hall way,3
7140,the hotel hallway and the room smelled like someone had been smoking in there for years,3
7141,the hotel was fine although it was not as good as it used to be,3
7142,towels and toilet paper were so very cheap and there were no linens so i had to have a room on the upper floors,3
7143,was not impressed a few nights when one of the staff had poor command of the english language,3
7144,this place is very old but well maintained and effectively managed,3
7145,i had been told that breakfast was served until 10:30 i was informed that the additional fees totaled more than 250,3
7146,staff was great and did their job but there was no extra effort,3
7147,the lobby area is noisy don't stay in room 350 because you will have an extra guest,3
7148,beds were not very comfortable but it wasn't that good on the property not worth the all inclusive price,3
7149,we could not get a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
7150,the carpet in the hallway in front of my 4th-story window,3
7151,it has a fairly decent breakfast and our room was clean appeared to have been recently updated so no complaints with that,3
7152,toilet was clogged when we checked in which was a little strange,3
7153,check in and staff at front desk were friendly and efficient,3
7154,next time i will ask for a room away from the adjoining highway,3
7155,the hotel itself was quiet and the location was great directly off the highway which was convenient but a little noisy,3
7156,the hotel is very dated and in serious need of an upgrade,3
7157,but the beds and pillows were very comfortable,3
7158,the food was good and a good value for the price,3
7159,the room was quite loud we had to keep shoes on or washing kids feet,3
7160,although this is a non smoking hotel yet it just stunk,3
7161,i complained about my room to the front desk to ask about our room which wasn't the case for others,3
7162,we did not like was we had two rooms with an adjoining door,3
7163,hot tub was spacious in the room to mask the smell,3
7164,i felt as if i was given the bottom of the tub revealing a thick layer of black and white muck,3
7165,we're happy you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
7166,the room was clean and spacious the hotel restaurant was one of my favorite stops when in the area,3
7167,not a bad spot for just an overnight stay halfway to my destination,3
7168,the woman who cleaned our room was very small with no place to sit down to eat,3
7169,everything about this hotel is that we were able to complete watching a program,3
7170,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
7171,in a rough neighbourhood but that's not too surprising for a downtown hotel,3
7172,service is excellent rooms are clean and contain a microwave and a refrigerator and it did have a small breakfast option,3
7173,the hotel was clean and very quiet and the staff very friendly but we could hear footsteps from room above us,3
7174,i was a guest in this hotel for one night as we were passing through,3
7175,this is a hostel so you basically you're getting what you pay for but i've had better 60 rooms,3
7176,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't see the sign until the,3
7177,one of the cheapest in the area it was in was a little shady,3
7178,room was ok and the free breakfast was not a breakfast and very busy,3
7179,plenty of restaurants nearby and right across the road from the tucson airport fit the bill with some minor inconveniences,3
7180,the staff was notified we were checking in late and it was not a terrible stay but i will probably not be returning,3
7181,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to walk right over to bsu football stadium and game,3
7182,most other hotels in the same location,3
7183,pool area was nice but they didn't touch our room,3
7184,the room on the other hand needs replaced,3
7185,the bed was a little high for the hotel room,3
7186,the air conditioner didn't work very well,3
7187,we choose this location because it was close to the airport so that was convenient,3
7188,other than that we enjoyed our stay there and did not have any problem in our room,3
7189,could connect to the internet but because it was so slow i could not even make or receive calls while in my room,3
7190,it looks like it's stuck in the 70's and hasn't been touched since,3
7191,food in the restaurant was broken because i saw our waitress at the front desk just a note saying to wait,3
7192,they helped me out at the front desk to turn it off,3
7193,my reserved room was not ready when i checked in at 8:30 pm there were 2 pieces of fruit were there,3
7194,the bedroom was pretty good and so was the pool area very poor with jacuzzi closed off with tape,3
7195,i informed the desk manager that i was very disappointed in the contiential breakfast that was served,3
7196,shower ok and that's what we got,3
7197,shame because the reception staff were very nice but the hotel is a little beat up but saved was well spent on fantastic wine,3
7198,room was very close to pool so there was a constant puddle on the bathroom floor i will not choose this hotel again,3
7199,they have a microwave and small fridge in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones,3
7200,it was cold at night due to a broken lock,3
7201,it was clean and there was a bunch of tagging,3
7202,on a positive note the breakfast was nice but i would not recommend this cabin,3
7203,however when i checked in for the first visit i was informed that that was on the weekend,3
7204,the hotel staff was friendly and the bed was comfortable,3
7205,front office staff was very nice and quickly accommodated my request,3
7206,the pool was disgusting and needed to be updated otherwise the hotel was excellent and service above par,3
7207,this visit i found a cockroach in one of the drawers when child was discovering the room,3
7208,for those who don't use the pool area,3
7209,overall a good stay but was a little disconcerted when i went to the front desk they took care of it right away,3
7210,terrible housekeeping staff do not care about their role in this hotel and hotel point or 10 coupon,3
7211,the walls are very thin and you can hear everybody walking to their rooms,3
7212,it isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and helpful and this was a convenient hotel for the route,3
7213,the microwave dial was sticky when i went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken,3
7214,nice motel the only thing i didn't like the soap shampoo n conditioner and the pool was nice,3
7215,kids had a blast shower was hot had a good time here but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
7216,and with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
7217,room was very clean but they need to take care of us,3
7218,we had booked the hotel for the price,3
7219,the room was clean and comfortable and the shower had little water pressure,3
7220,value for money hotel right on the harbor and walking distance to everywhere,3
7221,i d say overall experience was good though and the room had a very strong musty smell that i believe come from the air conditioners,3
7222,i had high hopes for this hotel based on price since i just wanted a place to sleep so it served its purpose,3
7223,but all in all we will not be staying here again,3
7224,access to the room was a smoking room,3
7225,but everything is close by so you can walk if you don't have a small child seriously search for another place,3
7226,beds were comfy pillows were good bathroom area was ok and there was a hole in our door with just duct tape over it,3
7227,but the girls at the desk were nice and so were the furnishings but all in all i had a good visit,3
7228,it states they have an indoor pool but they don't have non-smoking rooms with king or queen size beds,3
7229,we would stay here again for the right price,3
7230,i asked for a non smoking room had a burn,3
7231,the hotel itself is in dire need of updating as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker and low-sugar syrup,3
7232,was there for the beach and this was a convenient location for our purposes,3
7233,no ice bucket they gave me a non smoking room it smelled terribly of stale smoke,3
7234,only part we didn't like is that it was very clean the bed was somewhat small,3
7235,my fianc and i stayed here for pacific university family weekend,3
7236,the area is always lively and has plenty of places to walk to for dinner something quick or even a nice pub,3
7237,when i brought this to the attention of the people in the restaurant,3
7238,tv was a flat panel and had a great view to the south and especially the fireworks on the 4th,3
7239,when i pulled in the exterior was under construction and hard to get to rooms and out of hotel,3
7240,wouldn't recommend walking in the immediate area but you have to walk across the parking lot for an hour waiting just for that,3
7241,asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't a relaxing place to stay,3
7242,aside from those little things we had a nice stay and for about half the price as anywhere else in town,3
7243,when returning from dinner our room was freezing so i went to turn down the air because the room was at least 85 degrees,3
7244,one chair had a stain on it but the bed was good and breakfast was above average,3
7245,our room was clean the towels were adequate the morning breakfast was included with room you certainly would not go hungry,3
7246,we stayed in a room that had already been renovated,3
7247,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could do,3
7248,we wanted to be a walk to the beach and centrally located for our travels,3
7249,the only downfall is things close early around rockafellar center so you have to go to the hotel the next week to get corrected,3
7250,the hotel was according to the manager recently remodeled but it must have been from the rain the night before and set out for sometime,3
7251,other then this incident it is a beautiful hotel on the surface but lacking in quality of product,3
7252,there were fairly large cracks in the walls and scratches on the tub,3
7253,they do have free breakfast but i really should not complain had to ask for another room,3
7254,no tea or coffee making kit in the rooms so it was quite noisy,3
7255,this was supposed to be a non-smoking room that i was assigned 241 was great,3
7256,i didnt like that there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
7257,the staff are very friendly and accommodating within their means,3
7258,elevator seemed a bit old and in need of replacing,3
7259,no one was ever at the front desk to ask about our room which was very convenient,3
7260,however the rooms need to be updated but for the price it was a reasonable stay and the staff was friendly,3
7261,we had to use the hotel room service,3
7262,the location was great and we were able to throw,3
7263,feeling around in the early am for my glasses on the floor in our bathroom upon our entering was just outright gross,3
7264,also when we told the front desk and they were right there to help,3
7265,the bed was comfortable the place was clean and i do have to sya this was fixed prior to my departure,3
7266,the housekeepers are lazy but the front desk staff was very polite,3
7267,one was very pleasant and helpful with this and the room was clean enough and the manager was quite nice,3
7268,all in all it was a nice but aging hotel,3
7269,overall the stay was not up to par,3
7270,great staff lots of traffic in out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
7271,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is now smoke free,3
7272,room was clean but the bathroom floor was overlooked,3
7273,guests are allowed to smoke outside of the hotel to get reception for internet,3
7274,the accommodations were great but the staff was friendly and helpful during check in,3
7275,it's fine if you just need a place to stay passing through it works,3
7276,they do put an additional deposit on your credit card beyond what you may for the room,3
7277,the hotel was fully booked when i arrived but the staff at the reception two gentlemen working there,3
7278,it was the cheapest and closest hotel within walking distance of universal studios however i didn't want to add,3
7279,when i spoke to the person at the front desk because they didn't have hot water,3
7280,the room was clean for the most part were professional and respectful,3
7281,what i liked best was the refrigerator and microwave in the room and didn't seem to be vacuumed,3
7282,the front desk staff were really nice and helped me to find another hotel in this town,3
7283,the wifi was excellent the breakfast was good but the 2nd stay was not,3
7284,i stayed at this place four years ago and it was great spacious service great as was breakfast,3
7285,lots of kids and families running up and down the hallways yelling all night we did not get any sleep,3
7286,the neighborhood is crazy with tourists and vendors and the hotel is almost right across from the college,3
7287,the first problem was that as soon as we walked in we could smell cigarette smoke,3
7288,on several occasions there was no one at the front desk,3
7289,my husband and i stayed at the embassy and had a much better room,3
7290,1 there was a dead roach in the middle of the night after several hang ups,3
7291,overall you could see it was an older property and was probably a smoking motel in the past,3
7292,breakfast choice and quality is about average although there wasn't any rooms available but i'd already paid for my room,3
7293,it was a nice experience we were in a room we needed as a family,3
7294,we also had the restaurant and the food was good and a good value for the price,3
7295,also my nephew told me the new waterpark had chilly water so i didn't care for the attitude of the desk person,3
7296,although the hotel is in the process of checking in and checking out i found the staff to be very rude judgemental,3
7297,i called done to the desk and expained it was in the ice trays in the freezer,3
7298,we stayed on a lower floor and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
7299,there is a pool i didn't use anything the charge would be reversed,3
7300,work took me to monroe for a week and actually thought about checking out early to stay somewhere else next time in fayetteville,3
7301,we would stay there again even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room,3
7302,but if you want a hotel near crossgates mall you can't beat the bar and grill kitty corner delicious,3
7303,the first floor which we walked through to get to the big malls across the street is a lovely setting for a walk or run,3
7304,we wanted to stay 3 nights but had to switch rooms during my stay because of loud music in room 253,3
7305,we stayed there for a week on business,3
7306,does its job for a one night stay before boarding cruise,3
7307,checkout was good and i would stay at another property,3
7308,i enjoyed using the fitness room but the pool was a bit too deep for them even in the shallow end,3
7309,make a casino clear path to the lobby and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
7310,housekeeping didn't clean our room claiming they were too busy to send it and i needed to be,3
7311,the room was ok but there was no hot water when i showered in the morning,3
7312,normally we stay at another hotel next year,3
7313,when i returned to the front desk and they were very short to get off the phone,3
7314,bug big was found in one of the elevators was cracked and falling apart,3
7315,despite that the staff was very friendly but the breakfast service was great,3
7316,did not have to use stairs and was close to where i needed to go but still pleasantly quiet room,3
7317,i will not book through expedia again and probably won't stay here again if in long beach,3
7318,outside of our hotel room which is great for 2 and their coffee also good for 1,3
7319,their breakfast is offered in the form of an apple pear and orange,3
7320,i took the drink to the desk and asked them for a new remote never heard back from,3
7321,the latter was especially frustrating because i was trying to get into the martin mason,3
7322,i like the fact that the entire hotel is just,3
7323,i was looking forward to a good night sleep because the bad odor,3
7324,location is good and the room was clean and there was no pool very little space when you have kids,3
7325,so i don't know if i'd stay there again but ok for a last minute booking and on a friday night,3
7326,the hotel location is great and close to everything we wanted to do and see and it was mostly quiet and comfortable,3
7327,i wish that was included in the stay but the breakfast area was a tight squeeze,3
7328,it was nice having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the bathroom,3
7329,i couldn't tell any difference from what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
7330,we booked this hotel was for an overnight stay after a wedding,3
7331,the room was small but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
7332,so josh offered to print for me then asked if i wanted an accesible bathroom upon arrival,3
7333,carpets are chocolate in color but one can still see the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness,3
7334,there was no phone in the room did not have a reservation but they were able to get an extended stay until 6:00pm for 25,3
7335,nice motel the only thing i did not like is the light in the hotel so there was no issue when getting ready,3
7336,the staff is willing to help you out if needed,3
7337,i might stay here again if the price was right and the location couldn't have been any better,3
7338,the conference was efficient and the front desk made us wait for the room and it was okay,3
7339,we were placed on the 3rd floor unless you smoke,3
7340,there are soda or ice machines on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3
7341,for a night or two but i would not stay here again unless rooms not available elsewhere,3
7342,arrived hoping for a double bed but was told there were no non-smoking rooms with king or queen size beds,3
7343,manager was very helpful and full of information about the area and very nice,3
7344,hotel is a little tired and is in desperate need of updating especially for the price,3
7345,the carpet needed replaced and i didn't get much sleep,3
7346,the hotel is dated but it is clean and the,3
7347,my husband and i stayed here on a casino trip because the other hotels were full so they raised their prices,3
7348,it takes about an hour to get into our room,3
7349,my room next to the back entrance,3
7350,very clean and the staff were very accommodating in that i asked for,3
7351,my son decided not to go into the key room and find my keys,3
7352,i felt the room to be a bit more than disappointing but there is a mcdonalds across the street,3
7353,staff did their job but there was no signal in our room,3
7354,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
7355,it feels unfair to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under renovation so there were challenges due to that,3
7356,just little things need tending to like the shower curtain rod was rusty the hand rail in the shower was weak,3
7357,we are still trying to figure out how to turn on the other room lights,3
7358,we stayed for a week choosing this hotel because of its ratings and price,3
7359,it was surprisingly quiet area must say i was surprised by the lack of items in the room needed attention,3
7360,rooms where clean but the air was off in the room so if you have a moving truck,3
7361,let me start by saying i travel a lot and that was a plus,3
7362,complementary breakfast was limited but the help was very helpful and i actually left with a smile,3
7363,everything gone by 9 am on a sunday morning was over by 9 am,3
7364,the accommodations were great but the staff was friendly and the room was surprisingly comfortable though we spent little time in it,3
7365,the hotel had friendly staff the breakfast was okay not great but not bad,3
7366,i can't be too hard on this hotel because i didn't return the room cards,3
7367,this place is cute but we expected more out of our room for at least an hour because of a faulty security lock,3
7368,other than this small the room was and how large it was,3
7369,if you want a location next to the gondola and center of town its what we settled for,3
7370,it is a good location for the college,3
7371,unfortunately no one told us when we booked or when we checked in kind of small but overall not bad,3
7372,this is a pet friendly hotel and i know how booking sites work,3
7373,the 3 of us got up at 8 am and next at 10 am,3
7374,the guy we who worked the front desk was manned at my 3:30am arrival,3
7375,on a trip through md i was able to book it for 89,3
7376,we could not even have a cup of coffee and enjoyed warm oatmeal with brown sugar raisins and cream delicious,3
7377,overall not too bad though if you just need a place to sleep while on a road trip and didn't want to wait,3
7378,the from desk guy was creepy but if you just a place to sleep and incredibly convenient if you have business in the convention center,3
7379,reception at check-in was a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little,3
7380,the staff however was really understanding and literally walked me all over the hotel on the correct way to use the elevators,3
7381,some of the staff was friendly and very helpful with,3
7382,for those who don't use the pool area,3
7383,dinner portions were medium to what i considered small even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
7384,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i felt safe there with my family,3
7385,he said he would switch rooms i informed him i didn't have a goodnights sleep until we got home,3
7386,the breakfast room is too small and was packed and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks,3
7387,even though the highway was closeby i did not hear any noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
7388,i guess this place suits people looking for a cheap place to stay the rooms are fun the staff was beyond helpful,3
7389,on our last day the power went out in the entire hotel was poor fingerprints on walls mirrors many scratch and scuff marks,3
7390,is walking distance to places to eat and out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
7391,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any 2-beds available since they started remodeling early to get ready for a,3
7392,pros nice that there was a 24 hr,3
7393,it was a decent stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
7394,the place was quiet but it looked old and the facilities were meh,3
7395,the hotel itself was ok but it was a nice night for just the two of us,3
7396,best part was the price 50 on a friday night lucky for us there was a perkins across the street,3
7397,asked for additional pillows was told they don't have non-smoking rooms had on the last visit,3
7398,un trained staff at the front desk did not want to stay there even after the bug was killed,3
7399,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but that is usually expected in nyc,3
7400,so on the plus side the room was beautifully decorated,3
7401,this hotel is great for if you are planning a romantic getaway-not the hotel for you,3
7402,hotel was quiet but our room was clean the front desk ladies were smiling polite and very helpful,3
7403,it was right off the freeway so it's easy to catch a bus,3
7404,i had stayed here once before and found it clean spacious and very conveniently located,3
7405,that said location is good and was close to where i had to go,3
7406,we were so happy we had been able to stay in the hotel we would've utilized the 2 ice trays in the freezer,3
7407,hotel is a little dated but still functional,3
7408,we did ask for a smoking room so we bucked up and stayed the night,3
7409,all around the hotel stay could have been better but it was quiet and friendly,3
7410,several friends and i stayed at palm suites for the first time in telluride,3
7411,a call to the front desk and we were told yes three times,3
7412,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but not convenient to walk the dogs,3
7413,the lady in the room was clean well maintained,3
7414,we asked for a new bedspread and we were given a choice of 2,3
7415,were not happy about the parking our only option was responded to as if i was ungrateful about getting a room,3
7416,rooms and breakfast were very nice and helpful,3
7417,there was no place to dispose of it so we had to switch rooms during my stay because of loud music in room 253,3
7418,in the shower the soap was open and there was a slight smell but nothing to complain about,3
7419,hardly any of the rooms have a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,3
7420,the bed was comfortable and the staff was very nice but definitely understaffed,3
7421,hotel clerk was friendly and speedy the room was somewhat clean could have been better food was cold breakfast and dinner,3
7422,the room with a balcony which we stayed in was extremely hot the ac was barely working,3
7423,our to was great but there were no towels in the bathroom,3
7424,the exterior isn't much to look at but the rooms are not all that,3
7425,you could hear everything in rooms around us but we were able to get us checked-in 2 hours,3
7426,the bathrooms are small and the place could use a little help but i wasn't expecting the taj mahal,3
7427,i read the reviews on this motel i can see there is a great shopping center nearby if you wanted breakfast,3
7428,he allowed us to check-in a few hours early,3
7429,16th floor ice machine did not work and front desk was advised,3
7430,this caused a major problem for us as we simply needed a place to stay for the night,3
7431,the room was dated and smelled mildew the exercise room was actually nice as was the bar area restaurant,3
7432,good deal breakfast was not great but we were tired and had to get back into the room,3
7433,i stayed on the 2nd floor didn't work and and a run down weight machine,3
7434,the hotel is fine but don't go expecting courteous service,3
7435,service was ok but the room was very plain just,3
7436,the room with a balcony which we stayed in was very close to the highway which was convenient for us,3
7437,i haven't stayed there yet we booked a room with 2 single beds instead,3
7438,there were no rooms available at other hotels in nola and can't blame the water source,3
7439,i was told by super 8 that i had to take time to go to the lobby,3
7440,50 for one night is way too expensive for being the save a lot of the marriott brand,3
7441,one of the lamps next to the bed were not working at all,3
7442,we needed a clean economical place to stay while we slept,3
7443,a so so value for the money in this area,3
7444,the laundry was next door to the freeway so there is road noise,3
7445,i felt as if i was sleeping on the streets,3
7446,in a rough neighbourhood but that's not much of a tourist destination,3
7447,the check-in and the staff were very nice,3
7448,if we were given a room with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
7449,however the price was good for a road trip stop,3
7450,i was surprised to find that there was an omlet station but it was in a good location for us,3
7451,we could use the elevator to the 2nd floor were hard enough to do with luggage,3
7452,the hotel was nice in the front however our room was not up to what is expected for a monaco hotel,3
7453,i was on a business trip and looking for a holiday inn express as i almost always have a very pleasant stay,3
7454,we stayed over for a night on a road trip and didn't want to add,3
7455,overall i'd probably stay here again if in long beach,3
7456,we had hardly any water pressure in the room and do not disurb signs for the door,3
7457,the second day we fortunately returned as the room was looked neat but the bathroom floor was overlooked,3
7458,the room was fine and the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
7459,although the people who worked there were nice we will not be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us,3
7460,the desk staff were very nice and attentive,3
7461,the sheets with really scratchy and there was a dealer that i could resolve the problem,3
7462,it was just a place to sleep after a long drive,3
7463,our rooms were very clean and the bed was very comfortable,3
7464,grand junction has a little downtown and the hotel was accommodating for a decent place to stay for under 200,3
7465,although clean i will not stay at the ip again,3
7466,the staff was very friendly and the room was fine and the mattress was very firm,3
7467,other than that the stay was not worth the cost,3
7468,enjoyed our stay at the hotel and had to wait for 30 min for the beds to be done,3
7469,the weather was hot and the room was clean but smelled of smoke,3
7470,the hj staff were very accommodating in that i asked for a wet towel to wash off the filthy breakfast tables,3
7471,i stay at this hotel but ask for a room that obviously sleeps more than two and no more at the desk,3
7472,i was told at the time of booking were not available,3
7473,and the hot tub is located in an area with many other hotels and places to eat right there,3
7474,additionally the location was walkable to a lot of restaurants boutiques and grocery,3
7475,there were fairly large cracks in the walls and scratches on the tub,3
7476,some good food in the area but i would not have seen it had it not been for the big sign,3
7477,all in all it was a nice area the staff was very nice and helpful,3
7478,the from desk guy was creepy but if you just a place to sleep so it served the purpose,3
7479,the bed was very comfortable and the water pressure is mediocre,3
7480,upon check in we were told that we had a good time,3
7481,it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
7482,it is an older motel and the rooms are comfortable and the pool was nice lots of loungers,3
7483,the woman at the desk was very friendly and even let us check out,3
7484,highly recommend this as the place to stay in livermor and where we will stay in the future,3
7485,could be cleaned and i was disappointed the pool and hot tub we're large perfect temperature and enjoyable,3
7486,walking distance to beach and almost right next door to it just in case your kids need something better for breakfast,3
7487,overall not a bad place i've stayed in a lot worse places,3
7488,the check in was a good experience for the price,3
7489,the reception area is just splendid with a great view of the beach and the nearest public beach access is durham st,3
7490,we stayed at this laquinta for four nights and there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the room,3
7491,there is alot of fresh food for breakfast and it was swamped with people,3
7492,i picked this hotel because of its close proximity to the aquarium and the queen mary,3
7493,old hotel but great location for the price would stay again,3
7494,have to call for it after got out of the deal was free breakfast,3
7495,also they used to have hair dryers in the rooms glad i brought mine,3
7496,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any of the major networks i,3
7497,and finally there was no hot water for a few hours of sleep we wanted to give this a try,3
7498,i was on a business trip and i travel often,3
7499,staff is pretty friendly and the rooms are not new by any means but they are clean,3
7500,i am not a 5 star but comfortable for an overnight stay but wouldn't want to stay longer than a night or two,3
7501,not the worst place i've ever stayed great people and the guy at the front desk because we were only staying there four nights,3
7502,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any knobs for the ac,3
7503,being the biggest location in town for a race at texas motor speedway,3
7504,the whirlpool jets were so terrible that it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal,3
7505,in their pool area there was no towels in the bathroom,3
7506,hardly any water pressure in the room and there was only one water glass and one coffee cup,3
7507,when i called the front desk they took care of it right away,3
7508,i had even asked at the desk and in the restaurant and the food was very good,3
7509,no working fan in the bathroom was so far away from the elevator as possible and was very small,3
7510,the breakfast was nice and the staff was extremely nice and helpful need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry,3
7511,we stayed at the klimpton hotel the location was perfect for me as well,3
7512,the guy we who worked the front desk was very apologetic and moved us to hotel mennagio,3
7513,hotel was very nice the only problem was my key card didn't work but housekeeping did bring us another one,3
7514,it was roomy and clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was mediocre that is probably a generous description,3
7515,was there for the beach and this was a good location for the purpose of my trip and accessible,3
7516,i hope that by the next time we are in town,3
7517,had a nice stay for the most part it was great,3
7518,no hot water on the 4th floor very quiet bed comfortable,3
7519,friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle of tourist paradise 15 min,3
7520,one of the lamps was unplugged and we shortly discovered the only way to close the doors is to let them shut by themselves,3
7521,the room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and fridge in the room is tiny and doesn't keep anything coke,3
7522,didn't sleep at all due to the noise of people coming and going at all hours,3
7523,overall i'd say it was a decent stop over on our way,3
7524,room was comfortable as you would expect from a best western,3
7525,the women that ownes the hotel is very close to the beach,3
7526,located almost equidistant between the airport and the cruise terminal,3
7527,we just needed a decent place to sleep very close to the hotel,3
7528,while professional the desk attendant at sign in was not very friendly they just did their basic job and didn't look clean,3
7529,i can't tell you how the room was because when we arrived we were assigned to the second floor from the first,3
7530,the staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was really good room was comfortable,3
7531,if ya got ta poop this is the best hotel i've stayed at yet,3
7532,when we also got up to our room to find hair in the bathtub and all over the bathroom,3
7533,but i wasn't there high season as the hotel is under major renovation,3
7534,i only slept here the room was clean and met our needs for the few days we needed,3
7535,although the people who worked there were nice we will not be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us,3
7536,when we got to the motel melissa the front desk clerk was very nice and quickly accommodated my request,3
7537,in the second room the tub had no plug so there was no way that regular size luggage would have fit in it,3
7538,it wasn't quite the relaxing weekend i was hoping for when i had to sign to agree my pet would not do 6 of,3
7539,this was a great hotel in the university district and having stayed here in the past,3
7540,the front desk was on the phone with what sounded like a machine gun coming from up stairs,3
7541,it was a nice stay for the price,3
7542,it was nice having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the air conditioning,3
7543,hotel semmed like what you would expect from a comfort inn,3
7544,in order to get ice you have to go to family court down the street it's ok,3
7545,it seems as if it's in the right location if this is where you pick up the free shuttle to down town,3
7546,we stayed at the hotel for a business trip at this hotel,3
7547,if you want a soft drink or bag of chips you will have to leave the hotel and parking lot is in decline,3
7548,the bedding was dirty we had to go to starbucks to do work on internet,3
7549,it was typical for other comfort suites i've stayed at many hotels and on occasion left something behind,3
7550,i would have thought that the service would have been better if the pool was open,3
7551,on a trip through md i was able to get a milk even in the evening,3
7552,hotel room was nice very spacious only problem is the front desk service and the breakfast,3
7553,we had been told it would be about 10 minutes,3
7554,had to check in later in the evening i called the hotel to get reception for internet,3
7555,on the whole as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but you must remember that you get what u pay for,3
7556,arrived hoping for a double bed but was told there were no non-smoking rooms had on the last visit,3
7557,we couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel is always a disappointment,3
7558,i asked the front desk to complain and they disconnected me,3
7559,our biggest disappointment was the breakfast area was a little tired with age but functional,3
7560,the room was clean but we were disappointed by uncleanliness and lack of housekeeping,3
7561,we took pictures and showed one to the desk clerk was kind and friendly,3
7562,so if that bothers you you may want to avoid the bathroom the water pressure is mediocre,3
7563,stay was good room was clean but there was a dog on the floor that barked,3
7564,i went back to front desk and asked to be moved,3
7565,elevator was out of service for 4 days and 3 nights at cypress creek,3
7566,the sink had a long crack and the tub had a hard time getting hot tub time because of kids running in and out,3
7567,beds were comfortable and the pool was closed during most of our stay,3
7568,cons it was very noisy and propped open,3
7569,our toilet leaked so there was a lot of black mold on the ceiling above the air conditioner,3
7570,the neighborhood was very scary we went into the room it seems ok since it was really late and we were exhausted,3
7571,front desk stated they did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
7572,when i checked out i told the lady at the desk that we had 2 rooms reserved,3
7573,i am only 5'3 and i had to park way far away,3
7574,however the rooms were clean and well styled,3
7575,older hotel bathroom was very run down in need of overhaul,3
7576,the mattress was good and the service was friendly and pleasant,3
7577,i stayed in this hotel in order to be able to rinse my hair in a timely manner,3
7578,stay was fine only problem was they charged my credit card and i had a good stay,3
7579,they had some kind of party going on at the end of the bed and the mattress was almost non-existent,3
7580,breakfast was decent for a one night stay before going to the dessert museum,3
7581,some good food in the area but the hotel was full the night we stayed on a low occupancy day,3
7582,just the bug bites i went home with were a bit of a problem if you have big luggages,3
7583,it was a decent experience at this hotel was good for the kids,3
7584,the condo resort is in a great location the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
7585,other than those two things it's not a 4 or 5 star property,3
7586,it was a pain but the front desk gave you ice if needed,3
7587,breakfast was okay the rooms were clean and the room size was great and had everything we needed,3
7588,maybe if it looked nicer it wouldn't have been so terrible if i didn't have to wait for the bus,3
7589,back bay metro station is just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in branson,3
7590,the area surrounding lacks any other amenities but there is a sports bar next door that has amazing pizza,3
7591,the lobby was a bit offputting because it had a very musty smell but seemed clean,3
7592,needs remodeling set up was not conducive for a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
7593,it was cheap and that was all i needed but i wouldn't stay,3
7594,had modern furniture and the room was a little overpriced,3
7595,the staff were very nice helpful lovely breakfast but we found the breakfast selection to be totally unacceptable,3
7596,the pool was nice but there is no elevator so if you have a moving truck,3
7597,and when we checked in we were told it was a non smoking room but i got a room,3
7598,the hotel room was decent for the price and location,3
7599,we could not even have a cup of coffee and a muffin and returned to the room on saturday night the wifi was working,3
7600,i was quite surprised when we got into the room it had a musty smell ac made it worse,3
7601,getting there is a little weird you have to go to the truck stop c-store to register,3
7602,however i have learned some of the rooms were closed for renovations,3
7603,it served it's purpose and we near a lot of restaurants shops and a supermarket in the surrendings and metro very close,3
7604,there were times there was nobody at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
7605,we stayed for 2 nights the room was clean and kept clean through our stay,3
7606,the location was good expect the a portion of the highway to get to the front desk but the phone wasn't working,3
7607,the pool area was ok however the hot tub was decent and the dining room was ok,3
7608,the whole place could use a good overhaul,3
7609,the in room guest showed only one ice machine and it is on 1st floor,3
7610,one exit up is a lot of construction going on in the next room,3
7611,the room was in the back right by the gate which caused little sleep due to the mattress and the loud cars outside the window,3
7612,i was checked in by a nice gentleman and my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
7613,the lady in the room was dim and some light fixtures in the room were very uncomfortable and was like sleeping on tiny little rocks,3
7614,the hotel was very nice and price good,3
7615,the ac unit is right next to the stairs but we heard nothing,3
7616,dated decor that could use updating and the room was clean but the bed was as hard as a rock,3
7617,one eventually did come available the next day at about noon to see if one would be available,3
7618,you right around the corner from the t and galleria mall,3
7619,bed was hard pillows were small and not very fluffy,3
7620,only issue was that i requested a non smoking room it smelled terribly of stale smoke,3
7621,the room had an oder about it but the staff wouldn't help me,3
7622,this was one of the first to check out the other amenities it was good for a road trip stop,3
7623,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could,3
7624,fridge was actually cleaner than the one at the 150 hotel we stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon 8 years ago,3
7625,we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the room could have been better,3
7626,motel was in a good location close to the interstate and cheaper than downtown rooms,3
7627,it was very rude and for that reason we will not stay at the location again,3
7628,i ended up at the david location after a friend and i were planning to visit hearst castle the next day,3
7629,but all in all we will not be staying again,3
7630,the facility was a bit worn but the bed was comfortable but the bedding was stained,3
7631,an electrical breaker shorted in the room and didn't need it,3
7632,the room was too big for the a c unit rattled off and on all night,3
7633,the biggest problem we had was that we didn't go back a 2nd time,3
7634,since we didn't have a double left,3
7635,overall the hotel was nice our room was spacious and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay,3
7636,they were so loud with people going in and out of rooms all night,3
7637,good location and as soon as i told them about it,3
7638,however it is comparatively inexpensive to other newer hotels in the immediate area but you have to drive in the snow to get there,3
7639,location was in a business center which was nice and quiet and the bed was relatively comfortable,3
7640,fortunately friends volunteered to keep her so we were able to book our weekend trip last minute,3
7641,i was there for 7 hours and my room was not a particularly comfortable or relaxing place to be,3
7642,had to call for our own bellman when we arrived at the hotel a bit early around 1 pm,3
7643,overall my stay was good and the product was good,3
7644,exterior doesn't look like much but room was clean and spacious king sized bed flatscreen tv fridge microwave and a,3
7645,coffee and tea both in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice,3
7646,it was convenient for what we needed as we were there only for a quick night or two in long beach,3
7647,we did use the pool which was very nice but they could really use a microwave and refrigerator which was handy,3
7648,what enticed was was the price free airport shuttle and shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
7649,she put me on the third floor didn't work and the bathroom needed a good cleaning,3
7650,doesn't have an elevator so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own sheets,3
7651,i clearly heard the surrounding rooms talking on the street i was on the 2nd floor which had convenient stair access to the lobby,3
7652,the staff was very nice and went out of his way to make sure we were alright,3
7653,i called to the front desk to ask for a room away from the highway if you can,3
7654,the front desk manager was very kind and helpful and gave us an earlier check i which we were greatful for,3
7655,this was my third stay at this hotel and they will lose business,3
7656,the location is good and was close to where i needed to go but still pleasantly quiet room,3
7657,the nice thing is that you are a short walk to the dunes not crowded at all,3
7658,this location is easy access to the north and south,3
7659,the entire place feels low energy but our room was fine and the fact that they didn't charge for pet,3
7660,got there 1 hour after check in they was sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra,3
7661,stayed here for a night on our way up to portland,3
7662,this should tell you a lot when we got into the room we found that the hotel is starting to show wear tear,3
7663,right next to hon'l's beach and walking distance to many shops restaurants and prudential center,3
7664,we were attracted to the best western of long beach is in a older section of town directly across from a public transportation train stop,3
7665,the resort was ok but i wouldn't stay more than one night,3
7666,then when entering the room it had already been cleaned,3
7667,pool area needs some work and hot tub didn't work so it was far from comfortable,3
7668,the only thing i didn't like is our room has not been updated in years,3
7669,i found it easy to locate and it was easy to reach easy to find and get to this location,3
7670,it was nice that there was a large gap under the door so we could hear people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1,3
7671,after several days of trying to reach a live person i was able to check in my room a couple hours earlier than i expected,3
7672,the staff was friendly and helpful there was a little mold around the tub,3
7673,bed was decent room was clean and well attended to,3
7674,in the room itself the bath towels were very rough and the bed had a burnhole in it,3
7675,grand junction has a little downtown and the hotel was pretty old you can't change that,3
7676,very disappointed for the price we had the two bedroom suite was very comfortable,3
7677,we reserved a non-smoking room and the king size bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for my liking,3
7678,the views were really nice and the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be working in hospitality,3
7679,it was nice that it was located very close to where i needed to be,3
7680,it needs renovations but the room was nice and comfortable and wifi worked fine,3
7681,the hotel and our room was on first floor,3
7682,then when entering the room it had already been cleaned,3
7683,decor was a little dated but clean and the beds were comfortable,3
7684,if you can get a sunbed you can't sit in the chairs because they had major stains on them,3
7685,outside areas nice close to the beach but it's a place to sleep for a night but it's not a bad hotel,3
7686,it was very rude and for that reason we will not stay ther again,3
7687,on a positive note the room was comfortable and clean but nothing fancy,3
7688,but again it was a quick overnight stay for a business traveler,3
7689,it was nice because it was quite being on the main road with easy access to shops and restaurants,3
7690,the room was actually very clean except for the hairs left in the sink and in the bathtub,3
7691,and then when the breakfast came out an hour and a half later and the worst quality couldn't eat it,3
7692,the main bed was fine but the amount of noise in the room was not very modern,3
7693,had problem with noisy air conditioning system in the hallway and a big fight people swearing and running back and forth for about an hour,3
7694,i booked bayside because we stayed here before we booked it,3
7695,the issue i had was they double charged my credit card even though it was already pre paid via expedia,3
7696,there was no one at the front desk was very understaffed,3
7697,it was a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
7698,room was comfortable as you would expect from a best western,3
7699,good things decent location quiet neighborhood not too far from vegas buffet prices eighteen for adults and nine for child,3
7700,not an easy task to find a decent rate at this hotel,3
7701,overall the property is nice and well maintained just a bit too far to walk to notre dame a good half an hour,3
7702,we were two people in a room with 2 queen beds,3
7703,our room was basic with a sea view but when it came to finding a restaurant to eat at,3
7704,the television in the room was half naked when we opened the door to the outside 20 degrees for a smoke break,3
7705,all and all i might stay there again but i would like a different room,3
7706,average stay not what i was expecting at all we got there at 9:50am and it was closed,3
7707,room service is only once a week so you would have to get back to the hotel late that night that is,3
7708,the rooms were clean and quiet and the bed was comfortable,3
7709,no elevator to second floor would be a problem for larger or older people,3
7710,yes this is not the ritz but it's a place to sleep at night,3
7711,the front desk was very unfriendly and not at all helpful,3
7712,overall i'd say it's a solid 3 star,3
7713,older hotel but one of the reasons we booked this hotel was for an overnight stay,3
7714,my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
7715,the only good thing i could say is the bed was comfortable the room was clean but very cheap,3
7716,the location of this hotel works well as you have easy access to the highway or i-25 to get me where i needed to be,3
7717,got a good price on expedia because hotel is renovating had to walk past two ladies who were smoking right by the door,3
7718,we were in walking distance of whatever you need if you don't want to pay it get a refund,3
7719,we found ourselves in dire need of a refit some tlc,3
7720,stopped here overnight on the way to our final vacation destination,3
7721,the room was clean but ours did not have any of the major networks i,3
7722,the hotel was nice but it was the wall plug that didn't work during one of the coldest nights of the year,3
7723,the bathroom had quite a bit of hair on the floor in our bathroom upon our entering was just outright gross,3
7724,finally i was disappointed that the indoor pool was ok and the location was good,3
7725,the cons for me were the age of the place it was pretty nice i will say i found the bed very comfortable,3
7726,room 115 was also at the beginning of august as a friend and i had stayed at their cypress creek location,3
7727,the hotel is right next to i-10 so was very convenient for getting back onto the highway,3
7728,but for the price which is one of the better off property hotels ive stayed at,3
7729,when we go to our room and find things moved around,3
7730,the noise level was out of this world and we were there for a swim meet and wanted some extra practice time,3
7731,we were told to drive down the road 10-15 min during low traffic 45 min during high traffic,3
7732,one of the cheapest in the area which is why i only gave 3,3
7733,the first day at the loby they tried to charge us for our stay after we had already paid,3
7734,the nice clean surrounding neighborhood as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
7735,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and being farther away would probably help,3
7736,the beds and rest of room was very clean the bed was comfy and the room was as expected not many frills but clean,3
7737,i am trying to get them to reimburse me since i had already paid taxes on the room when i left,3
7738,hotel was close to the theater and had what seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things,3
7739,the options are limited so we had no programming to see,3
7740,we also had the restaurant and the food was disgusting cold and the same offerings each night,3
7741,our room was very clean the bed was very comfortable but my city view was of a rooftop,3
7742,room appeared clean at first glance however the bathroom wasn't the cleanest room,3
7743,the hotel location is great and within walking distance to st mark's square and the shopping area,3
7744,the quality inn is a budget hotel for people looking for a cheap spot to stay near the airport,3
7745,my father is a handicap and they put us on the back side of the hotel,3
7746,the ones here are hard as a rock as were the other bread items,3
7747,the room does have a refrigerator and some don't,3
7748,visited during a road trip so we're surprised to find that there was an omlet station but it was in a great area,3
7749,and with the king street trolley you can easily get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
7750,front desk was amazing y helpful and gave us a lot of money since it was just me and wasn't for a vacation,3
7751,the bar closed at 8 pm so if you're looking to save a few bucks,3
7752,the staff was very friendly and went out of his way to find a vacant room for me,3
7753,the staff however were helpful when i asked for something they kind of mean,3
7754,in order to get ice you have to go inside to get to your rooms,3
7755,there is valet but no one to help us at the desk,3
7756,the general feel of the hotel was kept open at night due to traveling we would not have the promised coffee amenities,3
7757,room was very clean and nice rooms,3
7758,room was clean and the customer service was great and keep in,3
7759,rooms and breakfast were very nice and clean,3
7760,would like better brand coffee in the room would benefit from serious renovation,3
7761,overall it was a good deal for the price,3
7762,the hotel staff was very nice and our stay was okay,3
7763,certainly the best value in the area and at the hotel,3
7764,arrived and stayed for one night and it fit the bill,3
7765,so my guys had to sit in the dining room and we wanted to watch the game while we had dinner and some drinks,3
7766,my second floor room near the pool was very pretty and the food good,3
7767,i've stayed here before and had a good experience however this time the floor in the room didn't work,3
7768,we needed an extra blanket and the lady in the room was surprisingly nice,3
7769,not a bad spot for just an overnight stay halfway to my destination,3
7770,it was so bad i felt like i was in an institution,3
7771,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and being farther away would probably help,3
7772,i would recommend it to a friend but i think it would be petty to bash,3
7773,she was irritated that i wanted plates at a late hour we slept good and we left early,3
7774,prefer less lighting so to relax and enjoy the pool only to get there and the pool was nice lots of loungers,3
7775,the entire place needs to be re-done however the rooms were clean and serviceable and the bed was comfortable to sleep in,3
7776,i agree with the other reviewers it's not the most beautiful and accommodating place to stay but the complimentary breakfast was horrible,3
7777,room was ok but there was no signal in our room,3
7778,went back to the desk to find no one there for some time y the looks of the rope and landscape around the pole,3
7779,there was a fan in the room that i had was on the second floor,3
7780,often we had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel,3
7781,i needed a place to stay when visiting yosemite,3
7782,served coffee at the desk in the morning that my room had no heat,3
7783,the hotel was located in a bad area of town,3
7784,bathroom is fairly newer but still could use an upgrade but they keep it clean,3
7785,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was because there was a long wait,3
7786,overall this is a great place to stay,3
7787,printer that was available for customer stay did not work the second evening i stayed here,3
7788,it's not the 4 seasons but this hotel is a bit dated and needs some updating,3
7789,nice hotel and service but the price was the best part,3
7790,where we stayed children ran up and down them it was loud,3
7791,smelled like cigarette smoke in the lobby and breakfast area were very nice and friendly,3
7792,this was our first visit to virginia beach and we wanted to watch the game while we dined and had some drinks,3
7793,this is an excellent location right next to canyon entrance,3
7794,overall i don't believe that it was worth 148 for the one night we had a dinner for,3
7795,my room ac didn't work very well,3
7796,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any headboards or pictures over the beds,3
7797,however they don't have enough outlets in the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms,3
7798,so friendly here they go out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face,3
7799,this hotel was obviously older and worn but the room was a bit warm as we could not find the motel,3
7800,bed was not very comfortable but it wasn't that good on the property not worth the all inclusive price,3
7801,the woman at the front desk to complain and they disconnected me,3
7802,room service breakfast was 30 min late and i had to put another 150 hold on my credit card,3
7803,for the price i'm sure we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter,3
7804,we were looking for an overnight place to stay while in osage beach well i highly recommend this property,3
7805,the head of the bed wasn't so hard and the pillows tiny,3
7806,there was a microwave in the room but we were to tired to deal with it when i checked in so i didn't complain,3
7807,the shower pressure was very weak and the shower head was original very worn and stuck in a mist,3
7808,the continental breakfast was one of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a couple days,3
7809,front desk was very friendly and our room was quite large with a full kitchen,3
7810,i checked out early and the motel didn't want to give because she said the dog was big,3
7811,we were spending two nights in north platte and basically needed just a place to stay before skiing the next day,3
7812,the reservation process for this hotel was excellent for our needs,3
7813,hotel was ok but the room was not clean,3
7814,i needed a place to sleep for a few hours so that was frustrating,3
7815,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice view on the 2nd floor that was quieter,3
7816,they moved us to another room smelled of smoke and toilet paper stuck in exhaust fan,3
7817,the second dining room was downstairs and we never used it but it was due to this hotel still having smoking rooms,3
7818,staff was very friendly and even let us check in 3 hours early and gave us excellent suggestions for meals,3
7819,the first night we checked in it was a pain but the front desk guy was rude,3
7820,not sure we would stay here again for price i paid,3
7821,the bathroom was clean and the staff was very friendly eager to fix problems,3
7822,beds could have been better but it was quiet and friendly,3
7823,the girl at the counter was really nice and i went to the lobby they had 3 computers but only 1 worked,3
7824,right next to hon'l's beach and walking distance to many shops restaurants and prudential center,3
7825,front desk staff was not friendly and had to be out of our vacation rental that day,3
7826,the room was average and the bathroom was a little outdated,3
7827,loved the look of the hotel but the room was clean but the mattress of the king sized bed was comfortable and shower was nice,3
7828,we stayed for a week choosing this hotel because of its ratings and price,3
7829,they drive large trucks and usually make a lot of noise from the street so ear plugs are useful,3
7830,the hotel is right on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
7831,bug big was found in one of the rooms on the side facing away from the interstate,3
7832,we were two people in a room with 2 queen beds but i wasn't there to get a room service cart,3
7833,i had to stand with my 2 kids at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do,3
7834,the room had a stain on it but the bed was good and breakfast was above average,3
7835,we arrived early so the room was a bit damp and the air conditioner did not cool off the room for several hours,3
7836,big fan i have stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
7837,i left my hat in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh,3
7838,innkeepers were helpful and nice and it was mostly clean,3
7839,i dreaded getting out of the pool and it was very cloudy,3
7840,it was a great place to stay for the weekend 4th of july festivities,3
7841,the hotel was clean and quiet however the staff was very professional and courteous,3
7842,with it true but it doesn't pretend to be,3
7843,other than that it was a false alarm,3
7844,and the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet that was free but opted to go across the street to another place,3
7845,would have been happier had they provided some sort of breakfast would be available,3
7846,overall the hotel was fine and the mattress was old and sagged in the middle,3
7847,the bathroom was clean but there was a roach in our room but unfortunately did not have one,3
7848,the staff was welcoming the night was clean and safe and we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again,3
7849,good place to stay for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
7850,it went on until 12 midnight which i thought was bit much for the quality of the rooms,3
7851,this place has a great location and a very helpful friendly staff,3
7852,in the room itself the bath towels were very rough and the bed had a burnhole in it,3
7853,room smelled a little like a boys locker room when i first arrived but it was switched to another,3
7854,spacious rooms and comfy beds but that doesn't make up for having to leave without showering,3
7855,00 hold on my debit card and as of monday it was still there when we checked out in the morning,3
7856,our stay was pleasant staff very friendly but the breakfast staff was very friendly and helpful,3
7857,without checking i was told that there was a printer and computer in the lobby was wonderful,3
7858,the arion resort and spa hotel is not a bad choice for a one night stay on our way to gulf shores al,3
7859,called the front desk to let them know i was there,3
7860,the room was in the detached block and i believe the owner's wife,3
7861,i was the last one to check in for the day when we were there at 11,3
7862,we did use the pool which was very nice as it was our anniversary,3
7863,breakast was the usual fare and the staff was very friendly and checked me in very quickly,3
7864,however have stayed at other marriot courtyards and was completely satisfied but this one was old and everything in it worked,3
7865,the king size bed was comfortable making for a good night's sleep is the most important thing,3
7866,all i can say is this was our first visit to an americinn property,3
7867,no options for room service and the pillows were very thick and hard,3
7868,the restaurant opens at 7 and we had to wait more than 45 minutes for shuttle service,3
7869,the room does have a refrigerator and some don't,3
7870,let's just say that wasn't the hotel's fault they say that they are in the middle of a business park,3
7871,the room was clean but there was nothing stocked in it,3
7872,shower and bathroom while appeared to be clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly,3
7873,would recommend it to a friend but i think it amplified the noise a bit from the other rooms,3
7874,i arrive into dc on a late flight got to the hotel our room was on the top floor,3
7875,i feel that for the price it was an acceptable stay,3
7876,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
7877,she was the best part of this hotel is close to railroad tracks,3
7878,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
7879,comfy beds and clean pool not to bad for the price but hey what do you expect at the last minute,3
7880,my husband and i stayed here for our visit to the bourbon trail,3
7881,the price of the room was great towels bedding but outside the room was very nicely sized,3
7882,the room was fine and the staff wasn't overly friendly,3
7883,other than that the hotel was okay to me,3
7884,stay away from this hotel if you have any problems talk to claudette,3
7885,they did bring about 8 pool towels after we went to the ip for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it,3
7886,breakfast was good but having three very large flies in the room that i almost asked for a room with 2 double full sized beds,3
7887,no problem we went to the front desk because they didn't have my reservation when i arrived,3
7888,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
7889,the hotel was just okay needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose,3
7890,the renovations on the bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get ready makeup wise,3
7891,our main complaint was that the beds were not comfortable,3
7892,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was comfy and the room was immaculately clean,3
7893,however there was one employee a woman at front desk was so very helpful getting wifi for me,3
7894,this hotel is no longer a country inn and suites brand cause we had stayed there many times before with out these problems,3
7895,after four days i did not have to use stairs and was close to where i had business meetings,3
7896,our room was ok but for the price i paid to this property,3
7897,also i understand that the rooms need to be cleaned vacuumed better along the,3
7898,there were only a hand full of cars in the parking lot adjacent to the access door and the smoke filtered in,3
7899,stayed here in april 2016 for one night only and felt that it was very overpriced for what we got,3
7900,that said location is good and the hotel has a welcoming feel and is has a nice warm decor,3
7901,the hotel is in the middle of remodeling so it was hard to get on and off,3
7902,the rooms then were updated and clean and the bed was relatively comfortable,3
7903,thought room had a stale smell and i wiped down the room myself when we got there the hotel power has just come back on,3
7904,overall a good stay but was a little disconcerted when i went to the lobby they had 3 computers but only 1 worked,3
7905,kudos to the workers for being so kind and i'm sure he would've switched us,3
7906,after i called hotels and they send a new confirmation i got a room which clearly has had smokers in it before,3
7907,bed was comfortable and the room was hot humid and musty,3
7908,the breakfast was nice for continental fair and it was a quiet neighborhood with a few resurants and a gas station,3
7909,as the title said it was not the hotel's fault,3
7910,i may return if i'm in the area but the hotel was very nice and went out of their way to please,3
7911,overall my stay was good for the kids,3
7912,the lobby and dining area for the price could have had a room away from the tracks,3
7913,this wasn't because there was a baseball tournament going on with several of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel,3
7914,the walk wasn't bad but my friends room on the 3rd floor and when you exited the elevator the smoke smell was terrible,3
7915,the first floor which we walked through to get to the pool above the parking garage,3
7916,if you are only looking for a clean economical place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids,3
7917,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but we had a good experience,3
7918,i was happy to see a longhorn steakhouse,3
7919,the work was very loud and spoke to the front desk and garage had that ghetto feel but the room was comfortable,3
7920,the hotel lobby is nice and the design is pretty cool,3
7921,i would not stay again on this hotel or any of the hotels in the area didn't appear much better from the outside,3
7922,the room and kitchen was clean but the dressing area was disgusting i didn't even think to ask for another room,3
7923,it was typical for other comfort suites i've stayed in worse happy i was only there 3 hours,3
7924,old hotel but great location for the price would stay again,3
7925,we asked the front desk to let them know i was there,3
7926,not deluxe but clean and quiet with a comfortable bed and a bathroom that needed a scrub cleaning,3
7927,so as you can imagine i was trying to wrangle luggage and a 2-year-old,3
7928,they did put us on the 4th floor 2nd floor was completely gutted,3
7929,the rooms are not very clean and the staff was very nice and helpful,3
7930,there isn't a door to the hall didn't close properly,3
7931,the hotel was noisy in the halls and neighboring rooms,3
7932,location was superb very easy to walk for anything you need,3
7933,we had dogs barking for hours throughout our stay that we were able to stay in the heavy traffic,3
7934,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of old cologne steps from the river dom restaurants etc,3
7935,clean non smoking rooms with plenty of towels and you get continental breakfast free,3
7936,otherwise it was cheap and convenient for a same day booking on a friday night with the option to pay or leave,3
7937,the ventilation in the bathroom was quite spacious as well,3
7938,but it is very close to disney parks,3
7939,the renovations on the bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get ready makeup wise,3
7940,it was decent for the price and close to the expressway,3
7941,room had a smell and we didn't want to spend,3
7942,the reservation process for this hotel was excellent for our needs,3
7943,it was close to where i had to go in shifts so as not to leave the dog alone,3
7944,stayed in 412 the room was pretty basic but the staff was very polite and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
7945,on the bright side the room was very comfortable the staff is very friendly and helpful,3
7946,where we stayed children ran up and down them it was loud,3
7947,it was exactly what i wanted every morning,3
7948,i was not thinking much about the hotel but the hotel in general had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel,3
7949,the only real problem was there was no hot water and the phone did not work and we did not have time to use it,3
7950,there was no need to ask to be moved to a room that appeared to have not been thoroughly cleaned,3
7951,if you're using gps remember that you have to pay for it you are just a regular customer,3
7952,however don't know if all of the rooms face outside typical red roof,3
7953,but other than that it was as good as it gets within the walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
7954,two bright spots were the location of the hotel is smash burger and their olive oil and basil french fries,3
7955,overall the hotel was clean and the location couldn't have been nicer,3
7956,water pressure in shower was good but the pool was super dirty,3
7957,we are happy you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
7958,the room was nice the pool was ok and the free breakfast was a plus,3
7959,when i got there they give me a smoking room and had to smell smoke all night not happy,3
7960,staff were friendly but the hotel wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet,3
7961,didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot doors opening closing all night people talking etc,3
7962,for one night it was not a room to spend much time here so i didn't complain about it,3
7963,i have stayed 2 other times at this hotel and the wingate were nearly equally ranked and priced on this site,3
7964,but the sheraton offenbach hotel is an older hotel with fresh looking carpeting but the hotel is clean as well as our room,3
7965,place is very low cost and walking distance to many shops restaurants and prudential center,3
7966,our room upstairs was ok stayed for one night while waiting for a flight from lax,3
7967,this also lead to problems with the breakfast in the morning but what about us tea drinkers,3
7968,the outside of the hotel is lovely and the staff is friendly and helpful,3
7969,i would stay here again if i needed a place to crash for a night you could stay at worst,3
7970,right off i-96 easy to get to from back bay t,3
7971,the out side area had not been cleaned ants were crawling in the windows and the service was friendly and clean,3
7972,i guess it should be priced at 39,3
7973,this hotel is located right off the highway which made it easy to walk there and do some window shopping,3
7974,my routine questions about whether the room we were given had an air conditioning unit that was very loud,3
7975,inside was clean but very much in need of updating food was extremely basic but the staff was friendly,3
7976,we have stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past so i know what to expect,3
7977,it seemed like with a little bit of dirt hair left from,3
7978,the front desk manager was very kind and helpful and gave us a lot of money as opposed to staying in a hotel,3
7979,the hotel was fully booked when i arrived but the staff at the front desk in the morning said that he would not pay,3
7980,he told me to start calling them the next day at 5 pm we took it,3
7981,basic room with two large beds that took up most of the room so the other queen bed couldn't see the tv that well,3
7982,stayed in 412 the room was pretty basic but it was ok,3
7983,came up for a wedding and it served our needs for a place to sleep on a budget this hotel is worth looking at,3
7984,but everything was clean and the staff were very friendly,3
7985,the bath towels were very rough and the bed had a big slope in the middle on one side,3
7986,it was my first time staying there,3
7987,it seemed like with a little bit of dirt hair left from,3
7988,the walls were thin and you could hear people in the hallways at night very clearly,3
7989,hotel semmed like what you would expect from an older ramada,3
7990,we were there to visit universities in the area and invited my significant other to stay with me,3
7991,it really is bare bones in terms of amenities but if you don't want to spend a lot for a room,3
7992,there was mold on the ceiling and running down a door,3
7993,the hotel was fully booked when i arrived but the staff at the reception two gentlemen working there,3
7994,the club car is nice but the staff was very helpful,3
7995,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
7996,i can't be too hard on this hotel because i just wanted a quiet comfortable place to sleep that didn't break the bank,3
7997,we had four rooms with our family and the hotel was right in it,3
7998,it isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and it's a short ferry ride to bellagio too,3
7999,i ended up not staying at the super 8 in ithaca which was awesome,3
8000,appeared to be somewhat recently renovated the room was clean but the hotel was full late july,3
8001,the staff is friendly and the internet was very slow at times,3
8002,breakfast was good but staff could not keep up with the amount of people staying in each room rented 2,3
8003,when we returned to the room to work on it,3
8004,beds very nice by any standard and the pool was dirty and not cared for,3
8005,i understand i am not a 5 star hotel but i would return,3
8006,when we asked about hilton honors she told us we booked through expedia and when we checked in,3
8007,the stay was ok but we wouldn't stay there for a long time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
8008,the conference was efficient and the front desk only had one person working,3
8009,ac was good bed was comfy enough pools are great and staff are very friendly and accommodating breakfast was very good with a nice selection,3
8010,we loved being right on the water and steps from downtown,3
8011,when checked into the room there was a ceiling hatch awkwardly hanging open,3
8012,the housekeeping staff did not properly service the room on the 2nd floor that was quieter,3
8013,we were minding our own business in the large gathering room that we were moved to was in much better condition,3
8014,as usual i booked a non-smoking room that reaked of smoke,3
8015,the location was very dirty place under a bridge the restaurant was empty and that should have been a sign,3
8016,however i was there for a week and i stayed at this place years ago and really enjoyed our stay,3
8017,we told them about it and nothing was done until end of day,3
8018,the downside is that you are also close to the elevator and into my room,3
8019,it is in a fantastic location easy walk to the stadium an easy safe walk from the hotel,3
8020,i chose this hotel based on the fact that they were not emptied in a while and the fact that they accept pets,3
8021,it is a decent hotel right off the freeway so it's easy to bring your own sheets,3
8022,after complaining they moved us to another room,3
8023,the room i had reserved wasn't available and they put me in a cab to go to another hotel,3
8024,the exterior isn't much to look at but the rooms are made for people over 6 feet tall,3
8025,this time we got a 1-br unit and it was small but adequate and clean as was the en-suite bathroom,3
8026,very nice hotel but could never recommend because of the thieves at the front desk just a note saying to wait,3
8027,the hotel was located in a great spot,3
8028,when we checked in the front desk had no explanation,3
8029,i informed melvin that i didn't use anything the charge would be reversed,3
8030,stayed over for a night on our way down to the gulf coast,3
8031,valet parking is mandatory as there is no a c the room is a good size,3
8032,this hotel is located right across the street from boardwalk bowl,3

8034,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the way of enjoying our vacation,3
8035,the room was clean and the staff were great especially during check in,3
8036,one of the women working the desk was outside smoking and there was no other parking options that i found available,3
8037,place was great room next to us barked for 7 hours,3
8038,when we arrived for bfast there was nowhere to set wrap glasses room key etc,3
8039,we wanted to stay 3 nights but had to switch rooms after the first night to a totally different quality of room,3
8040,if you're looking for an economical room close to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
8041,there are lots of hotels in the area unless i am flying,3
8042,the place is ok a little old but it was clean,3

8046,further out of town than i expected and the surrounding area in general is rather high class and quiet,3
8047,tiki bar and pool nice and clean as well however i was very disappointed in the security and response from the front desk,3
8048,however i have learned some of the rooms were closed for renovations,3
8049,there were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a room next door 335 and everything seemed to work,3
8050,the front desk clerk was very friendly and the room was spacious and comfortable,3
8051,at 6:30 i gave up showered and went down to the front desk again blaming it on the hotels reservation,3
8052,it feels unfair to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under construction but front desk help was pleasant and rooms were clean,3
8053,but on the first morning we were informed that we were charged for smoking,3
8054,the hotel was clean and very quiet and the staff very friendly but we could hear the people walking upstairs,3
8055,the good great location restaurants nearby you can walk to ihop and a short drive to bertuccis olive garden shopping,3
8056,the sink was dirty and the pool was dirty,3
8057,it's location is good and the lobby is well lit,3
8058,no choice of other hotels in the area and were pleased with the condition of the rooms this is extreme,3
8059,i requested a smoking room and clearly we did not request nor seem to pay for,3
8060,and hung up on me the second time i have stayed at other spots closer to the shore and more updated,3

8066,my only complaints 1 the a c unit to put suitcases,3
8067,it is a hostel so obviously it's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh,3
8068,additionally the walls are paper thin and i could hear the traffic hubby sleeps with ear plugs i had to keep door closed,3
8069,offered a continental breakfast but would prefer some sealed food for those of us needing to stay near the airport,3
8070,we often stay at this older country inn on our way to gatlinburg and this hotel is right off the highway so it was quieter,3
8071,cracker barrel restaurant right across the parking lot for,3
8072,our room was moderate clean and had a free wi-fi is only free after you sign up for a loyalty program,3
8073,the room with a balcony which we stayed in was extremely hot the ac was barely working,3
8074,after reading a prior review from a lady i was a little disappointed in our stay here,3
8075,i needed a place to crash but don't expect 4 star standards,3
8076,i can only comment on what i was hearing it sounded like they were in my room,3
8077,there was too many flies in the room that wasn't pleasant,3
8078,the room was clean and i felt safe and the shower water was great temperature wise,3
8079,comfy beds just don't expect anything fancy,3
8080,the hotel room was very clean with a good shower and comfortable beds,3
8081,if you are needing to be in the hotel very much,3
8082,the carpet on the floor was a bit dirty but it's a little old need to upgrade bathrooms,3
8083,the owners are very nice and comfortable and wifi worked fine,3
8084,i was very pleased with the location of the hotel was told they do not have an,3
8085,new tv did not work and we did not feel uncomfortable at all,3
8086,got in late as we were on our way to kansas and were hoping for a better night,3
8087,i would stay here again if the price was right so not much to complain about really,3
8088,you could hear traffic and people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1,3
8089,it was a nice place to stay near worcester,3
8090,right at the end of the day it's a pretty short drive to laguna beach and some shopping centers,3
8091,a little worry about the bathroom because there is only one trash can rather than one in the bathroom and has little counter space,3
8092,if the room linens would not have been any other place to go,3
8093,we needed a place to sleep like us,3
8094,i was locked in my room for me which was unexpected,3
8095,ok for a 2 star hotel it was clean enough and decent but overall a little drab for the price,3
8096,the hotel was fine for our needs and we were mere blocks from the boardwalk and you definitely can walk from the hotel,3
8097,i strongly suggest not staying at this hotel if you have a car or are taking the metro,3
8098,i am from singapore so i am not concerned about it,3
8099,there was blood on the shower curtain on the inside,3
8100,the hotel was nice but it was the same price,3
8101,there was no need to ask to be moved to another room that had the carpet cleaned and the carpet was torn in places,3
8102,one was the inability to be able to breathe at night,3
8103,even though it was an indoor pool you would have to get back to the hotel when it was getting dark,3
8104,we did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of the standard breakfast offerings and the coffee was very bad,3
8105,try to get a low floor because when the hotel is not at full capacity because it is,3
8106,pluses close to lackland afb 7 mi 10-15 min and there would be some sit down restaurants,3
8107,the room was nice and clean but there was a roach in our room,3
8108,i certainly don't have any more rooms,3
8109,the staff was very friendly and our room was very tired looking in terms of decor,3
8110,they give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was stiff and had springs poking me in the back,3
8111,the only minus is where my room was located behind the back of the house next to the kitchen and in front of the building,3
8112,they just don't do it man just don't do it man just don't do them,3
8113,the hotel itself is welcoming the staff friendly and helpful the room however was clean nicely done and very pleasant,3
8114,all in all it was pretty clean the neighborhood was great and the room was extremely clean and welcoming,3
8115,the beach cove resort hotel is an older hotel that you can tell they're trying to remodel,3
8116,there are snacks and other food for purchase in the lobby and breakfast available by 5:00 which is helpful for early morning sportsmen,3
8117,but when you asked for it they didn't have our reservation from when i booked 9 line at hotels,3
8118,good value in convenient location to where i was and i followed him to the hotel,3
8119,it's livable and the location is good several shopping centers nearby,3
8120,the public areas were well maintained but when i arrived i was given a handicapped room,3
8121,the vallet was a blessing and the staff was good and the location is great,3
8122,other than that staff was friendly and did help out with some things in our room and it was quiet,3
8123,we went down to breakfast and the staff was accommodating to the limit of their facilities,3
8124,the hotel met our needs for a place to sleep at night,3
8125,staff is pretty friendly and the rooms were average but clean with some upgrades,3
8126,most of the staff was friendly and the room was extremely small,3
8127,shower curtain was damaged and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo,3
8128,not 5 star but still not the standard we expected,3
8129,would i stay again probably for the price and location i would for sure stay here again if i was on the second level,3
8130,while an older property the room was quiet and i slept well for the first time,3
8131,it almost seemed that every time we went to the front desk and they took care of it,3
8132,other than this small the room was and how large it was,3
8133,way too many people for the pool and side doors etc,3
8134,the hotel rooms were a little out dated,3
8135,the hotel was right off the highway and they'll give you a voucher for mcdonald's which is right next door,3
8136,did not spend a lot of money for the stay,3
8137,great location for seeing boston with a small market across the street and meet at the hotel next door,3
8138,only bad thing i have to say i really don't think he should work in this hotel,3
8139,this is a great place to crash for a nite or so,3
8140,we were not happy with the location of the hotel is under renovation but we had an old room and it showed,3
8141,my fianc and i stayed here for one night before flying home after a cruise,3
8142,after driving a lot i was in need of updating food was extremely basic but the staff was friendly and helpful during check in,3
8143,we were spending two nights in north platte and basically needed just a place to crash but that is about it,3
8144,great location for seeing boston with a small market across the street and meet at the hotel next door,3
8145,marie was wonderful at the front desk were luckily able to find a room close by i found one here,3
8146,needless to say my family and i had to call hotel to wake her up,3
8147,this hotel isn't a bad option for a quick overnight and this fit the bill,3
8148,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue for those sensitive to it,3
8149,the majority of staff were very nice but seemed understaffed,3
8150,this was our second stay at this hotel was only 25,3
8151,once in the room it died they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc,3
8152,it is an ok place to stay if you don't want to cook,3
8153,nice rooms that have been updated recently but not worth the price and not entirely negative reviews,3
8154,the free breakfast was not worth it compared to other hotels in the area are better,3
8155,coffee in the room would have been nice to have more,3
8156,for a last minute booking and on a friday night lucky for us there was a perkins across the street,3
8157,oops ken just told me if i asked for a manager she offered fruit for my inconvenience,3
8158,this is the second time we've stayed here before on a couple of tours paid by the hotel and have it charged to my,3
8159,overall we had a nice stay and an awesome view of the ocean amusement park,3
8160,it was just a place for me to sleep for the night but the a c wasnt working so i called for service,3
8161,this is an older hotel now showing its age but the beds were great,3
8162,wasn't expecting much for breakfast but it was pretty much what you'd expect,3
8163,dear valued guest thank you for taking the time to write a review and for choosing to stay with us,3
8164,not good if you have more than one machine in a 4 story hotel,3
8165,i think i will be going back to the hotel from a 13 hour motorcycle ride,3
8166,the room was in the detached block and i believe the owner's wife,3
8167,having said that there are some drawbacks there is no coffee maker in room but motel coffee is in the breakfast room till 7 am,3
8168,i told the girl at the desk was pleasant and wide awake,3
8169,there was no hair dryer and when we went to go sightseeing the door would not close unless i pushed it shut 140,3
8170,i think that this hotel was rated 4,3
8171,breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for what you get,3
8172,but if you are looking for a clean bed shower t,3
8173,breakfast was good but the pool was very pretty and the food good,3
8174,our housekeeper was good but there was a tear in the comforter,3
8175,i enjoyed having the restaurant in the evening which was a little inconvenient to have to trek across the parking lot into the night,3
8176,we later found out they were short staffed,3
8177,at check in the attendant was very friendly and went out of his way to make sure everyone was taken care of,3
8178,work out room was nice to have an indoor pool and hot tub,3
8179,coffee maker is stored under the sink in the room had blood on it upon arrival,3
8180,nice cheap place to stay for the price,3
8181,we stayed at this hotel because of the hotel being under renovations it is hard to make really old carpet look very clean,3
8182,there � � �s no sound proofing and you can hear the footsteps in the walkway in the morning,3
8183,that smell seeps into all areas of the hotel and the personality of the housekeeper for our area,3
8184,the rooms were quiet but a little outdated the beds were not comfortable and only double not queen,3
8185,pool was good temp but it needs to be re-done however the rooms were very outdated,3
8186,breakfast was served temporarily in the small bar and was not the one i booked per the picture,3
8187,needed an inexpensive place to stay for a night on our way to yosemite,3
8188,no working fan in the bathroom may have attributed to the mold on the ceiling and running down a door,3
8189,the beds in our room and the bathroom looked like it had never ever been cleaned,3
8190,you can't beat the price and the staff was good and the product was good,3
8191,would like better brand coffee in the room and there were no bars of soap,3
8192,was told that my family could check in early but when we got there we were told that this service was not offered,3
8193,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was an older place that had been updated,3
8194,all i can say is this was our first time staying at a hampton inn hotel,3
8195,the hotel was fine and the bed was even smaller,3
8196,it's a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
8197,in general this hampton falls short in many areas and i do not recommend this to tourist good for needing somewhere to stay,3
8198,the motel is further from the highway so it wasn't hard to find,3
8199,wasn't the worst room i've had at a comfort inn in a long time,3
8200,climate control fan was extremely noisy as well as the rooms but functional,3
8201,nothing wrong with the room was the matteress it was old wore down and needs to be freshened up a bit,3
8202,i was checked in by a nice gentleman and my room was clean didn't smell and was comfortable,3
8203,rather there was only a tiny shelf in the shower and found a lot more,3
8204,breakfast fare was not good but overall it was good as a family trip,3
8205,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but close enough to where i had to go ask for a blanket,3
8206,rather dated but our room was clean the bed comfortable and the room was large and very clean the upstairs ice machine did not work,3
8207,we came back for a visit and found the hotel to be a bit more than ordinary,3
8208,although the room was clean otherwise and the pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment,3
8209,the location was great in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk,3
8210,the combined parking facilities total 3 were good enough and it was very cold drafty,3
8211,on the plus side rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
8212,rooms are very nice for the price we paid for it,3
8213,there were fairly large cracks in the walls and scratches on the tub,3
8214,fiesta inn centro historico is right next door to the freeway so expect a bit of noise,3
8215,staff was extremely friendly and helpful staff,3
8216,breakfast left something to be desired but they had waffles and that was a horrible experience the location was very nice with restaurants all around,3
8217,i stayed here for one night on our way to mexico missouri,3
8218,although i did find it a little expensive for what you get book online for better prices,3
8219,told it was no pet floor but there was a tear in the carpet and the walls and doors were marked,3
8220,guests are allowed to smoke outside of the hotel and the lot was flooded ankle deep in some places,3
8221,the room was worth the price it was an acceptable stay,3
8222,there was only one in the room and throughout the hotel,3
8223,hotel is older and in need of a major change,3
8224,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
8225,and no we did not have any options for a room,3
8226,the room was clean and comfortable but nothing particularly special,3
8227,called around 1-2pm to ensure my room100 was going to be a romantic night turned out to be not accepting credit card,3
8228,and it took a long time for the water in the area has a brown tint,3
8229,we were in-town for one night and no cc on its tv,3
8230,but if u just need a place to rest and sleep a while this motel is very acceptable,3
8231,basic place good for a place to crash but that is about it,3
8232,we needed an extra blanket and the lady in the room was terribly loud,3
8233,just be prepared to help the staff if you need a bed close to the airport this works,3
8234,the hotel itself was nice the rooms were nice and clean i saw three of them,3
8235,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
8236,i'm torn about vista hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub,3
8237,we have stayed here a couple of years ago and we liked it,3
8238,it was hard to move around the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with,3
8239,at least i did not see an elevator as that would have been easier if without a car,3
8240,i think i will be going back there next year,3
8241,the hotel was nice but the bed was good and breakfast was above average,3
8242,the front desk lady was very polite and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
8243,after searching and being unable to find a room i was comfortable with,3
8244,and technologically behind as they are charging for wifi in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones,3
8245,not as nice as we have come to expect from super 8 motels,3
8246,for the price i'm sure we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter,3
8247,but considering they were it was still a nice place to stay near the university of washington,3
8248,a large bathroom but the sink is too high square sink on top of the head boards and the lights,3
8249,the inside of hotel and rooms are clean and seem newly renovated,3
8250,i neglected to note there was no elevator and the wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction,3
8251,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to pay 5 a day which isn't bad,3
8252,the room was fine and the staff were accommodating,3
8253,the hotel is right on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
8254,we turned it off overnight though we were on the 3rd floor unless you smoke,3
8255,also room we were given was so small we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit,3
8256,stayed here for business and it was good and came super fast,3
8257,yet the manager was very courteous and helpful during my stay,3
8258,the pool was tiny and the breakfast wasn't all that great,3
8259,the fan in the bathroom was quite spacious as well,3
8260,the two down falls were limited parking and there was no available parking i had to create a spot,3
8261,room service breakfast was 30 min late and i had to ask for the second breakfast coupon and only received one cocktail coupon,3
8262,it was a non-smoking room which was confirmed at check-in and it was immediately credited upon check-out,3
8263,there was not a good selection for breakfast the ice machine on the 2nd floor you could still hear everything outside,3
8264,after a 30 minute discussion with the front desk staff were very attentive and helpful,3
8265,it isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and helpful and this was a good location clean rooms and good staff,3
8266,there is no pool also there is no alcohol available in the entire town,3
8267,having said that there are some drawbacks there is no coffee maker in guest rooms no room service,3
8268,we were dissaponted that the pool was closed for cleaning,3
8269,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to place our order while our waiter bypassed us several times,3
8270,we didn't expect anything special and we didn't have any protein provided which is kind of surprise and disappointed e,3
8271,i pointed out that i understood was there to confirm the day staff knew of the proposed room change,3
8272,in a rough neighbourhood but that's not much of a view in any direction,3
8273,it stormed one night and the parking lot,3
8274,the only complaint we had was that we didn't get much sleep,3
8275,room was good enough for a short one night stay on a trip to walt disney world,3
8276,good value in convenient location to where i was having a medical procedure,3
8277,served coffee at the desk in the morning and i think they could make better signs if that was really a problem,3
8278,the best soup and salad bar in all of the hotels i stayed in,3
8279,the hotel was a good location for us,3
8280,the hotel staff was extremely nice and the hotel was conveniently at a good rate this hotel would work fine,3
8281,the train close to this hotel is either indifferent or incompetent,3
8282,my wife and i enjoyed the comfortable king bed and pillows we got a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
8283,great staff lots of traffic in out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
8284,i didn't like that there wasn't a temporary parking area to check in we were hit with a very pungent odor,3
8285,upon checking in the lady at the desk said they had no house keeping staff at 10 pm,3
8286,we were so tired and did not get backtill late in the evening,3
8287,the room was a bit damp and the air conditioner cycled on and off,3
8288,they printed directions for us as we were in walking distance of whatever you need if you don't mind the gangstas,3
8289,the ice machine was not working on the second day we stayed two nights,3
8290,my husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the day we were checking out,3
8291,the floors were pretty thin so we could hear the conversations of the people next to us,3
8292,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
8293,we asked for a different room but it was just ok,3
8294,not good if you have more than one person at a time,3
8295,i rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the food was below average and multiple items were not stocked,3
8296,we have never had a problem with ants but it was cleaned in a timely manner,3
8297,i rented a room with a great view of mt,3
8298,overall good stay but the room felt very very damp the whole time,3
8299,i think the price was a little high for what it was,3
8300,the service is nice that the staff is very friendly and helpful and this was a definite plus,3
8301,although we didn't need it there was a kitchen living room and two dining rooms,3
8302,being long distance my boyfriend and i have been to many americinns and expected much more,3
8303,the sink was dirty and the pool was closed and not working,3
8304,all in all still a nice place to stay near the airport,3
8305,close to the airport so i can't comment on it,3
8306,2 the hot breakfast was meh and the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups,3
8307,the service was outstanding both at the desk and it was no problem to get one,3
8308,tv was old and in need of a good nights rest,3
8309,this place was a budget price i would not have booked here if we had know that,3
8310,the air conditioner in our room didn't work neither did the air conditioner making the room stuffy,3
8311,evening social meal good as well as the chico state campus,3
8312,the room was okay but one of the least expensive for the area,3
8313,we would readily recommend this hotel for its proximity to the mall of america,3
8314,i found out during the night that my room had no problems getting a receipt for her complete stay,3
8315,50 for one night is way too expensive for being the save a lot of the marriott brand,3
8316,i booked it anyway due to the price and the breakfast was a joke,3
8317,the hotel has been updated so don't let that keep you from staying here,3
8318,the hotel staff was very helpful and professional when i got sick,3
8319,the 2nd morning we didn't even try to use it,3
8320,fortunately friends volunteered to keep her so we were able to get us additional towels as there was only one working socket in the room,3
8321,the only thing wrong with the room in fact the bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good,3
8322,all can say is i do not know if any rooms do have one,3
8323,my issues with this place are that there was no coffee pot in the room,3
8324,overall not too bad though if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills,3
8325,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the bed and the mattress was almost non-existent,3
8326,you get what you pay for but there was no signal in our room,3
8327,i was commuting to dusseldorf each day so it was sweltering at night when we got back,3
8328,i was disappointed by a couple of things that i was very disappointed that i had to relocate because they were having some water issues,3
8329,pool and hot tub area were very nice and changed my room to the 5th floor,3
8330,price was good but the pool was not open,3
8331,the options are limited so we had no programming to see,3
8332,the rooms suite at this hotel are extremely nice and helpful need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry,3
8333,it was also very disappointing when we went to get blankets for it we were given a second room which had the electrical messed up,3
8334,if you didn't know you were going to have to wait for quite a while for the only receptionist to deal with other customers,3
8335,vanity and shower had lots of hot water,3
8336,the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard and the beds were dirty so we had to change rooms,3
8337,i missed having a coffee maker in the room and there were no kings available,3
8338,we had a single king size bed for 2 people,3
8339,i thought the room was a real disappointment,3
8340,our room was fine and the staff were responsive and friendly,3
8341,hotel was quite clean and in good working condition,3
8342,they assigned us a smoking room and i have asthma problems,3
8343,i rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
8344,however there was no crib in the room but the clerk brought one up right away,3
8345,for the price 140 night per room we felt that the hotel was not going to be in the hotel very much,3
8346,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could do,3
8347,room and furnishings were a bit worn but the bed was not what we were excpecting,3
8348,they just don't do it man just don't do it man just don't do them,3
8349,room was clean however if you're looking for a place to crash for the night we were there,3
8350,when i arrived the hotel was under construction for a remodel,3
8351,not very clean to say the least and some of the ceiling panels were missing,3
8352,the staff was notified we were checking in late and it was not a terrible stay but i will probably not be returning,3
8353,we booked this hotel for a weekend stay,3
8354,having said that there are some drawbacks there is no coffee maker in guest rooms no room service,3
8355,overall the hotel was showing its age but it's right on,3
8356,the floors could have been better but it was quiet and friendly,3
8357,there often is no one in the family slept well,3
8358,the tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise,3
8359,housekeeping staff was very good room was clean but furnishings were well-worn,3
8360,i stayed here with a couple of girl friends the hotel itself was ok but it was a nice area the staff was very nice,3
8361,bed was decent room was clean and the staff were all very pleasant and helpful,3
8362,the hotel is also close to the airport so i can't comment on that,3
8363,although i did find it a little expensive for microwaved sandwiches and there wasn't even toast,3
8364,i will try a different hotel the next time we visit family in the area,3
8365,place has potential but we had a good time here but it wasn't actually dirty,3
8366,good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance,3
8367,had to go to the airport and the cruise terminal,3
8368,there is no pool also there is no refrigerator in the rooms so don't bring alot of luggage,3
8369,the hotel is in dire need of updating as well as the rooms but functional,3
8370,list to pack prior to going 1 pillows horrible pillows in the room were very uncomfortable and was like sleeping on tiny little rocks,3
8371,on one day my room wasn't bad but my friends room on the 3rd floor but room itself very dated,3
8372,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
8373,my family stayed the weekend at the sf mandarin oriental,3
8374,old bedding pillows etc you pay for what you get located close to public transit and nice mall though,3
8375,being a last minute booking and on a friday night lucky for us there was a perkins across the street,3
8376,the beds were comfortable and it was in a separate block,3
8377,the hotel rooms are clean it is next to a couple of small shopping centers,3
8378,other then this incident it is a beautiful hotel in a great location on lake and has great rooftop restaurant and bar,3
8379,several other newer hotels in the immediate 60 mile radius area,3
8380,you could hear traffic and people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1,3
8381,not a five star hotel but the staff is very nice,3
8382,it was a little older and the staff was good and the place was clean and fine for a three star property,3
8383,we booked this hostel because it was the most expensive room on our trip and it was by far the worst experience,3
8384,you'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only one thus far that charges for internet access,3
8385,the signage with instructions for the hot tub was again dirty and cold,3
8386,the bartender was very nice and bed comfortable,3
8387,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't anything great about it either,3
8388,our toilet leaked so there was a lot of people through town much,3
8389,overall a good stay but the room felt very very damp the whole time,3
8390,worth on i 30 west is an older property that is adequate but not especially good,3
8391,i think the rooms need to be renovated to effectively block outside noise,3
8392,at 6:30 i gave up showered and went down to the front desk to check in as they were dropping someone off to the airport,3
8393,the maintenance man came to the room to work on it,3
8394,at the time we arrived it was too late around 8 pm as maintenance had left,3
8395,we were on our way to texas we stopped at this hotel after a competition wanted to relax in the apparent large pool,3
8396,we stayed here for a wedding and we had no clean towels to shower with,3
8397,there is no restaurant bar but you can walk to some others down the strip,3
8398,the hotel is clean and the beds were lovely and large,3
8399,for the price i'm sure we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter,3
8400,there was no way to notify me of this because the third-party reservation site there was nothing he could do about the error,3
8401,it had a smell and we didn't want to spend a lot of time at hotel,3
8402,the refrigerator was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and leave it parked there,3
8403,however the room was quite clean and that was all i needed,3
8404,no water to our room for a half hour after a call to the front desk to turn it off,3
8405,but everything was clean and in good condition,3
8406,i feel that for the price it was not worth it compared to other hotels in this price range,3
8407,air conditioning in room 114was so loud that i was unable to lower the water temperature in our shower,3
8408,pueblo bonito sunset is a beautiful hotel on the surface but lacking in quality of product,3
8409,the location was excellent if you are visiting the universal studios parks,3
8410,they attempted to resolve some issues we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged,3
8411,i stayed at the davie location which was very clean and the staff was good and the location is great,3
8412,i think if you buy single tickets from the hotel or you'll be stuck with the room service menu,3
8413,although the hotel is in the process of renovating the lobby area,3
8414,breakfast was fine and they had a free shuttle to the cruise terminal in the morning was kind and efficient,3
8415,the location was not easy to get to from i-81,3
8416,it is a hostel so obviously it's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh,3
8417,only downfall the room which was very small,3
8418,the location was great right across the street is a big hassle,3
8419,the location is great if you need to hear your alarm,3
8420,plenty of restaurants nearby and right across the road from the tucson airport fit the bill with some minor inconveniences,3
8421,stayed in 412 the room was pretty basic but it was ok,3
8422,broken mirror destroyed room phone but other than that it's nice quiet hotel and they have a nice continental breakfast,3
8423,as for the continental breakfast at 7 am only to find they were out of it,3
8424,i enjoyed my stay but it was a good choice for holiday dinner so we made reservations for the buffet 44 person,3
8425,it was a bit noisy as the person people in the room next to us barked for 7 hours,3
8426,overall a cute vintage hotel in a great area for where we were visiting so we would stay here again if they paid me,3
8427,the front desk gal was not very friendly but was efficient,3
8428,after a 30 minute discussion with the front desk and they took care of it fast,3
8429,after a late flight i needed a place to crash for a nite or so,3
8430,i asked the front desk to turn it off because of marijuana smell blowing into room,3
8431,the hotel is right in the center of the room so it was about 90,3
8432,it's within walking distance of mcdonald theater,3
8433,when we checked in our reservation were made through expedia even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
8434,it was on a hill and has a great view of the beach and the ocean,3
8435,good value in convenient location to where i was and i followed him to the hotel,3
8436,the food wasn't that good for sleeping,3
8437,we stayed at this hotel over a couple of days,3
8438,overall it was a good place to stay for a reasonable price for a night or two it's not bad,3
8439,we're happy you enjoyed your stay and we look forward to hosting you again in,3
8440,room was good enough for a republican convention,3
8441,i prepaid so i didn't want to help this person out at all,3
8442,not near the water but it was an easy location right off the tollway can not be beat,3
8443,have stayed in much nicer spots for the same price and had a much better room,3
8444,i stayed for one night only and felt that it was very clean with older amenities nothing fancy,3
8445,was nice but pieces in the wall in the room i stepped on the towel in the bathroom and one in the bedroom,3
8446,the room was very clean and nice rooms,3
8447,when people ran up and down the hallways yelling all night we did not get a fridge and the microwave was broken,3
8448,this was only a place to stay passing through it works,3
8449,clean room great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
8450,although the hotel is in dire need of a place to stay,3
8451,i put the do not disturb sign up,3
8452,on june 24th i checked in and was informed that the additional fees totaled more than 250,3
8453,staff was amazing corrected the issues and gave us a lot of money since it was just me and wasn't for a vacation,3
8454,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are bothered by traffic noise request a room in the south wing,3
8455,breakfast was lack luster but for what we stayed there for one night which i thought was pretty weird for a hotel,3
8456,the room was clean the beds were really comfy and the free breakfast was so-so but bed was amazing,3
8457,this place was a budget price i would not have stayed the first night,3
8458,we have 2 small kids and they didn't even offer queen sized beds when we ended up with the room we needed,3
8459,bed was fairly uncomfortable but we were only there for one night which i thought was pretty weird for a hotel,3
8460,good place to stay as it has will have many amenities for those looking for clean and comfortable environment it works,3
8461,when i got to the room there was water in the bathroom and has little counter space,3
8462,the ac was needed to be turned on in the lobby so maybe they are updating i'm not sure why it smelled that way,3
8463,it was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful,3
8464,it crosses the street about 200 yards from the hotel and you could always order in,3
8465,the curtains do not close in the room and a really weird shower,3
8466,room was very comfortable the staff is very accommodating and friendly,3
8467,lots of wasted space in the room to mask the smell,3
8468,there is no a c the room is a good size but it was very small and strangely carpeted in red with no hot tub,3
8469,the walls thin so heard people in the halls and being farther away would probably help,3
8470,i have stayed and rated this property a number of times for business and enjoyed my stay,3
8471,gentlemen at the front desk were luckily able to find a decent rate at this hotel,3
8472,was nice but jacuzzi tub in room was not swept on far side of 2nd bed from entrance,3
8473,the employees were very nice and the bathrooms were clean,3
8474,the service is nice that the staff is very pleasant and helpful the other the complete opposite,3
8475,other then that it was ok i will stay there again yes if the price still right,3
8476,we only used hj for an overnight stay when driving to your destination,3
8477,not enough towels or pillows given this time for a room that is an add on to the regular suite,3
8478,the entire door lock mechanism had to be replaced and so we did not use the pool and other amenities,3
8479,my family had nine rooms rented out which i think is the latest i saw for restaurants,3
8480,pool area was beautiful and the food was ok,3
8481,pueblo bonito sunset is a beautiful hotel on the surface but lacking in quality of product,3
8482,the laundry room also needed to be cleaned under the mattress there was a little bit of effort it could look alot better,3
8483,outside of our hotel room which is great the rest of the staff don't seem to get cleaned also have quite a musty smell,3
8484,i was disappointed with the appearance of the room and the ice machines are top notch,3
8485,we stayed there 3 days and it was like this was your first ever busy holiday,3
8486,i explained everything when we checked in earlier that day at 3:00 pm which would have been nice to have them,3
8487,the rooms were nice and we have stayed here in the past,3
8488,room was so so and the bed was hard and itchy,3
8489,the evening person gave me towels to put on the cream cheese as not everybody likes only sweet in the morning,3
8490,the hotel staff was friendly and helpful especially julio at the front desk was extremely helpful kind,3
8491,the kids working the front desk were luckily able to find a decent and affordable bb in cambridge for a 1-week stay,3
8492,first let me say if you want a location next to the gondola and center of town its what we settled for,3
8493,no frills so if you need a place to sleep after a long drive,3
8494,pretty good just there for a family reunion only have a few complaints,3
8495,towels looked pretty old used for a long time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
8496,the room does have a refrigerator and some don't,3
8497,we called the front desk to complain and they disconnected me,3
8498,the staff were friendly but they didn't touch our room,3
8499,we have not stayed at a red roof in a long time as we didn't want,3
8500,we stayed here just one night and found that the prices for the rooms in vegas were going to be out,3
8501,not a bad spot for just an overnight stay halfway to my destination,3
8502,our bathroom was old and not fresh there was a mild displeasing odor probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing,3
8503,the room was clean the decor was eclectic the location was great right across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses,3
8504,we didn't spend much time in room but it was booked for the festival on friday,3

8506,the front office manager was very helpful and room was adequate for a two nite gambling visit,3
8507,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't anything great about it either,3
8508,all in all the stay was ok the room was clean the clerk's service was exemplary,3

8510,it was decent for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
8511,didn't spend much time in room but it was booked for the festival on friday,3
8512,this did not matter to me since all i wanted to do was go to bed and when the next worker arrived,3
8513,we stayed at this laquinta for four nights and there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the hotel reflects that,3
8514,the handles don't turn so the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging unplugging it,3
8515,the location of this hotel was excellent staff was very courteous,3
8516,lots of kids and families running up and down the hallways till after 1 am,3
8517,location was great and we were able to fall asleep,3
8518,the water was out in the whole property and we were not told the pool was under construction,3
8519,here's a plus out the window from the room i was given had not been cleaned in a loong time,3
8520,this is my second stay at this hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park,3
8521,stay was fine only problem was they charged my credit card and i had a good experience but not this time,3
8522,we were so happy we had been able to stay in the jr,3
8523,there's only one person working the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone,3
8524,the curtains do not close in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing,3
8525,we paid extra for this hotel as it was close to very fine restaurants and great shopping centers,3
8526,told it was no pet floor but there was a rack with hanger and a some shelves behind a curtain,3
8527,overall my experience was good and i would stay here again for a night,3
8528,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
8529,other than that the stay was not bad,3
8530,we were in walking distance of whatever you need if you don't mind it being a little dated,3
8531,i traveled over 6 hrs and was told that because i didn't ask for anything after i checked in,3
8532,the staff was friendly and did help out with some things in our room from the previous occupants coke bottle sock,3
8533,personnel were nice room was adequate but old and dated,3
8534,the staff was friendly and the room wasn't anything special but the beds were clean and nice,3
8535,for our family of four the room was small and there is not enough parking,3
8536,i would stay here again for the price and location,3
8537,i was glad that our room did not smell and clean and that's all we needed on this trip,3
8538,very unusual that the hotel did not have an exhaust fan,3
8539,their breakfast is offered in the form of an apple pear and orange,3
8540,porsche at the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there,3
8541,hotel semmed like what you would expect from a comfort inn,3
8542,the sound-proof needs to be improved upon but other than that,3
8543,i only needed a place to sleep and change,3
8544,i stayed in a superior room with a king sized bed by the time we got there,3
8545,the reception staff was very polite and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
8546,you just have to remember that this used to be a coffee maker in the room,3
8547,i dreaded getting out of the room for at least an hour because of a faulty security lock,3
8548,being an old hotel the room was pretty basic but the staff was rude,3
8549,it was ok for a one night stay on our way to fort collins in a dog friendly room,3
8550,the room was clean but the dressing area was disgusting i didn't even think to ask but he did,3
8551,the ac was cold but noisy and difficult to sleep straight through the,3
8552,we stayed at this hotel recently when attending a concert at the webster theater on 3 26 16,3
8553,coffee in the room would have been nice to know that in advance,3
8554,staff was friendly and the bed was comfortable and clean and all that we needed,3
8555,this is the second time we've stayed here once before but this looks as if it will be our last stay,3
8556,there also is a pool out front but it was closed because we just had to drain it and change the levels,3
8557,the location was great directly off the highway which was convenient for us,3
8558,nice place to stay close to the airport which was a plus,3
8559,all the staff were very pleasant and accommodating the public hallways were clean and odor free but run down,3
8560,the hotel was great and the room was as advertised,3
8561,we reserved a queen but i think they put us in a different room closer to the lobby,3
8562,too many people so it was a bit run down but clean,3
8563,breakfast was minimal but for the price it was clean i felt safe and the staff was very polite and helpful,3
8564,this best western is in an older part of town but it has a parking garage and the car was fine,3
8565,nice furnishings and the bathroom was a little outdated,3
8566,very run down rooms smell breakfast is the worst of any hotel i've stayed in there was no shower cap,3
8567,i have one complaint the faucet in the bathtub had a couple of problems,3
8568,however i have learned some of the rooms can get a lot of,3
8569,the restaurant and bar staff were fabulous but our room had black mold on the shower curtain on the inside,3
8570,chose this hotel because it had free breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
8571,when i returned to the front desk clerk was very friendly and handed me our,3
8572,it was well located clean and met our needs for a place to crash but that is about it,3
8573,we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest and closest hotel within walking distance of this place,3
8574,the train close to this hotel is either indifferent or incompetent,3
8575,we've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the room was dark and lamps are not bright enough,3
8576,we had issues with the shower couldn't figure out the computer system and switched between two computers numerous times,3
8577,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to pay 5 a day which isn't bad,3
8578,at check-in the front desk had nothing to offer,3
8579,this hotel is convenient for us and close to the colleges,3
8580,the one big negative about the room was the smell musty moldy like the room had been cleaned well outside of the residual cigarette smell,3
8581,hair in the shower and i couldn't get on line to see what the problem was,3
8582,except this trip they were other guest 5 to 6 in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style,3
8583,we had a room in the back building,3
8584,little problems we had with the room was the matteress it was old wore down and needs to be freshened up a bit,3
8585,also there was no refrigerator in my room and i do not recommend it for very young children,3
8586,needless to say my family and i are staying in,3
8587,i chose this location due to the lack of any sun light,3
8588,we stayed on a lower floor and there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee pot in the room,3
8589,we would readily recommend this hotel for its convenience staff and clean rooms,3
8590,they are the worse i have ever seen at a hotel,3
8591,the room itself was nice but the stove partly worked couch is broken and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
8592,we got a big room and bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for my liking,3
8593,the price wasn't too bad but the location was awesome,3
8594,the rooms were nice and we have stayed here many times and really like this place,3
8595,television was kind of small but we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,3
8596,breakfast room was nice and quiet and the facility is in good shape,3
8597,finally got tired of it at 11 pm and called the front desk and they assigned us to a new room,3
8598,i requested a smoking room and it didn't stink like i thought it would fall down on us so i turned,3
8599,we had to leave the room and cross the hall at the top of the rooms second bed,3
8600,clean rustic place with a weird heated pool in the basement was dark and really creepy,3
8601,my friend and i were out most of the day and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings,3
8602,but room was adequate although there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee maker fridge or micro in the room,3
8603,the room worked well for our road trip,3
8604,i would only stay here if i were on a relaxing trip to the south,3
8605,helpful employees room very small advertised a queen size bed and got a double bed,3
8606,we also had issues with people smoking right outside the front door causing everyone to walk through the lobby while people smoke,3
8607,there are many nice restaurants within walking distance which have decent food,3
8608,when we arrived there was noone at the front desk who checked us in was very nice,3
8609,had a relative in nearby hospital and just needed a bed to sleep in for a good price,3
8610,there was unsightly mold on the grout around the tub but it wasn't horrible but it doesn't pretend to be,3
8611,the tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise,3
8612,i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
8613,parkside inn looks nice and inviting from the outside however the rooms are very dated and don't really match a 4 star rating,3
8614,we used the indoor pool for a short time breakfast was very good,3
8615,we were only there for a place to sleep at night and shower the location was great and the morning staff were very friendly,3
8616,the tv was small and the bed was comfortable but the fitted top sheet kept coming off n to loud n disturbing,3
8617,the front desk staff were really nice and helped me to find another hotel in this town,3
8618,also there are no restaurants in the immediate area but not many places to eat or order in,3
8619,however there was one employee a woman at front desk was so very helpful getting wifi for me,3
8620,it was mostly a clean room the beds were comfortable and internet was fast,3
8621,upon check in desk clerk improperly charged my credit card for the room as well as bathroom were clean,3
8622,it's probably a marriott thing but they charge for wifi in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones,3
8623,on the other hand was quite pleasant and the staff was super friendly and they even had breakfast for us every morning,3
8624,there were stains on a pillow carpet was filthy and there was a sports bar which must be why the cost was so much,3
8625,not a problem for me but it could have been beginning at 6:30 am,3
8626,carpet was worn and the wall paper was peeling off the walls in the room and throughout the hotel,3
8627,being long distance my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
8628,for the price i'm sure we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter,3
8629,the blankets were really thin so i recommend asking for a room on the upper floors,3
8630,the hotel is also close to the elevator and the stairwells,3
8631,unfortunately no one told us that the hotel was great for the first day but not refilled after that,3
8632,the weather also did not seem to be too friendly towards cash customers,3
8633,i was glad they checked further and found a way for us to stay there nice hotel and pools but too many mosquitoes,3
8634,i went out to the desk to find no one there for some time y the looks of the rope and landscape around the pole,3
8635,fortunately the room itself was nice but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were fairly poor also,3
8636,also little things like the paper towels and toilet paper are like sandpaper,3
8637,the good it is walking distance to places to eat,3
8638,there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room got quite wet so the room wasn't cleaned for some reason,3
8639,the decor was a little dated but clean and the staff was great,3
8640,rooms where clean but the air was off in the room so if you have a moving truck,3
8641,the woman who checked me in was very nice and friendly,3
8642,nothing fancy just a quiet room and an bed for a quick trip to see family it did the job,3
8643,it is very clear that they are investing a lot of time there except for in the evening,3
8644,i needed a place to stay one night so it was all about location,3
8645,the final day they made the beds but didn't replace the coffee we used the day before,3
8646,the position is great you can catch a number 7 bus up and down the hallways yelling all night we did not get any sleep,3
8647,i repeatedly tried to call back and nobody did it,3
8648,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of roanoke and right at the market center,3
8649,the staff was extremely friendly and the rooms are o,3
8650,although there was a tear in the carpet and the walls and doors were marked,3
8651,this was not as pleasant as i am used to sleeping in a softer bed i slept ok,3
8652,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is that it's about 35-45 minutes from downtown austin,3
8653,the reception staff was very polite and helpful answered all our questions,3
8654,when i got to the motel melissa the front desk clerk was really nice and the water felt amazing,3
8655,other than that the continental breakfast was nice and the breakfast was mediocre that is probably a generous description,3
8656,i love the design of the hotel and parking was terrible,3
8657,there was a huge roach crawling around our rooom so we had to trek up two flights of stairs that was the worst part,3
8658,pool was nice but there is no elevator so if you have a car and,3
8659,i was disappointed because we were not told about the in house dinner,3
8660,ask for a room in the 70's,3
8661,they were drinking alcohol in the hot tub entitled behavior galore,3
8662,helpful employees room very small advertised a queen size bed and got a double bed,3
8663,front desk person was very nice and our stay was okay nothing particularly noteworthy,3
8664,we have to hang outside in the hall way really loud kids running up down hall way,3
8665,walls are extremely thin and we were woken up in the middle of everything that can be a bad thing as well,3
8666,homeless-looking man was sleeping in one of the drawers when child was discovering the room,3
8667,we don't drink and drive and it is easy to walk to the crosswalk almost get hit,3
8668,i do think that there needs to be a little more thorough there,3
8669,the hotel room was a lotttt smaller than i thought it would be a decent size but it wasn't horrible,3
8670,the hotel is reasonable the location is good and the lobby is no exception,3
8671,the room we stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise so the location was perfect for me as well,3
8672,breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for what you get,3
8673,the location of this hotel is its location,3
8674,the hotel could use some renovation maintenance,3
8675,stayed at this laquinta several times in the past so the very noisy ac had to be on,3
8676,also the hotel is directly next door to the room got quite wet so the room was about 80 degrees upon check-in,3
8677,we stayed here while visiting the university of washington-seattle this is a nice well appointed hotel that is quiet,3
8678,at this point i don't know if every room is,3
8679,i told her that she should have mentioned that when i checked in at 6 pm,3
8680,stayed in a room on the top floor,3
8681,the housekeeping could have been better there was a splatter of some sort on the ceiling and dust on the baseboards and cabinet doors,3
8682,the hotel is rated 3 stars but i felt like i had stuff crawling on me all night,3
8683,the beds were comfortable and the room was quiet and comfortable,3
8684,the only highlight of the stay was the other hotel guests,3
8685,i had room service once and it was taken care of,3
8686,but the guy at the front desk was helpful elevator was extremely slow,3
8687,we decided to stay for the night,3
8688,very nice hotel lots to do in the area and were pleased with the proximity to university of washington,3
8689,it's relaxing to have the view of the water it would be a,3
8690,for 18 we could have gone to denny's and had a better effect standing in a warm shower there,3
8691,must have been a sealing problem at the base of the toilet which gave the bathroom a very bad look,3
8692,the front desk staff were friendly but they didn't have my reservation when i arrived,3
8693,at first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there,3
8694,other than that it was a false alarm,3
8695,they were drinking alcohol in the hot tub wasn't working,3
8696,i prefer dones comfort in and pay a little more and have much better facilities friendlier staff etc,3
8697,there was a huge roach crawling around our rooom so we had to use the hotel atm to get money to pay for my room,3
8698,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could,3
8699,i would assume that since it was a one way driveway,3
8700,friendly staff but forgot to clean my room one day of my 5 night stay,3
8701,the elevator is extremely small-my husband and i stayed here on a wednesday night before a job interview the next day,3
8702,generally a good overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
8703,we stayed in april i can't imagine staying there during warmer summer months,3
8704,the prices was good but hotel didn't have a microwave,3
8705,this is a very old hotel but it was a last minute stay so i can not complain,3
8706,but the staff was very nice and price good,3
8707,booked room here due to most other rooms in the area were much pricier than this one,3
8708,this is where you need to be near the airport for our 6 am international flight,3
8709,staff was pretty nice and the rooms were freezing and the heaters did not work very well in the room,3
8710,i booked bayside because we stayed here before we booked it,3
8711,bathroom was not as clean as should be,3
8712,one of the best meals we've ever had very disappointed in the hotel,3
8713,after reading other travel reviews on this motel i can see there is a great shopping center nearby if you wanted breakfast,3
8714,staff did their job but there was no mention of this in the reservation confirmation,3
8715,that being said the hotel is easy to find and get to this location,3
8716,i was told downtown had decent places to eat and out of the traffic of nashville,3
8717,when we arrived for our reservation the person behind the front desk who checked us in was extremely helpful with directions and itinerary planning,3
8718,hotel is too close to the highway and very convenient,3
8719,also on the internet page they said there is a wifi but there was no hot water for a few hours,3
8720,i ended up not staying at the super 8 in ithaca which was awesome,3
8721,i would stay there again even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room,3
8722,older hotel bathroom was very run down in need of overhaul,3
8723,the bed was nice and cozy and allowed for a good night sleep because the bad odor,3
8724,this property is in need of a bit of love,3
8725,i would stay here again if i had to ask three times for them to come to the room and leave it parked there,3
8726,it's good enough for a two night quick stay,3
8727,overall it was good for the location,3
8728,would recommend it to a friend but i think it amplified the noise a bit from the other rooms kept us up all night,3
8729,overall a nice enough place for the price but i wouldn't stay here again,3
8730,the beds were very comfortable but the rooms were nice and clean and everything worked well,3
8731,room was clean and there was a lot of noise from the street so ear plugs are useful,3
8732,but otherwise it was clean and the beds comfortable,3
8733,unfortunately when we arrived we walked into a room that smelled fine and enjoyed our stay,3
8734,the location was great for the price,3
8735,there were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a room directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
8736,this property is in need of a bit of love,3
8737,on a positive note the breakfast was nice and the staff was pleasant and helpful,3
8738,vanity and shower had lots of hot water,3
8739,however the staff was very good and staff was friendly,3
8740,stay was fine and was upgraded which you would think was a nice touch to have while having a 16 month old,3
8741,we walked past the clerk on the way inside and didn't know it till the next morning at check out,3
8742,all in all it was a nice area the staff was very friendly and helpful staff,3
8743,vanity and shower had lots of hot water,3
8744,on the whole as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but you must remember that you get what u pay for,3
8745,i told her that was the only reason i would stay here again if i were just going to king's dominion again,3
8746,i had to ask three times for them to come to the counter and that's only after i hollered at someone cleaning,3
8747,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but we did let the maid know,3
8748,the wall unit a c did not perform to good,3
8749,the air conditioner didn't work and neither did the tv,3
8750,rooms were average in size the floors were dingy and did not look like they have been cleaned,3
8751,the room was clean but not nicely decorated,3
8752,there were also a lot of noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
8753,rooms where clean but the air was off in the room so if you have a moving truck,3
8754,families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool which i did not expect anything good from it,3
8755,clean non smoking rooms with plenty of towels and you get continental breakfast free,3
8756,the room was ok the refrigerator didn't work and i could not smell it inside my room,3
8757,he allowed us to check-in a few hours early,3
8758,there is complementary coffee tea from 7-10 but when we came in,3
8759,it's a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
8760,so it was taxi time on the way back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
8761,doubtful i'll return but for the price what more could you want,3
8762,although the heater in the room was quite clean and in good shape very comfortable and the staff was good and the product was good,3
8763,asked for additional pillows was told they don't have a coffeemaker ask it at front desk,3
8764,breakfast was not bad and they had a free shuttle to sfo is the best perk,3
8765,they lady that checked me in was very nice and gave a short speech on the hotel,3
8766,rooms are small if your tall you may want to pass on free breakfast,3
8767,no one told us when we booked or when we checked in we were told we were calling direct,3
8768,unfortunately i have to say i really don't think he should work in this hotel,3
8769,many different elevators to get to our room the odor was gone,3
8770,this is a great hotel in the university district and having stayed here in the past and had no complaints,3
8771,staff was friendly and we got a king with a sofa,3
8772,pros the staff was friendly and rooms were a good deal for what we got,3
8773,she was irritated that i wanted plates at a late hour we slept good and we left early,3
8774,we booked through expedia and when we checked out we were asked about food allergies,3
8775,furnishings were only average and there were no complimentary shampoo or conditioner,3
8776,good hotel for the price and location were perfect the hotel could use some updating,3
8777,a certain charm and a great location in downtown monterey,3
8778,the staff that did try and make up the breakfast were very nice and it had a pretty descent breakfast,3
8779,when we got there we thought it was something else and had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug,3
8780,what i did notice was that the hotel water wasn't working couple times,3
8781,all in all it was clean but little things like the paper towels and toilet paper are like sandpaper,3
8782,i stayed here for a night on a road trip the hotel was clean and the breakfast is ok continental,3
8783,other than that it was a false alarm,3
8784,all we wanted was a clean quiet room for the night and it,3
8785,not a nice place but would have been top notch if they would have gone some where else and so would we,3
8786,the wifi connection at this hotel is always a disappointment,3
8787,however it was not one of the first to check out the new lobby,3
8788,the staff were very friendly and helpful they were very good,3
8789,on a positive note my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was easy to find and our room was on the third floor,3
8790,it even seemed to have drifted up to our room we had to escorted and wait for someone to bring ice up to us,3
8791,they offered to help with my things knowing that i was only going to be able to relax and enjoy late night drink and food,3
8792,i thought that some of the staff were friendly but the front desk staff not so good,3
8793,quick check in they are remodeling but my room was very clean and well put-together,3
8794,waterpark was the best part of town but,3
8795,the staff was friendly one day our room was not protected from the abundance of highway noise throughout the night,3
8796,the hotel was in a cute town and super close to downtown indianapolis motor speedway lucas oil stadium etc,3
8797,our first visit the room didn't have a toddler trying to touch it,3
8798,she said she would make sure it was cleaned up by morning but it wasn't actually dirty,3
8799,i complained about my room to the 5th floor to carry our bags,3
8800,he allowed us to check-in a few hours early,3
8801,i chose this location due to the lack of other options,3
8802,could not get past security issues with wifi and i got a non smoking room on the second day of our stay,3
8803,the hotel is in a great location though and there aren't a lot of options in this immediate area,3
8804,i informed the desk manager that i was very disappointed that there was no shower cap,3
8805,there are no directions for proper use settings for the coffee maker it had to be moved in order to open,3
8806,that was really the only thing that sucked was parking,3
8807,reported to the front desk to let them know as we did not want to sit on it,3
8808,despite that the staff was very friendly and got us checked in quickly,3
8809,an attempt has been made to update it but the rooms are spacious and staff is very helpfull,3
8810,this hotel is under new management again and many of the commerces appeared closed for good which is,3
8811,however upon arrival we were told that this was a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
8812,another down side about this hotel is that it's about 35-45 minutes from downtown austin,3
8813,if there were a rating for room service food i would have to say that the location is worth it,3
8814,our room did not smell and clean and that's what was needed anyway,3
8815,we have stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights,3
8816,food quality and options could have been better the beds were comfortable,3
8817,so if that bothers you you may want to avoid the bathroom the water pressure is mediocre,3
8818,the shower was moldy the toilet seat was up when i got there,3
8819,upon departure after we left the hotel the staff and our pool and hope you'll be back with us again in the future,3
8820,everything was fine except when we went into the room it seems ok since it was really late and we were exhausted,3
8821,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
8822,it was very pet friendly but i would not stay here again unless the world is ending and there is nowhere else to go,3
8823,not the best to say the least but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
8824,but considering they were it was still a nice place to stay attractive open lobby large clean breakfast area,3
8825,the breakfast is not high quality but there are plenty of other things to do at the site,3
8826,got a great deal for jackson anyway might as well have just gone to starbucks and saved some money,3
8827,the hotel is ok but the beds were very comfortable,3
8828,friendly staff and close to the softball fields,3
8829,the first room i was in which was not a pleasant experience,3
8830,there was also a large number of rooms still being cleaned,3
8831,the ac worked fine but the bathroom was not too bright it was hard for me with suitcase other items,3
8832,the top of the commode was clean but the mattress of the king sized bed was comfortable and shower was nice so it worked out,3
8833,we stayed in april i can't imagine staying there during warmer summer months,3
8834,had we realized there wasn't one in the hotel we had booked this would have been avoided,3
8835,not to mention you had to go outside after the swim to cool down,3
8836,i was a little disappointed in our stay here,3
8837,i will go there again for the price,3
8838,location is in the middle of remodeling so it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal,3
8839,but it was 3 in the morning when people were leaving,3
8840,for the most part it does the job for a good price for one night for a dance competition at the convention center,3
8841,other than my feet hanging off the bed the room was nice and there was a crackel barrel with in walking distance,3
8842,front desk staff was busy discussing their schedule for christmas and we had to wait more time over an hr,3
8843,it was very uncomfortable for my husband and to have a room on the opposite side of the interstate,3
8844,but on our stays it was clean and i felt safe there with my family,3
8845,off season so many of the other hotels were much more expensive,3
8846,i was next to the elevator which made for a quiet stay,3
8847,good comparison is that for less money per night i had a two day stay while visiting family and friends in my home town,3
8848,you can tell that the hotel has been updated so don't let that keep you from staying here,3
8849,my stay was good and the location is excellent,3
8850,and the cost of my overnight stay was fine and we brought our mastiff along,3
8851,the room was not cleaned and we had no idea where we were going,3
8852,doesn't have an elevator so if you have doubts it's easy to find,3
8853,the service was outstanding both at the desk and in the restaurant and the large 1980's video game area pretty much all to ourselves,3
8854,picked it because it was close to the airport and highway which was good,3
8855,it was someplace to sleep and the access to the hotel can be difficult,3
8856,the bathroom wasn't very clean but the beds were very comfortable and the water pressure is mediocre,3
8857,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but the person taking care of 16 of us this was a prearranged private booked brunch,3
8858,we booked this hostel because it was the cheapest we could find for staying in downtown boston,3
8859,other than that the room was clean with fresh smelling linen,3
8860,the breakfast was good and the room was fine and little stale when we first checked in,3
8861,pros this hotel was a little run down,3
8862,also there is no air conditioning in the room worked pretty well on a,3
8863,this is an older hotel and needs updating,3
8864,the recliner and table in front of the hotel but did not,3
8865,room appeared clean at first glance however the bathroom was small we couldn't even put our suitcase opened anywhere,3
8866,it was a cold evening not sure i did not speak to the front desk he asked me do you want it to be cleaned,3
8867,they provided earplugs which isn't helpful if you need to go downtown or to the waterfront to eat,3
8868,the location is okay great if you want to go anywhere and cheap,3
8869,the air quality in the first room we were given was dark and gloomy didn't have a toddler trying to touch it,3
8870,we were not that happy at this hampton inn and found it very nice,3
8871,most of staff not very friendly except sam which was very helpful and i actually left with a smile,3
8872,it was okay for a one night stay it was fine,3
8873,rooms are small and the place could use a good thorough cleaning some painting and other minor repairs,3
8874,room was ok for the most part but the beds were hard and flat,3
8875,overall it was good until i saw a roach crawling around the lobby,3
8876,the tub whirlpool feature didn't work and it was bit warmer in my room than i would have expected a little more,3
8877,the room was fine and the staff were friendly and helpful,3
8878,the front desk was very apologetic and moved us to another room with a slight upgrade,3
8879,just needed a hotel for just one night over the july 4th weekend,3
8880,the restaurant closed at 9:00 on a friday night the price was very reasonable,3
8881,i would have rated it higher but there was no signal in our room,3
8882,this is one of the cheapest in the area it was in was a little shady,3
8883,could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable pool area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
8884,when i arrived the hotel was under construction at the pool however this didn't impact our stay too much,3
8885,counter people great but black mold on shower curtain where it had not been cleaned so we were assigned a new room,3
8886,rooms and breakfast were very nice and attentive,3
8887,its clean but past its prime needs an upgrade fresh coat of paint and some fresh updated wall art,3
8888,beds were comfy pillows were good bathroom area was ok and there was a sports bar which must be why the cost was so much,3
8889,other than that housekeeping did a great job except the night shift desk cleark,3
8890,i will not say it was a lot better but no kids are allowed,3
8891,the recliner and table in front of the grand canal and within walking distance to the metro,3
8892,the staff treated us as if we were staying there in the summer,3
8893,the breakfast was not bad and they had a free shuttle to the airport running every hour,3
8894,we were not given the type of room you are requesting with the hotel,3
8895,hotel breakfast could use a little up dating,3
8896,also the shower curtain rod was rusty the hand rail in the shower was a joke just overall worn and dated,3
8897,the rooms while clean were very plain and simple i dont think you can beat this place,3
8898,cracker barrel restaurant right across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses,3
8899,towels looked pretty old used for a long time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
8900,what stands out to me about the drury inn is the bathroom in the corner had a lot of hairs,3
8901,the fellow who checked us in was borderline rude like we were making her work,3
8902,had a long weekend getaway at virginia beach and decided to stay for a couple of days,3
8903,i booked jacksonville plaza hotel because of the price and location were perfect the hotel could use some maintenance upkeep,3
8904,it was ok but the room had tons of fruit flys,3
8905,i honestly don't think that is the normal there but it was the tone of the voice from the front desk,3
8906,the price was good for the price and because it was not mold,3
8907,there was no elevator and the wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction,3
8908,it seemed like a common problem because we could hear the people in the next room,3
8909,we had been told it would be about 10 minutes,3
8910,it was pouring rain when we got to our new room on the 14th floor and gave us one free breakfast,3
8911,i was in bangor for a concert at the webster theater on 3 26 16,3
8912,we originally planned 2 nights for our family of four the room was small but adequate,3
8913,also close to the elevator and the stairwells,3
8914,checkin was swift once we were able to figure out the remote to the television,3
8915,its not fancy but for the most part but the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was great,3
8916,the hotel was great and the bed was very soft,3
8917,i would only stay here if i was unable to complete my work for my meetings and left shaken and annoyed,3
8918,our rm was on the second floor which was much better newer and cleaner,3
8919,however the bathroom was small we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit,3
8920,it's fine if you just need a place to stay with children,3
8921,room was quite comfortable and the room was large enough for my family of five,3
8922,after talking to the front desk they said they would put the crib in the room but no iron bed was comfortable,3
8923,not very clean to say the least and some of the staff are not professional at all,3
8924,i honestly don't think that is the normal there but it was the tone of the voice from the front desk was great,3
8925,i was suprised that many of the hotel and the lot was flooded ankle deep in some places,3
8926,however ownership and management attention to this hotel is pretty good but not this time,3
8927,the room does have a refrigerator and microwave in working condition,3
8928,the breakfast was nice and the hotel was pretty the staff was very courteous,3
8929,the things that made this more like a 2 1 2 star facility,3
8930,there are lots of hotels in the area were already full so i didn't even think to ask but he did,3
8931,if that was on the description i would not have seen it had it not been for the big sign,3
8932,there aren't any restaurants within walking distance which have decent food,3
8933,we stayed at this laquinta for four nights and there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the room was old,3
8934,and the cost of my overnight stay was fine and i would stay at another property,3
8935,the manager lied to us saying first they didn't even have lids for the coffee which tasted like poison,3
8936,each time we were provided by the front desk but the phone wasn't working,3
8937,this was our first time staying at a hampton inn hotel,3
8938,harrah's was the best spot if you want to take the stairs to the 4th floor,3
8939,we had to wait 2 hours in the parking lot who seemed to be very curt at a simple request for a tooth brush,3
8940,we ended up in a room with tax was 87,3
8941,staff very friendly and helpful and the location was a short drive from st,3
8942,fitness room was clean and pristine aside from the musty smell and room service was always happy to deliver more pillows with a smile,3
8943,the room was clean the beds were comfortable and internet was fast,3
8944,we arrived late and the lady at the desk was very nice and went out of their way to help and accommodate their guests needs,3
8945,negatives even though it is in maryland the price was good and the service was friendly and clean,3
8946,this hotel was ok but the room had no blankets or duvet,3
8947,overall it works room was clean and i felt safe and the staff was pleasant,3
8948,i enjoyed having my own sink mini refrigerator and microwave in the room as nowadays most places do,3
8949,housekeeping staff was very good room was clean and met our needs,3
8950,my stay was ok but we wouldn't stay there again,3
8951,the bathroom was musky and our room was still available no problems at all,3
8952,would stay here again for the right price,3
8953,not even sure why because it was not so far from home when you encounter such a happy staff,3
8954,our bathroom was old and not fresh there was a mild displeasing odor probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing,3
8955,may not seem important but if you have been in a better location for the same rate with more local amenities nearby,3
8956,as for the room everything was clean and the bed comfortable,3
8957,it's close to the highway which was convenient but a little noisy,3
8958,just not worth what they charge for 24 hours of access,3
8959,there was a fan in the room that wasn't pleasant,3
8960,pluses close to lackland afb 7 mi 10-15 min and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip,3
8961,i will say the hotel staff did not honor my reservations through expedia,3
8962,we were only there for a night to keep my sanity,3
8963,it was nice having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the rooms but functional,3
8964,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
8965,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to spend a lot since we knew we would be getting ourselves into,3
8966,the hotel was right off the freeway so it was very loud when on low setting the,3
8967,the service was very good in general although it just a bit too busy for quiet couple time,3
8968,entering room found no towels and coffee in the lobby had disappeared before i arrived at 7 pm breakfast a joke,3
8969,the customer service was great and the rooms were comfy,3
8970,fine for the 8 hour sleep we stayed but we will spend the extra money to stay here compared to the alternatives,3
8971,we were looking for a clean economical place to stay while we slept,3
8972,everything is great except our air condition was not working properly i also ask if they had a restaurant,3
8973,i was only in the room the bathroom could have used a little more space in the dining area without any tv's,3
8974,when we asked a manager if we could change rooms but they were completely booked,3
8975,i strongly suggest not staying at this hotel for two nights,3
8976,it is the best part of the hotel,3
8977,the actual room was nice and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine,3
8978,there are snacks and other food for purchase in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice,3
8979,at 7 am we were woken by the noise of the train and the street traffic,3
8980,staff as well as manager of the hotel was under renovation so there were challenges due to that,3
8981,the cord just came out of the hand when i went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken,3
8982,it didn't promptly cool down so i requested a new one and it never arrived,3
8983,it wasn't that bad but it wasn't horrible but it doesn't look like the website at all,3
8984,upon check in desk clerk improperly charged my credit card for the room as well as bathroom were clean,3
8985,the mattress cover had old blood stains so that had to be changed out because they were so old and rusted they fell off,3
8986,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any 2-beds available since they started remodeling early to get ready for a,3
8987,but it was 3 in the morning when people were leaving,3
8988,we couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel due to hilton honors points and location for family event,3
8989,i returned late in the evening and our room was very friendly and service oriented,3
8990,finally told the girl it would be good to have a balcony i would recommend to ask for the breakfast vouchers included in our reservation,3
8991,views were very nice and helpful staff,3
8992,it's a great place to stay but the complimentary breakfast was really good but i didn't see when making the reservation,3
8993,daughter 7 was looking forward to a good nights rest,3
8994,tube hadn't been cleaned in a long time,3
8995,we were two people in a room with two double beds,3
8996,old hotel but great location for the convention center and the beach,3
8997,i only slept here the room was clean but the bathroom floor was overlooked,3
8998,the meal was okay but not very accommodating,3
8999,we needed a pet friendly hotel and that we were on the 3rd floor but room itself very dated,3
9000,there were ice trays but they were empty so we had to change rooms which was a hassle,3
9001,staff is pretty friendly and the rooms are comfortable and the price is reasonable,3
9002,the room needed some maintenance however the overall stay wasn't bad after room was accommodated,3
9003,the entire place needs to be re-done however the rooms were clean but the bathroom floor was overlooked,3
9004,also my nephew told me the new waterpark had chilly water so i didn't care at that point i was so itchy,3
9005,the restaurant could use some updating but we had a hillview room that looked directly onto the parking lot and walkways were promptly cleared,3
9006,my only complaint is the mattress was old and sagged in the middle,3
9007,the 24 7 fitness room was locked when i got there i was informed by the guy at the front desk,3
9008,my husband came to where i was meeting family members,3
9009,the coffee pot did not work either even though it was an indoor pool you would have to go elsewhere for food,3
9010,the ac was needed to be turned on in the lobby so maybe they are updating i'm not sure if,3
9011,i requested a change but was assured it would be ok if it was inexpensively priced,3
9012,dated decor that could use updating and the room would get to hot then to cold,3
9013,i reported this to the front desk but inside the room was brown,3
9014,she got on her computer and found a room that smelled of cigarette smoke,3
9015,mattress was old and you could feel the springs thru the mattress and the loud cars outside the window,3
9016,cons were that there was no safe in the room for a short time when we arrived that evening it is open until midnight,3
9017,it almost seemed that every time we went to the loby 4 times every time waited in the line for hours,3
9018,the red roof room we were in which is always ni,3
9019,i needed a place for a night light,3
9020,could easily fit a small family in there there was a mixup with our reservation and they took care of it,3
9021,the pool area was basic i didn't like is that it was noisy,3
9022,a bit pricey for the accommodations in my opinion but again they made an effort and the service at the ip,3
9023,the bathroom wasn't the cleanest and the breakfast was delicious,3
9024,front desk stated they did not have a chance to use the pool and other amenities,3
9025,however when i brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk and we were told yes three times,3
9026,just needed a place for a quick night or two in long beach,3
9027,i was locked in my room for me which was unexpected,3
9028,without checking i was told that there was a printer and computer in the lobby was great,3
9029,it was clean overall but there were some housekeeping issues we found things in our room and in the hall,3
9030,a little worry about the bathroom because there is only one trash can rather than one in the bathroom and has little counter space,3
9031,this hotel was nice but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
9032,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
9033,this was an unfortunate incident and should not be working in customer service,3
9034,i found 3 chunks of food at the bottom of the shower curtain was brown and moldy,3
9035,i was told at the time of arrival that there were no more rooms on our floor,3
9036,i saw someone wrote that they have a shuttle to the cruise was awesome very helpful,3
9037,it was a place to stay near the airport,3
9038,i don't like to see debris behind desks and i think they could make better signs if that was really a problem,3
9039,no staff at the desk were very nice,3
9040,staff were friendly but the front desk made sure it was well past time for it,3
9041,walls are extremely thin and we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours,3
9042,breakfast was nice fruit make your own waffles was great and the location was easy to find but there is not much around,3
9043,the rooms were decorated nicely flatscreen tv's and great water pressure in the shower clean bathroom but discolored or stained bathmat in tub,3
9044,i did hear some noise a couple of times-reasonable price quick service food not bad,3
9045,wifi access coded given upon check in rather than having to call the front desk and he and everyone there did it with a smile,3
9046,the room was large the bed was very umcomfortable and somewhat itchy,3
9047,we decided to stay for the price and breakfast was a plus,3
9048,after a 30 minute discussion with the front desk and request a change which i would probably not stay here again,3
9049,overall the hotel was clean and well maintained,3
9050,we truly thought we walked into the lobby we were greeted with the stink emanating from somewhere,3
9051,water pressure in shower was good but the room had an odor to it,3
9052,when i finally checked in the room was only decaf,3
9053,our room was comfortable and the shower had plenty of hot water,3
9054,i liked the location the staff were friendly and the place was clean and we had a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom,3
9055,check out is at nooncons the door would not close unless i pushed it shut 140,3
9056,i dreaded getting out of the room wow,3
9057,it's not that fancy but it's about what you expect from a four seasons,3
9058,did not like the smell of the room not very nice,3
9059,serving the breakfast saved us a lot of advices about where to eat and find things again with a smile and not rushed,3
9060,you need to park in the fire lanes,3
9061,was going to a baseball game at chase field so we wanted a close hotel that provided free wifi and breakfast,3
9062,that did not happen and i had to put another 150 hold on my credit card,3
9063,i was disappointed because we were not told about the in house dinner,3
9064,one of the cheapest in the area it was in was a little shady,3
9065,well this is so much less than i would have expected a better stay,3
9066,it was a decent stay for a good price for one night for a softball tournament not a bad spot for just an overnight stay,3
9067,the in room guest showed only one ice machine and it is on 1st floor,3
9068,no staff at the desk were very nice,3
9069,the reservation process for this hotel was excellent for our needs,3
9070,the rooms are small and the place could use a remodel it seemed a bit outdated,3
9071,the location was great for the price,3
9072,our room was extremely hot as well called the front desk and we were told we were calling direct,3
9073,the bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and the parking lot and not any hills,3
9074,staff was great the room could have been cleaner,3
9075,with these caveats though a good basic hotel that provided a safe clean place to sleep while on a road trip,3
9076,the cabin was nice but the pool was super dirty,3
9077,breakfast was minimal but for the price it was a very pleasant stay,3
9078,it was a non smoking room but i got a free upgrade to a suite with a kitchen,3
9079,conveniently there is a gas station right across the street from a stop for,3
9080,the room was definitely old and the bathroom was not the cleanest not totally filthy but could have definately used a good scrub,3
9081,the bed was very comfortable and the room was warm hot if we were relaxing during the daytime,3
9082,i didn't like is that the walls are thin and you can see the mattress underneath,3
9083,good price for the location pretty bad considering the quality of the food was below average and multiple items were not stocked,3
9084,this wasn't because there was a baseball tournament going on with several of the staff and the cleanliness of the bathroom,3
9085,continental breakfast was probably the worst i have ever seen to the dogs barking in the lobby,3
9086,families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool which i did not expect anything good from it,3
9087,although smoke free the room had a balcony which it did but we were not able to take a bath,3
9088,the free breakfast had a pathetic selection and was cold so we ate out most of the time we were there,3
9089,the hotel itself or should i say tried to eat,3
9090,it was worth the money paid but it was not a room that should cost over 100 night,3
9091,we were traveling through to nm and this was a convenient location in west monroe for dinning,3
9092,my room was on the first floor and the elevator was down to one usable the other,3
9093,carpet in the room needs to be renovated but it was very clean,3
9094,our room was also close to the airport and the price was great and the bed was comfortable,3
9095,in other words they try to get rid of the smell it would be a,3
9096,the room is attractive but the bed is not comfortable and the doors wont lock right carpet had lots of stain,3
9097,its not fancy but for the most part but the beds were clean and nice,3
9098,outside of that the rooms were clean and comfortable with microwave and refrg,3
9099,doesn't have an elevator so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own,3
9100,booked the hotel due to the price and the breakfast was very good,3
9101,when i returned at the end of the bed and the wall,3
9102,the front desk staff was fine room was big and the bed confortable,3
9103,breakfast was lack luster but for what we stayed there for a night to keep my sanity,3
9104,very crowded the food is not as good and the staff cleaning and front desk were professional,3
9105,room was good size and i liked the room however it had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in there for years,3
9106,a lot of places to eat or get gas,3
9107,those are 2 of the things i tend to rate when i stay in dc i am now staying elsewhere,3
9108,none of this was in the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
9109,the back of the hotel in general had a bit of a walk and worry about security of the lot,3
9110,for the price of the room was very nice for the price,3
9111,i expected more from a best western but i'd suggest you drop the grand from the name,3
9112,we just needed a place to stay while we slept,3
9113,tv was a flat panel and had a great view to the south and especially the fireworks on the 4th,3
9114,the lobby was a bit offputting because it had a door to the hall didn't close properly,3
9115,it's a beautiful hotel in a great location though and there aren't a lot of choices in this area,3
9116,the best part of town but there were plenty of pools areas to enjoy,3
9117,not a problem for me but it could have been beginning at 6:30 am,3
9118,the staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful even just passing in the hallway,3
9119,this was supposed to be a non-smoking facility that's what it seemed like,3
9120,coffee and breakfast area in the lobby is very small and limited stuff,3
9121,it was fine for our needs and was clean and comfortable,3
9122,the room looked like it had been vacuumed,3
9123,we recently went upstate ny for fall foliage and stayed here for one night a couple of times but with two small children,3
9124,the man at the front desk was great the room was clean beds comfortable,3
9125,hotwire indicated a resort fee for the stay but it is what it is,3
9126,ours was open a crack which we did not know and the air conditioner didn't work and neither did the tv,3
9127,the only problem we had was that we didn't get to enjoy a swim before being laid up for the next day of travel,3
9128,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
9129,the guy who checked us in was borderline rude like we were making her work,3
9130,room was not ready when we arrived at 11:30 pm it wasn't in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine,3
9131,the roof top garden gives you magnificent views of the lake beds are comfortable and there is a bench to do so,3
9132,other areas seemed a bit run down and buffet breakfast not as good as it gets within the walking distance to the metro,3
9133,it was roomy and clean and the bed was comfortable if a little squeaky,3
9134,i was in room 216 on the 2nd floor didn't work and they could not fix it,3
9135,upon entering the casino area to check in we were hit with the 130 cleaning fee for our 3 day stay,3
9136,the curtains do not close in the room and do not disurb signs for the door,3
9137,pur business has a weekly meeting there and i would stay at this hotel but ask for a room situated in an upper floor,3
9138,i liked that it was in walking distance to places to eat and shop,3
9139,one set of friends had to move rooms because they didn't properly prepare for the vast amount of kids,3
9140,i missed having a coffee maker in the room and was moved at 3 am was moved to another room w o incident,3
9141,hotel is too close to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult,3
9142,the reservation process for this hotel was excellent for our needs,3
9143,the exterior was uninviting but we were tired and did not get one,3
9144,there are no directions for proper use settings for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink,3
9145,i never the rain again to walk to the gas station to fill our ice bucket which was a little discomfiting,3
9146,i will try a different hotel the next time we visit family in the area,3
9147,valet is at the other end of the street and although there is a good size but a little dated,3
9148,overall a great place to stay if you don't have many choices for lodging,3
9149,for a last minute booking and on a friday night in downtown seattle,3
9150,maria at the front desk were nice and so were the furnishings but all in all i had a good visit,3
9151,it was the first time i went we were shown a room in the upper floors breathtaking sight,3
9152,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but that is usually expected in nyc,3
9153,when checking in i was given a handicap-accessible bathroom,3
9154,the hotel had friendly staff the breakfast was okay not great but not terrible,3
9155,you need to park in the fire lanes,3
9156,found a long hair on the floor and it smells bad,3
9157,towels looked pretty old used for a long time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
9158,everything gone by 9 am on a sunday morning was over by 9 am,3
9159,the room was nice the pool was ok and the location was easy to get to,3
9160,pay someone to really clean the pool and hot tub area were very nice and it had a grainy picture,3
9161,all in all though we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,3
9162,the room we stayed in was very close to the river and lots of lovely restaurants and shops,3
9163,hotel is close to uofo about 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk,3
9164,we did have to fight a wasp at midnight which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
9165,other than those two things it's not a big deal especially for the price,3
9166,the hotel was what you would expect from a best western but i felt like i was sleeping on rocks,3
9167,when we arrived we walked into a room that smelled fine and enjoyed our stay,3
9168,we would readily recommend this hotel for its close proximity to the aquarium and the queen mary,3
9169,other than that it was as good as it gets within the walking distance to the beach shops and dining,3
9170,on our last day the power went out in the entire hotel was poor fingerprints on walls mirrors many scratch and scuff marks,3
9171,surprised to find the hotel located in probably the best part of staying here was the staff,3
9172,the hot breakfast was a plus and the staff was very nice and helpful,3
9173,my pillowcases were yellow and there was a bunch of sand under the pillows on the sofa,3
9174,i have asthma so it was not a room to spend much time in room but it was booked for the festival on friday,3
9175,room was spacious and clean and breakfast was good but limited other options particularly for kids,3
9176,other than that the stay was not worth the price,3
9177,everything looked a bit updated and clean and the staff was accommodating to the limit of their facilities,3
9178,one of the main reasons we chose this hotel due to its proximity to that,3
9179,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while in osage beach well i highly recommend this property,3
9180,there were a lot of hotels cheap pricey,3
9181,when we arrived we were informed that we were charged for 1 soda and 1 snack smh,3
9182,my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
9183,the only problem was that i had a bit of a musty smell,3
9184,the stay was average but at first site the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would,3
9185,the stay was quiet and relaxing so we got a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
9186,older hotel but one of the beds needed to be cleaned and vented clothes were left damp and smelt moldy,3
9187,chill out with a cocktail at the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be working in customer service,3
9188,other than that the hotel staff were helpful in giving directions to local attractions,3
9189,this comfort inn however must have been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
9190,we recently went upstate ny for fall foliage and stayed here for a conference in the area,3
9191,i would have went to a different hotel but it was the best deal we could find at that time of year,3
9192,hotel was clean and close to all amenities which was just as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
9193,the beds were not very comfortable but weren't horrible and the rooms were decent however the remaining decor and condition was quite dated,3
9194,in order to get ice you have to go inside to get to your room,3
9195,rooms are a bit small but close enough to where i had to go in shifts so as not to leave the dog alone,3
9196,the staff however were helpful when i asked for a microwave they would give one,3
9197,i was disappointed because we were not told at check in,3
9198,however i did hear a lot of traffic noise but i should have known that since it was a weekend,3
9199,not 5 star but still not the standard we expected,3
9200,have to call for it after got out of the deal was free breakfast,3
9201,when it poured rain the carpet just inside the entry door to the room next to the back door near the pool parking area,3
9202,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't any king rooms available except for handicap king room,3
9203,overall it was an okay experience with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it,3
9204,we have stayed at this hotel for family,3
9205,if you are looking for a bed to sleep in for one night during our cross-country move,3
9206,the first non-smoking room but was given a smoking room and i have asthma problems,3
9207,we probably won't stay there anymore because of the price and location it was worth it,3
9208,the room would have been more compelling but,3
9209,given the proximity to a wal-mart this hotel is pretty good but not this time,3
9210,we booked this hotel was for an overnight stay after a wedding,3
9211,the things that made this more like a 2 1 2 star facility,3
9212,the hotel is in need of replacement namely the fridge in our suite had rust spots on the bottom of the list,3
9213,the room was clean but not nicely decorated,3
9214,the only downfall is things close early around rockafellar center so you have to go up a long hill to find the hotel,3
9215,room was clean and the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very comfortable,3
9216,jonathan from 417 says the hotel was nice for the price we paid it was worth it,3
9217,after reading many reviews we decided to book two rooms at this hotel for a stop during our move cross-country,3
9218,i stayed here for work because it was the only one with a key to acess the towels,3
9219,it was ok nice room for the money that i spent,3
9220,it would be much better if they had a room as they were having internet problems,3
9221,we stayed at best western mainly for the price and the fact that they had shuttle service,3
9222,rooms are small if your tall you may want to pass on free breakfast,3
9223,the carpet in the elevator was extremely dirty and our bathroom door did not close or lock properly,3
9224,other than that the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly,3
9225,the back of the hotel was told they do not have an,3
9226,we stopped here for a night on my way across the country,3
9227,pictures are not for this hotel but for a marriott i had some disappointment vs other marriott hotels i have stayed in so far,3
9228,rooms are very clean and tidy they are a little on the lumpy uncomfy side but very clean,3
9229,the conference was efficient and the front desk personnel to be very warm and humid outside so the air conditioner had to run,3
9230,in the room itself the bath towels were rough and hard there was enough toilet paper for one use,3
9231,paper thin walls lots of noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
9232,our room on the third floor did not work and the tv power button didn't work well,3
9233,back bay metro station is just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in branson,3
9234,feeling around in the early am for my glasses on the floor in our bathroom upon our entering was just outright gross,3
9235,clean rooms and the beds were super hard and the husband and i had the king bed room with hot tub,3
9236,i had to stay at the sleep inn also a choice hotel but it was late and we needed to get some sleep,3
9237,overall not bad for the price but would not stay there again,3
9238,even though it was a little concerning that there were notes instructions all over the hotel to find a room i was comfortable with,3
9239,the a c in the room was dim and some light fixtures in the room were quite uncomfortable,3
9240,only real downside is not being able to walk to fishermans wharf and many great restaurants that are relatively close 1 mile or so,3
9241,when we checked in our reservation were made through expedia even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
9242,didn't like the fact that their wasn't a shuttle to pick us up at 4 am and paid the cost,3
9243,i rented a room with a king bed,3
9244,bed was hard as a rock the room was small but the bed was not particularly comfortable,3
9245,we were there for the miss usa pageant so we weren't picky about where we chose to stay was an excellent location,3
9246,there was a issue with our stay the staff was very helpful,3
9247,that said location is good and the lobby is no exception,3
9248,the front desk gal was not very friendly the room was dusty and the mattress was almost non-existent,3
9249,they have a sign saying to go to the lobby and there was a sports bar which must be why the cost was so much,3
9250,they did put us on the 4th floor 2nd floor was completely gutted,3
9251,it was a little annoying so i called the front office and told them of the situation,3
9252,the room was very clean the breakfast was ok the staff was very friends,3
9253,when i finally went to the desk to find a pizza place for us that would deliver,3
9254,the rooms are small but clean and adequate for our needs,3
9255,the carpet in the hallway in front of my 4th-story window,3
9256,housekeeping also failed to clean our room i got a smell of damp and the room was large the bed was very comfortable,3
9257,this was an okay hotel but for a marriott i had some disappointment vs other marriott hotels i have stayed in so far,3
9258,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke and outdated color scheme,3
9259,the room was clean we were able to stay in the busy town area and wanted some quiet,3
9260,the downside is that you are a short walk to the dunes not crowded at all,3
9261,overall central location to a lot of restaurants boutiques and grocery,3
9262,it was ok but the room had no blankets or duvet,3
9263,this place is cute but we expected more out of the name than what i got,3
9264,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but didn't affect our stay,3
9265,this hotel is satisfactory but i would only stay here if i were on a relaxing trip to the south,3
9266,i informed the desk manager that i was very disappointed in the security and response from the front desk,3
9267,we loved being right on the water and steps from downtown,3
9268,it crosses the street about 200 yards from the hotel and its rooms are not brand new they are well maintained,3
9269,i'm assuming that the credit card machine in the restaurant was incredibly rude on 2 separate occasions,3
9270,bed was hard as a rock the room was small but very nice and clean,3
9271,the hallway on the 6th floor had a very musty smell but seemed clean,3
9272,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a plunger we were surprised that nobody offered assistance,3
9273,however have stayed at other hotels in the area are better,3
9274,this was an unfortunate incident and should not be working in customer service,3
9275,i don't know if i'd stay there again but i would like a different room,3
9276,we were disappointed we had no view of the water was wonderful the pictures on the internet,3
9277,then we find out they don't have to eat in their overpriced restaurant,3
9278,what we thought was going to be from the look of the hotel but did not,3
9279,the place is rundown but the rooms are small and its outdated but its clean the staff is super nice,3
9280,if you're using gps remember that you have to pay for parking with a hotel stay,3
9281,if you can get a room facing the courtyard it is very pleasant and helpful but the poor mattress really messed my sleep,3
9282,staff was a bit rushed when i checked in the desk clerk was kind and friendly,3
9283,in the morning there was a lot of noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
9284,the hotel was fine although it was not as nice as the hotel provided picture make it look,3
9285,the rooms were ok but carpets didn't seem to know where anything in town was,3
9286,the housekeeping accidentally put my beach towel in their laundry and it didn't stink like i thought it would be,3
9287,in reality it is very dated and needs an update,3
9288,whomever fixed the ceiling in the bathroom didn't work and and a run down weight machine,3
9289,and the hot tub is located in an area with many other hotels and fast food restaurants in the area,3
9290,breakfast would have been much better if they offered rooms with 2 queen beds,3
9291,we stayed one night as we were passing through on a long road trip,3
9292,if a person needs just a place to stay at last minute for a reasonable price for a night or two,3
9293,overall i'd say it's a good rate but it might as,3
9294,everything was okay except that the room smelled a little musty,3
9295,we had gnat like bugs hanging out on the balconies to other rooms,3
9296,for those who don't use the pool area,3
9297,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to the bed,3
9298,the rooms were ok clean but out dated pillows were horrible,3
9299,we rented a room with a great view of mt,3
9300,the housekeeping accidentally put my beach towel in their laundry and it didn't stink like i thought it would,3
9301,the hotel is right next to i-10 so was very convenient for getting back onto the highway,3
9302,we had a good time here but it wasn't horrible but it doesn't affect the rooms,3
9303,when we arrived for bfast there was nowhere to set wrap glasses room key etc,3
9304,the cabin was amazing and check-in out was efficient,3
9305,we picked this hotel because it was close to the highway and downtown newburgh,3
9306,the carpet was worn and stained dirty,3
9307,the front office manager was very helpful and i actually left with a smile,3
9308,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but that is usually expected in nyc,3
9309,you could tell they used egg beaters so i didn't want a 1 star dirty motel 6 either,3
9310,there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room your were hit with it,3
9311,the room barely fits the bed and you have to basically jump to get into the pool,3
9312,it was annoying but do able so i didn't care at that point i was so itchy,3
9313,we would stay again if travelling through the area by train,3
9314,the out side area had not been cleaned so we were assigned a handicap room,3
9315,what we did not like was that it was very noisy and woke me up,3
9316,at 6:30 i gave up showered and went down to the front desk to come check it out,3
9317,the front desk made us wait for the room and it didn't have an atm in the hotel,3
9318,glad it was pet friendly and didn't charge for a pet to stay,3
9319,the hotel was just okay needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose,3
9320,there was enough space in the room only 4 drawers,3
9321,the room is old but clean and comfortable,3
9322,the pool area was nice and seemed to be bothered when having to assist us,3
9323,there are numerous good places to eat in the area unless you want to drive or walk across 6 lanes of traffic,3
9324,didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot doors opening closing all night people talking etc,3
9325,however the location was great and we were able to have pancakes as a late,3
9326,notified desk was given a double bed standard,3
9327,it looked like the filter hadn't been cleaned bar of soap empty shampoo containers were still there,3
9328,the hotel is located right across the street from the toll station but was relatively quiet considering,3
9329,offenbach is not a nice place but would have been top notch if they would have gone some where else and so would we,3
9330,then upon asking for a microwave to use and was told no we don't have a small child seriously search for another place,3
9331,overall it was good but could have been a little cleaner,3
9332,feels a little creepy at night as the drawer next to the beds are gone along with the drawer that i used to use,3
9333,the manager lied to us saying first they didn't even ask if that would be a problem for larger or older people,3
9334,at around 3:15 the bartender called the front desk n told them n they couldn't help me,3
9335,nice place for a short stay overnight only,3
9336,clerk did remove the charge but i probably won't be staying here again,3
9337,the combined parking facilities total 3 were good enough and it was very cold drafty,3
9338,the one big negative about the room was the smell musty moldy like the room had been cleaned well,3
9339,all in all it was an ok stay nothing spectacular,3
9340,one of the women working the desk was outside smoking and there was no ac at this time of year,3
9341,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and you could always order in,3
9342,the hotel is supposed to be new but it is not one i would recommend for most people,3
9343,easily able to walk to fishermans wharf and many great restaurants that are relatively close 1 mile or so,3
9344,most of the guests were oap's so really not a place for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays,3
9345,it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice but i wonder if she was new,3
9346,the line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a weekend,3
9347,they drive large trucks and usually make a lot of noise from the highway all night long,3
9348,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any of the major networks i,3
9349,we only stayed a night as part of a wedding room block in may 2015,3
9350,this hotel is just what you should expect for the price you pay you would expect a little more,3
9351,the location was not easy to get to the elevator reeked of cigarette smoke,3
9352,the house keeping staff was kind but when i asked for something they kind of mean,3
9353,our room was fine and the staff was pleasant enough,3
9354,friendly staff when we checked in and was told the same,3
9355,they tried to give us a room with a refrigerator i felt he profiled me was not pleased,3
9356,a new swimming pool is being added on the 2nd floor and it stank when the humidity was high,3
9357,no hot water on the 4th floor very quiet bed comfortable,3
9358,i can't stand cigarette smoke and even though i am used to sleeping in a softer bed i slept ok,3
9359,there is nothing fancy about the hotel but it was less than that,3
9360,but it was great to be close to everything its ideal,3
9361,there was some ants inside the room at last night and the staff is not really helpful and you don't mind the gangstas,3
9362,the location is not bad as it is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from venice,3
9363,the woman who cleaned our room was very friendly and our room was very spacious with a separate sitting area from the beds,3
9364,there was only 1 small light in the bathroom and were told that the orange juice was done for the day,3
9365,best things bed was firm and comfortable front desk staff was fine room was big and the bed confortable,3
9366,the motel was no frills but the room was clean and spacey just too thin walls,3
9367,bathroom again a little dated but still functional,3
9368,the wifi never connected and we had to call for a replacement,3
9369,i was worried about noise as we were right next to the riverfront and a minute fromt he dom,3
9370,i will try a different hotel the next time we are in town,3
9371,will stay there again any time i'm in the area but you get what you pay for,3
9372,just don't plan to do anything using the wi-fi though free was constantly cutting out and in,3
9373,it is in a great location for our needs is very good,3
9374,asked for one at the front desk was very rude about me being a kimpton member,3
9375,the bathroom grout needed to be bleached but it was clean and the staff were very friendly courteous and friendly,3
9376,and the television was old and it water hammered all night,3
9377,separate kids area with smaller frog slide and a hot tub as well as we were in town for a work event at ung,3
9378,beware if you want to use it you need to leave the room for several hours,3
9379,the room was clean and pristine aside from the musty smell and room service was always happy to deliver more pillows with a smile,3
9380,had to wait over an hour to get to the hotel but you got the noise too,3
9381,more towels would have been nice to have more than one suitcase,3
9382,i was just glad that the other guests weren't in the room but your not promised what you asked for,3
9383,no options for room service and the restaurant at the hotel was great for the price many other options for hotels in the same location,3
9384,the only complaint was the check-in process took a long time for a shower which i really enjoyed,3
9385,we were just there to sleep so it served its purpose for good rest and shower,3
9386,room was clean front desk clerk was not very friendly,3
9387,we have stayed here a couple of years ago and we liked it,3
9388,i neglected to note there was no elevator and the wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction,3
9389,valet parking is mandatory as there is no a c but we were fine,3
9390,location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to even swim on our family vacation,3
9391,if you are on a budget this is as good place to stay if you don't want to wait,3
9392,the first is that our room was extremely hot as well called the front desk assured me if it was found housekeeping would have it,3
9393,it was a nice hotel but it's about the location,3
9394,the up stairs electric heater ran on high with no way to turn it off because of marijuana smell blowing into room,3
9395,i went back to the desk to find no one there for some time y the looks of the property and amenities,3
9396,the noise level was out of this world and we were there for the juniata new student orientation,3
9397,we went to san jose to watch a sharks game and this was a convenient location for our needs and was clean and comfortable,3
9398,soon discovered that the toilet seat was up and the water in the area has a brown tint,3
9399,we liked that it had a swimming pool and fitness center were all exceptional,3
9400,overpriced by 30 for what it is and what it offers,3
9401,but the room itself was nice but the air conditioner in our room did not face the picnic party area,3
9402,whole place is non smoking but our room had black mold on the shower curtain,3
9403,rooms could be bigger and a bit of a funky smell oldish maybe a bit moldish,3
9404,we did back up the truck a few stalls from the entrance and within walking distance of key shopping dining and beach areas,3
9405,no options for room service and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference,3
9406,it was good hotel for a quick stop over the hotel was fine,3
9407,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room would have been nice to know that it is under construction,3
9408,my shower was recently re-tiled and was nice except there was no parking directly in front of our room,3
9409,i d say overall experience was good though and the room had a very damp smell and the rug was also damp,3
9410,otherwise the room was clean and semi quiet,3
9411,they ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't have a ground-story room available,3
9412,exercise room is small and the air conditioner did not cool off the room for several hours,3
9413,staff could not keep up it was as if we were staying at a motel 6,3

9416,we were there to visit universities in the area and there seemed to be a good rate,3
9417,the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a little more contemporary,3
9418,i think i will be going back there next year,3
9419,the staff were very friendly and willing to help you out if needed,3
9420,stayed here for work because it was the end of the hallway similar to the units in the rooms so it was quite noisy,3

9425,when i woke the next morning i mentioned problem upon checkout and the front desk was very helpful,3
9426,this place was a budget price i would not have seen it had it not been for the big sign,3
9427,really loud doors slamming people talking in the room next door early in the morning and everything would be ok,3
9428,room primarily just used to sleep and prepare to go back to our room at nearly 10:00pm all we wanted to do,3
9429,this is a shame because the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very bad,3
9430,a more serious complaint is that the room smelled a little funny like burnt rubber breakfast left something to be desired,3
9431,we did complain and were told that the parking was free when we left the property,3
9432,this location is easy access to the highway and not overly expensive and this fit the bill,3

9440,we found stephanie at the front desk was great the room could have also had a more pleasant smell,3
9441,the tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise,3
9442,must have been a sealing problem at the base of the toilet which gave the bathroom a very bad look,3
9443,the hotel met our needs for a place to crash for the night this was an average hotel in the burlington area,3
9444,the only things i didn't like the fact that there were signs everywhere saying,3

9446,we arrived late as it was a busy weekend and she did a good job of it,3
9447,the hotel manager came to the room but didn't,3
9448,if you're looking for a nice looking room go elsewhere,3

9451,we had dogs barking for hours throughout our stay that we were able to book our weekend trip last minute,3
9452,the place i'd clean and comfortable but i found that the aspen haus was not for,3
9453,needs remodeling set up was not conducive for a good night's rest and continued our trip the next day,3
9454,i had to take care of any need i may have had some trouble checking in,3
9455,the restaurant closed at 9:00 on a friday night with the option to pay or leave,3
9456,i was not thinking much about the hotel but it was sold out,3

9461,we also were told there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
9462,our maid service was not great i stood at the front desk and after call a off duty manager they gave me a queen bed,3
9463,we couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel is always a disappointment,3
9464,also my nephew told me the new waterpark had chilly water so i didn't expect 5 star but i didn't care,3
9465,this is a nice place for a quick in-out one night stay,3
9466,saw a couple too lazy to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
9467,the only down side was that the pool was closed and the staff did a good job,3
9468,we were traveling i-35 and needed a place to sleep for the night,3
9469,we were disappointed in our weekend at this holiday inn express several timesaver the past 5 years,3
9470,so friendly here they go out of their way to help us with any concerns that we had,3
9471,the staff is friendly and it is pet friendly and the location is great walking distance to lots of great restaurants bars and sights,3

9473,we had to walk to another hotel to see what they had,3
9474,the hairdryer was missing the towels were rough and scratchy and there was a bunch of tagging,3
9475,in order to get ice you have to go to family court down the street it's ok,3

9482,i stayed at this hotel because of the location friendly staff good price seeing the time of year,3
9483,front desk was friendly enough when we checked in we were told that this service was not offered,3
9484,we were assigned the room next to ours had the same problem with all but one,3
9485,hotel is nice and the rooms were very outdated,3
9486,the hotel gave me one of the worst hotels for shuttle service,3
9487,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue for those sensitive to it,3
9488,on sunday we went out as the breakfast area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
9489,it might have been helpful if they had offered to help with luggage which was no skin off my back,3
9490,the bathroom have dirt on the floor look like it hadn't been cleaned in a long time,3
9491,if we were given a room with 2 queen beds,3
9492,not a great place for a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
9493,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
9494,as the title said it was not the hotel's fault,3
9495,walls are thin and you could hear people on the street,3
9496,glad it was pet friendly and didn't charge for a pet to stay,3
9497,i'm a non smoker and requesting a non smoking room both at booking and at check in,3
9498,people were smoking in the dining room and we wanted to stay on the beach,3
9499,we stayed there 3 days and it was like a sauna in our room,3
9500,king sized bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good no 24 hour reception available,3
9501,was here one night on our way to gatlinburg and this hotel is right off the highway not too loud in the mornings,3
9502,staff was great the room was clean but had a bit of a problem if you have big luggages,3
9503,when we first got to the room from the drive,3
9504,it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
9505,the customer service was great and the views from the pool were beautiful but we had a bad experience with best western,3
9506,be aware that they will ask for a room away from the tracks,3
9507,kids activities in the evening but unless you eat at the hotel restaurant was quite pleasant and the staff was friendly and room was clean,3
9508,the la quinta ft lauderdale-sunrise is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance,3
9509,surprisingly good for the price great location staff was very nice with restaurants all around,3
9510,the room was clean and pest-free and the bed was comfortable and the shower worked great,3
9511,hotel deca was located in a bad area of town,3
9512,overall the hotel was showing its age but it's right on 28th street where you can find most anything,3
9513,there are a number of restaurants within walking distance which have decent food,3
9514,very nice and comfortable and the staff wasn't that friendly to me neither,3
9515,there is a lot of noise kids running in the halls all night and early morning,3
9516,so we were asked to come and pick it up at the front desk was extremely helpful kind,3
9517,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
9518,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to pay a separate fee to use the pool,3
9519,i booked jacksonville plaza hotel because of the water slide for the kids we were very disappointed and displeased with this stay,3
9520,our room was on the third floor didn't work,3
9521,i stayed at this hotel several times before and probably will not stay at the ip again,3
9522,this place looks like a prison so i thought it would fall down on us so i turned,3
9523,when it poured rain the carpet just inside the entry door to the room which we cleaned up before occupying the room,3
9524,the beach cove resort hotel is an older hotel now showing its age but the beds were clean and nice,3
9525,the king bed was comfortable and the room was ok but there was no microwave and we had a peaceful and uneventful stay,3
9526,all in all it was an ok stay nothing spectacular,3
9527,i am glad to see you had an excellent stay at our hotel and will be going back to the hotel,3
9528,trying to watch our spending we chose this motel after a long day in the sun followed by a car crash in a parking lot,3
9529,the hotel was conveniently at a good rate this hotel would work fine,3
9530,i recommend this hotel if you have any problems talk to claudette,3
9531,the front desk staff were very nice but seemed understaffed,3
9532,it looks like a cheap motel but the rooms have what you need fridge microwave coffee maker,3
9533,although the room was clean and comfortable the staff friendly and helpful the bed was comfy and the climate in the room was quite small,3
9534,other than the roach the room and bathroom were clean and warm,3
9535,the staff the was friendly and the room was comfortable and the room was clean and the room smelled like stale smoke,3
9536,it had a smell and we didn't get robbed or sick but that is about it,3
9537,the room was appointed like an innner city loft except it was the size of our room which wasn't the case for others,3
9538,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but didn't affect our stay,3
9539,whenever there was a problem with the hotel was room size particularly bathroom size,3
9540,the breakfast area in the lobby is covered by a piece,3
9541,i can't be too hard on this hotel because i didn't return the room cards,3
9542,we enjoyed the indoor pool which was warm and inviting with jazz music being piped in and the front desk was very,3
9543,the hotel is reasonable the location is good and the lobby is no exception,3
9544,room was nice though i would choose a room with a nonstandard bathroom generally fine but noise pollution may be an issue,3
9545,me and the mrs stayed at the hotel valencia for a few days,3
9546,the standard room is an okay size though the bathroom is small but was not an issue,3
9547,no choice of other hotels in the same price range and see if it gets better,3
9548,i recommend this hotel if you're looking for a nice looking room go elsewhere,3
9549,however the hotel is a bit loaded,3
9550,not worth the money i saved over the weekend to stay there again at least until they renovate,3
9551,room was clean and the customer service was just okay,3
9552,the water pressure was poor and the shower had little water coming out wifi signal was weak,3
9553,room was clean and the staff wasn't overly friendly but it was clean and we had everything,3
9554,price we paid was appropriate for the room we had was not as nice as we have come to expect laquintas to be,3
9555,it is in a great location the staff was very nice and helpful,3
9556,the tv was older and so were the staff making the breakfast,3
9557,the air unit did not work and room was old,3

9560,the cold water wasn't working as well as the complimentary breakfast,3
9561,the front desk staff was very friendly at check-in,3
9562,rooms look just as in the pictures on website a bit small but close enough to where i had to go ask for a blanket,3
9563,the day we checked out i went down to the front desk about it,3
9564,when i got to my room and an elevator,3
9565,a word of advice to other travelers book a room on the ground floor facing the parking lot,3
9566,didn't sleep at all due to the noise of people coming and going at all hours,3
9567,this room definitely did not appear to have an elevator for second floor access,3
9568,it is an ok place to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant,3
9569,my room was across the street from the beach,3
9570,it's an average stay for sleep but don't expect the service to wow you,3
9571,had to ask for towels and the ac did not work which would have helped drown out the highway sound and,3
9572,i will go there again for the price and that was certainly delivered,3
9573,elevator was out of service for 4 days and 3 nights at cypress creek,3
9574,i am pretty particular when i stay at a hotel for 3 weeks you expect to be able to close our toilet seat,3
9575,the staff and accommodations were nice but we found ants in our room,3
9576,we took pictures and showed one to the desk clerk was pleasant with us when we checked in was a bit aloof and cool,3
9577,beds were fine and it was just a stop for sleep on the way,3
9578,yes there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building,3
9579,there was no one at the front desk could have been warmer but the room was very nice though and clean,3
9580,room was very clean with a modern decor and it had all of the essentials and they all worked find,3
9581,the rooms were clean it has a fridge it's not too close to the highway which was convenient for us,3
9582,i explained to her about the game being on and that we could have only one towel then closed up the area and disappeared,3
9583,breakfast was ok but other hotels in the immediate area except for fast food,3
9584,it looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and the pictures are not reliable,3
9585,when we go to our room and find things moved around,3
9586,the hotel was full the night we stayed on a relatively warm weekend so being without ac wasn't as bad,3
9587,it was severely understaffed for a busy weekend and she did a good job,3
9588,i was glad they checked further and found a way for us to stay there nice hotel and pools but too many mosquitoes,3
9589,hot breakfast nothing fancy but it was comfortable enough,3
9590,walls are extremely thin and we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours of the morning,3
9591,we booked this hotel as i just needed a bed and shower the next morning,3
9592,the rooms are not much but it is clean with a fridge microwave and airconditioning,3
9593,overall i'd say it's a solid 3 star,3
9594,however it did have a very nice pool and they keep it very clean,3
9595,stayed here for a night on my way across the country,3
9596,all in all though we enjoyed our stay there and did not have family with,3
9597,this was our first stay at this motel and for one night it's ok no people when you go late night people nice,3
9598,it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
9599,i thought it was going to be a very mixed review,3
9600,beds very nice by any standard and the pool wasn't available during my stay,3
9601,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
9602,the place is ok a little old but it was clean,3
9603,during our visit to boston we stayed here for a combo business family trip,3
9604,the old tube tv didn't work and it was like this every morning,3
9605,great trip help at the hotel was not horrible for the price,3
9606,the hotel was clean but in bad condition,3
9607,this hotel is a good choice if you're looking for a classy establishment folks look elsewhere,3
9608,the room was clean although it could use some updating popcorn ceiling needed some attention furniture was worn and felt dirty,3
9609,would i stay again probably for the price and location just don't stay in room 107,3
9610,the hotel price was good but the 2nd stay was not,3
9611,the room seemed kind of out dated and i wouldn't have noticed the noise so much,3
9612,we often stay at this older country inn on our way to gatlinburg and this hotel is nice and the design is pretty cool,3
9613,we were a little misinformed when we were told we were upgraded not sure exactly what that upgrade meant,3
9614,the parking lot can be a bit difficult to find on iphone maps and location disappointing upon finding,3
9615,other than that our stay was very welcome at the end of june 2016,3
9616,it had an old box tv and everything in the room was worn and stained dirty,3
9617,this is my first time in a ground level room and the stay was not up to what is expected for a monaco hotel,3
9618,the parking lot was very crowded and no place to sit down to eat,3
9619,all and all i might stay there again but ok for a last minute booking and on a friday night,3
9620,the place i'd clean and comfortable but nothing particularly special,3
9621,great very friendly staff and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
9622,the overall hotel was fine the room was clean hotel shows wear for age,3
9623,the staff is very friendly and accommodated me immediately when my tv didn't work at first as the cable was broken,3
9624,it was fine for a stop over it was clean but we wouldn't stay there again,3
9625,it would be nice to have more than one person at a time,3
9626,it is clean breakfast is included in this price range can use shower upgrade,3
9627,definitely a student housing hostel type place but it's in a good location for the college,3
9628,friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle with a hard bar,3
9629,location was ok clean room but the front desk clerks always come thru,3
9630,place was great room next to us fighting for awhile,3
9631,the one drawback was there was not a good situation for me,3
9632,the room was clean but there were hardly enough towels provided and they were very short to get off the phone,3
9633,for a quick one night stay for us,3
9634,i felt as if i was sleeping on the streets,3
9635,doors to our room were quite thin so it was quite hot and stuffy in the hall,3
9636,the air conditioner leaked but it worked so i didn't care at that point i was so itchy,3
9637,the room we stayed in this hotel while visiting family,3
9638,we stayed at this place four years ago and it was great but the room was,3
9639,the elevator still doesn't work and they could not fix it,3
9640,the tv was small and the bed was comfortable,3
9641,definitely will never stay there again and too far from the hotel they,3
9642,it was someplace to sleep and the access to the street didn't feel the cleaning was sufficient as the room was being cleaned,3
9643,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
9644,the hotel is located in a great location the room was small but very nice and clean,3
9645,this hotel was nice but next to the train tracks and it is loud and shakes the building,3
9646,rooms were clean the property was run down and in need of upgrades,3
9647,i found out during the night that my room had no problems getting a receipt for her complete stay,3
9648,the said they had no king beds available no breakfast and no close restaurants,3
9649,visited here mainly because it was one of the least expensive for the area,3
9650,overall i was satisfied with my stay at this hotel in 3 years,3
9651,they didn't clean our bathroom one morning called down to get more coffee three times and it never came,3
9652,my fianc and i stayed here to save some money but it might have been helpful if they had offered to help with my bags,3
9653,the restaurant and the food was above average,3
9654,the hotel is fine but don't go expecting courteous service,3
9655,hotel has been around for a long time for the water in the toilet and large black cockroaches running around outside,3
9656,it was exactly what i wanted every morning,3
9657,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of cleaning carpets for all rooms in the hotel,3
9658,i'd only recommend this hotel if you're looking a budget-friendly family-friendly hotel that is close,3
9659,being the biggest location in town for a work event at ung,3
9660,reported to the front desk i was informed there wasn't any rooms available but i'd already paid for my room,3
9661,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't think we will stay here again,3
9662,broken mirror destroyed room phone but other than that it was ok i never stay there again,3
9663,bfast good they have a waffle maker and some muffins,3
9664,the best part was the location-very close to the winery we went too as well as occ,3
9665,the hotel was located in a great area,3
9666,it was also very disappointing when we went to go sightseeing the door would not close,3
9667,just not worth what they charge for 24 hours of access,3
9668,we booked this hotel because it had a very smokey smell,3
9669,now it is just another dated property that looks like it's stuck in the 70's and hasn't been cleaned,3
9670,we will stay here again since we did not get an early start to our day,3
9671,i booked jacksonville plaza hotel because of the water slide for the kids we were very disappointed in the hotel condition,3
9672,overall my stay was good and the bed was kind of sagging in the middle,3
9673,we recently went upstate ny for fall foliage and stayed here for a total of 4 weeks straight,3
9674,you can either walk if feeling energetic or it's easy to bring your own bowls plates etc,3
9675,breakfast was okay the rooms were clean but severely dated,3
9676,cheap so okay for a place to fall down and sleep so i really didn't care for the attitude of the desk person,3
9677,there were no rooms with double beds in both rooms the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was very small but clean,3
9678,we could not even have a cup of coffee which u have nice selections,3
9679,the location and appearance of the hotel were pretty and breakfast was provided,3
9680,the guide on tv didn't work and tiles were loose in the bathroom,3
9681,took about an hour of our time during our stay that we were able to figure out the remote to the television,3
9682,check in staff was polite and the location was easy to find but could use some more counter space,3
9683,there were no towels or soap and we waited at the front desk the service was always prompt and polite,3
9684,but they do take a 50 deposit upon check-in and the staff were all good pleasant helpful and smiling,3
9685,the hotel was right off the highway and they'll give you a voucher for mcdonald's which is right next door so very convenient,3
9686,basic place good for a place to sleep so it served its purpose for just sleep,3
9687,tbe the price was right and the location could not be beat,3
9688,we arrived early so the room wasn't anything special but the beds were very comfortable great mattresses,3
9689,we had a 2 night stay and i don't really enjoy pool action anymore,3
9690,i had a problem with ants but it was cleaned up but the dead ants were in the same place,3
9691,service could be better concierge didn't give us the wi-fi though free was constantly cutting out and in,3
9692,however one of the two elevators is out of work but the location is good and the lobby is well lit,3
9693,have been staying at this hotel if you are in need of replacement in our room,3
9694,in a rough neighbourhood but that's not much of a view in any direction,3
9695,an electrical breaker shorted in the room and told her the beds had not been made although the towels were replaced,3
9696,i think i can get better value for the money we paid 99 a night cheap for the keys,3
9697,upon arrival spare blanket was soiled and we had to go back to campus,3
9698,the hotel can be difficult to communicate with if you do not care that you are not staying by the beach,3
9699,it was clean and comfortable and the parking is safe,3
9700,the wifi connection at this hotel is always a disappointment,3
9701,disappointed that hair dryer did not work properly or at all at times,3
9702,got the 2 queen bed with sleeper sofa for our family of four the room was small and nothing special,3
9703,we were awakened 9 am by the fire alarm and had to be found to check in and out easy,3
9704,i was quite surprised when we got into the room it had already been cleaned,3
9705,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
9706,the sheets were clean but the bathroom floor was overlooked,3
9707,we took pictures and showed one to the desk clerk was kind and friendly,3
9708,you get what you pay for but there was no soap in the shower and found a lot more,3
9709,the furthest room in the corner on the first floor in the back room which was a comfortable place,3
9710,the pool area was nice and seemed to be bothered when having to assist us,3
9711,we needed a place to stay one night so it was all about location,3
9712,on the negative breakfast is not included with this hotel and they were taken,3
9713,if ya got ta poop this is the best hotel i've stayed at yet,3
9714,the bones of the building are a little old but good for a room and a bed,3
9715,we have never traveled with our dog and he was comfortable in the room during the extreme wind and rain,3
9716,the wifi is sub par to say the least and some of the rooms have a refrigerator and some don't,3
9717,we had booked the hotel for the price,3
9718,the train close to this hotel is either indifferent or incompetent,3
9719,when i arrived i was given a double bed standard,3

9725,the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable and there was a little mold around the tub,3
9726,the carpet is old and threadbare and the bed was comfortable and the location of the room,3
9727,the price was fair for that time of the year with everyone moving out,3
9728,you just have to remember that this used to be a coffee maker in the room but no iron bed was comfortable,3
9729,my stay was ok but we wouldn't stay there for a long time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
9730,the promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be too friendly towards cash customers,3
9731,i was not impressed with the breakfast food in the morning and came back in the evening,3
9732,i have a disability where i have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area,3
9733,on the plus side rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
9734,they didn't seem to be in the dining area without any tv's,3
9735,the hotel was quiet and the room was hot humid and musty,3
9736,had a king suite on the 2nd floor that was quieter,3
9737,the rooms were like this but it was a last minute decision to go,3

9739,they were small and you could hear people in the hallway all night,3
9740,hot breakfast nothing fancy but it was clean,3
9741,the free breakfast was a plus and the staff was very friendly,3

9744,the tile floor in one of the chairs in the lobby,3

9748,the elevator was not working on the second day we stayed two nights,3
9749,cons it was very noisy and propped open,3
9750,overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if passing through but not fr more then a night,3
9751,i called them was told a shampoo dispenser was damaged the room smelled of it clean towels did and so did the bedding,3
9752,the adult pool was a lot better than in person,3
9753,the hotel gave me one of the worst hotels for shuttle service,3
9754,in general this hampton falls short in many areas and i do not recommend this to tourist good for needing somewhere to stay,3
9755,good beer selection but this is not a reception problem for the entire facility,3
9756,there is alot of fresh food for breakfast and it was swamped with people,3
9757,a couple of brown spots on the ceiling from what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
9758,i had to use the hotel room service,3
9759,the hotel did not have my reservation so i had to settle on this hotel,3
9760,we arrived early so the room wasn't thoroughly cleaned however the front desk clerk was very friendly,3
9761,i had even asked at the desk and in the restaurant and that's where the nightmare occurred,3
9762,for the price it was a great place to stay,3
9763,i personally did not find the room as clean as i've wanted it comparing it to hotels of this rating,3
9764,i was not exactly impressed with that but overall it was a pleasant stay and we will use super 8 kingston again,3
9765,we wanted to be a walk to the beach and come back for the,3
9766,i went to get food shortly after i arrived at the hotel at 2:50pm with a 3 pm check-in time,3
9767,if you're looking for a place to crash but not for the unfit as there's just too much stairs to move around,3
9768,he and the staff were friendly and helpful,3
9769,we did ask for a smoking room so we bucked up and stayed the night,3
9770,we were promised rooms on the first floor since this hotel did not have 2 room suites,3
9771,front desk staff was very helpful with directions,3
9772,we were there for july 4th and by the time we checked in she was giving me a queen,3

9774,also i had a big surprise when i checked in i was given a handicap room which i didn't ask for the correct room,3
9775,the only soda and ice machines available were on the first floor who would hear everyone's comings and goings,3
9776,overall it was ok for the most part we enjoyed our stay,3
9777,both elevators are also old and need to be refreshed in many ways,3
9778,we stayed for two nights and they did not refill much from day to day,3
9779,clumpy grits dry eggs no complementary coffee service unless you go to the lobby several times to use skype and check emails,3
9780,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was an older place that had been updated,3
9781,i stayed here once a couple of years ago the property is showing some wear but the room and bed were fine for one night,3
9782,the manager lied to us saying first they didn't even have lids for the coffee which tasted like poison,3
9783,overall i was satisfied with my stay at this extended stay,3
9784,my husband came to where i was having a medical procedure,3
9785,the hotel was still under construction at the time of booking were not available,3

9788,pretty sure we won't be visiting again,3
9789,we booked this hostel because it was the end of the night were quite dirty,3
9790,the location was great in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk,3
9791,i was staying with my two young children and we had a comfortable stay as we traveled north to ontario,3
9792,i had to persuade the front desk to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby,3
9793,also the check-in process took a long time for a shower which i really enjoyed,3
9794,the breakfast they offer was decent and the staff was great,3
9795,asked for a non smoking room but the odor was significant,3
9796,the night time staff at the front desk was very apologetic and comped me a night of valet parking,3
9797,room was clean but seemed damp mildewed like no one had vacuumed i would never recommend anyone to stay here,3
9798,comfort in the hotel was good for sleeping,3

9800,a decent place to sleep very close to the train station,3
9801,my husband and i stayed at the davie location which was very clean and the staff friendly,3
9802,it was a nice hotel but it's about the only place in town,3
9803,only real downside is not being able to view hd channels,3
9804,the sound-proof needs to be improved upon but other than that all was nice,3
9805,i would have rated it higher but there was no signal in our room,3
9806,on the whole as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but getting back to the interstate and resulted in a somewhat noisy room,3
9807,just the bug bites i went home with were a bit of a take it or leave it attitude from the hosts,3
9808,also very quiet for being in the center of everything we needed to do which was nice,3
9809,the lakeside park right across the street from the beach,3
9810,the stay was fine and i would stay at another property,3
9811,they did rectify this by moving us to a new room which was much better newer and cleaner,3
9812,the hotel staff was friendly and the room was very expensive for that class of a hotel,3
9813,the room was noisy and the access to the main highway was good,3
9814,the blankets were really thin so i recommend asking for a room on the third floor which i could tell had not,3
9815,it was a clean safe place to sleep for a couple of nights,3
9816,the bathroom was small but adequate and clean as was the en-suite bathroom,3
9817,this hotel is no longer a country inn and suites that hasn't been updated since the late 90's,3
9818,waterpark was the best part of my stay,3
9819,rooms and breakfast were very nice and the location was good for the price,3
9820,the bed was very comfortable but the rooms were nice and we have stayed here once before and had forgotten why i avoided this hotel,3

9822,we were on the third floor didn't work and tiles were loose in the bathroom,3
9823,the location was good the people were friendly the room was dusty on the furniture as well as the hot tub,3
9824,the woman who cleaned our room was very small without any place to tidy clothes,3
9825,the rooms are older and smaller and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables,3
9826,was not impressed a few nights when one of the staff had poor command of the english language,3
9827,i can't be too hard on this hotel because i didn't ask for the correct room,3
9828,when returning from dinner our room was freezing cold when we got there,3
9829,rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are bothered by traffic noise request a room in the back,3
9830,bed was fairly uncomfortable but we were only there for the night because you have to go inside to get to your room,3
9831,we pre-arrnged to have our room either on the first floor the older male shook his head no,3
9832,beds very nice by any standard and the pool wasn't available during my stay,3
9833,definitely a student housing hostel type place but it's in a good location close to a hubway bikeshare station and walking distance to town,3
9834,i had a smoking room and had to move us 2 days later,3
9835,the room barely fits the bed and you have to park in the adjacent city owned parking garage,3

9837,it is clean breakfast is included in this price range,3
9838,good breakfast fare with plenty of choices as well as a swimming pool and a fitness center,3
9839,came with a small fridge that looked like it had been cleaned it was just old and stained,3
9840,the weather also did not seem to be in the best location due to reading the other reviews,3
9841,i think it is overpriced for what you get located close to public transit and nice mall though,3
9842,also there was a party of people in the room next is complaining,3
9843,breakfast was fine and they had a shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
9844,getting to the hotel is the staff,3
9845,this hotel is just what you should expect for the price you are paying i would say this was absolutely reasonable,3
9846,there were semi's that looked like they had been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
9847,televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
9848,had to run a c to drown out the noise from the trucks dose not give you a good night sleep,3
9849,even though the room was okay but we were hoping for a better night,3
9850,my stay was good and the service was really slow,3
9851,i stayed here once a couple of years ago and we liked it,3
9852,the weather was hot and the room was very dated but it was pretty bad,3

9854,the hotel is very convenient to the airport,3
9855,the room was decent and clean as was the bathroom so no complaints there,3
9856,when i finally checked in the room was not clean the gold fish we had requested came hours,3
9857,there also is a pool out front but it was closed because we just had to drain it and change the levels,3
9858,i was suprised that many of the hotel and for that reason i would not recommend to a friend without the caveats i have mentioned,3
9859,finally a couple had a huge screaming fight in the middle of remodeling so it was hard to get on and off,3
9860,a decent hotel for the price and the breakfast was pretty sparse would have appreciated having some fresh fruit,3
9861,the fitness area is laughably poor it is in a great location and a decent breakfast,3
9862,the first problem was that as soon as we walked in we could smell cigarette smoke,3
9863,unfortunately the inconsiderate idiots in the room next door early in the morning then enter,3
9864,pool area needs some work and hot tub didn't work so it was far from comfortable,3
9865,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
9866,breakfast was fine and they had a free shuttle to sfo is the best perk,3
9867,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to make one trip up the stairs,3
9868,i was quite surprised when we got into the room we found that the hotel is under major renovation,3
9869,it was good the only thing that made my latest stay at the hotel and liked it,3
9870,hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and son's birthday weekend,3
9871,my son went swimming and there was a slight sulphur sewer smell coming from the bathroom,3
9872,we had booked the hotel for the pool,3
9873,when i went to check out no one was in the lower class,3
9874,i felt as if i was sleeping on the streets,3
9875,booked online showed up and was given a double with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
9876,what i couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and bathroom walls had hair dye on them,3
9877,bed was hard pillows were small and not very private,3
9878,we stayed at this hotel on a last minute trip not pleasure,3
9879,the room was nicer that i thought it was overpriced for a hampton inn,3
9880,the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice as it was within walking distance of this place,3
9881,the hotel price was good but hotel needs some cosmetic work,3
9882,the building is getting a little dated and tv was old but adequate for the price but no extras,3
9883,i think they need to get new towels,3
9884,the room was worth the price it was alright,3
9885,the location is convenient to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
9886,and you are in the center of the santana row,3
9887,we finally had to walk down to the desk for another set to,3
9888,other than that the hotel staff were helpful in giving directions to local attractions,3
9889,our room was not cleaned and i had to park at the other end of the casino from registration,3

9891,purchased a double queen room with a sleeper sofa,3
9892,staff was friendly and helpful especially julio at the front desk was very apologetic and fixed the situation immediately,3
9893,the staff wasn't overly friendly but it was clean and comfy beds close to airport with free shuttle,3
9894,the breakfast was okay but the person taking care of 16 of us this was a prearranged private booked brunch,3
9895,we don't drink and drive and it is easy to walk to places to eat and shops,3
9896,staff not very friendly except sam which was very helpful and i actually left with a smile,3
9897,the bathroom looked like it had been cleaned well outside of the residual cigarette smell,3
9898,the staff was very friendly and our room was directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
9899,if you are not one of the 74 recently renovated rooms,3
9900,beds were comfortable and the staff is accommodating,3
9901,the continental breakfast was nothing to brag about,3
9902,pool was dated as well as the chico state campus,3
9903,we did ask for a accessible room but a grab bar in the bathroom was curling along the front of the hotel,3
9904,breakfast would have been much better if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early,3
9905,it was super small we had a full bed instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault,3
9906,we told the reception about this and they really should have,3
9907,very helpful front desk when we arrived late at night after driving 10 hours only to find no room for us,3
9908,rooms were nice and we have stayed here a couple of years ago with no issues,3
9909,the hotel was very nice however we booked a room for a weekend in a couple weeks,3
9910,but the location was great in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk,3
9911,good place to crash in between hanging out at the pool but surprisingly fri was quieter,3
9912,the hotel could use some renovation but adequately met our needs for the few days we needed,3
9913,the staff was very nice and our stay was okay nothing particularly noteworthy,3
9914,my family stayed the weekend at the sf mandarin oriental,3
9915,the hotel itself is welcoming the staff friendly and helpful the room however was clean nicely done and very pleasant,3
9916,could connect to the internet but because it was so slow i could not even make or receive calls while in my room,3
9917,pretty outdated but i wasn't sure why,3
9918,the tv was in the center of the room so it was a good place to stay,3
9919,breakfast had a wide variety of food but it was free so what can you say,3
9920,not enough towels or pillows given this time for a room that is an add on to the regular suite,3
9921,ironing board iron in the room is noisy we asked to have a cot in the room,3
9922,one of the elevators was broken so we had to walk down to desk because a hair dryer didn't work,3
9923,i appreciated an early check-in and direction to the room,3
9924,the fellow who checked us in on friday was very nice and went out of his way to make sure everyone was taken care of,3
9925,would not recommend for solo females just because of the pool for my youngest however we did not have a good night sleep,3
9926,we could not even have a cup of coffee and enjoyed warm oatmeal with brown sugar raisins and cream delicious,3
9927,for example almost had to convince the front desk to check in as they were dropping someone off to the airport,3
9928,there is an indescribable odor in the hallways but not as much as the rooms themselves,3
9929,the hotel was under construction i wish they would have put the heat on before we got there,3

9931,my companion and i decided to take a chance on this,3
9932,the room was very clean and nice staff was friendly and the room was comfortable but not a great area of town,3
9933,i would not use it again and would not recommend it for an extended beach vacation,3
9934,we reserved a non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke,3
9935,beds were comfy pillows were good bathroom area was ok and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo,3
9936,a little far from campus and downtown but not too bad if you stay on the pool side,3
9937,they assigned us a smoking room and was told there were only 4 double beds in the hotel and they were mostly positive,3
9938,the king bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good with a nice selection,3
9939,staff was great bed was super nice and really appreciated her service,3
9940,the refrigerator was very noisy and propped open,3
9941,i was pleasantly surprised about how nice the room was good but noise of room next door bad was very noises,3
9942,i read the reviews for this hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park,3
9943,didn't smell it in the hall but as soon as i got off the elevator to go to my mobile hot spot,3
9944,and our room was on the second level no elevator,3
9945,no water to our room for a half hour after a call to the front desk,3
9946,there is no daily housekeeping for us that wasn't a problem for us our concert is only a mile a half away,3
9947,we knew we would be getting ourselves into,3
9948,the breakfast area in the lobby is very small and the bed was comfortable,3
9949,i've stayed at a lot of hotels in the vicinity,3
9950,the rooms have not been updated in years,3
9951,didn't not supply extra pillows and blankets in the closet,3
9952,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
9953,this hotel isn't a bad option for a quick overnight and this fit the bill,3
9954,it's less than 10 minutes from the airport it's very clean,3
9955,when we asked a manager if we could change rooms but they were completely booked,3

9957,ac was good bed was comfy enough pools are great and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries,3
9958,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't any king rooms available except for handicap king room,3
9959,rooms are very clean and tidy they are a little on the lumpy uncomfy side but very clean,3
9960,this visit was for a family get together for a night and best thing off that exit,3
9961,also room we were given was dark and gloomy didn't have a ground-story room available,3
9962,getting there is a little weird you have to go to family court down the street it's ok,3
9963,rather dated but our room was fine and the staff were great especially during check in,3
9964,the room was in need of a makeover,3
9965,hotel has been around for a long time while we were checking in,3
9966,everything was perfect with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
9967,but you can walk to a lot of good restaurants and things,3
9968,for both visits my reservation was for a room with 2 single beds instead,3
9969,the room had a great view and i liked the room however it had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in it,3
9970,angelina's is an ok place to stay if you don't need much then it's a fine place to rest your head,3
9971,the hotel itself or should i say tried to eat,3
9972,this was my third or fourth choice for a last minute or a one night stay,3
9973,the staff treated us as if we were an inconvenience not painv customers,3
9974,the room was clean and the staff were all good pleasant helpful and smiling,3
9975,there were only a hand full of cars in the parking lot at night was bit scary though,3
9976,inconveniently i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
9977,television was kind of small but we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again,3
9978,there was also a lot of noise from the hallway very audible front desk person was very nice and quickly accommodated my request,3
9979,overall i'd say it's a solid 3 star,3
9980,all inclusive is a scam as they don't have non-smoking rooms available,3
9981,to start the rooms are small but clean,3
9982,room needs updating mattress was too hard however it was clean and the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the areas attractions,3
9983,we were moved to another room because this little dog could be heard all over the hotel to find a room i was comfortable with,3
9984,however don't know if all of the rooms and the staff service would better qualify as a 3-star hotel,3
9985,thinking they meant for a couple of days for the purpose of my trip and accessible,3
9986,also lobby was a little iffy lobby restroom was not clean and there was no ac at this time of year,3
9987,the hallway is a bit outdated and the room had decent pillows as well as extras which made for a quiet stay,3
9988,everything was perfect with the exception of the first day,3
9989,the bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and no cc on its tv,3
9990,i don't think the cleanliness issue was just us either when we checked in that they were replacing the carpeting in the hallways,3
9991,the room was nicely decorated and i was just looking to take a shower i realized that there was no coffee pot in the room,3
9992,they had no information in the room so every question required,3
9993,walk across the street and meet at the hotel next door which isn't made clear in the listing,3
9994,the manager was rude the last day of our stay regardless of what time we left the hotel,3
9995,i honestly don't think that is the normal there but it was the tone of the voice from the front desk,3
9996,the room was not very clean the bathroom is tiny and the decor is very very dated,3
9997,however during my most recent stay the a c was turned on and one hour later one was still not working,3
9998,this hotel was ok but the room was clean but nothing above average,3
9999,clean room great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
