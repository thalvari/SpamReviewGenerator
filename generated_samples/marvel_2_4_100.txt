disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok. this movie was as stupid as i thought it was very dull and boring. the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do. well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive. the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have. the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own. the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific. i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers. a big step down from the first movie and some of the funny moments. iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame. edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner. with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying. this movie did a great job with him. it tried to top the first one but still really damn good. i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the mcu. scenes from trailer are also one of the worst ones that could have become of it. iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film. iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable. the movie is really forgettable and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way. he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe. wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man trilogy. everything else is terrible one of the worst films of all time. the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie. the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film. firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed. the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world. the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received. the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids. however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt. yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused. tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did. not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience. it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average. there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe. judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews. a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense. like the third installment of the cinematic universe. this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c. look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know. it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here. i really like the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie. because yes it felt like a dead horse. taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting. one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something. the movie has a lot of dumb messages. to be honest i didn't really find that involving. the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic. the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much. a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment. this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones. first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel. new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying. really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way. marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction. rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks. even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse. basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction. fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains. many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow. i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more. eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks. strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk. paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a lot going for it. to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok. then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit. it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today. not as bad as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired. it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable. the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world. the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok. more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to see more of them. was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point. it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies. like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain. another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though. paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys. i was thoroughly disappointed with this film the weakest of the iron man suits so crappy in this film. to me this is the worst film of the iron man suits so crappy in this film. i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie. i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives. the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time. again it's not one of the worst characters ever made. strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk. review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a bore. overall it was an ok movie at best. in my opinion this movie could have been so much more. her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster. the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different. and for the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring. i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers film. although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic. there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film. a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash. it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain. chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it. spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction. yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused. however my problem with spider-man being spider-man. one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe. the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers.
