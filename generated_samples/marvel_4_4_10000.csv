0,yes i can admit that i loved this movie almost as much as the winter soldier did if not more,4
1,i liked the first flick better but it's a great comedy and the visual is very much amazing,4
2,amazing movie you have to see this film,4
3,there is no doubt that guardians of the galaxy is an amazing into to a lot of people complain about the other mcu movies,4
4,guardians 2 is the super hero movie for people who don't like marvel movies,4
5,really solid and fun action movie with some great performances and awsome action along with one of the best superhero films made,4
6,just like its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
7,the visuals and the story is well told,4
8,the action and effects were amazing and it has a highly likable protagonist,4
9,toby mcguire was a good peter parker but not a great spider-man movies but still pretty good overall,4
10,along with thor ragnarok i think this film's strongest attribute is its ability to stand on its own as a great movie,4
11,it's not the movie that you could watch over and over again without ever getting bored,4
12,i was very impressed with edward norton as the hulk was replaced by mark ruffalo,4
13,not as good as the first ant-man,4
14,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
15,2 may not be as spectacular as its predecessor iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor,4
16,the trailer is just an appetizer the rest of the old cast are just as great or better like hope than last time,4
17,funny 3 this is the origianal spider-man marvel's spider-man homecoming 2 we can capture some epic and awesome moments,4
18,it's a refreshing take on the character of spider-man movies that i watched,4
19,another major plus for the film is that it stands on its own,4
20,with a story that moves results in a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
21,and overall it set the tone for what we now know as the mcu,4
22,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
23,peter has been wondering about his parentage for a while now and seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials,4
24,they give appropriate homage to ant-man but i love what pual rudd does with the character,4
25,best superhero movie i've ever seen in a movie,4
26,while maintaining the charm of the first movie but it still packs a punch,4
27,i loved pretty much every spider-man fan you will come away angry,4
28,though i didn't expect this film to be darker than the first movie by marvel studios,4
29,the looks on this is much better than its predecessor and plenty of action scenes to keep you more than entertained,4
30,i like the plot cgi is great fight scenes are great to watch amp very well choreographed,4
31,trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more human then marvels previous movies which is also great,4
32,funny and epic guardians of the galaxy which i also loved,4
33,not as good as the original but it still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
34,this was a great entrance to the marvel universe or canonical in their history,4
35,iron man 3 may not quite live up to the high standard set by its predecessor it holds its own as a great movie,4
36,homecoming is an appropriate title for the film in a number of funny moments and a butt load of action,4
37,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
38,better than i expected it to be a big dud like it was too ambitious of a project,4
39,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the best part about the movie,4
40,honestly this movie was fantastic and by far the best spider-man movies but still really good,4
41,good acting unique action sequences and some unexpectedly hilarious scenes with one of the best it's had to offer,4
42,i loved the movie it was impossible for me to walk away happy,4
43,but a special mention must be made for michael keaton's vulture character were nothing short of amazing see what i did there,4
44,guardians of the galaxy is definitely a full-of-heart script gunn and nicole perlman and a visually dazzling splendor,4
45,better than the second not quite so and this one is no different,4
46,i think this is just a minor qualm,4
47,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i felt was a little under used here as most of the others,4
48,the best thing about this marvel film is that it does not feel one sided,4
49,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
50,and the whole thing wraps up with one of the best and another perfect marvel movie and setup for new characters,4
51,although avengers age of ultron was a letdown,4
52,while ant-man has more of the same in the first movie,4
53,2 another entertaining if somewhat forgettable entry in phase 3 of the mcu complete with false hope a red wedding and hell,4
54,however the two major problems i have with the film is the villain unfortunately,4
55,the thor arc remains my favorite part of the film about how tony stark facing problems is a bit too long,4
56,the character development in this movie isn't as great as the original movie,4
57,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
58,edward norton does a fantastic job with it,4
59,he is an innocent kid as he should be and becomes in future films,4
60,this was a satisfying and emotional entry into the mcu and even after all the spider-man film we deserve,4
61,tom holland's peter parker starts by vlogging what his side of the story rocket yandu baby groot make their escape from the captivity,4
62,there were some flaws but all in all this movie was a dream for me,4
63,what with avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
64,i was not expecting to like this film as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
65,the reception for this film was all over the place linking to all manner of spinoff stories,4
66,phenomenal this by far is the comic action movie ever made from start to finish to the point where i actually cared,4
67,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes were colorful and visually appealing,4
68,breaking box office records does black panther live up to the high standard set by its predecessor but age of ultron still a great movie,4
69,the joke between tony stark and pepper pots,4
70,i personally really enjoyed this movie just like the first film,4
71,these aren't my favorite kind of movies but this one is a lot of fun,4
72,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
73,otherwise it was a wonderful addition to the marvel cinematic even if things go a little too overboard at the end,4
74,this movie did all of that and give us 2,4
75,it is one of my top 3 marvel movies of all time for me at least,4
76,like the previous installment iron man 3 is set after the event in new york city see the avengers,4
77,ant-man is another fantastic marvel film with great special effects very funny actor robert downey jr,4
78,this is my favorite iron man movie and one of the most delightful comic book movies to date,4
79,the incredible hulk iron man and the first captain america big time,4
80,action a villaion a great plot and a great cast,4
81,the avengers is one example of how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
82,now i don't know about you but i can not wait of the second one,4
83,t move marvel forward but is a nice addition to the mcu ant-man and the wasp its a good marvel film,4
84,a great movie the special effects were outstanding and it's the type of comedy that has force or cheesy jokes or nonsense,4
85,tom holland is the best spider man movie i have ever seen in my life,4
86,it offers amazing visuals and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
87,5 out of 10 a great follow up to it's prior film,4
88,i'm not a big fan of iron man now and this is one of the best superhero movie's i've ever seen,4
89,great mcu movie in the top 5 in the mcu,4
90,chris pratt owns the role of peter was played very well,4
91,i feel this is the film that started the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
92,this is a good addition to the universe for sure,4
93,but the villain ultron james spader doesn't feel compelling and avengers age of ultron is a great time at the movies,4
94,this is not yhe most elaborate super hero movie ever made but it's a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
95,in fact the character development in this movie is really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
96,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
97,has never been better as the post-avengers mcu and did so while being a fun thrill ride for the eyes,4
98,this version of spider-man into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
99,one of the good aspects of the film however did make up for it with its consistency of fun humor and self-awareness,4
100,and with the supposedly game-changing captain america civil war coming out next week which i am so excited for,4
101,but it turned out to be my favorites,4
102,paul rudd is an excellent choice to play the original ant-man movie was making it a small flick for a small hero,4
103,there also not enough of the black panther joining the avengers i don't know what i am saying,4
104,the avengers is what everyone hoped it would be it's even better,4
105,a different kind of spider-man and the wasp,4
106,and i loved seeing edward norton as bruce banner and tim roth as the villainous emil blonsky,4
107,the second guardians movie was just as much fun as the first one,4
108,this character brings a kind of realism often lacking in the mcu and one of marvels better villains,4
109,a space adventure unlike any other guardians of the galaxy captain america the winter soldier and only had 30 seconds in the movie,4
110,is at his best here and the action has a good physical feel that makes it exciting,4
111,it is a swell film in the marvel cinematic universe and let's face it they're on an epic roll,4
112,hank pym but it also manages to deliver a witty and comical script,4
113,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki ofcourse,4
114,on top of that he puts up a hell of a ride that you can enjoy,4
115,avengers age of ultron is a solid entry into the marvel cinematic universe,4
116,a vast improvement over ang lee's 2003 horrible vision of it,4
117,in this film we see more of ant-man,4
118,but the big thing is that all the action scenes involving the suits are a visual treat,4
119,tom holland is great as spider-man and iron-man,4
120,this was a very good focal point of the movie the film lulls you into this sense of comfort,4
121,however i have heard of ant man and the wasp is a fun summer popcorn movie,4
122,besides being an immensely fun roller coaster ride the avengers is a fun entertaining film that is a slight inconvenience to our dynamic duo,4
123,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero film ant-man is a great comedy heist film starring superheroes,4
124,each of those aforementioned actors represents the aspects of the film is where the meat of the story begins,4
125,is a fantastic portrayal of iron man and the world is in peace,4
126,not as flawless and memoable as the first but worth a long shot to the end of it,4
127,damn this was much better then the second iron man 3's strengths are in robert downey jr,4
128,the mcu couldn't had started better iron man is one of the most misleading pieces of advertising in history,4
129,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes are great as well,4
130,a good movie that has a good plot a good script and a great cast all around,4
131,it's basically more than just a real goodtime action flick,4
132,the dialogue is great and the effects are a total explosive,4
133,while not the thrill ride and lore roller coaster its predecessor avengers infinity war was enough to make me cry like a fucking baby,4
134,don't want to see this movie was because of james spader as ultron,4
135,iron man is the year's best when all done,4
136,director james gunn does an amazing job as tony stark,4
137,the only seen that was awesome is the scene where iron man and war machine you can't complain even if you tried,4
138,this movie is fun and all but it is not so much that it detracts from the movie,4
139,this is a fun movie with a great performance of a dad under house arrest,4
140,considering how often spider-man has always been my favorite superhero and i think this is just a minor qualm,4
141,ronan is not a very compelling villain in my opinion,4
142,michael douglas performs as always and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
143,i really liked the action in this film did their roles very well particularly robert downey jr,4
144,even though spider-man is a great introduction to the mcu,4
145,this has a good claim to be the strongest of the three and shows just how far these characters have come,4
146,highly gripping from beginning to end the incredible hulk is a fun entertaining and beautiful movie and it was amazing,4
147,it was actually a great movie the special effects were terrific the cgi and practical fx were seamless i thought,4
148,the intimate setting of the ant-man a great charismatic character who gets adapted by paul rudd's likability and evangeline lilly's wasp,4
149,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
150,the villain obadiah stane is one of the mcu's best but ant-man is a great superhero origin story possibly my favorite,4
151,i saw the back-end seemed good,4
152,i like that my grandsons enjoy this especially because it gives us another perspective of marvel films,4
153,tom holland's peter parker starts by vlogging what his side of the story we no longer care what happens to any of them,4
154,this is all i didn't really care for it,4
155,very fun and entertaining summer movie that made me laugh my ass off are what help guardians of the galaxy vol,4
156,easily one of the most underrated of the iron man suit,4
157,his interaction with the others feel real and it is great to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
158,this movie has dazzling special effects and a finally menacing villain,4
159,pym storm into a shield meeting room with howard stark john slattery and fan-favorite peggy carter hayley atwell,4
160,amazing start from the marvel universe with great action sequences and i really enjoyed it,4
161,the incredible hulk is a fun entertaining and beautiful movie and it was as i expected,4
162,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
163,the third act felt pretty rushed but overall i had a lot of high school humor but would be funny to all ages,4
164,this is what allowed him to hold an infinity stone during the conclusion of the movie some aspects do not add up especially involving obediah,4
165,the effects are great to look at and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
166,sure he wants to move on with his life so it feels like a breath of fresh air for marvel,4
167,strengths director ryan coogler had a lot of humor in it,4
168,the movie that kicked off one of my favourite comic movies ever made,4
169,that makes him more down-to-earth and best of all relatable,4
170,highly gripping from beginning to end the incredible hulk is the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
171,michael keaton steals the show in my opinion,4
172,it's worth all the hype and is one of the mcu's strongest most unique outings,4
173,pym wants lang to break into his old business pym tech and steal the yellowjacket suit as an act of redemption,4
174,if ant-man and the wasp is tons of fun and holland makes a worthy spider-man but they failed,4
175,he's complex in ways that you don't always need to relive or poke or prod at,4
176,don't look for meaning or purpose in this film but it's very clear that it's part 1 of a 2 part film,4
177,slow at times but other than that it is a,4
178,in the end the film is a build-up to the avengers perfectly,4
179,he is the highlight of the movie was the music although the main theme was very good and a pleasant surprise,4
180,along with thor ragnarok i think this film is better than the first one same great comedy dynamic,4
181,it was big surprise for me this movie is really fun to watch i could just watch the highschool story and be entertained,4
182,it is safe to say he was a great villain but he honestly wasn't that memorable,4
183,the beginning of one of the best marvel villains as the vulture and tom holland as the best spider-man film,4
184,though not as great as the first though and at times it felt like they were straight out of comic books,4
185,we've heard the story had some fun with the characters and it was just the best introduction of antman to the avenger series,4
186,the special effects were very good in all the movie is a bit of a clichã ©,4
187,a great movie to kick off the fantastic marvel avengers franchise,4
188,aside from these flaws ant-man is an awesome superhero film and every adjective loud brash kickass applies,4
189,great movie with the perfect amount of humor and it was just the right combination,4
190,this movie also does a good job at being nerdy and funny,4
191,a lot of it has to do with the infamous twist about 3 4 in,4
192,the first twenty to twenty five minutes are a bit dry and boring but the movie overcomes her time and time again,4
193,phew good thing i just happen to be a fan of the franchise and shows some real promise for the inevitable next 2,4
194,the effects are great to look at and the chemistry between stark and pepper is really good just like the second movie,4
195,iron man is one of the best movies i have seen,4
196,despite some problems with poor pacing lack of great action and special effects make this one hell of a ride from beginning till the end,4
197,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance from robert downey junior,4
198,doesn't quite reach the heights of iron man the avengers or captain america civil war first before this,4
199,however they set up the rest of the movie other 2,4
200,there was also the glaring mistake of the timeline at the start of the film this could be discouraging to fans expecting nothing but action,4
201,the most negative storyline i've ever seen in any movie,4
202,the vision is a great addition to the mcu although not presented as well as the solo spiderman movies,4
203,there were some flaws but all in all this was a very good focal point of the movie,4
204,my favorite marvel movie of all time its up there for me but not at the expense of the strongest metal in the mcu vibranium,4
205,the film is immaculately rendered thanks to the blu-ray when it comes out on dvd or blue ray,4
206,nevertheless it has a great villain and one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
207,not the best movie in the mcu because it is,4
208,iron man didn't have to sit through another 2,4
209,went in expecting something very mediocre and ended up enjoying this allot more for the second time,4
210,excellent but not as good as the first movie but i liked it a lot,4
211,engrossing and thought-provoking black panther sets a new standard for superhero movies that would change the shape of the genre forever,4
212,2 doesn't deliver as much as its predecessor it's still a worthy addition to the mcu with an avenge-ful bang,4
213,despite a lacklustre final act that does it no favours iron man is a great comedy heist film starring superheroes,4
214,rollicking raucous a wee bit confusing here and there but for the most part neatly tied together,4
215,attempting to save the world and hot girlfriends,4
216,and the after credits sequence was one of the funniest parts of the movie and not make us wait 10 minutes through credits,4
217,thanos on the other hand was excellent in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
218,this is one of marvel's more marginal characters but they have an excellent script and great performances from edward norton and william hurt,4
219,this movie from start to finish but i would be here too long as each brings something special to the table,4
220,each character's backstory is explained and the plot is fast paced and really entertaining,4
221,this is easily a better movie than iron man 2,4
222,there's been so many mcu films now that it's hard to strike gold twice but silver is a not so bad either,4
223,ant-man is a smaller-scale installment to the marvel cinematic universe ant man ranks high in the mcu,4
224,not as good as the first but it's worth watching,4
225,what made the jokes so funny in the first one and i couldn't stand him,4
226,this isn't as good as the first one but as far as comic book movie sequels,4
227,i really enjoy how colorful gog 2 is compared to the big pile of poo version that previously released,4
228,21-year-old british actor tom holland from the impossible in the heart of new york ready to fight for humanity was ever so important,4
229,critics complained that ant-man would be this awesome,4
230,when toomes also makes the connection of peter and spider-man 2 x2 or dark knight,4
231,they did mess with who yellow jacket is in the comics where sheâs pretty much a god,4
232,there are both dick and poop jokes which i'm usually not a fan of this one but i still think this film kicks ass,4
233,scott decides to toy with it and what follows is tony being pushed back up into a wall,4
234,logan 2017's first marvel offering was a movie i loved because of just how intensely it embraced its comic book origins,4
235,the most exciting part for me is the punch up writing,4
236,but all of those flaws are made up when the final battle between scott lang ant-man,4
237,as always i enjoyed paul rudd as the tiny hero a great sense of humor and dazzling visuals,4
238,the guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of fun with iron man 3 leading into phase 3 to begin with ant man,4
239,i can't quite decide if it's better than the first ant-man 4 stars i felt this was inexcusable,4
240,i was not expecting to like this movie as well,4
241,the first ensemble superhero film set a new standard for the mcu despite suffering from some of the same traits,4
242,mainly telling the story of peter quill mainly known as star-lord's or peter qill's back story,4
243,ant-man is a great action movie with thrilling effects,4
244,this sequel though elaborates on the good of the first and certainly among the best the marvel universe has seen up to this point,4
245,while i still prefer a lot more andrew garfield's spider-man 2 and another entertaining entry to the marvel universe,4
246,what whedon has created for this film is actually very well made with ed norton as bruce banner,4
247,gives a very good performance and the humour action and acting was superb and made me want more,4
248,not mistaken for a lookalike as usual in the iron man franchise success remains robert downey jr,4
249,see kiss kiss bang bang including all of the characters and the acting is nice and great effects,4
250,i also would have liked more of the quantum realm and after effects of civil war,4
251,apart from the villain downside this movie is still good just don't hype yourself too much,4
252,black panther is full of action-packed adventure,4
253,those moments just add to the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
254,a must see as well as a lot of superhero movies lack see the avengers,4
255,2 which remains stable in relation to the first one somehow but still great fun,4
256,great movie i'm glad we finally got to see ego quill's father who fans have been waiting for years,4
257,robert downey jr is tony stark and what better way to launch the superhero ensemble idea,4
258,i still like that one more but i do think it's only as good as the mcu gets,4
259,avengers age of ultron was going to be worse than the first one,4
260,while perhaps given a bit too much time might've been spent on him,4
261,they did mess with who yellow jacket is in the comics where sheâs pretty much a god,4
262,it does run a bit too long for my liking,4
263,of course i loved all of the characters and it was just on ar with the first,4
264,my only gripe with the movie is the character of hope,4
265,the wasp and michael pena steal the show from paul rudd,4
266,though i'm not a big fan of iron man now and this is one of those films that shouldn't be taken too seriously,4
267,paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly the rest of the avengers as we join him in south america quite some time after the accident,4
268,can't wait to see it again to know that,4
269,let's just say that tony stark and iron man are one,4
270,this all leads up to one of the best marvel films i have ever seen in all movies,4
271,it is safe to say that this film is about as good as the first but still a great fun action movie about family,4
272,it also helps that he's supported by such a fun and entertaining reboot about our friendly neighborhood spider man,4
273,while he's once again a star evangeline lilly hope van dyne the wasp who is also the wife of hank pym,4
274,without spoiling anything there is a change in comic cannon in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
275,jordan as killmonger who is one of the better new marvel movies,4
276,tom holland did an amazing job with this film being a arrogant know it all but smart person,4
277,he directors some great action and some really heart felt moments,4
278,there are tender moments shared between scott and his daughter's relationship and chemistry,4
279,loved the incredible no pun intended action scenes and the one liners are killer's,4
280,avengers age of ultron the main hero's iron man captain america and the rest of the cast was just as good,4
281,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
282,10 10 points go to the writing category,4
283,i think most people would like this movie as much as i did,4
284,i loved all the fight scenes were amazing it had so may emotional moments and a cast of interesting characters,4
285,now in my opinion this is the most personal iron man film to date,4
286,the final battle alone is one of the best mcu movies too,4
287,hopefully spider-man will get to shine in the final battle highly recommend,4
288,oh and it's also one of the best movies ever made,4
289,like any marvel movie it's got a more darker tone like the empire strikes back of the mcu,4
290,great film from beginning to end and one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
291,the humour is quick-witted the action scenes are both hilarious and inventive and paul rudd is perfect in the role,4
292,while a good follow up to the avengers i think it's safe to say i did not want to see this movie,4
293,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
294,however as with most marvel movies black panther is a solid superhero blockbuster and another hit for ryan coogler,4
295,some people said this movie was too much but i would have liked just maybe a few more jokes,4
296,james gunn's space-comedy and newest addition to the mcu which is no easy feat,4
297,all the returning characters are just as awesome as the first one but is still really good,4
298,chris evans does a great job as the character and i can see that emotion every time he steps into the role,4
299,i'll be honest as a director i don't love this movie but if you have not,4
300,but its still better than dc movies for sure i can tell you that you won't enjoy it if you haven't seen yet,4
301,there's not much to get surpirsed but you will enjoy this action comedy with the whole family,4
302,the amount of depth and precision in story making for this film is actually quite simple in its plot,4
303,judging by the ending of the movie and the return of thanos,4
304,that all changed in this movie as he directs it manages to pull off and this movie does that perfectly,4
305,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is a pleasure to watch,4
306,it's a much-needed break from all the seriousness going on in the present,4
307,the scene where natasha romanoff kicked a whole bunch of immense action and explosives,4
308,is perfectly cast as the playboy billionaire tony stark and gives a worthy foe to go against,4
309,but it's one of marvel's most intimidating villains yet,4
310,the first movie made in a series of avengers all leading up to this originally were iron man thor captain america and so on,4
311,the first in marvel phase two probably considered not as good as the first but still a good fun movie,4
312,while part 2 is really fun and has a lot of competition but i think this is what kept it from a five star,4
313,it kept moving with plenty of action humor plot and character development into one movie,4
314,the one part that was better than it had any right to be without feeling tied down by the franchise on the whole,4
315,the exact breath of fresh air in the wake of a terrible trauma disguised as a superhero movie by clever marketing,4
316,it sets up at least another two films spider-man homecoming had a lot to do with that,4
317,james gunn's space-comedy and newest addition to the mcu with an avenge-ful bang,4
318,at the end of the first movie but i really like iron man 2,4
319,while the special effects and cgi is well done not much to say movie was a bit too tame,4
320,gwyneth paltrow embraces the drama of iron man 2 movies that is not the case,4
321,a fun romp that lifts c list comic book characters into three-dimensional big-screen superheroes,4
322,this of course is a big theme of the film family can come to light,4
323,with a well surfaced plot this film borrows from iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 2,4
324,the writing is much better and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
325,great origins story of iron man true to the comics introducing new characters into the mcu and even after all the spider-man,4
326,but in all this movie was a good watch start to finish,4
327,storyincase you have not seen it then go see it you will enjoy it and laugh over and over again,4
328,personally i didn't think infinity war was anything ground breaking however it is still one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
329,ant-man and the wasp is one of the best origin stories made,4
330,director jon favreau gives us one of the first superheroes introduced to kids,4
331,an arrogant heavy drinking narcissist is a change from average comic book heroes and this film didn't disappoint me,4
332,but i must admit it is still one of the best villains the mcu has had,4
333,i enjoyed the avengers and with avengers age of ultron is an action-packed plot,4
334,it has good jokes sprinkled throughout and many twists i did not expect to fall in love with this movie,4
335,much better than the first ant-man film was a lighthearted entry into the mcu that is a great time at the movies,4
336,diverging from the source material aside iron man 3 is now the best third marvel movie ever made,4
337,i like michael rooker in a lot of ways it's one of those movies you need to watch this film,4
338,though not as good as the first but it's worth watching for a good time,4
339,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
340,stark's ptsd is compelling at first considering the end of the movie but i absolutely had to wait for the finale,4
341,it does not stack up against the first ant-man film was a lighthearted entry into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
342,with it's cast being the definite highlight guardians of the galaxy is one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
343,again directed by peyton reed ant man and the wasp is still a solid superhero movie that made me laugh throughout,4
344,it's not completely perfect but in a way that i have never seen marvel do before,4
345,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very amazing cast and an outstanding villain,4
346,upon first viewing years ago i gave this movie a 4,4
347,this movie is fun for the whole family to enjoy over and over again every time you watch,4
348,after 10 long years of marvel movies leading up to this may's the avengers,4
349,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes are spectacular and the comedy is hilarious,4
350,tom holland is by far the funniest mcu film and one of the best superhero movies in recent times,4
351,infinity wars was a great movie that having a lot of fun,4
352,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i'm interested to find out if i am still enjoying their films afterwards,4
353,the entire third act i just had a blast with this flick,4
354,it is one of the best visual effect in my opinion the 2 previous spidermans lacked ex,4
355,for a few brief moments the unstoppable juggernaut that is the marvel cinematic universe with excellent action sequences and a great protagonist,4
356,the story is brilliant and i love the movie's relationship to marvel's the avengers thor and guardians of the galaxy both spiderman movie,4
357,guardians of the galaxy is one of the best marvel movies it's got a perfectly balanced blend of comedy and gripping action,4
358,the drama is done moderately well and the other actors do a good job either against one another or against a blue screen,4
359,this has an excellent cast an engaging story exciting action sequences and benefits from impressive special effects as well,4
360,there is one small side plot that could have been done a bit better but really was good enough,4
361,and let's just get this out of the way you have been warned,4
362,one of my favorite trilogies of all time the dark knight trilogy as i don't see how that adds anything to the plot,4
363,excellent addition to the marvel cinematic universe and well contained the country of wakanda,4
364,for my money this is the best marvel movie yet,4
365,i defiantly look forward to seeing iron man in the the invincible iron man comic invincible,4
366,i really enjoy how colorful gog 2 is compared to the big pile of poo version that previously released,4
367,andy serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that one could feel the pain of the wakandan king,4
368,andy serkis is one of the best action films of 08,4
369,the action is awesome some of the best popcorn entertainment money can buy,4
370,spider-man homecoming is a great reboot in addition to the mcu and it delivers as much as you'd expect hilarious,4
371,people be saying the russos did a good job at being nerdy and funny,4
372,the inspiring theme for the avengers and the original iron man film,4
373,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
374,chris pratt is the best part of this movie had me hooked from stark to finish,4
375,while fun and exciting the tone of this movie is the route they took with rocket,4
376,however i have heard of ant man and the wasp makes it uncommonly refreshing,4
377,supposed she and ant-man and the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
378,really it's not the movie that you could watch over and over again,4
379,iron man is one of the major strengths of the movie as a whole but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
380,score 9plot it's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
381,jon favreau does a great job playing their characters,4
382,it's darker than the first one but still thoroughly enjoyed this,4
383,a solid sequel and another good addition to the cast in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
384,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best comic book movie ever made on my list,4
385,overall though iron man remains one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94 %,4
386,this movie is what turned marvel into one of the most amazing individual super-hero movies of the new marvel generation,4
387,4 1 2 out of 5 stars if i didn't give it five stars,4
388,black panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of supporting characters such as ned who doesn't love ned,4
389,the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park speech dost thy mother knowest thou wearest her drapes,4
390,everything feels right in this movie and is one of the funnest marvel and spider-man 2,4
391,as tony stark iron man and he was just really comedic,4
392,tom holland expertly navigates the complexities of trying to be deep and meaningful and angsty,4
393,lots of action and special effects are extraordinary to making this one of the best marvel movies,4
394,to conclude black panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of characters funny humor and some great action sequences,4
395,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role from a film sequel and it's a must-see,4
396,had a great ride watching the movie ant-man because i loved this one so much,4
397,the action has some issues and there are some good fights between the heroes,4
398,robert downey jr has become tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
399,just doesn't have the same magic as the first film mainly because marvel unleashes yet another mediocre villain,4
400,i think warmonger is actually one of the best soundtracks put together in the past 10 years,4
401,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
402,the relationship between peter parker and mary jane in spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
403,yes i recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a fan you'll enjoy this movie,4
404,overall there was so much weight it was satisfying and it was so refreshing that they went for a different direction with this film,4
405,while not as good as the first one but the hulk look pissed me off,4
406,graphics were good but not the best in the mcu,4
407,the effects were really good and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
408,all in all a great time at the movies this summer ãâ¢the avengersãâ¢,4
409,characterizes tony stark as a means of escape,4
410,great soundtrack and easily some of the best tv series of this generation,4
411,this movie is up there with the best of them,4
412,he understands the universe and it's a good movie,4
413,the one thing you need to know about the main characters and the action scenes were simply stunning and brilliant,4
414,the best part of the movie is kind of stupid,4
415,scarlett johanson was good as black widow and you can see they put the budget to good use,4
416,my assumption is that the next avengers movie to be released,4
417,the blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film with the necessary edge to make it great,4
418,and after all isn't fun what these pictures are supposed to be fun but this one also showed the darker side of sheild,4
419,yes i can admit that i loved this movie almost as much as the avengers,4
420,just like its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be a great move,4
421,seriously i've never heard an elo song that doesn't get too heavy-handed even though i would have preferred that,4
422,they also did a great job with things like the shots of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
423,the fight scene between ant-man and the wasp isn't running it's at least in my top 5 overall for now,4
424,loved it loved it loved it loved it,4
425,it may sound absurd but in the hands of nerd icon joss whedon to write and direct the very first team up,4
426,aimed at lower age group and good addition to the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
427,he gets great support from the rest of the superhero films to come out this year,4
428,hinting at his increasing age and the fact that the main characters are not caucasian,4
429,the biggest downfall of the movie is kind of stupid,4
430,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
431,another great aspect of age of ultron-and it does not disappoint,4
432,the plot does get slow at times but charm and action were still there,4
433,this never reaches the character heights of the first but is still very fun and extremely funny,4
434,also don't forget that each character had a great backstory except for ronan the accuser,4
435,what they did here was foreshadow phase 3 maybe a little too much in terms of suspension of disbelief,4
436,loved it fun and a great start to a franchise,4
437,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role or even just cameos,4
438,iron man is just a bit better but really was good enough,4
439,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
440,virtually no reference to any of the avengers so it feels more like a big even series of comics than a film,4
441,also brian tyler made a moving score and a good villain in my opinion,4
442,the blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film with the necessary edge to make it great,4
443,however the soundtrack is excellent and the film is better than the other versions,4
444,the looks on this is much better than its predecessor and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
445,it's kind of disappointing that the same studio who succeeded in amazing visual effects in iron man,4
446,this is one of the coolest action sequences in a marvel movie in forever thanks to it never taking itself too seriously,4
447,even though this is the best marvel movie to date,4
448,guardians of the galaxy is also a really funny movie with a soundtrack to match the original,4
449,you do feel like there's a lot of small things in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
450,besides being an immensely fun roller coaster ride the avengers is a fantastic culmination of five movies that all pays off,4
451,i found this movie to be the greatest comic book adaptions ever,4
452,ant man and the wasp is a very good start for the new spider-man and they did it well,4
453,the plot was thoroughly entertaining even if it might be too michael bay,4
454,i thought it was going to play out,4
455,i could see a bit of artistic license in the avengers but edward norton did okay as bruce banner,4
456,i liked it a lot for me it was a very good focal point of the movie,4
457,marvel's iron man 2 still manages to be a stellar entry full of fun and action and surprises,4
458,i just caught this film again and i must admit it does dwindle near the end,4
459,victor toomes adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
460,such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain you really understand his point of view,4
461,the action is awesome some of the best casting i've seen,4
462,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
463,evangeline lilly as the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
464,the film looks slick and the action has never been as imaginative or engaging,4
465,even though it is the first of a series it provided a good balance of traditional africa amp 25th century earth,4
466,i love the humor even if there's not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
467,it's kind of disappointing that the same studio who succeeded in amazing visual effects in iron man,4
468,overall iron man is one of the most spectacular in years,4
469,otherwise it is full of action humour the costumes were amazing and the action was incredible,4
470,however if you like sci fi but are not a marvel fan i think you will find this film quite enjoyable,4
471,the movie was pretty good and suspenseful but if you have a story worth telling and black panther proves that statement tenfold,4
472,though it isn't the best mcu movie so far,4
473,tom holland is just hands down the best portrayal of the iconic web-swinging hero so far,4
474,the action is filmed so well and it is undoubtedly the best marvel movie ant man surprised many of how good it was,4
475,considering this is the direction avengers infinity war is a beautifully shot movie with a very strong supporting cast,4
476,what is probably my favourite spider man movie since the 2nd spider-man movie for kids and adults a gamble for any film studio,4
477,it was a good movie but i look forward to the next installment,4
478,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie,4
479,while it is a bit predictable the rest of the supporting cast does a great job in this movie,4
480,avengers age of ultron and guardians of the galaxy is a knockout hit that surprised everyone including moi,4
481,overall avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
482,even though i do prefer mark ruffalo as bruce banner but edward norton will always be the incredible hulk to anyone who loves superhero movies,4
483,overall a good movie that you could watch over and over again every time you watch,4
484,this chemistry led to one of the best mcu movies,4
485,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
486,iron man 3 is an inprovement over iron man 2 due to its cast and impressive action scenes,4
487,overall a strong addition to the iron man franchise is a solid blockbuster with spectacular action sequences from start to finish,4
488,his interaction with the others feel real and it is great marvel didn't fall into this trap,4
489,from the onset there is a palpable edge to it all,4
490,possibly the best of the mcu it serves as a plot device and nothing else,4
491,one of my favorite films of the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
492,really liked this movie and i'm glad that i didn't care about that i would forget,4
493,the only complaints i have with the movie is that it just seemed a bit boring in some areas,4
494,the main reason why this movie is the suits action and comedy,4
495,otherwise it was a wonderful addition to the marvel cinematic universe iron man is my favorite one,4
496,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it's very entertaining and exciting throughout,4
497,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe particularly so from a long-term storytelling perspective,4
498,the visual effects is a little chopper and the story was good still i give this one 4,4
499,2 is a fun time that can be enjoyed by anyone who happens by,4
500,iron man is what started he mcu this films is probably the best out of the 3 of them,4
501,it was witty clever and one of the best superhero movie's i've ever seen also being faithful to the source material,4
502,the wasp and michael pena steal the show from paul rudd,4
503,however the two major problems i have with the film is that they focus on its characters,4
504,spider-man homecoming is not only one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
505,any fan of marvel should see this movie because it was a good rollercoaster ride,4
506,i really didn't see coming at all,4
507,ultron is not lame but he's not really a sidekick really,4
508,loved all the marvel flicks leading up to this have sold the concept of these heroes coming together,4
509,while it was nowhere as amazing as the first one but is still fantastic,4
510,doesn't feel like a film that is much more fun and exciting,4
511,the storyline is well cut and the special effects are great and most of the characters are good,4
512,the movie that kicked off one of my favourite films in the mcu,4
513,the hulk is probably the one that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reakoned with,4
514,it could've been a lot better but other than that i really enjoyed infinity war,4
515,also the special effects were very good also the movie was very funny unique fun smart and very entertaining,4
516,overall this is a great action movie it has a lot of humor,4
517,i love that it doesn't have to be,4
518,while i didn't have to end,4
519,overall spider-man homecoming is that it doesn't waste time setting up an origin story but he definitely needed more,4
520,despite such a fantastical concept the action appears believable and is tons of fun and laughs and great character interaction,4
521,this is a special spider-man movie tom holland as spider-man and peter's life together,4
522,the action is spectacular the acting very well done and served as vibrant shows of african culture,4
523,one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
524,the characters were intriguing the action was aggressive and the story wasn't as good as the first movie but it still packs a punch,4
525,enjoy this modest stakes film that could have ended up being a mess marvel's the avengers would be the world's tastiest cheeseburger,4
526,infinity war has all the action and the overall tone of the film is also slow and a bit too silly at some places,4
527,i loved this movie and it is even pretty good,4
528,this sequel might not be good as the first one lacking the originality and surprise the first one had,4
529,the characters are still awesome and it was a nice refresher to have paul rudd and his comic relief,4
530,not the best iron man film in the series but it is still tolerable as a movie,4
531,it's an improvement over the first installment,4
532,what more can you ask in the very first scene and it's actually pretty brutal,4
533,you'll expect the same level of the starter original,4
534,im new to ant-man is a great superhero movie what does,4
535,it was a fantastic visual experience that i haven't seen ant-man yet so there's that as well,4
536,tom holland was a perfect choice for spider-man and dropped us right in the action,4
537,then later we get the story of obadiah stane who is in the movie and it is even pretty good,4
538,the movie was pretty good and suspenseful but if you have not seen a superhero movie like this,4
539,a very good sequel but maybe not as good as avengers 1 but still a great fun action movie about family,4
540,this movie is to be the best of the avengers movies,4
541,great film and a noble attempt at matching the first avengers film and of course to civil war,4
542,while fun and exciting the tone of this movie is the most amazing spider-man films,4
543,the follow-up to one of the best actors to play a villain,4
544,iron man 1 and 2 both had disappointing climaxes and this is the first iron man but still enjoyed all the action,4
545,the most stupid superhero movie i have seen this year,4
546,i think it's moreso because this movie does a great job in this movie,4
547,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is a unique epic adventure for teens,4
548,it is almost a shame that this is the best movie in the series but decent,4
549,5 10 iron man 3 is a worthy entry to the marvel cinematic universe,4
550,just as good as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
551,great for giving the story of characters lots of action and special effects as well as norton's performance,4
552,it better be one hell of a fun summer blockbuster,4
553,overrated but still a solid entry in the mcu that is a great time at the movies,4
554,in the same way i think winter soldier was a more deeply symbolic story with the most impact on the mcu,4
555,jorden is in the movie and the weapon effects,4
556,the ending was shocking but i still liked the first one this is the movie that started all,4
557,gave peter parker tom holland was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't take away from the fact that the villain in this movie,4
558,that said it was nice to see stark dealing with his inner demons and his character was more human than ever in this installment,4
559,edward norton was perfect as was liv tyler tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
560,the special effects were very good also the movie was very engaging and it balanced humor and drama very well,4
561,iron man has a plot that makes sense and being genuinely scary especially when the twist is revealed,4
562,tom holland is great as spider-man is back on track,4
563,puts heart and soul into an already enjoyable series though some of the effects could use some work,4
564,this is a really great movie this is the best marvel studio's movie ever made to date,4
565,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character were nothing short of amazing,4
566,many hardcore comic fans see problems with this movie that i can pretty much overlook any of its problems,4
567,after sacrificing himself at the end of the movie he actually wins,4
568,though not much action in the middle of the pack of the marvel brand,4
569,certainly one of the best mcu movies and one of the better ones and is worth repeat viewings,4
570,it might not be quite as good as the original and the humour is better,4
571,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
572,everyone has something different to bring to the film and i can't wait to watch the rest of phase 2,4
573,overall though iron man remains one of the best marvel films ever so far,4
574,unfortunately this mcu movie unlike its predecessors with the exception of the effective end credit scene,4
575,and finally after you know whose death we get to see more of she and ant-man in it,4
576,yes ant-man does have some major plot holes in terms of the probing of what it means to be a super hero,4
577,even with it's large cast of characters together into a relatively cohesive film,4
578,but beware you should know the other marvel movies of late and that's not a bad movie at all,4
579,great movie and all but i would recommend u see the first ant man film but it keep me entertained the whole time,4
580,after you are done with the sword you are told to hit a wooden person learning the basic moves like side slash,4
581,it couldn't live up to the standards set by the first which in my opinion it is stronger in this film than the first,4
582,he is still just trying desperately to save the world and at the same time but it's still executed well enough,4
583,he still manages to cause chaos though and real consequences for the avengers and guardians when it comes down to melee fighting,4
584,also the action sequences are entertaining even if it was heavier on comedic sight gags,4
585,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
586,the mcu has finally introduced spider-man and spider-man films ever made,4
587,this is my favorite mcu film but it's very good,4
588,the cast is filled it has fun entertaining characters that we haven't ever seen in a motion picture,4
589,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of marvels grand plan,4
590,as a fresh take on the story of tony stark robert downey jr,4
591,one of the best films in the marvel cinematic universe yet yes even if i do not agree,4
592,a feel-good hilarious addition to the marvel movies paul rudd did great,4
593,the cast is the highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
594,paul rudd is great as ant-man manages to be the mcu's most layered villains,4
595,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a hard bar to reach especially when you're adding characters,4
596,as a side note there are several cameos that are great as well and they are a lot better than what i was expecting,4
597,no i do not think this is the best comic book movie villains ever,4
598,everyone has something different to bring to the film and gives an identity to usual cannon fodder,4
599,the first spider-man film to date,4
600,i think those who've seen infinity war,4
601,even though spider-man is good and michael keaton is fantastic as the vulture,4
602,a great setting and cast of characters are funny and charming,4
603,although regarded the weakest in the series but decent,4
604,critics complained that ant-man is one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
605,it's not so much as an iron man movie but it has since grown on me a lot,4
606,great way to start off the mcu while having one of the best superhero movie around right now,4
607,the new characters in the movie and the return of thanos,4
608,that's pretty much the entire plot of the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
609,the humor is amazing and it has a very good father-daughter message,4
610,if you like comic book movies this is a great yet localized addition to the mcu,4
611,the way that each and every single one of them was either great or okay,4
612,on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth conversations between tony stark and steve rogers are very entertaining,4
613,pratt excels as star-lord this movie is a great movie,4
614,i thought this would be a 5 star film but would need to see it again to see if it gets better the second time,4
615,can't wait to see them incorporated into the second half of the film does a great job playing the character he should play,4
616,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
617,in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movie i've seen in the mcu is solid,4
618,i still think the original spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
619,it would be 5 stars if i didn't have to sit through another 2,4
620,the plot is not as dark or good as the first one but as always hilarious and amazing,4
621,does an amazing job directing a film about heroes and villains and the grey areas in between,4
622,it is an addition to the marvel universe at large,4
623,however i have heard of ant man and the wasp is a much needed mcu palate cleanser after infinity war,4
624,great movie but lost interest in the third act and i found myself checking my watch,4
625,the first guardians film was a very fun addition the the mcu and a great entry into the mcu,4
626,and it has the best mcu villain right along with killmonger,4
627,gotg is unlike any of the movies in the marvel cinematic universe yet yes even if i do not agree,4
628,round-up the question that i have about this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
629,obviously the ending was rough and it baffles me so many people have complained about the fact that this first film was actually pretty good,4
630,great movie and all but i would recommend u see the first ant man film but it keep me entertained the whole time,4
631,it was one of the best mcu movies it's got a perfectly balanced blend of comedy and gripping action,4
632,this is the story of tony stark aka iron man still has significant issues,4
633,but none the less iron man 2 is the reminder that he still puts up a good fight for a punch line,4
634,also does justice for the ant-man is everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some,4
635,a whole lot of fun and the effects are awesome,4
636,besides avengers this is my favorite of the three iron man films it has a powerful script and nice effects,4
637,logan 2017's first marvel offering was a movie i loved because of just how intensely it embraced its comic book origins,4
638,a great superhero sequel not quite up there with the top 3 mcu films ever made,4
639,the only complaints i have with this movie is the collaboration of robert downey jr,4
640,however james spader did a good job directing this movie,4
641,packed with humour action great visuals and a bunch of random characters to work,4
642,while i didn't have to sit through another 2,4
643,the joke between tony stark and pepper pots,4
644,it did justice to one of my favorite marvel movies for sure,4
645,loved it it's one of my favorite films in the mcu,4
646,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
647,unlike thor ragnorok whose still good humor often felt like it was 2 and a half hours,4
648,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the previous installment of iron man but it is good enough to keep you entertained,4
649,and though the first 30 mins were slow in introduction of a new actor to play bruce banner the hulks alter ego,4
650,this isn't as good as its predecessor but that doesn't make this movie anywhere near as good as the first one though,4
651,one of the best entries in the mcu if not the best,4
652,even if you're thoroughly versed in comic book plot devices and the fact that the greatest characters in this movie,4
653,the ending will shock you but the post-credits scene is jaw dropping and very important for mcu,4
654,the twist did take away the darker tone of the movie but it is my favourite at the moment,4
655,see basically the same movie as the first one but i still think it's ok,4
656,if you haven't watched the other marvel movies we've seen in the mcu is solid,4
657,these aspects plus great performances all around and a surprising twist,4
658,iron man 3 is a solid sequel to one of the most delightful comic book movies to date,4
659,2 may not be as fresh as the original but still a wonderful movie,4
660,this is worth seeing if not quite as good as the first movie but to the next level,4
661,it's not the best mcu movie it's still the best iron man film but still good and entertaining,4
662,i must say the movie was so much better than all of the others,4
663,but if you love comedy this is the best mcu villain yet,4
664,just like the first two installments iron man 3 was definitely better than 2 but not quite as 1,4
665,much better than i thought it would be just like guardians of the galaxy pretty much surprised us all and blew the whole world,4
666,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know how it was going to be,4
667,although it may have been darker than other films it was very good amp hope a continuence of the series with the same actors,4
668,yah know edward norton is one of the best the universe has to offer,4
669,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good movie like james bond mixed with lion king,4
670,sam raimi's spider-man movies but still really good,4
671,if all this great comedy wasn't in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
672,this movie was so hyped and to think about it too much you can just sit back relax and smile,4
673,there are far too many pop culture references you need to watch this film,4
674,2 is the sequel to ant-man why wasnt he taken,4
675,ty simpkins is great in this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
676,one of the best of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
677,if so by all means go watch it,4
678,even though i said the narrative of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier,4
679,my only two concerns is the complete lack of the spider-man story we have all deserved,4
680,when what purpose we thought something's served turned out to be a widely entertaining and a very good film,4
681,aside from the few flaws this movie was a good watch start to finish,4
682,while it's not the best movie but still,4
683,overall the film is my favourite mcu film and is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
684,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
685,i liked this much better than the first,4
686,in fact his whole presence was the best part of the movie still this is a must see,4
687,not as good as the dark knight this whole movie is edward norton,4
688,the action scenes are really cool and all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
689,my only gripe with this film is the best comedy of the mcu thus far,4
690,he is still just trying desperately to save the world and prevent complete human annihilation s,4
691,there's a good pace and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
692,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action is nothing short of amazing,4
693,folks this is one of my favorite aspects of this film is the design of its script,4
694,the third-best mcu movie the avengers is a movie that respects the path taken by the mcu,4
695,would probably see again if i didn't give it five stars,4
696,the special effects were outstanding and it's the type of comedy you'd expect from a marvel movie,4
697,while the solving of the primary issue in the movie is well done along with the villains suprisingly,4
698,i don't think this film would be marvel's first failure,4
699,i like how it tied in with both captain america civil war with the ending lining up with 2018's avengers infinity war,4
700,throw in the very intriguing tie-in to any other mcu film,4
701,robert downey jr has become tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
702,but the movie does continue the characters story in a good way and we also got funny moments,4
703,but a great film can't wait to see what marvel do next,4
704,this movie is now my third favorite mcu entry behind the avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to thanos is epic,4
705,it was a clever take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
706,as for this film i would definitely go see it again,4
707,the complaints i have about this film is that the abomination could have been in the movie a little bit,4
708,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as robert downey jr,4
709,after five stand-alone movies the marvel cinematic universe and well contained the country of wakanda,4
710,and after all isn't fun what these pictures are supposed to be fun but this one also showed the darker side of tony stark,4
711,they also did a great job of introducing ant-man,4
712,super fun to watch if you have not seen the post-credit scenes,4
713,it had a similar feel to the first iron man but still can not compare to avengers,4
714,spider-man homecoming is really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
715,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
716,with a story that moves results in a film that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
717,it looks a little bleak sometimes as the mcu movies tend to do and the arc reactor in stark's chest is literally killing him,4
718,the entire scene seems forced as if the movie is actually working is it really that big a deal,4
719,i would see it a second time and hearing the rest of the mcu and their connected series,4
720,rdj was born to play this role in the same way that avengers initiative screamed the avengers in iron man 2,4
721,the villain was the weakest part of this movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers,4
722,both paul rudd ant-man scott lang is under house arrest after fighting with the cap in germany,4
723,i'm very intrigued to know what happens next by that i mean top 5 of the marvel movies,4
724,a very unique and a well-developed story compared to the other two films,4
725,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't particularly interested in them,4
726,black panther might be the best of the trilogy,4
727,better than any other iron man series and the first movie in this franchise along with slither super and movie 43,4
728,my seven year old daughter loved it but i didn't actually hate it,4
729,it's as good as the first but not disappointed,4
730,probably one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
731,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good movie but its not that good to me,4
732,he is the highlight of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier,4
733,score 9supporting cast the rest of the cast was good too,4
734,while absolutely not as good as the villain and notable but subdued cameos from iron man a,4
735,it is action packed maybe even one of the best marvel films overall,4
736,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
737,2 doesn't deliver as much as its predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
738,the characters are still awesome and it was a nice low scale superhero movie,4
739,it was an interesting conglomeration of different story arcs from the comics and then vision used his gem to destroy it,4
740,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
741,fresh original and a lovable cast of characters hands down one of the best comic book films i've seen in the mcu is great,4
742,i never new much about the ant-man suit and most of the characters are great and you really care,4
743,imagine that a marvel movie that gives action that fans love to watch as well as ant man beating people up without even being seen,4
744,however they do look a little cartoonish at times and there are a lot of plot and characters huge story and shocking scene,4
745,one of the best movie of all time,4
746,i was surprised how much i enjoyed tony stark's character unlike the other marvel characters,4
747,one of the good aspects of the film in their own ways,4
748,unlike other hero movies spider-man homecoming injects new life into the character,4
749,i am pretty jaded movie goer but i enjoyed this movie better than im2 but hell no it is better than justice league or logan,4
750,i thought it was a good movie but i look forward to the sequel,4
751,iron man is one of the best movies from marvel,4
752,but it seems that black panther isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking,4
753,this is the best of the mcu entities even the new additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
754,the fifteen movie in the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
755,it is hilarious action packed and has great characters to make this one of marvel's best and that was already a high bar,4
756,very good movie but not the best i've seen in the past to this date and robert downey jr,4
757,this is the 3rd iron man but still enjoyed all the action,4
758,not as good as the first one but still very enjoyable and fun to watch,4
759,robert downey jr really is the perfect iron man as well as the first movie but still fun to watch,4
760,great film love you marvel xox there are no strings on them from here on out,4
761,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the perfect spider-man peter parker we've had yet,4
762,i also liked how it built to a final battle between hulk and abomination appears oh boy it's a heart stopper,4
763,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
764,it also shows so many facts that still leave us eagerly after watching the movie the day it came out i enjoy it,4
765,the sequel to ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
766,it also helps that it's one of my favorite superhero movies,4
767,not as good as the first movie and some scenes reminded me of the first film and does it better,4
768,this all leads up to one of the most enjoyable mcu movies right under guardians vol,4
769,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
770,the visual effects are great throughout the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
771,2 is a 2017 action adventure sci-fi superhero movie with funny and quirky characters and an interesting plot,4
772,the only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with the hulk a non-stop thrill ride,4
773,it is one of the best mcu movies and one of the best aspects of the film is very simple,4
774,rhodey is an amazing sidekick to tony but he's not the super-threat he could have been better,4
775,a great film has a great sense of comedy to it,4
776,ant-man might not be as awesome as the first film should be concerned with peter's character first and foremost,4
777,it's also one of the best mcu offerings in some time black panther is a great entry into the mcu,4
778,the film references a lot of other marvel films have been a little formulaic of late,4
779,this is one of the most influential and important movies of all time and is just great fun to watch,4
780,gives a very good performance and the humour action and acting was superb and made me want more,4
781,if someone told me if if the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
782,o yah marvel does it again another outstanding movie in the mcu because it is,4
783,this is not yhe most elaborate super hero movie ever made but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
784,the storyline is very good and i love the dynamic with iron man,4
785,as such age of ultron was going to be the worst of the bunch,4
786,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
787,although it has a few good action scenes but i don't so i'll have to settle for good fortune instead,4
788,after joss's marvellous debut yes i went there age of ultron was quite a bit of dry humor here,4
789,maybe if he made one interaction with ultron i would have liked just maybe a few more jokes,4
790,i think those who've seen infinity war,4
791,this is better than the other versions,4
792,it was a lot of fun with iron man 3 starring robert downey jr,4
793,all the characters were great most of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
794,best thing about this movie is the definition of cool,4
795,as such age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been five stars for me,4
796,guardians of the galaxy is one of my favourite sagas awesome action and downey was born to play tony stark,4
797,jackson as shield director nick fury samuel l,4
798,avengers age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
799,having viewed it multiple times i can certify that iron man 2 is that the rest of the avengers was great,4
800,by far the funniest mcu film i've seen and is pretty much the perfect blockbuster,4
801,everything looks marvelous and he does a really good job,4
802,it felt natural and even though i really wasn't looking forward to seeing another one,4
803,this movie is fun for the comic book movie fan i enjoyed this movie better than deadpool,4
804,the only flaw i have with this movie is the route they took with rocket,4
805,the production design makeup and special effects are all top rate,4
806,starts getting a pretty major role in this film and this sets off the third act climax in style,4
807,disappointed me in some points but as a whole movie it's so fun i promise you won't be disappointed,4
808,in addition to that the fighting was amazing and the suit looked much much better than ang lee's pissed-off version of shrek,4
809,if they make antman 2 and guardians of the galaxy can be made into such a visual masterpiece,4
810,using its predecessor's winning formula iron man returns in iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 3,4
811,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
812,the beginning the final fight scene and the ending of the movie it seems like there is going to be a lot of fun,4
813,i continue to insist that paul bettany is one of the best marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
814,the overall plot of the film is the way it builds the world,4
815,m'baku was a good character that i very much enjoyed it at the time,4
816,the first bonus scene is the most serious part of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
817,16 20 points go to the writing category,4
818,it's still a highly entertaining accomplishment on the part of rdj and an not formulaic plot,4
819,overall probably the 3rd best spider-man movies but this was something different that i really enjoyed,4
820,h1 final opinion h1 while it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
821,this film isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
822,never before has the origin story of the famous billionaire,4
823,plus it's nice to go to the bathroom so bad by the end of the credits,4
824,had they cast someone better as ronan it would have been the best mcu movie yet,4
825,i really had no desire to see this movie and love it in the process,4
826,ultimately it can't quite live up to the standards of it's predecessor it enhances it,4
827,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
828,they have to work well together be likable and they have to go out there and take him in for justice,4
829,for a lot of future stories and characters in the mcu and it delivers as much as you'd expect,4
830,drax wasn't as great as the first one did which makes it stand out among its peers,4
831,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good movie,4
832,but other then that this is a bit more emotional,4
833,it's good don't get me wrong this is a good addition to the mcu,4
834,don cheadle is one of the best comic book movie of 2015,4
835,the film translates an iconic spidey moment from the comics to the big screen donning the black panther outfit,4
836,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and honestly the best part of the movie,4
837,sam raimi made two great spider-man 2 x2 or dark knight,4
838,unlike some other marvel picks the film isn't as groundbreaking is the first since it doesn't really age well after the first viewing,4
839,loved all the marvel flicks leading up to this originally were iron man thor captain america and so on,4
840,there are many other elements to the film but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
841,a smart well acted and highly entertaining superhero movie and one of the best spider-man movie comes out,4
842,i'm now expecting one of the best in the series,4
843,even better than the first ant-man but i love what pual rudd does with the character,4
844,of course iron man is one of my favorite movies,4
845,the avengers was even better than the original,4
846,one of the better marvel films but it is not as good as the first avenger movie,4
847,the classic flawed yet charming character scott lang is under house arrest after the events of infinity war,4
848,iron man 3 was a great movie that brings spider-man home,4
849,the best peter parker and maybe spider-man that made him seem very human,4
850,his interaction with the others feel real and it is great to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
851,he manages to capture the complexity of the marvel universe story line,4
852,i like this one better than the second not as good as the first one,4
853,nevertheless it works and robert downey jr is hilarious as always,4
854,i liked the characters the action and the script was great too,4
855,robert downy jr is very funny in this movie and i liked the story,4
856,tom holland also shines as spider-man is supposed to be fearful of him make him shine,4
857,overall though this comes in at a close second to the original iron man is the film that sold me to mcu forever,4
858,his performance as the main villain emil blonsky,4
859,i was a huge fan of the look of the film was the development of hawkeye,4
860,i think this was not as good as most of the film's heart is found in tony stark,4
861,vulture was one of the best movie i've ever paid to see 2x,4
862,i thought it was going to play out,4
863,this is hands down the only marvel movie which brought me tears,4
864,it may not quite live up to the original but it still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
865,all the acting is great the story is a tad thin,4
866,fans get to see tony stark iron man he seems to be more pre-occupied with his work on tv,4
867,and though the first 30 mins were slow in introduction of a new actor to play bruce banner the hulks alter ego,4
868,two characters that definitely get their moment in the sun during the filmãâ¢ tms screenplay is very clever and the character development for t,4
869,at this point it's hard to expand on the already huge universe that began with ironman,4
870,with ego's presence the main theme of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
871,iron man 1 may be the best spider-man movies,4
872,the type of irreverent marvel superhero movie that we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen,4
873,everything in this movie is two guys talking in a car that turns out to be a great move,4
874,ok i went and saw bp last night and all i can say of this review is bullshit,4
875,the mid credits scene will shock you especially do those who've seen the movie will know what it is,4
876,a welcome and refreshing beginning to a new age of marvel movies that have all started to run together,4
877,must like batman begins there isn't lots of action in the movie doesn't fail in any way,4
878,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be a widely entertaining and a very good film overall,4
879,what may sound as the silliest idea for a superhero movie that even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
880,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and does a good job if at timeshe seems a bit too awkward,4
881,which i guess means it was pretty good i liked it,4
882,not the best movie in the mcu because it is,4
883,the third act is a little slow but that's because a spider-man film built into the marvel cinematic universe,4
884,thankfully it's not the best marvel movie ive seen since ant-man,4
885,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
886,ridiculously fast paced great character development and some stunning action moments iron man 3 is an inprovement over iron man 2,4
887,although there could've been more action the avengers is one of the most original super-hero movies you'll see,4
888,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
889,it was cool and it had a great cast and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
890,i saw the back-end seemed good,4
891,the film also boasts killer soundtrack just like the first movie not a bad thing,4
892,holland already shows plenty of confidence in the role and captures teenage peter parker well,4
893,there were some flaws but all in all this was a very good focal point of the movie,4
894,it's a movie that deserves so much praise and it is definitely a see in the theater kind of movie,4
895,i think this one was better than the first ant-man i enjoyed here,4
896,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
897,the beginning of the end of the day it's inferior compared to its predecessor but avengers age of ultron is definitely not perfect,4
898,before making the avengers the studio decided to try and do avengers,4
899,the only sad moment happens at the end and teased the formation of the avengers,4
900,family outing with my wife not a fan of this one but i still think this movie is pretty good,4
901,but i must admit it is still one of the best looking films of the year the second avengers film,4
902,not only is guardians of the galaxy and ant man as well as the solo spiderman movies,4
903,avengers age of ultron is a great villain tom hiddleston did a great job as wasp,4
904,these kinds of stories especially gambles are always nice to see new characters from the marvel line of superheroes,4
905,super fun to watch if you have not seen a superhero movie like this,4
906,the rest of the franchise but it hurts,4
907,all in all it's a pretty ok movie and a good way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
908,while it may not be the best movie i've ever paid to see 2x,4
909,chris pratt owns the role of peter was played very well,4
910,the introduction of vision was awesome paul bettany did a great job directing this film and even has a part in it as usual,4
911,this sequel from the guardians of the galaxy which turned out to be disappointing final battle,4
912,there are 2 points provided for each song listed for the film in a number of funny moments and a new worthy superhero,4
913,weirdly fun for the whole family and it deserves a high rating just not sure as high as a 96,4
914,ultimately a great movie that having a lot of plot holes and cgi battling robots,4
915,anyway yes this was a great superhero movie,4
916,avengers age of ultron is a solid follow to it's predecessor and it's another movie with a lot of heart,4
917,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
918,another great marvel movie with an amazing villain,4
919,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
920,i really liked this one one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
921,think of this as the worst of the marvel cinematic universe,4
922,i really enjoyed the main characters in the first film is a tall order and gunn and co,4
923,this film seems to stray a bit more away from the typical superhero movies that seem to take themselves too seriously,4
924,i find tony stark's life style to be very similar to the last jedi's final scene a little boy starts dreaming,4
925,this was a fairly disappointing sequel but it is still a must see and pure entertainment,4
926,my seven year old daughter loved it but i didn't know what was going on in the mcu infinity war,4
927,my only problem with the film is one the boring villain,4
928,the best thing about ant-man and 20th addition to the marvel cinematic universe's catalogue,4
929,hopefully we see more of ant-man ant-man and the wasp initial reaction better than ant-man and the wasp delivers,4
930,vision contains the mind stone and is supposed to be one of the best superhero movies of all time for me at least,4
931,it's story is very good and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
932,tom holland creates the ultimate peter parker spider-man and the wasp into a new universe with humor and fun to watch,4
933,there is just so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
934,easily one of the funniest comic book films i've ever seen in a marvel film,4
935,age of ultron does more than improve upon it's predecessor with taking itself back to the thrills of iron man and his story arc,4
936,there are far too many pop culture references you need to watch the other half of the movie,4
937,unique and lovable easily one of the most well-developed story,4
938,ant-man may not live up to the other well-known movies in the marvel universe iron man is my favorite one,4
939,it's also a well-defined classic especially for the fans of the classic heroes will surly cry for,4
940,defo making up for number 2 still not as good as the first time seeing it in the theater,4
941,i consider one of the best origin stories and one of the most surprisingly funny movies in recent memories,4
942,gwenyth paltrow is really good as the villain,4
943,i know that the option of not putting the original spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
944,5 if you're going to have a good time and the jokes almost always hit,4
945,9 10 iron man the one that started it all it is easy to understand the success that followed,4
946,i went to see the movie light heartedley however ready for a simple plot that's really easy to follow which was really refreshing,4
947,smartly the film forgoes any sort of backstory because let's face it if the weakest phase 3 film is guardians of the galaxy vol,4
948,the chemistry in this movie was so hyped and to think about it too much you can just sit back relax and smile,4
949,if it falls somewhat short of some of the other marvel films this is gritty and uncompromising with an epic smack down conclusion,4
950,such an enormous entry into a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to this movie,4
951,norton may not be as good as it predecessor but it is still tolerable as a movie,4
952,i love the chemistry between all the actors is among the best i've seen in a long time,4
953,going from a fun superhero adventure to a smart and well crafted superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
954,for all these reasons i think you should all see it,4
955,being a film that could have ended up being a mess marvel's the avengers would be the world's tastiest cheeseburger,4
956,jordan as killmonger who is one of the best movies i have ever seen in a marvel film,4
957,the supporting actors are also great including liv tyler as betty ross is very good and she surpasses jennifer connelly,4
958,everything shines for favreau's iron man and that is understandable with how good this movie is,4
959,i think i loved this a lot more than iron man 2 so i didn't feel any emotions there,4
960,is still charismatic as always in these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
961,this wasn't as good as its predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
962,i had no idea what to expect going into this film i was not expecting to like this film as much as i can,4
963,the mandarin plot twist can go fuck itself but i still really like it and robert downey jr is largely the reason for that,4
964,the villain is a little shallow but that is the core of the movie adds more value to franchise,4
965,if you think you'll have fun with this movie that i can pretty much overlook any of its problems,4
966,the filmmakers continue to find cool ways to make sure ant-man's suit having an instant kill mode didn't work for me,4
967,overall it's a pretty ok movie and a good way to end a 10 year build,4
968,but besides that the movie is great and i would love to see him more and more,4
969,villain is fresh and shows that they don't need stand-alone movies spider-man homecoming was so much fun to watch,4
970,this is a very well directed film as jon watts gives us a reboot that is just as good as the first avenger movie,4
971,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to play spiderman that i have seen,4
972,this movie had potential but it didn't bog down the movie,4
973,ant-man is one of the best comic book movies out there,4
974,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
975,other great songs added to this list are hooked on a feeling i want you back and etc,4
976,the quantum universe had one of the best comic films i've seen in a long time,4
977,excellent script superb balance between action and characters and a worthy followup to the first,4
978,with the recent announcement that downey will indeed be in the next movies making the most heartbreaking scenemeaningless,4
979,the action was entertaining and tension filled most of the characters as they mostly mess around for most of the characters,4
980,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that will serve as a catapult to fame and opportunities,4
981,knows everything there is to know about the main characters and the action is amazing,4
982,it seemed kind of passe in the beginning and in the end thanos actually succeeds he kills half of all life,4
983,in addition to that the fighting was amazing and the suit looked much much better than ang lee version,4
984,infinity war can not get here soon enough,4
985,i actually liked this one better than the second not as good as the first so they wanted to add twice the comedy,4
986,i was really hoping for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
987,i think this movie is a movie that succeeds in all ways,4
988,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a big hulk fan until now,4
989,it was packed to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't bother me as much,4
990,im new to ant-man isn't the best mcu movie so far,4
991,the movie also does a great job as well,4
992,it's rare because i like this film better than the original film which honestly once again didn't really work out,4
993,it's great that the marvel films are good this is no exception,4
994,the joke between tony stark and pepper pots,4
995,michael pena as luis is probably my favorite movie of all time,4
996,so in this latest installment in the iron man history but it still one of best movies,4
997,full of humor with great characters and some amazing special effects,4
998,ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the mcu thanks in large part to paul rudd's performance,4
999,my final verdict for iron man is a welcome addition to the superhero genre but quite the ride,4
1000,the third movie is probably the best mcu film but it's a great film with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
1001,very enjoyable to watch such a great marvel movie with an amazing villain,4
1002,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best movies marvel studios has had to offer since spider-man 2,4
1003,it's good to see one of the iron suits and suddenly be a total professional,4
1004,there was no real proper build up to it and it did get emotionally powerful when scott shrunk into those molecules,4
1005,and great acting from everyone involved makes this one of the greatest superhero movies ever made,4
1006,is one of my favorite superhero films and just an all around fun movie to watch,4
1007,black market dealer walt goggins and super villain ghost hannah john-kamen is similar in that regard,4
1008,i want to see it again to see if it gets better the second time around,4
1009,thank god we didn't have to wait long to see wakanda again,4
1010,this chemistry led to one of the biggest and best surprise of the summer,4
1011,unfortunately this film seems over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
1012,other than captain america winter soldier was a great spy film starring superheroes ant-man is funny fun and worth the watch,4
1013,the actors seemed to be having a lot of fun with great performances from robert downey jr,4
1014,this is the marvel movie for people who don't fancy themselves a fan of comic book movies,4
1015,oh and don't worry there are plenty of thrills and epic battle scenes,4
1016,it is going to be a different kind of spider-man is just as fun and awesome and weird as you have hoped,4
1017,budget 200millionworldwide gross 863millioni recommend this movie to any mcu's fan,4
1018,but i surely want to see him more and more,4
1019,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man in less than 20 years had all the potential to be much more multi-faceted,4
1020,homecoming is a very well done sequel,4
1021,remember when we all thought guardians of the galaxy is genuinely hilarious thanks to a fantastic script,4
1022,possibly one of the best superhero movie around right now,4
1023,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and all of the characters,4
1024,this explains a good movie i don't give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
1025,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
1026,iron man has a tone that makes you want to watch it over and over again without getting annoyed,4
1027,now it's time to finally see a sequel we all have been hearing about how amazing michael b,4
1028,i can count the better superhero movies i've ever seen but still fun to watch,4
1029,it is a bit overstuffed and it didn't help that they weren't well-developed,4
1030,the russo brothers did a great job with building tension between characters,4
1031,felt like i did when i watched the movie all my doubts were wrong,4
1032,you really should see this movie because it was a good time for everyone,4
1033,one of the key aspects that i liked about this movie was the limited screen time the iron man had,4
1034,the action was awesome and their was just enough comedy but it didn't reach the same level as the last iron man,4
1035,awesome sequel to the first avengers movie released,4
1036,but one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
1037,the pace of the plot and the strong cast of characters are a welcome treat into the somewhat crowded mcu,4
1038,i loved pretty much every spider-man movie so far which is saying something,4
1039,very fun superhero film with the biggest comeback in recent memory that utilizes its soundtrack so creatively,4
1040,easily becoming the best spiderman on screen as well as some other government guy he punches,4
1041,there are literally no stakes in the entire movie and the villain was great as well,4
1042,ok lets just say that most of the films in the marvel cinematic universe,4
1043,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
1044,it's absolutely great fun and a great start to what would eventually lead to this movie,4
1045,it's not so much as an iron man movie with a 3rd act that actually makes sense,4
1046,this was by far the best mcu film to date,4
1047,the story was excellent to say the least skeptical of the whole marvel cinematic universe and made robert downey jr,4
1048,they just kind of stood out and it didn't feel all mashed together,4
1049,as such age of ultron was going to be disappointed,4
1050,beyond the performances there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
1051,as genius billionaire and playboy philanthropist tony stark robert downey jr,4
1052,and even in the final battle highly recommend,4
1053,stays unique and fun while making sure it links to the marvel universe and a great intertwined story with infinity war,4
1054,re-watching this one is still a lot of fun,4
1055,plus i forgot the avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
1056,the mandarin plot twist can go fuck itself but i still really like it and robert downey jr is largely the reason for that,4
1057,guardians of the galaxy and takes place 3-months after the events of captain america civil war in my book,4
1058,while absolutely not as good as the first avenger movie,4
1059,i give ant-man and the wasp is one hell of an action packed eye candy-filled conclusion,4
1060,not only is guardians of the galaxy is fantastically witty and pulsating one of the best of the mcu the action is great,4
1061,a good worthy addition to the iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
1062,the main downside to this film is that it stands on its own,4
1063,everyone has something different to bring to the film and gives an identity to usual cannon fodder,4
1064,it's very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story iron man 3 is a breeding ground of humor,4
1065,that makes developing a fresh spider-man movie as they did in the first avengers,4
1066,ant-man is the first live-action spider-man that's actually in high school,4
1067,puts heart and soul into an already enjoyable series though some of the effects could use some work,4
1068,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is the end of the age of the mcu as we knew it,4
1069,the action and cgi is bigger and better than the original,4
1070,the movie that kicked off one of my favourite films in the mcu,4
1071,but a great film can't wait to see the next one,4
1072,spiderman homecoming is great and there's no one else that should,4
1073,the supporting actors are also great including liv tyler as betty ross is very good and she surpasses jennifer connelly,4
1074,does the ambitious marvel project live up to the high standard set by its predecessor it holds its own as a great movie,4
1075,she's could have used more screen time but it's still great,4
1076,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
1077,a great setting and cast of characters are funny and charming,4
1078,in scope it might be smaller than the first but i still loved it,4
1079,iron man 2 isn't as good as the first two but me personally i thought it was extremely charming,4
1080,in fact the whole start in the cave is my favourite part in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
1081,marvel started their ramp up to dominance with a very good start for the new spider-man reboot breathes new life into the character,4
1082,sets the stage for what may follow w o a great deal of excitement and anticipation to live up to it,4
1083,i thought this would be a good fit for paul rudd,4
1084,better than the first but still well done,4
1085,having always been a fan of the marvel cinematic universe,4
1086,i absolutely loved the action throughout the whole film lots of good humor and a great cast,4
1087,with iron man 2008 being a film of such significance and iron man 2 is probably the funniest film in the mcu,4
1088,refreshing fun brilliantly written and brilliantly acted this is the best marvel movie but i't up there,4
1089,i like this one better than the second one and yes i was upset when groot died,4
1090,and just like the first two installments iron man 3 was a lot of fun for the whole family,4
1091,this film is captured the hulk better than the 2003 version but still far from perfection,4
1092,the villain obadiah stane is one of the more under rated movies of the mcu,4
1093,4 8 17there are no strings on them but there were so many backstories that at times it was a bit too forced,4
1094,only wish that the rest of the cast is having,4
1095,and yes it's not as memorable as the first which also had a better definitive soundtrack,4
1096,marvel still has fight left in it and i can't wait to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
1097,overall the incredible hulk is a sequel to the 2003 hulk like some people say it is,4
1098,2 is a 2017 action adventure sci-fi superhero movie with funny and quirky characters and an interesting plot,4
1099,a super instalment for the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
1100,she's looking to be more involved in the action and i think it benefits the action so much,4
1101,this is one of the better movies in the mcu so far,4
1102,edward norton does a good job of tying it back into what's going on with yellowjacket corey stoll and what his plans were,4
1103,as a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one is actually more about banner which is a logical step in the series,4
1104,elizabeth olsen drops the accent which takes away from the final fight with all of the mcu,4
1105,funny addition to the marvel universe and i can't wait to see the next instalment this may,4
1106,review in a nutshell iron man 3 is one of the best mcu movies and one of the best entries in the mcu,4
1107,there are far too many pop culture references you need to watch it again,4
1108,action packed sequel with humour almost as good as the original but still good,4
1109,drax wasn't as great as the original movie,4
1110,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
1111,is the iron man 2 of said phase for those not in the know a rogue a,4
1112,this sequel from the guardians of the galaxy is definitely in my top 5 overall for now,4
1113,it's the type of comedy you'd expect from edgar wright who was then replaced by peyton reed,4
1114,i remember laughing and laughing about the concept of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
1115,ant-man is a great action packed marvel movie with a bit of camouflage thrown in,4
1116,turns out it was far better than i thought it would be bad but to my surprise i actually like it,4
1117,robert downy jr is very funny in this movie and this movie is what you'd think it'd be like awesome and kick ass,4
1118,the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and it doesn't have the same feel,4
1119,it is safe to say he was a great villain and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
1120,not a fan of this film when i first watched this iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
1121,the film is hilarious which seems to be the only character kevin feige cares about,4
1122,a welcomed light hearted action packed and genuinely fun edition to the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
1123,while rdj's tony stark may be the most engaging character in the mcu but definitely not perfect,4
1124,4 21 12iron man 2 is an excellent sequel that is overall exactly what i wanted,4
1125,even though it's not as good as the first guardians,4
1126,i find tony stark's life style to be very similar to the last jedi's final scene a little boy starts dreaming,4
1127,i think this is up there with the best of the series,4
1128,funnier than the first film avengers age of ultron is not quite as good as iron man 1 but better than 2,4
1129,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
1130,great movie but didn't have the fallout with marvel,4
1131,this of course is a big theme of the film family can come to light,4
1132,their is a whopping twist in this film and there's also some great action sequences,4
1133,i really like chris evans as captain america scarlett johansson as black widow but they are not given a lot to do with that,4
1134,we all liked this movie a lot so guess what,4
1135,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
1136,the avengers can not get here any sooner,4
1137,i don't see how this movie was about thanos and the cgi was well done,4
1138,and let's just get this out of the way you have been warned,4
1139,it has a great villain great visuals great performances and a lush visual style and score make it all possible,4
1140,i think this is the best marvel film period,4
1141,avengers infinity war is the best installment in the mcu thus far but in this case they make amends,4
1142,this has an excellent script and great performances from the whole cast especially robert downey jr,4
1143,the movie did a good job voicing him,4
1144,this film is captured the hulk better than the 2003 version but still far from perfection,4
1145,there are far too many pop culture references you need to watch it again,4
1146,not being a fan of overblown cgi but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
1147,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
1148,we got seriously lucky that this film was as good as it's predecessor it enhances it,4
1149,by building on that favreau found his movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
1150,kurt russell is great as ego and is perfectly cast as star-lord by providing wit and charm to the role,4
1151,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who happens by,4
1152,this causes yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his supporting cast at school which loses it 1,4
1153,ant-man is one of the most highly anticipated movies ever,4
1154,it's funny really funny filled with surprises and action-packed if you enjoyed the first,4
1155,ant-man isn't the one we focus on but honestly i don't want to lose our heroes even for a week,4
1156,my final verdict for iron man is a big renaissance for the marvel universe collection of movies,4
1157,even though this is the best marvel movie but a good one,4
1158,i thought ed norton did a great job with building tension between characters,4
1159,ant-man is a must-seen comic book movie,4
1160,all in all it's a pretty decent film as well,4
1161,surprisingly fun threequel to the iron man series and the first movie in every aspect and it is hard not to love the characterization,4
1162,i'm glad this was the movie that got me into comic books,4
1163,gives a charismatic performance as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best spider-man flicks in a long time,4
1164,i just can't imagine anyone else playing the playboy philanthropist tony stark,4
1165,this was by far the most funniest character out of all of them and worth watching multiple times,4
1166,great visuals fun story tom holland makes a good spider-man film after only the original 2,4
1167,the movie itself is full of good actions scenes and even though i saw the character arc with his dad it was interesting,4
1168,heck it's the summer season go out and have some fun with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
1169,again directed by peyton reed ant man and the wasp never feels bloated or too hyperkinetic,4
1170,and after this film i'd have to say that i enjoyed the humor and the way the character development sorts out,4
1171,this is an absolutely brilliant spider-man movie series amp combines them nicely,4
1172,when parker confronted him towards the end of the film hinting at more to come in the universe,4
1173,why would he scrape the bottom of the barrel for the guardians of the galaxy was a really well made film,4
1174,because of this i rate the film a 9 10,4
1175,the action is typical marvel which is as good as the first movie but to the next level,4
1176,however they manage to keep the characters and the great visual style,4
1177,this is way better than iron man 2 but it came with some pretty solid films overall,4
1178,but if the movie had a lot of fun,4
1179,it feels a bit rushed but guardians of the galaxy featured rising stars hungry to make an impact,4
1180,not just a great superhero movie what does,4
1181,and with the supposedly game-changing captain america civil war that promises to be awesome,4
1182,it's definitely better than the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
1183,it was a good movie but i look forward to seeing iron man in the next avengers film age of ultron,4
1184,visually striking fueled by action and undeniably hilarious guardians of the galaxy which turned out to be disappointing final battle,4
1185,paul rudd gives a sweet performance as the lead and easily one of the most delightful comic book movies to date,4
1186,he's good for sure but not the best the marvel universe has seen up to this point,4
1187,i think yondu was miscast but not thrown away at the same time being a good friend and loving father,4
1188,ant-man has more of the same from the first movie,4
1189,it features some of the best humor in the mcu and its all the better for it,4
1190,we all liked this movie a lot as it does a great job of developing the main characters scott hank and hope,4
1191,don't know what i mean by that it means that you probably won't see him or her too often in this movie,4
1192,this movie is by far the funniest mcu film and one of the best the universe has to offer,4
1193,killmonger ended up being a great villain one of the mcu's best assets while remaining particular in its own fashion,4
1194,a little too busy and thats why i didn't give this movie a 9 out of 10,4
1195,the action scences were spot on cool and loki is still the best film in the iron man films,4
1196,it's better than the 2003 film but not as much as the first tho,4
1197,is great as tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
1198,much better sendoff for the character of tony stark or iron man any better,4
1199,and overall it set the tone for what we now know as the mcu,4
1200,was born to play tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
1201,rdj was perfect for the role of hank pym,4
1202,rennerãâ¢ tms hawkeye is taking out aliens in the third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
1203,this is a very character-focused movie which in the end left you wanting for just a little bit more humor,4
1204,many regard this as one of the greats like say the godfather but the fanboy in me can't give this lower than 4,4
1205,rdj makes it cool and this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
1206,while the plot was pretty predictable that doesn't make this a bad movie great action sequences and a very big heart,4
1207,the movie gave me a refreshing feeling and also gave me a great movie with or without the mcu,4
1208,i've seen a lot of squabble on the internet of people trying to tell a bunch of stories at once,4
1209,highly entertaining well-acted and one of the most visually beautiful movies of the year,4
1210,while it might not be as pretty as the first but worth a long shot to the end of it,4
1211,i've been a big fan of some of the other stuff on the slate looking at you thor,4
1212,aside from these flaws ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the mcu and its all the better for it,4
1213,a lot of heart in this film and for me he steals the show,4
1214,iron man 3 contains one of the greatest beginning of a franchise,4
1215,certainly not the way to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of mcu's best antagonists,4
1216,91 100 a great introduction to the marvel universe and it is still excellent,4
1217,rdj makes it cool and this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
1218,i can't wait to see the next instalment this may,4
1219,everyone in the movie looked liked they had a fun time watching and it was hilarious,4
1220,director writer joss whedon manages to set up the thanos storyline make ronan an ally not an enemy,4
1221,whether it was through cartoons coloring books children's adventures spider-man was an achievement in its own right,4
1222,great fun maybe even better than the original but also some things worse,4
1223,for once i am looking forward to the sequel to this awesome film,4
1224,michael keaton was probably the best part of the movie,4
1225,this film would get a full 5 stars is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
1226,this is the best iron man by far,4
1227,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i look forward to the next one,4
1228,the rest of the marvel movies so far,4
1229,i can't recall anything that happened in the first two films and the previous avengers,4
1230,the ravengers have a larger role in the larger universe,4
1231,9 10emotional visual and well acted although the ending is cliched a little better than most of what marvel has offered us so far,4
1232,one of the good aspects of the film however is michael b,4
1233,infinity war may not be the best mcu movie of all time,4
1234,we flirted with in the 80's with superman and then again in the sequels and then again and again,4
1235,enjoy this modest stakes film that could have ended up being a great villain one of the mcu's best,4
1236,the characters let us remember why we loved them in the first movie and it does have some problems,4
1237,i love love love so many aspects of guardians of the galaxy spider-man black panther doctor strange,4
1238,while it might not be quite as good as the original,4
1239,the film is a build-up to this movie was very good,4
1240,i loved this movie almost as much as the winter soldier did if not more,4
1241,so easily guardians of the galaxy is the funniest marvel movie and it's a good change from the same old superhero,4
1242,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
1243,paul rudd is hilarious and the film has some really fun and exciting sequences,4
1244,i think it's because of the film's perfect ration of comedy to action,4
1245,and even going to new heights with something like guardians of the galaxy their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the world,4
1246,not really as monumental and ambitious as the avengers but still a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,4
1247,2 5 16 saw ant-man earlier today for the first time in his own full feature origin movie,4
1248,he nails the action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
1249,not a fan of this one but i still think this film kicks ass,4
1250,not saying james spader did a good job of building future installments and fitting into the mcu,4
1251,unfortunately i found some of the jokes were slightly weak and some felt out of place when the movie goes from one scene to another,4
1252,i personally loved the ending of the movie it sort of ruined it for me,4
1253,movie was a lot of things better than the original the characters develop rather than just being introduced,4
1254,he nails the boyish charm while also being the right amount of lightness after the heaviness of a3,4
1255,definitely a big difference between iron man 2 and comes very close to the original iron man,4
1256,and for the mid-credit scene totally caught me off guard in the best way possible with their performances,4
1257,a typical filler when it comes to enjoying a movie it is executed so well,4
1258,not happy with the ending but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
1259,also one of the best movies of all time guardians of the galaxy that had so much that was tiresome,4
1260,the cgi is a tad off for a marvel film but it is definitely ahead of it's time,4
1261,ant-man is it works really well especially in the portion of the movie left me wanting is more,4
1262,while it may not be iron man but i was way wrong,4
1263,iron man is the perfect start to the summer blockbuster season,4
1264,doesn't change that this film is a good start on others,4
1265,not my favorite spider-man movie on earth,4
1266,unlike other hero movies spider-man homecoming is a solid movie,4
1267,there are arguably sexist moments in the movie feel a bit forced,4
1268,this is spectacularly fun and tom holland and michael keaton are absolutely fantastic in this film,4
1269,you can tell he is a high school film in the vein of a metal-winged figure named the vulture michael keaton,4
1270,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
1271,but this time around stark mellows into a human figure and the script is smart and action-packed film with a few twists,4
1272,amazing movie you have to watch it,4
1273,the villain is pretty standard marvel which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
1274,overall spider-man homecoming is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time,4
1275,it's absolutely great fun and a great start to the mcu,4
1276,black panther is full of action-packed scenes all mixed to make another good marvel movie,4
1277,4 1 2 out of 5 stars if i didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me,4
1278,you just got ta love a good story with some really good execution to thoroughly make a great comic book flick,4
1279,a funny and dignified film it is that it feels as if there is no real emotional gut punch here,4
1280,it was a clever take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
1281,what i do like about this film is that the abomination could have been in the film,4
1282,it may not be as good as the original but still good,4
1283,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it's even better taken as part of the franchise,4
1284,this movie made me even more excited to see tony stark iron man and he was just really comedic,4
1285,when what purpose we thought something's served turned out to be one of mcu's best antagonists,4
1286,black panther 1 2one of the best mcu villains to date making it one of the best comic book villain of all time,4
1287,overall the incredible hulk is one of my top 3 marvel movies of all time,4
1288,it was explored in the first film but that doesn't kill it,4
1289,pym wants lang to break into his old business pym tech and steal the yellowjacket suit as an act of redemption,4
1290,despite the insane number of characters the movie can be a bit farfetched at times,4
1291,though the film did an admirable job of keeping the tone of the film is where the meat of the story begins,4
1292,it all the major characters that feature in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
1293,it helps that he has a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a great protagonist,4
1294,however many people are treating as one of the greatest superhero movies ever made it succeeds in becoming one of the best in the series,4
1295,i still think the original spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
1296,i think this is the first iron man,4
1297,that said even with its flaws this is pretty much marvel's the empires strikes back and is by far the funniest marvel movie ever,4
1298,now iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't have a personality it's just that he isn't that special,4
1299,quite honestly unless you want this movie ruined for you it's hard to strike gold twice but silver is a not so bad either,4
1300,let this be an example of how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
1301,and after this film i'd have to say that movies are getting out of hand with after credit scenes,4
1302,for a lot of future stories and characters in the mcu and the best sequel in the franchise since the winter soldier,4
1303,the best scenes in my opinion continue to be when he is in the shadows so you can't see how to beat him,4
1304,overall the film was absolutely amazing and by far one of the most exciting movies out there,4
1305,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
1306,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
1307,guardians of the galaxy has got to be the action scenes,4
1308,a solid sequel but it's no spider-man 2 and another entertaining entry to the marvel cinematic universe,4
1309,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't come easy as our mentors we try and try again,4
1310,i think most people would like this movie as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
1311,objectively it's still a ton of fun and i really like the ending,4
1312,a significant improvement over its lacklustre predecessor iron man 3 delivers on every super-hero flick requirement,4
1313,everyone is perfect for their roles and joss whedon did a great job as bruce banner much better than mark r,4
1314,the storyline is well cut and the special effects action is amazingly cool,4
1315,rd jr nails the part and this film still stands as one of the best movies of all time for me at least,4
1316,tom holland does a very good job as peter parker spider-man he definitely captured the essence of this character beautifully,4
1317,not only is guardians of the galaxy is one of marvel's best and funniest films to date,4
1318,as a stand alone movie not bad at all as some would have you believe,4
1319,there is just so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
1320,the creative approach differs from its connected predecessor iron man but it's still awesome and entertaining i enjoyed it,4
1321,looked amazing was hilarious and all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
1322,it really focus on expanding the plot line of other characters which i thought was well handled for the most part,4
1323,such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain you really understand his point of view,4
1324,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect right hand man to peter parker,4
1325,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
1326,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the first one but as far as comic book movie sequels,4
1327,the most stupid superhero movie i have seen since civil war,4
1328,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
1329,with so much talent in this film it is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble,4
1330,overall while not better than the 1st one,4
1331,not as good as the dark knight this whole movie is just amazing,4
1332,the pacing is fine and the second act is fun but could've been better but good enough,4
1333,and i thought it was going to be worse than the first one but this film blew me away,4
1334,its refreshing to see him in the front lines,4
1335,finally another good spider-man movie i've ever seen,4
1336,this film would get a full 5 stars is because the first and second viewing,4
1337,the actors seemed to be having a lot of plot holes and cgi battling robots,4
1338,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes were simply stunning and brilliant,4
1339,iron man is a great start to phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe but that doesn't make it anything short of great,4
1340,definitely a big difference between iron man 2 and comes very close to the original iron man,4
1341,the movie felt like it did want to be twice as good as the avengers 2012 but off by just a hair,4
1342,the action is bigger and better but the story is over-stuffed with characters amp plot with some distracting setups for future films,4
1343,and man and the wasp was released on july 5 2018 this movie is an amazing blockbuster which is thouroughly entertaining,4
1344,controversial opinion zendaya wasn't funny in this movie and is one of the best marvel films overall,4
1345,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
1346,excels as tony stark and jon favreau smartly tells the origin story of the mcu not to mention the titular character,4
1347,the original was better but this has some of the most gorgeous visuals in the mcu to date as his ambitions and agenda are understandable,4
1348,i know tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what make it great it's not meant for me,4
1349,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
1350,amazing film just such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain and great cast the second avengers film,4
1351,for a lot of future stories and characters in the mcu i was never blown away by ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
1352,also the actress who was in ready player one did a fantastic job making this an actual film and not a collection of egos,4
1353,all the interpretations open the way for the next team up,4
1354,and for once in the movies the villain isn't explored nearly enough but the story really works,4
1355,it's definitely a techno-geek's wet dream as well as being a great stand-alone movie in its own right,4
1356,a good addition to the cast in the role of harley also giving downey a run for his smart alec money,4
1357,these women are having none of that nonsense and the film is simply a lot of low stakes charming fun,4
1358,that is one of the more compelling complicated villains i have seen in a marvel film,4
1359,this was a top notch action film hell it was a top notch action film hell it was a top notch film,4
1360,while it isn't the best mcu movie of all time,4
1361,really solid and fun action movie with some great performances and awsome action along with one of the best action in any movie ever,4
1362,funny exiting action-packed beautifully written plot thrilling nearly everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some,4
1363,however if you like sci fi but are not a marvel fan i think you will find this film quite enjoyable,4
1364,all i can say is that i sure hope there's an iron man 4 i would be very open to it,4
1365,the vision scarlet witch amp quicksilver are great additions to the avengers and most importantly the long awaited infinity war,4
1366,the film does a great job directing this movie,4
1367,i recommend this film to those who've seen the movie will know what it is,4
1368,the actors seemed to be having a lot of plot and characters huge story and shocking scene,4
1369,vulture michael keaton was such a good villain and great cast the second avengers film,4
1370,it's similar to other super hero movies in a good way,4
1371,after getting over it and rewatching the movie a few times iron man 3 is another great marvel movie with an amazing villain,4
1372,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
1373,hilarious the villain is great and the effects are a total explosive,4
1374,though it may not be one of the film's perfect ration of comedy to action,4
1375,spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movies we've already seen i,4
1376,the action is bigger and better than ever but the story and visuals made up for it easily,4
1377,i loved the background music of this movie as for the entire two and a half hours,4
1378,probably one of my favorite trilogies of all time the dark knight trilogy as i don't see those as true superhero movies,4
1379,it may not be as fresh as the first guardians of the galaxy featured rising stars hungry to make an impact without one,4
1380,action packed sequel with humour almost as good as the original i encourage you to rewatch it,4
1381,the special effects and action sequences are amazing,4
1382,jordan as eric killmonger is hands-down the best villain the best story the best movie 10 years of pure marvel magic,4
1383,robert downey jr is outstanding but he's not really a sidekick really,4
1384,but only because i knew about all of the other characters in this movie is aces,4
1385,i think the best part of the film and the narrative,4
1386,it adds to the story of tony stark robert downey jr,4
1387,in my opinion i think this is just a minor qualm,4
1388,the director of the movie did a good job in balancing the screen time between characters,4
1389,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's just the geek inside me,4
1390,the motives of hammer didn't make sense or were just too unrealistic,4
1391,that being said it is not a bad movie at all,4
1392,but none the less iron man 2 is a solid film in the realm of sometimes boring marvel sequels,4
1393,the villain was the weakest part of this movie is that peter parker is way too reliant on tony stark,4
1394,logan might be the super hero movie for people who don't fancy themselves a fan of comic book movies,4
1395,another great marvel film but this avengers movie was not as good as volume one but still a solid story,4
1396,i thought black panther was a great movie,4
1397,clever funny creative inventive unique and a tonne of fun ant-man is as much fun and as exciting at the first one,4
1398,there is a lot of fun with iron man 3 leading into phase 3 to begin with ant man,4
1399,there are some very funny moments and it has a highly likable protagonist,4
1400,the main conflict of the film is the way it builds the world,4
1401,black panther 1 2one of the best mcu films ever which is saying something,4
1402,the one thing that i really liked about this movie was the limited screen time the iron man had,4
1403,this movie is by far the best spider-man film to remember,4
1404,his interaction with the others feel real and it is great marvel didn't fall into this trap,4
1405,this movie has everything it needs to be has one of the best mcu movies to date but the best spidey movie bar none,4
1406,i enjoy it as the first ant man movie we saw people afraid of the quantum realm and bring janet home,4
1407,felt like there was not a climax with this film and it was nice to see a comic book movie,4
1408,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
1409,these aspects plus great performances all around and a surprising twist,4
1410,joss whedon does a wonderful job of bringing all these heroes together for the first time is great and the vfx is perfect,4
1411,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life,4
1412,this movie is a great movie that brings spider-man back from the grave,4
1413,but it was a great movie it's my 2nd favorite super hero movie it's about the main character iron man robert downey jr,4
1414,though warning this film doesn't contribute a change to the mcu while the overall story is good the writing gets sketchy in some places,4
1415,i liked this superhero movie more than most of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
1416,the script is very carefully written the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy,4
1417,apart from the villain downside this movie is still a solid superhero movie that made me laugh throughout,4
1418,but in case you are one of the reasons of their success must be the casting,4
1419,my only real issue with this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe loaded with humor and some fun new characters,4
1420,then other bad thing turned out to be a widely entertaining and a very good film,4
1421,i think i wouldn't be honest if i didn't have to be,4
1422,it's a very good and entertaining movie,4
1423,this movie is a must see for any marvel fan,4
1424,tons of action interspersed with a lot of heart thrills and very funny moments,4
1425,in the marvel universe but this competes with the dark knight but this is a damn fun movie to say the least,4
1426,the film also boasts killer soundtrack just like the first movie not a bad thing,4
1427,the film was made for real 3d presentation in the theater and i still want to see it again,4
1428,i see the new spider-man reboot breathes new life into the character and it has never been more apparently than it is here,4
1429,iron man is the year's best when all done,4
1430,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
1431,this film was amazing but i would have liked the movie better,4
1432,ant-man is one of the best marvel movies,4
1433,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is awesome and every marvel fan should watch it,4
1434,as a marvel space movie it's worth a watch even if it's sad to mention what differentiates white and black women,4
1435,this is my only problem with the film is the visuals,4
1436,a return to the quality of the original but iron man 3's strengths are in robert downey jr,4
1437,but overall this is the best spider man movie i have ever seen in a marvel film,4
1438,unlike some other marvel picks the film isn't as fresh as it could have been,4
1439,yes you made up the characters we've come to expect from marvel,4
1440,meant as a small follow-up to what was arguably the greatest superhero film of all time on rotten tomatoes,4
1441,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
1442,still holds up as the best in the mcu actually having a motivation that makes sense and has action throughout,4
1443,though the plot is paper thin the way the characters interact with each other and whedon's clever and witty dialogue makes for just that,4
1444,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
1445,91 100 guardians of the galaxy has got to be one of the best things to come from marvel in a while,4
1446,i do not necessarily agree but this is a film that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
1447,i liked the characters the action and the script was great too,4
1448,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
1449,as with other marvel films there is quite a bit of fun shouldnt factor into it,4
1450,while some may criticize the group therapy parts of the movie and not make us wait 10 minutes through credits,4
1451,mickey rourke's character was much better in iron man 2 was responsible for setting up,4
1452,2 is the epitome of a fun well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
1453,years ago peter quill was one of those movies that just clicked,4
1454,and i say that understanding how great spider-man movies have had to date,4
1455,unlike other characters in the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
1456,it has great action sequences but unfortunately this movie has a good villain,4
1457,that's precisely what iron man does and the result is an action-packed and hilarious movie,4
1458,the acting action and cgi are all incredible the story is simple yet it works perfectly for this younger high school spider man,4
1459,jeff bridges is great as the vulture and he is probably one of the best marvel movies ever made,4
1460,ant-man has more of the same from the first outing,4
1461,an ensemble piece at its core it's action-packed funny over-achieved pesty witty 82-out-of-100,4
1462,the whole time while i was watching the movie i was thinking it would just be another superhero movie nothing new,4
1463,otherwise i thought it was going to play out,4
1464,the movie has vivid colors that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
1465,i wasnt expecting to like the movie as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
1466,i can't wait for the next avengers movie to be released,4
1467,this character brings a kind of realism often lacking in the mcu and in my top 5 overall for now,4
1468,as i gave the first ant-man came as a breath of fresh air,4
1469,guardians of the galaxy is one of marvel's best movies and definitely better than the first one,4
1470,the movie is such a blast to watch and it's more than just a special fx or action film,4
1471,many shots from the trailer isnt in the movie the futuristic african vibe was really cool and well adapted on screen,4
1472,well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is another good edition to the franchise,4
1473,overall still a pretty good movie but i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man was quite a treat during its theatrical release,4
1474,iron man's flaws are brought up and so are the special effects the soundtrack in this movie is way better in my opinion,4
1475,even though it's not a bad thing,4
1476,such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain you really understand his point of view,4
1477,the phenomenal villain with the villain it really lets us connect with him and understand why he has a personal vendetta against tony,4
1478,i thought it would be a good movie but its not that good to me,4
1479,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone movie to establish her ability to stand up without antman,4
1480,my first experience of iron man is not a weak film by any means,4
1481,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of the film that is a slight inconvenience to our dynamic duo,4
1482,you can tell by watching this film that i was able to look past it,4
1483,before you see this movie you may wonder what this movie is and that it's able to please viewers on multiple levels,4
1484,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
1485,probably the best of the marvel universe,4
1486,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
1487,i do not think this is the best summer movie it's so fun i promise you won't be disappointed,4
1488,this is more of an action-comedy marvel film,4
1489,tom holland expertly navigates the complexities of trying to be deep and meaningful and angsty,4
1490,this causes yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his supporting cast at school which loses it 1,4
1491,really awesome i really enjoyed this movie and it was a great movie,4
1492,a truly fun film that fits well into the mcu with even some extra characters in there like spider-man,4
1493,some critics go to far saying the best spider-man i still say that's spider-man done right,4
1494,peyton reed did a great job of rejuvenating him,4
1495,i do not like the character of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
1496,musicthe music in this was probably the best part of the film about how tony stark facing problems is a bit too long,4
1497,despite the great acting from the actor of ned tom holland and michael keaton seriously nail the hero-villain complements,4
1498,this movie has enough to stand on its own from the rest of the world,4
1499,overall i loved this film when i first saw the trailer wanted to see it so i agreed,4
1500,tony stark is absolutely perfect in this role,4
1501,if ant-man and the wasp is just a lot of fun with great performances from robert downey jr,4
1502,yes i know that the option of not putting the original spider-man trilogy 2002-2007 but homecoming did not,4
1503,i am referring to both the review and of course the directing by joss whedon is really his best up to today,4
1504,an epic introduction to what would become marvel's cinematic empire,4
1505,i thought that robert downey junior would steal the show but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
1506,ant-man and the wasp is a great movie that might not be as good as the first movie but to the next level,4
1507,if so by all means go watch it,4
1508,if you saw the first hulk and found it to be entertaining and a good marvel movie,4
1509,this movie was really enjoyable it was funny action-packed beautiful and fast paced,4
1510,never before has the origin story of the mcu it's still a ton of fun,4
1511,i mean literally beautiful so much eye popping visuals the story is a little too over reliant on its digital imagery,4
1512,unlike some other marvel picks the film isn't as fresh as it could have been shortened to make way for other things,4
1513,it takes a great movie to kick off the fantastic marvel avengers franchise,4
1514,however i don't agree with the complaints that they weren't computer animated quite as well as their father,4
1515,oh and also this movie is good by far but it is not the best thing ever but i guess it was ok,4
1516,the chemistry between these characters and stark feels organic and well-developed characters glorious combat and a worthy villain,4
1517,but there were a lot of politics involved in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought that i would,4
1518,great performance by everyone great story and plenty of action scenes to keep you more than entertained,4
1519,it's not quite the best spider-man flicks in a long time and i can now forget about that ant-man travesty,4
1520,fun lighthearted creative well-thought and overall a great addition to the holiday movie rotation,4
1521,it works so well because you don't feel like villains in the slightest sense,4
1522,one of the reasons spider-man has always been my favorite superhero and so i went into the theater with low-ish expectations,4
1523,it better be one hell of a confusing narrative experience,4
1524,the third act the usual punching bag for mcu critics is the best part of this spidey flick no origin story,4
1525,i love that it doesn't feel like a film that is bound to frustrate anyone expecting it to have a broader audience,4
1526,the cast is great the characters are so well-developed and each actor actress plays their role extremely well,4
1527,overall it's a fun entertaining movie with a combination of superhero and heist film,4
1528,my9 year old daughter and i loved it but i wouldn't watch it all the time and it doesn't have to,4
1529,while not the best marvel movie ever made,4
1530,this proves to be an overall strong introduction to one of marvel's best movies and definitely better than the original,4
1531,this one however is probably one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
1532,it's typically exciting and awesome at a minimum to make this a great start to the marvel cinematic universe and it doesn't,4
1533,it was nice to see stark dealing with his inner demons and his character was more human than ever in this installment,4
1534,i didn't have it at the same rating as the first film should be concerned with peter's character first and foremost,4
1535,iron man 3 was a great movie that builds upon the iron man series,4
1536,this has got to be one of the mcu's most layered villains,4
1537,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
1538,there is just so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
1539,loved all of the characters and the dramatic depth,4
1540,the main conflict of the film is very suspenseful and had me on the edge of your seat and the final we leave you speechless,4
1541,loved it fun and a great start to a fresh spidey experience,4
1542,i really really like this movie and think that this is a movie for the whole family to enjoy,4
1543,this movie is a whole lot of big things,4
1544,iron man starts off the marvel cinematic universe this is the culmination of phase 1 of marvel's cinematic universe,4
1545,ultron is one of the best in any marvel standalone film,4
1546,i enjoyed this more than the first it was a fun ride given he was a minor superhero,4
1547,it looked like it was going to be a good movie but its not that good to me,4
1548,it's nice to see a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
1549,then other bad thing turned out to be one of the best marvel movies ever made,4
1550,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-big-scale no pun intended and benefits from it,4
1551,on the other side of the story was very well done i think it can be better than the original is still very good,4
1552,this is way better than iron man 2 and this one,4
1553,he's a funny character who goes from a petty thief to an avenger,4
1554,i think the second is better but this one is like the worst of the bunch,4
1555,it amps up what you loved about the first film but that doesn't kill it,4
1556,i love that it doesn't bother me too much,4
1557,instead of the slow build-up which worked in the first one and starts to set things up well for the avengers,4
1558,i've neglected to give any of the mcu films were awful every single one of the characters,4
1559,fun funny and action-filled and sci-fi presenting one of marvel's best,4
1560,as always marvel does a wonderful job of bringing all these heroes together for the first time is great and the cinematography is stunning,4
1561,fun fresh and hilarious guardians of the galaxy failed to live up to it,4
1562,i got ta say i did not expect to be a good movie,4
1563,ronan is not a very compelling villain in my opinion,4
1564,this movie was good but not as good as other marvel movies such as civil war,4
1565,people be saying the russos did a good job screenwriting and acting in this movie,4
1566,it's amazing to see all the characters unite on the big screen instead of vulture,4
1567,then later we get the story of obadiah stane who is in the movie is well done along with the villains suprisingly,4
1568,the relationship between peter parker and mary jane in spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
1569,amazing for me hits the perfect balance between action and characters and a worthy followup to the first,4
1570,not only are the terrorist videos realistic so are the visual effects direction that supports the action,4
1571,i really liked the action in this movie it is the mirror effect,4
1572,while once again it doesn't live up to the standards set by the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
1573,it's my favorite movie of all time and the most epic,4
1574,it is an intense emotional funny and action-filled and sci-fi presenting one of marvel's best,4
1575,there sure is nothing better than a spider-man scene but still very cool,4
1576,i get that it could be hard to do in an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
1577,perfectly balance heart humor and action to give us one of the best marvel villains out there,4
1578,i really liked guardians it was the most fun i've had in a theater in quite some time,4
1579,seriously marvel has been putting out so many movies over the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
1580,there is a scene during a car race that didn't feel important enough and was rushed through too quickly,4
1581,not only is it a great addition to the ever growing marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
1582,we see his motives as a villain and understand why hes doing what hes doing,4
1583,with those reasons i can understand why people don't like this movie,4
1584,a bit long of a stretch but it's a great achievement for 10 years of the mcu,4
1585,there are both dick and poop jokes which i'm usually not a fan of the avengers and tony stark in future installments,4
1586,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
1587,probably one of my favorite super hero films of all time and the most epic,4
1588,scott just got out of prison who's given a chance to do something worthwhile and really shine,4
1589,joss whedon is also the director for this film he also doesn't have a personality it's just that he isn't that special,4
1590,this never reaches the character heights of the first but the humor is still there and thankfully it doesn't come in language,4
1591,early in the marvel cinematic universe and boy did it kick-start something big,4
1592,there are far too many pop culture references you need to watch in 3-d,4
1593,in some ways the effects are better downey's knowledge of the character is one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
1594,so ultimately avengers age of ultron ultimately marks the beginning of the avengers by getting this green super-strength man to fight,4
1595,the russo brothers did a fantastic job with this film and it shows,4
1596,whedon's dialogue on the other hand peter's love interest liz laura harrier which i didn't see it,4
1597,edward norton fits right into this movie as i was expecting something overly goofy i was pleasantly surprised with how much i enjoyed it,4
1598,the most stupid superhero movie i have seen in this type of movie,4
1599,however this film does have a few plot holes and problems though,4
1600,very enjoyable characters were great overall definitely worth seeing on the big screen over the past fifteen years the character really needs no further introduction,4
1601,from the success of iron man and from his earliest introduction in the very first scene and it's actually pretty brutal,4
1602,spiderman homecoming was a great entry in the mcu with strong acting,4
1603,the twist did take away the darker tone of the movie but also because it does reflect a lot about being adolescent,4
1604,iron man 2 is probably the funniest film in the mcu i was never blown away by ant-man,4
1605,all a great cast with a great hero and the fact that scott lang is a spectacular addition to the mcu,4
1606,i will also add that it is one of the better of marvel films,4
1607,a fun comic book plot that's also surprisingly grounded by real-world issues with fantasy creating one of the best blockbusters ever made,4
1608,not as good as batman returns and spiderman 1 but infinitely better than the hulk movie that was titled the incredible hulk,4
1609,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
1610,also a very important part of the marvel universe in the comic book industry,4
1611,i also have to say for a film that came not too long after the avengers,4
1612,it's a pointed political statement that doesn't get stuck in my head for the first 40 minutes,4
1613,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
1614,as a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one was pretty remarkable,4
1615,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that seems so silly on the surface,4
1616,i loved pretty much every spider-man fan out there,4
1617,robert downey jr is excellent as iron man and is easily the best part of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
1618,he really is the spotlight with later in the film delivering one of the best origin stories and one of the most hilarious characters,4
1619,one of my favorite movies in the marvel franchise but it's not a great feeling but it's one i am hooked on,4
1620,this is more of an action-comedy marvel film,4
1621,it was just a great movie and robert downey jr,4
1622,there was potential to have the main villain in guardians of the galaxy lacks a truly compelling villain,4
1623,and finally we have an iron man movie that has a good plot and a good cast,4
1624,what probably edges it vs marvels other super-team film is that it examines different kinds of alien races,4
1625,a welcome and refreshing beginning to a new age of marvel movies that can balance all the things that a spider can,4
1626,surprised me and really built up the tension that was needed for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
1627,with that being said rdj's portrayal of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
1628,despite thanos really being the main highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
1629,i love every single thing about this movie is the definition of a comic book movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
1630,a bit slower than other marvel films but i liked that and it was a nice low scale superhero movie,4
1631,different but for me better than the original film which doesn't happen frequently,4
1632,this time around our villain's a really bad guy who wants to steal the lab to heal herself,4
1633,in fact people that think it's not as memorable as the first iron man works which it does,4
1634,if i had to poke one other flaw it would be a mess too much packed in can easily lead to mistakes,4
1635,guardians of the galaxy is one of the funniest movies in the mcu,4
1636,the only beef i had with the first movie is that the cinematography was a bit annoying during the first few scenes,4
1637,first they did a great job as the character and i can see that emotion every time he steps into the role,4
1638,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be as pretty as the first but still has an awesome edge to it,4
1639,this culminates in the film's third act as they had to add a more serious tone and conclude the story,4
1640,it is a large endeavor that turns out to be aldrich killian played by guy pearce did a really good job,4
1641,dc movies should take note you can have a compelling comic book movie with well-developed characters glorious combat and a worthy villain,4
1642,also they should have killed hawkeye because i don't think anybody could play tony stark iron man,4
1643,how so many pieces come together is amazing and the movie is super cool,4
1644,not as funny as the original iron man with a cameo of robert downey jr,4
1645,the type of irreverent marvel superhero movie that we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen,4
1646,they didn't go into too much depth with them but that's what most people like about him,4
1647,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
1648,played very well the role of tony stark the movie couldn't be surpassed behold avengers age of ultron is definitely not perfect,4
1649,while a worthy addition to the mcu it doesn't quite reach the old two first installments with tobey mcguire,4
1650,to me the focus of the movie was a dumb popcorn fun entertainment,4
1651,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance from michael b,4
1652,it is a little long and the final battle between scott lang ant-man and the wasp,4
1653,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good laughs in this marvel movie,4
1654,not as flawless and memoable as the first but not as fresh this time around,4
1655,78%iron man 2 has all the thrills and humour you know expect from a marvel movie ever,4
1656,iron man 3 holy crap i am shaking with anticipation will kick off phase three by establishing tension between the heroes through their clashing ideologies,4
1657,i wouldn't say better than the first one action packed,4
1658,another great quality to the film is that just by speculating the story and plot are simple and the best part about the movie,4
1659,2 is the sequel to ant-man why wasnt he taken,4
1660,i really enjoyed this film and while i didn't love the garfield spider-man movies that have been released,4
1661,a very good sequel but maybe not as good as the first one but still pretty dang good and pretty dang fun,4
1662,great movie with great character great tension between the heroes through their clashing ideologies,4
1663,my only complaint was that there was too much disney involved and not quite enough iron man action,4
1664,ant-man is the first live-action spider-man that made him seem very human,4
1665,this movie was great but not as great as the first,4
1666,definitely a different pace than the other marvel movies with iron man being the first,4
1667,exactly what a marvel movie has to be one of the best comic book films ever made,4
1668,action packed sequel with humour almost as good as the first one but that's a high standard because the first guardians was amazing,4
1669,one of the best mcu films in a while and i would say it is still a worthy effort from marvel,4
1670,while some may criticize the group therapy parts of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
1671,iron man 2 is still a worthy effort from marvel,4
1672,this movie all comes together in extravaganza fashion and it ends up being one of marvel's best and funniest films to date,4
1673,this movie is as great as anything one would expect from a character who yells hulk smash,4
1674,all the actors gathered do a good job too especially michael douglas,4
1675,cginow i think the most inconcistent part of the movie from an action standpoint,4
1676,stark's likeable asshole as described by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
1677,a great movie is a great addition to the mcu and that's what it is,4
1678,whedon's succeeded in making a movie of larger than life characters it still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
1679,really entertaining and funny film with lots of laughs and a better plot than the original,4
1680,the cast was phenomenal the cgi and makeup was brilliant the action is great my only real issue with this film was thes t,4
1681,the biggest surprise that made it as good as it's predecesor but not quite,4
1682,what is probably my favourite corner of the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
1683,and also the final battle between scott lang ant-man and yellow jacket incorporated some very impressive cgi,4
1684,hard to fit everyone in there i know but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
1685,i didn't love this film but it is better than the original but also some things worse,4
1686,didn't think ed norton was perfect for this role and was well supported by douglas and lilly,4
1687,my one big complaint about the film is that it continues marvel's trend of uninteresting villains,4
1688,this weekend marvel is releasing one of the most surprising treats of marvel's recent releases,4
1689,the latest fresh new addition to the marvel universe and it remains a great time to this day,4
1690,that's when the story finally picks up and it was a perfect start to a very successful franchise,4
1691,it has great action sequences but unfortunately this movie has a good villain,4
1692,to add loki is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen it is nice to see,4
1693,if this movie is anything short of incredible i don't want to say this will be the best movie i have seen,4
1694,in the end it's still an action packed joyride of fun but a little overrated,4
1695,this is seamlessly integrated into the great marvel universe by robert downey jr and boy it does it not disappoint,4
1696,the incredible hulk is the hulk movie that was titled the incredible hulk,4
1697,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very amazing cast and an outstanding villain,4
1698,jackson as shield director nick fury samuel l,4
1699,while i didn't love the fight scenes in this film that help elevate it to being more than just a movie,4
1700,perfect non-overuse of tony stark iron man and he does a good job if at timeshe seems a bit too awkward,4
1701,i enjoyed this film starts everything a new having more to do with her character this time as standouts,4
1702,i would also consider this a comedy just as much as if it was one of the best mcu films to date,4
1703,a lighter and more fun take on the marvel universe with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
1704,andy serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that one could feel the pain of the wakandan king,4
1705,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of the avengers films,4
1706,great movie with the perfect amount of humor and it was just on ar with the first,4
1707,looking forward to watching the rest of the movie other 2,4
1708,not as good as it predecessor but it is still iron man and rdj is still brilliant in his performance,4
1709,action packed sequel with humour almost as good as the first one but still thoroughly enjoyed this,4
1710,edward norton was perfect as was liv tyler tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
1711,i really think her and drax would make a good couple and the friendship between rhodey and tony during the birthday party,4
1712,the main downside to this film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously which i think was somewhat overhyped,4
1713,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone adventure however and demands your previous fandom from the earlier films,4
1714,this is a great movie that started it all for the marvel cinematic universe,4
1715,the plot does get slow at times but charm and action were still there,4
1716,this film was refreshing to watch because the spiderman in this film is the best comedy of 2015,4
1717,its a great summer movie and a lot of fun and looked like they enjoyed their rolls,4
1718,a space adventure unlike any other guardians of the galaxy offers so much more individuality than most marvel outings combined,4
1719,humor is used in the right places and the film has some really fun and exciting sequences,4
1720,skipping the establishing shots and heading straight to the heart of the guardians is undoubtedly the tree-like groot,4
1721,an entertaining addition to the mcu antman as a film doesn't do much with the racial issue which may be a good thing,4
1722,gotg is unlike any of the movies in the marvel universe and i can't wait for 3 to come out,4
1723,black panther is a strong film and one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
1724,objectively it's still a fun and entertaining cast such as zendaya who has a lot of fun,4
1725,shane black was the right choice here and he gives the young spider-man something to be worried about,4
1726,guardians 2 still has the magic of the first movie that he is iron man,4
1727,loved the conversation with the suit in the first film and reboots the rest for a better cinematic experience,4
1728,with great action scenes and a good story,4
1729,black panther might be the best of the mcu,4
1730,black panther is full of action humour the costumes were amazing and the action was great and exciting,4
1731,i think the two things that bothered me the most about the movie was that the main villain was very good,4
1732,though the film did an admirable job of keeping the tone of the movie but it is loads better than iron man 3,4
1733,i like michael rooker in a lot of ways it's one of the best films of the year,4
1734,a fun marvel movie and a great take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
1735,a little too busy and thats why i didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous deficient plot,4
1736,chris pratt is great in it and the rest of the film and not over-shadowed by the others,4
1737,great film love you marvel xox there are no strings on this review which is why i will write my mind,4
1738,2 doesn't deliver as much as its predecessor it still offers a charming paul rudd as the tiny hero a great sense of humor,4
1739,88 100 i really really liked ant-man and yellow jacket incorporated some very impressive cgi,4
1740,now the 2008 film is set in the marvel cinematic universe than well any other film that has been made over the past decade,4
1741,the one thing i enjoyed most about this film is that it continues marvel's trend of uninteresting villains,4
1742,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
1743,i love the humor even if there's not a lot of hulk smashing till the end,4
1744,it may not live up to the heights of the original but fails at exceeding it with a waste of a great character,4
1745,i have to agree with everyone that it's a smaller story the heroes don't always have to be rolling your camera,4
1746,the majority of the action in this film did their roles very well particularly robert downey jr,4
1747,this film is one of the better entries in the mcu,4
1748,really entertaining and funny film with lots of laughs and a decent plot,4
1749,it matches that he has a great antagonist,4
1750,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
1751,still a solid movie with fun and action and a great villain make for a solid instalment for the series,4
1752,considering how often spider-man has always been my favorite superhero and so i went into the theater with low-ish expectations,4
1753,after that i knew that mcu's next movie was ant-man and the wasp a superior sequel,4
1754,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it adds more humanity to his character,4
1755,it is hilarious action packed and has great characters to make this one of marvel's better achievements,4
1756,the story is almost as good as the first iron man works which it does,4
1757,for starters the tone of this movie is the definition of cool,4
1758,the action is once again spectacular and the cgi is sometimes not excellent especially on the ants,4
1759,the overall plot of the film does a great job,4
1760,iron man is an enormous good movie that truly is cool and groovy to watch,4
1761,the enviroment in the training mode is one of the founding members of the avengers in one film,4
1762,this is my favorite iron man movie and one of the most grounded funnest and all-around best superhero films ever,4
1763,this movie is awesome the acting is great as i mentioned robert downey jr is tony stark and that's what it is,4
1764,iron man 3 beginning phase 2 is a great sequel to iron man and kicks as much shiny ass as the first one,4
1765,after having grown weary of these comic book movies because this changed the game,4
1766,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first ant-man,4
1767,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
1768,i loved that they introduce 3 new characters in this movie and this movie is another good edition to the franchise,4
1769,2 combines heartfelt emotion and fun humor to deliver one of marvel's better movies and far better than no,4
1770,i like that my grandsons enjoy this especially because it gives us another perspective of marvel films,4
1771,now iron man is a triumph of an action movie due to great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
1772,i love the humor even if there's not a lot of hulk smashing till the end,4
1773,the pace was a bit slow and the soundtrack was awful but other than that i'm cool with them being together,4
1774,having viewed it multiple times i can certify that iron man 2 isn't as good as age of ultron,4
1775,and of course there were the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy,4
1776,carries on the franchise and does a good job as the lead and easily one of the best superhero films,4
1777,not a big marvel fan but rdj does a great job capturing the unique and comical personality of tony stark,4
1778,almost every aspect worked and this film floored everyone including me and it was a lot of humour which the mcu likes to do,4
1779,the first twenty to twenty five minutes are a bit dry and boring but the movie overcomes her time and time again,4
1780,fantastic everything you'd want in an action comedy is here spider-man homecoming is not only one of the better origin stories,4
1781,it really focus on expanding the plot line of other characters which i thought was well handled for the most part neatly tied together,4
1782,probably one of my fav mcu movies loved everything about it but only wish there was more action,4
1783,he's a funny character who goes from a petty thief to an avenger,4
1784,janet is the assumed dead wife of hank pym michael douglas and hope van dyne evangeline lilly,4
1785,i believe the mcu is one of the highest standards set by marvel,4
1786,i have heard it was a good time for everyone,4
1787,a great edition to the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
1788,thoughtful but also bold iron man is the best comic book movies of all time,4
1789,when what we know is right that we attach ourselves to a new start that we look forward to,4
1790,the movie was able to deliver very well,4
1791,its funny and has great action to make it a more entertaining watch,4
1792,it was explored in the first film but not as dull as the second iron man movie is a decent movie,4
1793,it helps that paul rudd is one of my favourite comic movies ever made,4
1794,i will also add that it is one of the better of marvel films,4
1795,marvel still has fight left in it and i can't wait to watch the rest of phase 2,4
1796,i loved the first guardians and i didn't feel that there were many stakes in this movie,4
1797,it lacks a compelling motive for most of the scenes assumingly using a steadicam,4
1798,some people didn't think this was going to be the worst of the lot,4
1799,joss hulk lets you forgive and forget about the other hulk movies but this one is like the worst of the lot,4
1800,there's zero lag here everything has a purpose and the action sequences are rather crafted masterfully with a great amount of fun,4
1801,my highlight of the movie which is also really refreshing to see with the family and friends,4
1802,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the perfect portrayal of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
1803,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
1804,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
1805,avengers age of ultron is not quite as good as the first so they wanted to add twice the comedy,4
1806,paul rudd is class as always and michael pena is really funny and a great time at the movies this summer ãâ¢the avengersãâ¢,4
1807,its funny its full of action humour and heart,4
1808,by far one of the best of the iron man films,4
1809,it is the second best movie in the mcu in its own right,4
1810,they help this movie to feel like a well fleshed out and satisfying movie,4
1811,some critics say there is perhaps a little too much in terms of suspension of disbelief for the viewer,4
1812,infinity war is the culmination of phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe,4
1813,the action is good and downey jr's performance is the heart and soul of iron man and ac dc helps bring the heavy metal,4
1814,with a brilliant performance by robert downey jr was too much of a comedian he has to stop,4
1815,such an event takes place in iron man 2 wether it be whiplash or the dazzling effects,4
1816,iron man and the villain is not as compelling as its predecessor iron man 2 is an absolute blast,4
1817,while i loved every second of the avengers the truth is that it is a too big movie it never felt overstuffed just epic,4
1818,amazing start from the marvel universe with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
1819,the action was top notch and it's all around a very good and fun comic book movie,4
1820,i definitely like the back story of the character ant-man,4
1821,there are so many conveniences in the plot and throughout the film-are so exquisite the whole sequence feels novel,4
1822,it's like a test reel for avengers infinity war i started rewatching all the other marvel movies for maximum entertainment,4
1823,stellar comedy mixed with amazing special effects and just the right amount of comedy to make it a more entertaining watch,4
1824,it also helps that it's one of my favorite comic book movies,4
1825,though it might be the weakest mcu film in phase 3 so far,4
1826,there is just so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
1827,i highly recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a fan you'll enjoy this movie,4
1828,it doesn't quite meet the standard set by its predecessor but age of ultron is definitely not perfect,4
1829,i'm raving that iron man is the movie that started all,4
1830,a good deal better than iron man 2 but it came with some pretty solid films overall,4
1831,the film is overall really good and worthy of the avengers and we actually see that there is much more to him,4
1832,iran man is my younger son's favorite superhero and iron man 2 featuring mickey rourke entertainment was a guarantee,4
1833,however its emotional center clearly makes it one of the best superhero films totally worth your time,4
1834,the special effects were outstanding and it's the type of comedy that has force or cheesy jokes or nonsense,4
1835,what i didn't like the first one but i can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is,4
1836,however i feel that this honestly works better for the sake of having a love story,4
1837,jordan as eric killmonger is hands-down the best villain the mcu has ever seen in my opinion,4
1838,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
1839,i don't think it had to do with the infamous twist about 3 4 in,4
1840,i liked it a lot for me it was a very good focal point of the movie,4
1841,to this day it still remains one of funniest superhero movies ever and it still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
1842,funny good yet way darker than other mcu movies would be a stretch,4
1843,is awesome in this film in fact he has a lot of the film is just like the first one it was a great movie,4
1844,a little too busy and thats why i didn't give it five stars is because i think it needed more action,4
1845,marvel keeps doing what they do best great addition to the mcu although not presented as well as the first one but i like it,4
1846,a worthy follow-up to one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
1847,the latest fresh new addition to the marvel series that out does its predecessors,4
1848,it's not quite as strong as the first movie and they are going to win this war and recover the tryceraptus,4
1849,that isn't to say that the movie doesn't stop amp it's pretty surprising in a few spots,4
1850,while altogether riveting and suspenseful stark seems to be a fairly standard failing of the marvel series,4
1851,this is the end of the credits,4
1852,doesn't quite reach the highs of the original but fails at exceeding it with a waste of a great character,4
1853,the action was great with a lot of action and a solid storyline,4
1854,the fox version of quicksilver was a lot more pleased by this movie than i thought,4
1855,still love this movie it holds up well on the revisit,4
1856,the look into tony's psyche is interesting and well-structured plot with few flaws,4
1857,overall the film is my favourite mcu film and is easily one of the best character arcs in a superhero film,4
1858,iron man isn't perfect but as a hulk movie it is extremely fun and funny and action packed,4
1859,after having grown weary of these comic book movies because this changed the game,4
1860,the villain in this movie and this movie is fucking great,4
1861,black widow thor captain america and the rest of the film had plenty of glorious action and many funny scenes,4
1862,cinematography was great and the story was compelling,4
1863,it has the feel of a spider-man movie to date and one of the most anticipated films of the year,4
1864,the one let down is the fact that it's an mcu film that fans will definitely like and it's just as good,4
1865,i didn't love this film but it's still entertaining to watch,4
1866,great cast and a great story iron man 3 is another great marvel movie,4
1867,they give appropriate homage to ant-man and the wasp never feels bloated or too hyperkinetic,4
1868,great special effects and well shot action scenes make this a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
1869,the one part that was better than it had any right to be without feeling tied down by the franchise on the whole,4
1870,if this movie had a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a truly great story line,4
1871,too much was overwhelmingly confusing but i love the second half of the movie and the return of thanos,4
1872,one of the best films in the marvel cinematic universe and a big comeback performance for robert downey jr,4
1873,i personally really enjoyed this movie just like the first one is that they were few and timed perfectly,4
1874,with the recent announcement that downey will indeed be in the next movies making the most heartbreaking scenemeaningless,4
1875,really good film liked the chemistry between the characters in an opposite way,4
1876,we see his motives as a villain and understand why hes doing what hes doing,4
1877,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and great small scale effects,4
1878,whilst definitely not my favourite of the marvel cinematic universe and certainly holds up as one of if not the best spider-man film,4
1879,paul rudd fits into the mcu great cant wait for part 2,4
1880,it has great action sequences but unfortunately this movie has a lot of funny action packed dramatic and definitely memorable moments,4
1881,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a film that is not the case,4
1882,oh and also this movie is directed by joss whedon and zak penn,4
1883,the casting was great for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one,4
1884,kurt russell is great as evil dad ego and while the first movie made in a series of avengers all leading up to this moment,4
1885,jon favreau is the one to take credit for starting the now extremely popular marvel cinematic universe,4
1886,the phrase street level tends to be overused but i can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is,4
1887,my only regret with this film is ronan the accuser,4
1888,iron man's flaws are brought up and so are the special effects the soundtrack in this movie is awesome,4
1889,my only problem the relatability in this movie is awesome the acting is great the characters are great,4
1890,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
1891,and there's a lot of small things in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
1892,overall this is a great movie with their acting especially paul rudd as scott lang has been the best choice ever since,4
1893,let this be an example of how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
1894,it's a good summer movie it's so fun i promise you won't be sorry,4
1895,guardians of the galaxy is different from everything marvel has done and that's what this film really needed to nail,4
1896,the special effects were outstanding and it's the type of movie i could watch over and over again,4
1897,this has an excellent script and great performances from the whole cast especially robert downey jr,4
1898,the charisma of the cast is also stellar,4
1899,the ending will shock you but the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of avengers infinity war,4
1900,this is what a super-hero flick and this one is no different,4
1901,while not living up to the marvel name,4
1902,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone film amp builds more of the marvel universe,4
1903,it never gives you a dull moment and gives you all the more reason to be on board,4
1904,if you liked the first movie this movie is still a solid entry in the marvel universe,4
1905,it definitely seems better than the avengers but still avengers age of ultron is the latest installment of the entertaining masterpiece,4
1906,a fast paced fun wild enjoyable action movie that has one of the best villains in the entire mcu,4
1907,super-fun comic-book action movie with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
1908,but with two sets of spider-man that's actually in high school,4
1909,leading up to this so it was great to see the guardians back on the big screen,4
1910,judging by the ending of the movie it seems like there is going to be better than the original is still well worth viewing,4
1911,this is not the storyline of the age of ultron a very powerful sequel however there is some minor adjustment,4
1912,best thing about this marvel film is that it continues marvel's trend of uninteresting villains,4
1913,coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes iron man one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
1914,with the recent announcement that downey will indeed be in the next movies making the most heartbreaking scenemeaningless,4
1915,when the first avengers movie it is still a must see and if you're anything like me you'll laugh almost the entire movie,4
1916,that's precisely what iron man does and the result is an action-packed and a fun movie,4
1917,not as great as the first one but still a great movie to me,4
1918,it involves more story and characterization than one would expect from the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
1919,coming in as a sequel to one of the biggest and best surprise of the summer,4
1920,really good film liked the chemistry between the actors is among the best i've seen in awhile,4
1921,when it's time to finally see a sequel we all have been hearing about how amazing michael b,4
1922,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
1923,he was an idiot in civil war and still is in this movie but it has a good story so i liked it,4
1924,they did a phenomenal job juggling all the characters and the spectacular visuals compliment a fine but overstuffed story,4
1925,excellent acting performances by tom holland and michael keaton seriously nail the hero-villain complements,4
1926,and luckily the script is a whopping breath of fresh air is the creative visual style and character focused storytelling,4
1927,although the story is great it's not meant for me,4
1928,really good film liked the chemistry between the characters in an opposite way,4
1929,the quantum universe had one of the best movies in the entire series,4
1930,doesn't take itself as seriously as the first one but still is a lot of fun and looked like they enjoyed their rolls,4
1931,ant-man and the wasp is a great movie that builds upon the iron man series and also other marvel movies,4
1932,i see two parts of the avengers saga including tensions between the characters,4
1933,plus it's a great film with a good villain and adding the power stone into it,4
1934,its not as strong as the original but really stacks up to the hero,4
1935,probably the best of the iron man suit to escape and further combat terrorism,4
1936,it was not as good as the first one and the incredible hulk will pay off,4
1937,the action and cgi is bigger and better than ever but the story and visuals made up for it,4
1938,when what purpose we thought something's served turned out to be a widely entertaining and a very good film,4
1939,in many ways iron man 2 is still a great actor,4
1940,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best in the mcu that you want to see more,4
1941,i feel this movie showcased one of the best movie going experiences of my life,4
1942,the acting is top-tier from everyone in the movie looked liked they had a fun time watching it,4
1943,this is probably the reason that it was not as exciting as the first,4
1944,the biggest downfall of the movie is focused on stark developing the iron man suit but robert downey jr,4
1945,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned leeds and michael keaton as the vulture but he didn't have enough of was character development,4
1946,but where shane black's fingerprints shine through i really enjoyed myself in this movie and compromises were made,4
1947,and finally we have an iron man movie that just came out of theaters now,4
1948,the humor rises above that of the first and certainly among the best the marvel universe has seen up to this point,4
1949,the characters continue to be fun and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
1950,there is a scene during a car race that didn't feel important enough and was rushed through too quickly,4
1951,the first and best of the iron man suit it is pure perfection,4
1952,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
1953,again not as bombastic as the first iron man but it's great to know what was going on in the mcu infinity war,4
1954,if all this great comedy wasn't in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
1955,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
1956,laurence fishburne was a great addition to the holiday movie rotation,4
1957,however i feel that this honestly works better for the sake of having a love story,4
1958,a bit slower than other marvel films but i liked that and it was a nice low scale superhero movie,4
1959,my favourite action scene is the finale as well as the first one but still very good,4
1960,2 is a 2017 action adventure sci-fi superhero movie with funny and quirky characters and an interesting plot,4
1961,waaaayy better than the 2003 film but not as much as the winter soldier did if not more,4
1962,this version of spider-man movies that i watched,4
1963,wasn't the best marvel movie but it's just another marvel film,4
1964,to add loki is definitely one of the better comic book movies,4
1965,i love this movie in every way and the first one was great the second not quite so and this one is no different,4
1966,while the film is overall really good and worthy of the avengers and tony stark in future installments,4
1967,the third-best mcu movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
1968,also maybe it's just me but that part of the story chris prat is perfect,4
1969,a great tie-in to infinity war and it's a good movie and sequel,4
1970,but in all this movie was a breath of fresh air with a great cast fantastic plot and an unforgettable origin story,4
1971,a fun romp and nice addition to the marvel line-up,4
1972,despite the tech suit which was a bit bothering i would say it is still a great movie,4
1973,a great movie is a great addition to the mcu,4
1974,not too emotional like avengers infinity war and black panther i confirm this,4
1975,leave it to writer director shane black to deliver to us the perfect iron man and he will never be topped,4
1976,is it the best spider-man movie as they did in the first movie,4
1977,the incredible hulk iron man and the world is in peace,4
1978,i remember laughing and laughing about the concept of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
1979,that's not to say that the rest of the superhero films to come out this year,4
1980,he is an innocent kid as he should be and becomes in future films,4
1981,it's just a funny action-packed and hilarious movie,4
1982,all in all a worthy performance by robert downey jr and boy it does it not disappoint,4
1983,the guardians of the galaxy is a blast from the hilarious moments to the shocking credit scene,4
1984,the action is filmed so well and it is undoubtedly the best marvel movie but i't up there,4
1985,the plot was twice as good as the first one if that,4
1986,incredible not awesome the movie contains entertaining edge of your seat and the final we leave you speechless,4
1987,almost cough amazing spider-man and coming into his own,4
1988,this movie does a great job with things like the shots of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
1989,this movie could never live up to expectations along with that horrible accent,4
1990,overall this is a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
1991,the special effects are on point and the action is incredibly exciting,4
1992,overall this is easily one of the most anticipated superhero movies ever,4
1993,it is not as good as the first one but i loved it,4
1994,especially at the climax of the little mermaid,4
1995,josh brolin was the perfect casting choice for tony stark,4
1996,the film contains a couple of antagonists with each projecting a different level of reality because of a quantum linking,4
1997,it's story is very good and i love the dynamic with iron man,4
1998,iron man is the story of tony stark aka iron man still has significant issues,4
1999,probably one of the best superhero movie i've ever seen also being faithful to the source material,4
2000,i cant wait for ant man and the wasp never feels bloated or too hyperkinetic,4
2001,they then return in the third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
2002,while this is an important film to the overall story of the mcu not to mention the titular character,4
2003,killian is actualy my second favorite mcu movie and the only time you see him is sitting on a chair,4
2004,although it's nice that he was the hero of the movie,4
2005,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
2006,he was kind of predictable but for being the first film in my opinion age of ultron offers a better story and more action,4
2007,there is one small side plot that could have been in the movie a lot more funny,4
2008,i really liked it and i'm excited to see what was going to happen and learn more about all the characters,4
2009,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action keeps the movie going at a consistant pace,4
2010,going from a fun superhero adventure to a smart and well crafted superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
2011,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
2012,amazing soundtrack and marvel successfully made a talking racoon and tree one of my favourite because he is voiced by vin diesel,4
2013,lawrence fishburne was a great addition to the mcu and it delivers as much as you'd expect,4
2014,altogether iron man 2 is an absolute blast it may not have the thrill and charm of 1 but robert downing jr,4
2015,there's a good pace and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
2016,the american director and screenwriter presents one of the most relatable and realistic teenage superhero i have ever seen,4
2017,what a consistently entertaining and fun action movie with some great performances and awsome action along with one of the most entertaining superhero movies,4
2018,it's really really really really good i just wanted to to see more of both of them and second is i found michael b,4
2019,overall isn't it wild to think that this was the best marvel movie ant man surprised many of how good it was,4
2020,the best part of the film at all,4
2021,this is the end of the movie they become the guardians of the galaxy's plot and character development,4
2022,one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
2023,what i think is interesting about it is that it feels like a classic,4
2024,robert downey jr's performance is the heart and soul of iron man and his story arc,4
2025,will the price increase to save the galaxy from its destruction,4
2026,black widow is introduced in this film and despite the villain is not as interesting as in past spidey movies but homecoming still succeeds,4
2027,i enjoyed im 2 and 3 but the first is always the best,4
2028,he still manages to cause chaos though and real consequences for the avengers and guardians when it comes down to it,4
2029,does not beat the first one but still a hell of a film,4
2030,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
2031,the creation of the vision is very inspired and i love the way jarvis was used to created the vision,4
2032,it might not be the best mcu movie but that doesn't mean iron man 2 should suck,4
2033,i must say the movie was so much better than all of the others,4
2034,carries on the franchise and does a good job of representing the source material until then,4
2035,2 couldn't possibly be as good as the original but this is movie with what fans wanted to expect,4
2036,and the great action scenes it makes up for a disappointing lack of originality in terms of action and plot,4
2037,great job marvel and i can't wait for the next one,4
2038,this movie has everything it needs to be has one of the most memorable movies in marvel's entire library,4
2039,one of the best reasons to see iron man captain america thor hulk etc,4
2040,7 10 points go to the writing category,4
2041,almost all the comic book movies this is a must see for any marvel fan,4
2042,a movie so fun that it's visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
2043,good marvel movie and one of the better films in the marvel cinematic universe that has become so insanely huge as of late,4
2044,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
2045,after the better part of three hours i left the theater feeling a little like this movie could have been a bit better,4
2046,the action was specatcular and i thought it was better than iron man even,4
2047,a great setting and cast of characters are funny and charming,4
2048,this film was refreshing to watch because the spiderman in this film is an excellent reboot of the ultimate marvel hero,4
2049,homecoming is an appropriate title for the film in a number of funny moments and a new worthy superhero,4
2050,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
2051,it provides excellent entertainment from the moment you sit down to watch a marvel movie,4
2052,it was fast-paced action-packed enjoyable movie with great depth to the main figure advertised,4
2053,a fantastic addition to the superhero genre but it works nonetheless,4
2054,the story however is not as great as the first avengers movie set a ridiculously high bar for the superhero genre,4
2055,holland already shows plenty of confidence in the role and one of the most influential and important movies of all time,4
2056,this was a great movie that might not be as pretty as the first but still pretty great,4
2057,if marvel keeps making movies this fun all of the other marvel films he doesn't grow too much and is sidelined repeatedly,4
2058,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,4
2059,i really liked the beginning of the end of the film that is essentially a mind game between loki and the heroes,4
2060,i loved pretty much every spider-man movie i've seen in the mcu is great,4
2061,and although the story is great and the effects are a total explosive,4
2062,definitely worth a watch even if it's not as fresh the original but works in its own way,4
2063,not as good as the original but with the fantastic performances from the whole cast who all do an amazing job with their roles,4
2064,it was explored in the first film and the action is incredibly exciting,4
2065,this is my only problem with the film is one the boring villain,4
2066,the story was great and the story was a good spider-man movie because it is tied in with the marvel cinematic universe,4
2067,the battles are epic and keep you on the edge of your seat thriller to the very end with a cast of likable characters,4
2068,78%iron man 2 has all the thrills and humour you know expect from a marvel movie ever,4
2069,was at his best if you love action and superheroes you need to see this from a lot of my friends,4
2070,one of the best actors out there but i was afraid that ant-man did it,4
2071,some people said this movie was too much but i would have liked to see him get another movie,4
2072,the action scenes are really cool and all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
2073,the introduction of paul rudd's ant-man to steal the yellowjacket suit from his old protege darren cross corey stoll,4
2074,blue sky stuck in my head for the first 40 minutes,4
2075,bradley cooper and vin diesel are hilarious too bad they are not as good as avengers 1 but still a great movie,4
2076,and of course i would be in remiss if i didn't have to sit through another 2,4
2077,the only marvel movie with a good villain despite what people say and wonderful additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
2078,i see this being one of the best movies too,4
2079,gotg is still arguably one of the better marvel movies but at the same time,4
2080,an entertaining addition to the mcu it doesn't quite have the focus or pacing to match up with its predecessor,4
2081,if i had a complaint it's a tad too long but it is still iron man and rdj is still brilliant in his performance,4
2082,a bit too crazy and didn't live up to the standards of it's predecessor it enhances it,4
2083,although not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far,4
2084,spider-man homecoming does two things no other spider-man movies but still really good,4
2085,it is a brilliant film and really fives us all a taste of what is to come in the marvel cinematic universe,4
2086,never reading the comics you still get what you need to know about the character and it would be perfect,4
2087,fantastic comedy great action and some top humour,4
2088,the only thing that's negative about this movie is the most amazing spider-man,4
2089,all together black panther is a strong film and one of the most surprising treats of marvel's recent releases,4
2090,guardians of the galaxy has got to be one of marvel's most important heroes moving forward,4
2091,78 100 ant-man is the first live-action spider-man movie comes out,4
2092,jordan as killmonger who is one of the most fun you'll have at the movies,4
2093,it matches that he has a great antagonist,4
2094,however a better way to describe spider-man's suit malfunctioning resulting in him constantly changing sizes involuntarily,4
2095,to me the focus of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier,4
2096,definitely my top movie for the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe in total begins here and what a excellent beginning it was,4
2097,he gets nice support from the rest of all marvel superheroes,4
2098,by far the funniest marvel movie to date yes even over the avengers a great movie for any occasion,4
2099,well maybe not if you already read the comic books i was a little worried about the reliance on cheesy comedy,4
2100,i think this was not as good as the first and third films in franchise,4
2101,i thought ed norton did a great job developing spider-man's role in things,4
2102,one of the more action packed marvel films in recent years antman stood out as one that i was keen to see,4
2103,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of the most highly anticipated movies ever,4
2104,the amount of depth and precision in story making for this film is a blast from the hilarious moments to the shocking credit scene,4
2105,the downside is that he really isn't in the movie it somehow makes use of just about all of them,4
2106,you have to remember that this movie came out i had my doubts,4
2107,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character were nothing short of amazing see what i did there,4
2108,all the actors in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
2109,went deeper into some of the characters and the dramatic depth,4
2110,sure some of the action and comedy,4
2111,this was a very fun addition the the mcu and a great entry into the mcu in 2008 is a work of art,4
2112,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best mcu films to date,4
2113,makes for a great tony stark and this movie also had so much heart and humor,4
2114,that's actually a downside to the film without giving too much away his last on-screen appearance was a very good marvel movie,4
2115,its still not perfect as loki seemed detached and lonely when it came to a cohesive long-running cinematic universe,4
2116,if this is the iron man 2 of said phase for those not in the know a rogue a,4
2117,i love iron man captain america thor etc,4
2118,i was surprised i thought this movie did many things right i thought it was brilliant but they was a lot of fun,4
2119,hopefully after avengers infinity war we will see spider-man in the shadow of the larger world of heroes namely the avengers,4
2120,interesting twist in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
2121,it's really really really really good i just wanted to to see more of in the mcu,4
2122,the biggest issue with number 2 was that the film didn't work out the potential well,4
2123,very good movie but not as good as the first but still enjoyable,4
2124,also there is a left-field romance that doesn't quite have the focus or pacing to match up with its predecessor,4
2125,not as good as the first one but still is a lot of fun to watch,4
2126,it helps that paul rudd is one of my favorite things about this story is the character growth,4
2127,this avengers movie has to be one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
2128,the film that kicked off the marvel cinematic universe it's also one of the mcu's strongest most unique outings,4
2129,for a superhero movie ever turns out to be one of mcu's best yet,4
2130,this was the best marvel movie by far,4
2131,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
2132,as with other marvel films there is quite a bit of fun but is it better than the first avengers,4
2133,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and i don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore,4
2134,as with every other marvel studios film pacing tone plot special effects and action are typically top notch the story leaves alot to be desired,4
2135,if an audience is supposed to be the super villain,4
2136,i like that my grandsons enjoy this especially because it gives us another perspective of marvel films,4
2137,also finally seeing these characters on screen together is just an all around terrific film that brought the team together in excellent fashion,4
2138,iron man isn't perfect but it has great characters and visuals and action scenes,4
2139,some great action scene's with some really good execution to thoroughly make a great comic book flick,4
2140,it wasn't as great as the first one but is still really good,4
2141,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of action and a solid storyline,4
2142,very fun superhero film with the biggest comeback in recent memory that utilizes its soundtrack so creatively,4
2143,my only real complaint with this movie is the collaboration of robert downey jr and more tony stark and cool it with the yeah,4
2144,the avengers does have the upper hand but age of ultron still manages to entertain and deliver exactly what audiences may have expected,4
2145,and if you know what it is it's the most momentous picture of the mcu,4
2146,being an exciting and fun installment for the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half,4
2147,the rest of the movie was a dumb popcorn fun entertainment,4
2148,in this film it is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble,4
2149,does not beat the first one but definitely a fantastic movie,4
2150,having viewed it multiple times i can certify that iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor in virtually every way,4
2151,i like that my grandsons enjoy this especially because it gives us another perspective of marvel films,4
2152,there was no real proper build up to it and it was so much fun,4
2153,was perfect and born for the role of james rhodey rhodes and the relationship between tony stark and pepper pots,4
2154,it's not my favorite mcu film but it is part of the mcu,4
2155,although regarded the weakest in the series but it is still an avengers film,4
2156,i thought pepper potts was a little annoying in iron man 2 and improves on it,4
2157,the script is very carefully written the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy,4
2158,not as amazing as the first one didn't have those problems,4
2159,and the drama in this film is awesome it's like star wars mixed with the avengers with more humor,4
2160,ant-man and the wasp is one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
2161,although i had a headache afterwards i very much enjoyed the mix of action and comedy,4
2162,still it is one of them but it is the one that remembers the primary rationale for spidey love he's a kid,4
2163,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this one as it has great actors fresh story line and a killer soundtrack,4
2164,the movie follows the story of the character ant-man,4
2165,gives us one of the best spider-man interpretation yet,4
2166,overall it has a lot of the scenes seem more like fan service instead of trying to be a hero,4
2167,the storyline is well cut and the special effects are outstanding any scene in outer space is so colorful,4
2168,there's been so many mcu films now that it's hard to make a movie out of a superhero's vulnerability self-doubts,4
2169,with a great comeback performance by robert downey jr is a promising start to the marvel cinematic universe,4
2170,the cast's were great on their roles tom holland was the best choice for the part there could have been,4
2171,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air to the spider-man legacy,4
2172,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
2173,another great addition to the spider-man movies behind us it's hard to expand on the already huge universe that began with ironman,4
2174,this isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't a sequel to the 2003 hulk like some people say it is,4
2175,score 9plot it's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
2176,should have been the wasp and ant-man would be this awesome,4
2177,i highly recommend this film to anyone who really wants to have some fun and relax,4
2178,guardians of the galaxy definitely managed to do it this is still the best mcu villian and he just made this movie awsome,4
2179,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that can be appreciated by anyone,4
2180,action packed sequel with humour almost as good as the original i encourage you to rewatch it,4
2181,before this movie came out i had my doubts but it turned out to be one of the film's overabundance of characters,4
2182,without downy jr i am not sure where they go now,4
2183,the first and best of the iron man trilogy off on a high note,4
2184,great addition to the mcu which is no easy feat and of course iron man is one of the best lower scale superhero movies today,4
2185,everything balanced out into one of the best comic films i've seen in the past to this date and robert downey jr,4
2186,the incredible hulk is a fine example of a comic book movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
2187,iron man 3 improves upon it's predecessor it enhances it,4
2188,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man homecoming caught me off guard,4
2189,my favorite one out of all the marvel superhero movies this is a must see for anyone in the galaxy,4
2190,plus it's great that the marvel films are good this is no exception,4
2191,ant-man didn't live up to the standards set by the first movie but still fun to watch,4
2192,i really enjoy evangeline lilly as the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
2193,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
2194,almost every aspect worked and this film floored everyone including me and it was a lot better than i thought it would be comforting,4
2195,the plot is very simple and thus it's not the greatest superhero film of all time,4
2196,at the end of the film that is a 4 5 very good,4
2197,the special effects are on point and the action is incredibly exciting,4
2198,whedon knows how to direct a superhero movie,4
2199,i think those who've seen infinity war,4
2200,iron man is still one of the best spider-man films,4
2201,downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't ever seen in a marvel movie,4
2202,in my opinion i would have to say that it really rocks,4
2203,the story is excellent joss whedon and the acting is nice and great effects,4
2204,fun funny and action-filled and sci-fi presenting one of marvel's best movies and definitely better than the avengers,4
2205,and i thought it was going to play out,4
2206,and though the first 30 mins were slow in introduction of a new actor to play bruce banner the hulks alter ego,4
2207,still holds up as one of if not my favorite film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
2208,when genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man and he does a good job all around,4
2209,this avengers movie has to be one of the funniest comic book films i've seen in a marvel film,4
2210,the timeliness of the movie it seems like there is going to be better than tasm,4
2211,during this time a villain called the mandarin played by ben kingsley who was great by the way is the most adorable thing,4
2212,when it comes to enjoying a movie it is executed so well that the faults concerning character development are ultimately dismissible,4
2213,the latest fresh new addition to the marvel cinematic universe yet yes even if i do not agree,4
2214,it was a fun action-packed adventure,4
2215,insanely boring if you haven't seen it,4
2216,what i've taken from this movie is that the villain isn't explored nearly enough but the story really works,4
2217,overall marvel's first film into a cinematic franchise is also one of my top five favorite marvel movies has funny dialogue and great action,4
2218,when they finally land the ship in the middle of the movie and not make us wait 10 minutes through credits,4
2219,the actors in this movie are constant throughout the film and i can't wait for more,4
2220,was not expecting it to especially with drax and most especially yandu,4
2221,that's actually a downside to the film without giving too much away his last on-screen appearance was a very good marvel movie,4
2222,i definitely recommend the movie and i can say i was wrong,4
2223,i'd definitely watch it again and again,4
2224,one of the funniest films i've ever seen in a motion picture,4
2225,other than that this movie was really entertaining,4
2226,funny and not predictable as i would have liked the movie better,4
2227,in conclusion black panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of supporting characters such as ned who doesn't love ned,4
2228,really good film liked the chemistry between the characters in an opposite way,4
2229,nonetheless iron man is a great movie gripping interesting and thrilling,4
2230,this was by far the best spider-man movie because it is tied in with the rest of the universe,4
2231,good but non as memorable as the other mcu movies don't have which i think makes the mcu look weird,4
2232,but it doesn't slow the film down the action is great the music is great with on point acting and a fantastic story,4
2233,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't feel like anslapped together sequel at all,4
2234,it's good that they can still make great stories behind this wonderful hero,4
2235,jon favreau is the one to take credit for starting the now extremely popular marvel cinematic universe,4
2236,good story good special effects good action great characters and a good story arc with a believable dose of character growth,4
2237,this made me excited for the future of iron man and ac dc helps bring the heavy metal,4
2238,hands down the best in the series iron man is a movie to see no matter your familiarity with marvel,4
2239,the movie is fantastic and makes you want to rush back to see it the very next day,4
2240,a worthy follow-up and a pretty good addition to the marvel cinematic universe a fantastic start,4
2241,great soundtrack and easily some of the best cgi i have ever seen and also one of the mcu's best,4
2242,ant-man and the wasp is a fun superhero flick filled with fun sequences good performances and an entertaining ride,4
2243,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow which just gives you all the thrills that you expect from superhero movie,4
2244,it is a swell film in the marvel cinematic universe and one of the greatest comic book adaptions ever,4
2245,iron man is a big renaissance for the marvel universe and it remains a great time to this day,4
2246,while this was a fairly disappointing sequel but it is still an avengers film,4
2247,this movie is to be the best spider-man movie,4
2248,i am happy to say that the rest isn't good,4
2249,well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is a common negative among marvel movies the villain,4
2250,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
2251,director james gunn does a fantastic job as the main villain emil blonsky,4
2252,the script is very well crafted and a perfect end to the iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
2253,overall i had a fun time making it,4
2254,this movie has some unnecessary scenes and sequences it was nice to finally see hulkbuster in film,4
2255,the rare sequel that is just as good as the sam raimi trilogy to appreciate homecoming for what it is,4
2256,keaton brings a strong villain performance but like all the other marvel films the action scenes are really cool and all of the characters,4
2257,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a specific area or else the game will not detect it,4
2258,on top of that he puts up a hell of a way to start the mcu,4
2259,volume 2 follows the same recipe as the first movie but to the next level,4
2260,wow a sequel better than the original film which honestly once again didn't really work out,4
2261,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it was nice to see a comic book movie,4
2262,michael rooker's character yondu plays a more pivotal role in this film and the interactions between them and iron man are full of chemistry,4
2263,great characters and decent story with amazing visuals make this the best of the iron man films i'd choose this one,4
2264,for me i think the middle part of the film and make it more mainstream,4
2265,it's not completely perfect but in a way that hurts rather than helping the story,4
2266,overall ant-man is an incredibly enjoyable film with two great leads some great side characters and a good story,4
2267,i really didn't see coming at all,4
2268,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the group as the fast-talking racoon-genius,4
2269,the performance is great and the visual effects pop,4
2270,it is almost a shame that this is the best marvel film period,4
2271,one area where iron man 2 is still a solid movie with fun and action and surprises,4
2272,with tom holland as the best spider-man movies especially since the amazing spider-man,4
2273,there is a scene during a car race that didn't feel important enough and was rushed through too quickly,4
2274,i mean if you want to understand you need to watch this film,4
2275,i still think the original spider-man story we have all deserved,4
2276,while iron man 3 is a surprisingly well made and satisfying addition to the mcu which is no easy feat,4
2277,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
2278,no i do not think this is the less remembered movie in the mcu in its own right,4
2279,michael douglas was fantastic as hank pym it was nice to see a return to form for the web slinger,4
2280,i don't think this film would be marvel's first failure,4
2281,great job marvel and i can't really differentiate them anymore,4
2282,great film and a noble attempt at matching the first avengers film but it's up there,4
2283,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the main reasons i wanted to see more of the cap falcon and black widow,4
2284,now it's time to finally see a sequel we all have been hearing about how amazing michael b,4
2285,that is until one of their most fascinating stories fully realized characters stunning action and great performances from the amazing actors,4
2286,while he's once again a star evangeline lilly hope van dyne the wasp who is also the wife of hank pym,4
2287,overall marvel's the avengers is the one of the best super-hero movies is through humour,4
2288,i knew he was a questionable character but a surprise i did not see the original film before watching this one which i regret now,4
2289,probably the best of the mcu the action is great and so are the captain's,4
2290,the action is typical marvel which is as good as the first really funny lots of action see its a good sequel,4
2291,a cool movie not as good as iron man 1,4
2292,a wonderfully fresh take on the superhero genre iron man is one of marvel's riskiest projects and it is a great movie,4
2293,i feel like they didn't go overboard with iron man,4
2294,well-written well-cast well-acted and one of the best villains put to screen in an mcu film,4
2295,we still haven't gotten to my favorite mcu movie ant-man because i loved this one so much,4
2296,doesn't change that this film is about as good as the first but still has an awesome edge to it,4
2297,the side characters are some of the best visuals i've ever seen in a marvel film,4
2298,the actions scenes in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
2299,one of the biggest and best surprises of 2014 guardians of the galaxy is the funniest marvel movie to date,4
2300,when i first saw this movie but it was really good,4
2301,the graphics are unbelievable and the story is overall engaging and nicely crafted,4
2302,it's not as good as the sam raimi trilogy to appreciate homecoming for what it is,4
2303,re-watching this one is still a lot of funny action packed dramatic and definitely memorable moments,4
2304,the quantum universe had one of the best movies superhero of all time,4
2305,the best part is that he was one of the classic aspects of the movie,4
2306,successfully pulls of adapting one of marvel's best and funniest films to date,4
2307,the action is good and downey jr's performance is the heart and soul of the film,4
2308,this is the spider man movie we have been waiting for we expect it to be this good,4
2309,one thing that homecoming does better than the last one i'll promise you that1,4
2310,easily becoming the best spiderman on screen as well as some other government guy he punches,4
2311,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
2312,went deeper into some of the characters but the film is supported by great actors and a story that is utterly unpredictable,4
2313,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
2314,now that being said its insane that about three quarters of the movie was a bit choppy the movie has great action and comedy,4
2315,what more can you ask in the very first scene and it's actually pretty brutal,4
2316,if you're not a marvel fan then go see it right now,4
2317,but it's one of the best spider-man films as well,4
2318,i wasnt expecting to like the movie as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
2319,definitely one of the more heartfelt and funnier comic book movies i've seen in a long long time,4
2320,a good deal better than iron man 2 but it came with some pretty solid films overall,4
2321,jackson maria hill cobie smulders to random world war ii vets i can guess are friends of captain america etc,4
2322,holland already shows plenty of confidence in the role and captures teenage peter parker well,4
2323,funny addition to the marvel universe at large,4
2324,by turns hilarious and breath-taking this has a good amount of time to be developed,4
2325,it provides excellent entertainment from the moment you sit down to watch a marvel movie,4
2326,they give appropriate homage to ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
2327,other great songs added to this list are hooked on a feeling i want you back and etc,4
2328,this is the best marvel movie ever made,4
2329,they give appropriate homage to ant-man is a baller movie,4
2330,the creation of the vision is very inspired and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
2331,edward norton was perfect as was liv tyler tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
2332,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-big-scale no pun intended and benefits from it,4
2333,a standard marvel movie with a good twist,4
2334,thrilling ambitious and emotionally resonant black panther is a fun and exciting plot,4
2335,ultron is not lame but he's not the only great actor jeff bridges is really good as pepper potts and she's very likeable,4
2336,the original and new characters are on point and make the movie very enjoyable,4
2337,i really had no desire to see this movie after watching the trailer and this movie exceeded expectations,4
2338,the closest to auteur cinema the marvel cinematic universe which viewers are treasuring these many years later,4
2339,certainly entertaining for all ages you can't help but want to see the edgar wright version of it though,4
2340,but beware you should know the other marvel movies of late and that's not easy to do especially in 2014,4
2341,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the disposable villains in the mcu,4
2342,while i agree the film focuses a bit too much for my taste but still a thrilling marvel movie,4
2343,unfortunately the plot is a little predictable and cliche but it's still very enjoyable and laughable,4
2344,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
2345,this is a must watch for marvel fans,4
2346,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
2347,count ant-man as one of the best superhero origin movies,4
2348,tom holland is great and i would love to be the hulk but that's just it,4
2349,evangeline lilly was great but i don't know why many people on here are calling this one a disservice,4
2350,now in my opinion this is the most personal iron man film to date,4
2351,the action is filmed so well and it is a much better movie than most people give it credit for,4
2352,spider-man homecoming injects new life into the character and it has never been more apparently than it is here,4
2353,spider-man homecoming is a very energetic fast pace movie,4
2354,for me i think the middle part of the film is the villain unfortunately,4
2355,i just caught this film again and i must admit it does dwindle near the end,4
2356,and the villain is an over-the-top mediocrity but the characters are interesting and complex the action scenes are great as well,4
2357,tom holland develops great chemistry with robert downey jr is a promising start to the marvel cinematic universe,4
2358,also i know i said pepper potts was a more annoying in this one but it doesn't bother me too much,4
2359,visions aka jarvis was amazing and i'm glad that i didn't care to be honest,4
2360,i mean literally beautiful so much eye popping visuals the story is a little too over reliant on its digital imagery,4
2361,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
2362,i'll be the first to admit that most of the good lines but michael pena is right behind,4
2363,ant-man may not be as good as the first one but a worthy sequel,4
2364,in my opinion iron man was a great start to an amazing franchise,4
2365,not to bring about a spoiler alert there are a few weak entries but i don't know,4
2366,so charming i can't help but laugh at it,4
2367,i thought it was brilliant but they was a lot of fun this lethal iron weapon,4
2368,is great as tony stark iron man and he does a really good job,4
2369,the action is great and the visual effects pop,4
2370,after joss's marvellous debut yes i went there age of ultron was quite a bit of fun shouldnt factor into it,4
2371,strong superhero movie with creative action scenes and a villain that steals the show in this,4
2372,i hope the character will emerge from the shadow of the larger world of heroes namely the avengers,4
2373,anyway despite this essentially being more of the same and left entertained and happy,4
2374,this is a must watch for marvel fans,4
2375,rewatchable fun with a great story line,4
2376,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a pretty light tone and nothing really dark happens,4
2377,a bit slower than other marvel films but i liked that and it was a interesting take on the franchise,4
2378,josh brolin was the perfect casting choice for tony stark,4
2379,the characters are decent there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
2380,92 % not only is guardians of the galaxy or ant-man-the-wasp,4
2381,found it was a little long and the final battle between scott lang ant-man,4
2382,my only complaint was that there was too much disney involved and not quite enough iron man action for my tastes,4
2383,i like the new spiderman i still found it to be entertaining and a good marvel movie,4
2384,after you are done with the sword you are told to hit a wooden person learning the basic moves like side slash,4
2385,the action and cgi is bigger and better than ever but the story and visuals made up for it easily,4
2386,the main downside to this film is one of my favorite things about this story is the character growth,4
2387,i also like the fact that it's an incredibly solid film and is easily in my top 3 favorite mcu villains,4
2388,i like to think this is better than any spider-man film made yet,4
2389,for starters the tone of this movie is that peter parker is way too reliant on tony stark,4
2390,now iron man is a visually stunning movie and has great action sequences but unfortunately this movie has a good villain,4
2391,but the thing that stands out the most for me is the last hour and a half of the film,4
2392,keaton is keating which is a good thing because robert downy jr is amazing,4
2393,i thought it was well structured i was invested in the characters and doesn't lose them until the closing credits are rolling,4
2394,spider-man homecoming is a phenomenal film that is a slight inconvenience to our dynamic duo,4
2395,i watched this movie and it is even pretty good,4
2396,basically every hero in the marvel universe along with iron man,4
2397,one more negative is that i didn't care for maya hansen played by rebecca hall,4
2398,but this spider-man is supposed to be protected or destroyed if he has to so that thanos can't retrieve the soul stone,4
2399,i just went back and watched the original avengers film and it is still a must see and pure entertainment,4
2400,this is my favorite iron man movie but still check it out,4
2401,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
2402,not too emotional like avengers infinity war and black panther i confirm this,4
2403,overall i really enjoyed this movie not my favorite iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
2404,probably the best decision they made in this movie however there were a few pacing issues,4
2405,the fight scene between ant-man and the wasp provides a much more light-hearted and fun to watch for all ages,4
2406,the only notable song has got to be one of the film's biggest strength is it never feels world ending,4
2407,great origins story of iron man true to the comics introducing new characters into the mcu and one that was better than the first one,4
2408,probably the best decision they made in this movie however there were a few downsides to it,4
2409,is hilarious as iron man and he was just really comedic,4
2410,i'm glad i didn't see coming at all,4
2411,overall avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel to one of the most original superhero origin stories ever put on the big screen,4
2412,most people told me it was the best action in any movie ever,4
2413,but it was a great way to kick off a billion dollar franchise,4
2414,this proves to be an overall strong introduction to one of marvel's best and that was already a high bar,4
2415,the subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between ant-man and yellow jacket incorporated some very impressive cgi,4
2416,i thought however that the soul stone not being shown in the movie is almost lazy the performances jokes and story make up for it,4
2417,another great marvel film but this avengers movie was not as good as the first one but this one pleasantly surprised me,4
2418,he is an innocent kid as he should be and becomes in future films,4
2419,good action and special effects are pretty good the characters are likeable and the action is a little lighter and more fun,4
2420,the third act felt pretty rushed but overall i had a great time and i can't wait for the sequel to this,4
2421,one conflict of the plot the writers especially utilize is ant-man has evolved into a heist movie and takes the leap perfectly,4
2422,it's definitely not the best movie in the avengers universe,4
2423,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy spider-man black panther doctor strange,4
2424,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be him being aided by tony stark his friend knows his secret,4
2425,perfectly balance heart humor and action to give us one of the most jolly and fun-filled humbled and relaxed,4
2426,how can you make a sequel as fresh as the first guardians is a difficult feat and in many senses vol,4
2427,any fan of marvel should see this movie because it has a better grip on the pacing and delivers stronger action scenes,4
2428,i loved this movie but it was really good,4
2429,probably the best spider-man film we deserve,4
2430,you'll expect the same level of the starter original,4
2431,there are so many standout performances and the blend of comedy action and sci-fi presenting one of marvel's best films,4
2432,some of the major flaws are keeping me from saying that this is the threat the avengers are facing against,4
2433,fun really is the one and only best word to describe this action-packed adventure with some laughs along the way,4
2434,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
2435,i cant wait to see more of our villain whom we've never seen in any superhero film,4
2436,and yes it's not as grand or filled to the brim with technology that made my eyes and mind dazzle,4
2437,is the perfect iron man as well as the first movie,4
2438,the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of comedy to make it a more entertaining watch,4
2439,rudd does a great job of rejuvenating him,4
2440,the most exciting part for me is the last hour and a half of the film,4
2441,its a great summer movie and a lot of great action scenes with some unique special effects,4
2442,enjoyable but not as good as the first but still good,4
2443,i cant wait to see more of the cap falcon and black widow,4
2444,the avengers is a great film with great people in it,4
2445,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
2446,the man manages to just keep up the fight in iron man 2 wether it be whiplash or the dazzling effects,4
2447,the action is good and downey jr's performance as tony stark proves that,4
2448,this was a great superhero movie but a great movie nonetheless,4
2449,the incredible hulk is better than its predecessor and that makes the story all the more compelling,4
2450,looking back age of ultron does more than improve upon it's predecessor it contains an epic villain the abomination,4
2451,the avengers are back and ready to take on the hulk pre-abomination,4
2452,the four main cast members form a perfect union and one of the best comic book movie since guardians of the galaxy vol,4
2453,while perhaps given a bit too much time might've been spent on him,4
2454,so charming i can't help but laugh at it,4
2455,rarely do i ever suggest seeing anything but the original where it all started and its just classy superhero fun,4
2456,spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
2457,michael douglas was fantastic as hank pym it was nice to finally see hulkbuster in film,4
2458,he makes mistakes has setbacks but in the end you feel for the little guy,4
2459,this film isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
2460,the acting action and cgi are all incredible the story is simple yet it works perfectly for this younger high school spider man,4
2461,can't wait for ant-man more than makes up for it,4
2462,so age of ultron is a great time at the movies this summer ãâ¢the avengersãâ¢,4
2463,is it a fun action-packed and supper funny,4
2464,i think those who've seen every film in the marvel cinematic universe in general which has been around for eight years now,4
2465,not quite as good as its predecessor but the pacing is eh and the there is way to much shacky cam,4
2466,this is the best film of all the films the question was could such an ambitious feat succeed,4
2467,the actors bring life to the characters but the film is supported by great actors and a story that is utterly unpredictable,4
2468,director jon favreau gives us one of the best action put into any marvel film alongside robert downey jr,4
2469,visually stunning and an enjoyable ride guardians of the galaxy 2 is less empire strikes back and more age of ultron,4
2470,a mind-blowing successful sequel to the first avengers movie which contrary to popular belief is better than avengers infinity war,4
2471,2 may not be as well made as previous marvel installments but the incredible hulk is still an exciting entry from marvel,4
2472,iron man is back to the iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
2473,let's face it if the weakest phase 3 film is guardians of the galaxy is marvel studios at both their weirdest and most fun,4
2474,the action is awesome some of the best visuals i've ever seen in a marvel film,4
2475,it's not as good as the first but still a great fun action movie about family,4
2476,awesome action sequences a detestable villain everything you'd ever want in a comic book movie fan i enjoyed this movie thoroughly,4
2477,really good film liked the chemistry between the characters and each person gets their time to shine,4
2478,also the fact that all this is now tied in with the marvel cinematic universe starts off with a bang with iron man,4
2479,and i loved seeing edward norton as bruce banner and tim roth as the villainous emil blonsky,4
2480,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first iron man but still feels fresh,4
2481,not a bad movie but the ending was meh not enough action it felt like it should have been handled better,4
2482,i love the chemistry between all the actors is among the best of the mcu so far,4
2483,it's a perfect fit into the mcu and making a strong social statement,4
2484,the good it is more of the same and left entertained and happy,4
2485,hands down the best marvel film i've seen and it is one of the best comic book villain of all time,4
2486,the only problem is the character of hope,4
2487,gives us one of the first and unquestionably second iron man but still fun,4
2488,and then there's the lynchpin to the whole movie and the twist at the end,4
2489,either way pretty good movie but i like the avengers defines the comic book movie,4
2490,but i felt it's not as good as you remember but better still than you might expect,4
2491,without many mistakes these risks have paid off for the most part the mcu has done to date,4
2492,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to play spiderman that i have seen,4
2493,it is not as good as the first but still good,4
2494,initializing the clean slate protocol in the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
2495,there's also plenty of subtext for the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
2496,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a great intense action movie and also a funny feel good comedy sometimes,4
2497,my only problem with the film is one the boring villain,4
2498,although there could've been more action the avengers is one of the best structured villains since darth vader,4
2499,you just got ta love a good story with some really good execution to thoroughly make a great comic book movie,4
2500,overall the film is my favourite mcu film and is easily one of my favourite sagas awesome action and downey was born to play lang,4
2501,director james gunn does an amazing job directing a film about heroes and villains and the grey areas in between,4
2502,when genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
2503,the bad the pacing was slow in spots even though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
2504,finally another good spider-man movie because it is tied in with the rest of the cast are great,4
2505,the right movie at the right time to play this role infact the whole cast made me laugh with tears in my eyes,4
2506,a film designed for everyone to have a good time and the jokes almost always hit,4
2507,also one of the greatest superhero films of all time and is just great fun to watch,4
2508,rdj does a great job as spidey,4
2509,but the big thing is that all the action scenes were colorful and visually appealing,4
2510,after having grown weary of these comic book movies because this changed the game,4
2511,it manages to deliver the great action scenes and the one liners are killer's,4
2512,the vision is a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
2513,in closing although captain america winter soldier was a great spy film starring superheroes ant-man is both entertaining and hilarious,4
2514,the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't need to distract from anything,4
2515,luis and his crew were likable for being comic relief but that's about it which is not what i look for in a movie,4
2516,best thing about this movie and all the other rappers and singers do an amazing job too,4
2517,really solid and fun action movie with some great special effects,4
2518,spider-man homecoming is that it doesn't take up much screen time,4
2519,i really liked the characters but i feel like they should have stuck with that from the comics,4
2520,it's not quite the best spider-man we've seen yet,4
2521,paul rudd gives a sweet performance as the lead and is one of the best villains the mcu has had,4
2522,i wasn't expecting much from this movie but i am so glad i watched it,4
2523,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between but there still there,4
2524,blue sky by elo via star-lord's or peter qill's back story,4
2525,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it's one of his better aperrances,4
2526,as such age of ultron was going to be twice as exciting as its predecessor but the pacing is a lot better,4
2527,not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far,4
2528,in the same way i think winter soldier was a more deeply symbolic story with the most impact on the mcu,4
2529,my entire family really enjoyed this film and i look forward to seeing black panther in future mcu films,4
2530,the original and new characters are on point and make the movie very enjoyable,4
2531,however the second half of the film doesn't become predictable,4
2532,once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
2533,tony stark as played by robert downey jr and boy it does it not disappoint,4
2534,michael keaton is awesome and overall it's just a good film,4
2535,it's good movie to watch but i wouldn't dream of taking her to see tdkr,4
2536,the relationship between peter parker and mary jane in spider-man 1 amp 2overall a 9,4
2537,since he didn't get enough time in the first one and now the sequel as well,4
2538,but what was even more incredible to me is that everyone in this film was bland and his fake russian accent didn't help,4
2539,it has a lot of competition but i think this is up there for me as one of the best,4
2540,not the best of the mcu it's still a highly entertaining accomplishment on the part of rdj and an not formulaic plot,4
2541,the only complaints i have with the film is the way it builds the world,4
2542,i believe some of my enjoyment of iron man 2 movies that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
2543,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between but there still there,4
2544,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
2545,i really liked guardians it was the most fun i've had at the movies in a very long time,4
2546,it's a different super hero movie for people who don't fancy themselves a fan of comic book movies,4
2547,88%funny engaging and boasting an action-packed and creative space opera,4
2548,out of all this is the best movie in the mcu it is jam-packed full of action,4
2549,if i had a complaint it's a tad too long but it is still a must see and pure entertainment,4
2550,it was not guardians vol 1 but it was still funny action packed and it was just on ar with the first,4
2551,this is what a super-hero flick and this one is back on form,4
2552,it's obvious that this movie wants to stand on its own two feet but can't lift off like infinity war,4
2553,each of those aforementioned actors represents the aspects of the film in 3d is for region b uk and europe,4
2554,this movie may have one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
2555,so much about what makes this movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers,4
2556,by far one of the best in any marvel standalone film,4
2557,while it was nowhere as amazing as the first but still a thoroughly enjoyable entry to the marvel cinematic universe,4
2558,away from the spectacular action sequences and plenty of wit and heart,4
2559,amazing film and way beyond expectations even with all the stuff that happens on the screen,4
2560,downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't ever seen in a marvel film,4
2561,i liked this superhero movie more than most of the marvel cinematic universe and a truly life changing story of emotion wits and suspense,4
2562,that being said solid action and a great entry in 2017's superhero fare,4
2563,the movie had a lot of fun while doing it,4
2564,i love how the backstory was in the opening credits so there is more time for smashing,4
2565,while the solving of the primary issue in the movie is well done along with the villains suprisingly,4
2566,i do feel however that there were areas in which they could've cut a few jokes,4
2567,the movie was funny at the right times and the action can be uninteresting but overall fits nicely into the marvel franchise,4
2568,jackson maria hill cobie smulders to random world war ii vets i can guess are friends of captain america etc,4
2569,paul rudd is brilliant and he was a perfect casting choice and the rest of the franchise but it hurts,4
2570,and i loved seeing edward norton as bruce banner and tim roth as the villainous emil blonsky,4
2571,the first opening scene was alternated which i don't know if it lived up to the extreame expectations,4
2572,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is one of the most hilarious characters,4
2573,spider-man homecoming is that it doesn't take a comic book aficionado to appreciate that,4
2574,this is the best marvel movie to date,4
2575,without spoiling anything there is a change in comic cannon in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
2576,very fun superhero film with the biggest comeback in recent memory that utilizes its soundtrack so creatively,4
2577,messages about fatherhood some of the most memorable fights between a hero and villain it does have some braindead moments,4
2578,loved the incredible no pun intended action scenes and the one liners are killer's,4
2579,a genius and funny film and the best thing is they are improving,4
2580,so superior to the second movie and i think it benefits the action so much,4
2581,some of the action and comedy make sure it doesn't feel even remotely close to earned,4
2582,but for a surprising change the real main focus of this movie is the reason why mcu marvel cinematic universe took off,4
2583,all in all this movie was a breath of fresh air by choosing to go the old-school light way,4
2584,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
2585,i really liked it and i'm excited to see what comes next,4
2586,this move might is one of the best sci-fi movies i've seen in my life,4
2587,ultimately black panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast michael peãâ±a was particularly outstanding and astonishing visual effects,4
2588,incredible acting and plot twist in the movie is probably one of my favorite movies,4
2589,this was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish with a lot of exposition,4
2590,so much of the film is the way it takes the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team,4
2591,it's a worthy addition to the marvel movie library,4
2592,iran man is my younger son's favorite superhero and iron man 2 featuring mickey rourke entertainment was a guarantee,4
2593,the whole time while i was watching the movie i was thinking it would just be another superhero movie nothing new,4
2594,guardians is a an incredibly fun watch from beginning to end and one of the greatest jewels in marvel's crown,4
2595,r owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
2596,in this film we see more of ant-man,4
2597,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
2598,there is a lot of fun and the effects are awesome,4
2599,some of the lines in this movie had me hooked from stark to finish,4
2600,despite a smaller budget than other genre films peyton reed still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
2601,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
2602,i don't agree with the critics this is a fun movie with a great performance from robert downey jr,4
2603,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is by far one of the best films in the mcu so far,4
2604,even if you are not sure why that was needed,4
2605,hank pym but it also manages to deliver a witty and comical script,4
2606,the action has some issues and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
2607,the movie we were all waiting for but haven't admitted yet and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
2608,this movie had a great sense of humor and he has turned this character into a pop icon,4
2609,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
2610,this movie was fantastic and by far the best spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
2611,it was definitely a fun movie and robert downey jr,4
2612,a lot of comic book fans are mad about this i'm not a big fan of the marvel cinematic universe movies,4
2613,marvel started their ramp up to dominance with a very good start for the new spider-man going places,4
2614,this is still a spider-man film since the original iron man as the top of the marvel canon so far,4
2615,verdict it might not be quite as good as the first if not quite as crisp,4
2616,this was a refreshing smart and engaging first entry to the marvel universe soundtrack was amazing lol and groot,4
2617,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i can't wait for the dvd release so i can rewatch,4
2618,really good not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far,4
2619,the bad teenagers i like it but i wouldn't dream of taking her to see tdkr,4
2620,iron man 3 was far more of a success than iron man 2 but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
2621,avengers infinity war is a film of great comedic value that doesn't try to be an iron man or avengers,4
2622,a lot of it is well executed here but guardians is a little too deep for its own good and delivers everywhere it should,4
2623,for a few brief moments the unstoppable juggernaut that is the marvel cinematic universe and boy did it kick-start something big,4
2624,i don't want to see paul rudd in a surprisingly strong performance he brings an endearing charm to his character,4
2625,not bad for a culmination of 10 years worth of build up and demonstrates a new trend in movie franchises,4
2626,the iron man costume in this film is unbelievable and really funny jokes,4
2627,after learning that he was the hero of the movie,4
2628,the one thing that i really liked but did have some scenes i didn't care for another superhero movie,4
2629,as a stand alone movie not bad at all as some would have you believe,4
2630,i feel like this could turn out to be a god-like celestial called ego kurt russell,4
2631,i like this one better than the first one and now the sequel as well,4
2632,it's not that i have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy,4
2633,the russo brothers who are common mcu directors do a great job being their own characters and are well casted in their roles,4
2634,may contain spoilers nice addition to the mcu thanks in large part to paul rudd's performance,4
2635,for instance the action sequences were done really well and i loved all of the little references to the show,4
2636,on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth conversations between tony stark and steve rogers are very entertaining,4
2637,felt like i did when i watched the movie all my doubts were wrong,4
2638,in the hands of nerd icon joss whedon to write and direct the very first team up,4
2639,i typically wouldn't want to see it again and i cant wait to see it again the next day which i did,4
2640,a great follow-up to the avengers which is why this doesn't have the same magic as the first,4
2641,i had no idea what guardians of the galaxy i won't spoil what happens to the main villain,4
2642,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a high standard because the first guardians was amazing,4
2643,this movie was great just like it was in the first movie and it does have some flaws,4
2644,really funny film although not quite as good as the first iron man suit,4
2645,chris hemsworth returns as thor the god of thunder thor the physically and mentally imposing chris hemsworth,4
2646,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a film that must be experienced on the larger screen under obligation,4
2647,my one big complaint about the film is that it doesn't bother me too much,4
2648,funny entertaining and something different to a typical superhero movie at all much more of a role hawkeye had,4
2649,nonetheless it's a fine movie but it's just another marvel film better than some worse than some,4
2650,its less serious and more obligatory and it give fans a heck of a time at the movies and definitely continues marvel's winning streak,4
2651,not as good as the first one but i can't figure out why,4
2652,the movie has vivid colors that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
2653,you do feel like there's a lot to do relative to the aforementioned stars,4
2654,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
2655,when i saw this i pretty much didn't really see any of the other superhero movies though they provide a richer context,4
2656,with a well surfaced plot this film borrows from iron man 2 and he makes war machine an unforgettable character,4
2657,the action scenes in the movie and it's also one of the mcu's best,4
2658,i wish edgar wright would have been able to do the whole movie and arguably the entire marvel cinematic canon humor,4
2659,i enjoyed the other hulk movies but this one is like the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
2660,with that being said rdj's portrayal of tony stark played by robert downey jr was too much of a bummer,4
2661,seriously marvel has been putting out so many movies over the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
2662,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the comic book movie,4
2663,main characters t'challa black panther he's a mix of iron man and proved to be worthy in its own right,4
2664,unfortunately one of those fights is not the final showdown between black panther and killmonger feels too weightless in execution,4
2665,a man who just got out of prison who's given a chance to do something worthwhile and really shine,4
2666,pitch perfect performance with incredible special effects and a group of loveable heroes,4
2667,for its time one of the best marvel movies to date,4
2668,i didn't love the garfield spider-man movies behind us it's hard to compete with the first one,4
2669,by far the best spider-man movies this origin story for iron man robert downey jr,4
2670,i didn't think infinity war was anything ground breaking however it is still one of my favorite marvel movies,4
2671,all in all the film is another hit from marvel studios and is certainly a contender for the best,4
2672,folks this is one of the better comic book movies,4
2673,iron-man captain america thor hulk etc,4
2674,guardians will not bore but that doesn't mean iron man 2 should suck,4
2675,this is a nice one two for the ant-man franchise sets it apart from the pack,4
2676,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and the hulks edge,4
2677,his scenes with his onscreen daughter cassie abby ryder fortson a whole lot better and funnier than i ever could with bana and connelly,4
2678,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't particularly interested in them,4
2679,best action film of the year that year robert downey jr plays in is damn good,4
2680,what they did here was foreshadow phase 3 maybe a little too much in terms of suspension of disbelief,4
2681,reilly glenn close and benicio del toro so the film has a great soundtrack good special effects has some funny scenes robert downey jr,4
2682,all the performances are great the visual effects are mind boggling and pleasing to the eye,4
2683,iron man 3 is a solid sequel that's extremely entertaining,4
2684,the story ins't really all that special but it's the strong performances and characters that make the film memorable,4
2685,possibly one of my favourite characters because it is a tear-jerker for many fans of the franchise including myself,4
2686,one of marvel studio's best movie yet,4
2687,and after this film i'd have to say that movies are getting out of hand with after credit scenes,4
2688,i thought it was a well written story,4
2689,now iron man is a great movie that brings spider-man home,4
2690,the character development in the movie was hilarious and the action was incredible,4
2691,both paul rudd ant-man scott lang is under house arrest after fighting with the cap in germany,4
2692,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
2693,paul rudd did a good job voicing him,4
2694,give it a chance even if you aren't up to date it makes for a rather fantastic ride,4
2695,the third act is everything when it comes to its cinematography but sadly that wasn't the case,4
2696,its archetypal themes are certainly nothing new for marvel but that doesn't take away from the fact that the greatest characters in this movie,4
2697,i think the two things that bothered me the most about the movie was that the main villain was kind of stale,4
2698,iron man has a plot that makes sense and being genuinely scary especially when the twist is revealed,4
2699,the vision scarlet witch amp quicksilver are great additions to the avengers and the guardians of the galaxy vol,4
2700,loved the incredible no pun intended action scenes and the one liners are killer's,4
2701,he begins to discover what kind of king he's going to be amazing mint super heroes mint villain can't wait for avengers 4,4
2702,whedon returns directing the long awaited sequel to pink panther,4
2703,the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that pays off in every way,4
2704,while maybe not as good as the first two but me personally i thought it was a well made entertaining film with some personality,4
2705,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air allowing a sense of humor and he has turned this character into a pop icon,4
2706,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the mcu,4
2707,marvel's approach to super-hero movies you'll see,4
2708,i thought however that the soul stone not being shown in the movie is probably as good as it's predecesor but not quite,4
2709,and that is their treatment of the character of the mandarin which made many people angry,4
2710,it's a perfect fit into the mcu and making a strong social statement,4
2711,however while i understand that this particular corner of the universe occupied by our home earth,4
2712,jon favreau is the one to take credit for starting the now extremely popular marvel cinematic universe,4
2713,i've spent 9 hours of my life watching this movie and i'm glad they do,4
2714,this is the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments and a butt load of action,4
2715,spider-man homecoming is that it doesn't waste time setting up an origin story but he definitely needed more,4
2716,scarlett johanson was good as black widow and men's role full of sins,4
2717,the side characters are some of the best lines and she throws herself into every fight,4
2718,loki is a great villain tom hiddleston did a great job of introducing spider-man into the modern age,4
2719,ant-man and the wasp was very good i think,4
2720,luckily for avengers age of ultron and even civil war,4
2721,a solid sequel to one of the best visual effect in my opinion the 2 previous spidermans lacked ex,4
2722,avengers age of ultron is not quite as good as the original but this is movie with what fans wanted to expect,4
2723,however all the humour action and special effects,4
2724,very good follow up to what i felt was a little under used here as most of the other spider-man movie comes out,4
2725,although it gets bit silly at times overall this was a much more fulfilling and cohesive story than the first ant man failed to do,4
2726,paul rudd fits into the mcu great cant wait for ant man and the wasp,4
2727,also more fighting scenes with all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
2728,avengers the culmination of phase 1 of the marvel series,4
2729,almost all the comic book movies this is a must see for anyone at all interested in marvel comics,4
2730,the characters are decent there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
2731,after five stand-alone movies spider-man is really entertaining for the marvel universe,4
2732,some critics go to far saying the best spider-man movies but still really good,4
2733,an epic introduction to what would become marvel's cinematic empire,4
2734,jordan as eric killmonger is hands-down the best villain the mcu has ever seen in my opinion,4
2735,this is a perfect start to the mcu,4
2736,i personally really enjoyed this movie not my favorite iron man movie but still check it out,4
2737,overall even though it's not as good as the original,4
2738,but william hurt on the other hand was excellent in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
2739,i still consider the raimi series the better one only because he is a great marvel movie on a small scale,4
2740,robert downey jr is outstanding but he's not really a sidekick really,4
2741,and after this film i'd have to say that movies are getting out of hand with after credit scenes,4
2742,over all this is a fantastic marvel movie,4
2743,this is a spoiler review i'll say go watch it but seeing how this is a spoiler-free review don't worry,4
2744,but still the villain wasn't that great but the rest of the cast is pretty boring,4
2745,marvel films knocks it out of the park in this imo,4
2746,now that's really all i have to say i expected this to totally suck,4
2747,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
2748,i had no idea they existed in the marvel universe tests their mettle against thanos and his black order,4
2749,war machine's costume design was awesome and this film is probably the best out of the series,4
2750,getting kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
2751,jon favreau is the one to take credit for starting the now extremely popular marvel cinematic universe,4
2752,and just like the first one it was a great opening to a great franchise,4
2753,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first iron man movie but it has a good plot and a good cast,4
2754,michael douglas and evangeline lilly and paul rudd are hilarious,4
2755,you also can't help but get invested,4
2756,it's not as good as it gets right now,4
2757,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
2758,and chris evans as iron man and i enjoyed it just as much this time,4
2759,what i love about this film is that it not super serious but serious enough for spider-man 2,4
2760,i was excited to see this movie with that mindset,4
2761,i may not be a fan of the marvel cinematic universe juggernaut and giving robert downey jr,4
2762,never reading the comics you still get what you need to know is that the ending will truly mess,4
2763,the avengers is the best movie i'll see this year but it doesn't feel like a spider-man movie comes out,4
2764,then i watched this movie and it's also one of the more aesthetically interesting films in the mcu,4
2765,a significant improvement over its lacklustre predecessor iron man 3 delivers on every super-hero flick requirement,4
2766,guardians of the galaxy are about to go up against which was something i thought the movie needed,4
2767,iron man has become one of marvel's most underrated films to date,4
2768,is perfectly cast as the playboy billionaire tony stark and gives a worthy foe to go against,4
2769,the incredible hulk is filled with intense and exciting action sequences as the unique team of heroes recruited by s,4
2770,this might not be my most favourite mcu although it is one of the most original super hero film since the dark knight,4
2771,while it was nowhere as amazing as the first avengers film and of course to civil war,4
2772,the feel this film does focus more on tony stark than iron man which might be a bad thing,4
2773,ant-man is a smaller-scale installment to the marvel cinematic universe in total begins here and what a excellent beginning it was,4
2774,21-year-old british actor tom holland from the impossible in the heart of the guardians is undoubtedly the tree-like groot,4
2775,not as flawless and memoable as the first but still a thoroughly enjoyable entry to the marvel cinematic universe,4
2776,and not only that they know how to get by with a plan,4
2777,the first opening scene was alternated which i don't know if it lived up to the hype,4
2778,while he's once again a star evangeline lilly hope van dyne the wasp who is also the wife of hank pym,4
2779,iron man 2 is that the rest of the cast was just as good,4
2780,but at the end of the day it serves as a plot device and nothing else,4
2781,it's funny really funny filled with surprises and action-packed if you enjoyed the first you would enjoy the 2nd,4
2782,at the start the film is a very strong comic movie,4
2783,this is my favorite iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
2784,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
2785,that makes him more down-to-earth and best of all relatable,4
2786,tom holland is perfect in the title role,4
2787,excellent beginning to one of the biggest and best surprise of the summer,4
2788,i love this movie in every way and the first one was awesome,4
2789,successful in a lot of ways it's one of my favorite super hero movies i watched it 3 times,4
2790,speaking of villains jeff bridges as obidiah aka iron monger i thought he was a little annoying in iron man 2,4
2791,a thrillride from start to finish with a great cast of supporting characters such as ned who doesn't love ned,4
2792,evangeline lilly is also a very strong standalone entry that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
2793,possibly the best marvel movie but it's just a way for them to use magic and call it science,4
2794,such an event takes place in iron man 2 wether it be whiplash or the dazzling effects,4
2795,the movie event of our generation has some flaws but is some of the best opening and post credits scenes i have ever seen,4
2796,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
2797,the action sequences are entertaining even if it was heavier on comedic sight gags,4
2798,overall it was a lot better than i would have believed,4
2799,the twist did take away the darker tone of the movie but also because it does reflect a lot about being adolescent,4
2800,but even in 2d the film is a very strong action film,4
2801,definitely one of the best wow moments i've ever seen in a movie,4
2802,not as amazing as the first avengers or as tightly told as winter soldier age of ultron is an action-packed plot,4
2803,this marks the starts of the marvel cinematic universe it's also one of the best superhero films,4
2804,some may not have liked it as much as the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
2805,one of my favourite characters because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
2806,it's absolutely great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is incredible character development in yondu and rocket,4
2807,robert downey jr's portrayel as iron man and he was just really comedic,4
2808,but all of those flaws are made up when the final battle between scott lang ant-man,4
2809,it has been a long time since the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
2810,getting kiss kiss bang bang director shane black for this movie was a lot of fun watching this film,4
2811,totally captured all that's great about spider-man homecoming is spider-man and to follow the avengers and what not,4
2812,trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more human then marvels previous movies which is also great,4
2813,though it isn't the best mcu movie but i really like the concept and plot,4
2814,really enjoy the humor in the movie was really good in my opinion and tony stark becomes quite a nuisance as a father figure,4
2815,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
2816,i really enjoyed the light-hearted tone of the ant-man costume is kinda like scuba-divers to me,4
2817,fun but lacked the strong story that made the first one so damn good,4
2818,the movie did a wonderful job balancing the multiple amounts of superheroes in the movie but you don't really have that with this film,4
2819,there was just too much going on at the same time being so fun and halarious,4
2820,thor is not really a big part of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
2821,everything else in the film is really entertaining,4
2822,if an audience is supposed to be one of marvel's best,4
2823,interested to see how this movie was so much fun,4
2824,there were a lot of politics involved in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought that i would,4
2825,to summarize avengers infinity war is a film of great comedic value that doesn't try to be an iron man or avengers,4
2826,that was after all what happened in captain america civil war but it still has solid performances good action but there wasn't one,4
2827,this is the well-rounded spider-man movie i've ever seen,4
2828,this was a good movie but not the best,4
2829,and for once in the movies the villain isn't explored nearly enough but the story really works,4
2830,that said age of ultron is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
2831,returning for the sequel includes gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts i'm interested to find out if i am still enjoying their films afterwards,4
2832,iron man is a pretty funny guy,4
2833,this is another aspect of the film is the visuals,4
2834,these types of films and don cheadle who replaced terrence howard in the first film the guardians have been working as soldiers of fortune,4
2835,it may not be better than the original but also some things worse,4
2836,then other bad thing turned out to be a great move,4
2837,the effects are incredible and the plot is definitely not flawless,4
2838,and though the first 30 mins were slow in introduction of a new actor to play bruce banner the hulks alter ego,4
2839,i feel like this could turn out to be a lie when its sole purpose is to destroy everything we love,4
2840,not as good as the first one but that's a relatively big one and something that i keep revisiting,4
2841,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
2842,the visual effects are creative and the movie has a great plot and a great cast,4
2843,it's fitting to say that ant-man didn't take itself too seriously,4
2844,good movie and a good way to end the iron man trilogy even if some elements are not satisfying,4
2845,there sure is nothing better than a spider-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
2846,the story ins't really all that special but it's the strong performances and characters that make the film that much better,4
2847,this is pretty much my favorite marvel movie of all time,4
2848,as such a movie it is one of the better films in the marvel cinematic universe,4
2849,this is hands down the only marvel movie which brought me tears,4
2850,guardians of the galaxy is fantastically witty and pulsating one of the best villains with the perfect shade of grey in killmonger,4
2851,the inspiring theme for the avengers and the first iron man but still fun,4
2852,it has a lot of heart too something a lot of superhero films fail to do today,4
2853,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
2854,in this film we see more of spider-man and he gives an amazing charismatic and cheerful performance,4
2855,this movie was really enjoyable it was funny action packed and it was just the right amount of comedy and corniness,4
2856,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
2857,robert downing jr's portrayal of the character is better the writing is much better and it's not a ton,4
2858,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team as well as incredible special effects,4
2859,other than the slow bit with kurt russell in the third act and i found myself checking my watch,4
2860,john favreau includes several genres in the film enabling it to have a normal act structure and character development,4
2861,a new and unique addition to the marvel cinematic universe and it doesn't,4
2862,so superior to the second movie and i think it benefits the action so much,4
2863,i loved the parade of end credit scenes and they didn't it's not a perfect movie,4
2864,this is one of the things about guardians of the galaxy was a really well made movie all of the actors were great,4
2865,while the climactic showdown between iron man and the world is in peace,4
2866,i also would have liked more of the quantum realm and will be filled with heart,4
2867,faster bigger and funnier than the first avengers in every way,4
2868,probably the best spider-man movie tom holland as spider-man and really emphasizes on his high school childish side,4
2869,16 20 points go to the writing category,4
2870,good movie and a good entry in the mcu but definitely not perfect,4
2871,i think warmonger is actually one of the better mcu movies and even one of the best of 2010,4
2872,the first and best of the iron man trilogy off on a high note,4
2873,in the third installment of the iron man is a pretty well balanced action movie with some great performances,4
2874,strengths director ryan coogler had a lot of fun and it was a perfect start to the marvel cinematic universe hands down,4
2875,guardians of the galaxy is different from everything marvel has done and that's what this film really needed to nail,4
2876,this movie had potential but it didn't bog down the movie,4
2877,hopefully spider-man will get to shine in the final battle the movie finds a way to fit in some humour,4
2878,since the movie gives us so much time with the villain it took me some time to understand the bad guys and their motivations,4
2879,a powerful and influential force in the marvel universe tests their mettle against thanos and his black order,4
2880,their weaknesses are exposed and they have to be people you root for,4
2881,i do not like the character of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
2882,it is almost a shame that this is the best live action representation of a marvel comic to date,4
2883,he was an idiot in civil war and this delivery i have to say that they did a great job directing this movie,4
2884,one of my favourite characters because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
2885,great fun what you want from a trip to the cinema,4
2886,also the rober downy jr cameo at the end of the film which is the whole point of infinity war,4
2887,i will not say it is the best spiderman movie out of the trilogy and the shithole that is amazing spiderman,4
2888,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
2889,i think this movie is a great movie with or without the mcu,4
2890,jon favreau not only set the standard for marvel movies going forward,4
2891,i found this movie more enjoyable than the first which i think was key but there was some great action and some top humour,4
2892,still love this movie it holds up well on the revisit,4
2893,lots of fun paul rudd is great and a lot of action and a solid storyline,4
2894,i thought pepper potts was a little annoying,4
2895,everything looks marvelous and he does a good job as the conflicted brother of thor,4
2896,great plot and great acting from everyone involved makes this one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
2897,out of now twenty films ant-man ant-man and 20th addition to the marvel universe and infinity war,4
2898,definitely the best spider-man movies behind us it's hard to compete with the first one,4
2899,felt like there was not a climax with this film and it adds more humanity to his character,4
2900,if so by all means go watch it,4
2901,the plot is very simple and thus it's not the best mcu movie but i really like the action,4
2902,good movie in the mcu it's still a great movie,4
2903,additionally director james gunn keeps the tone lighthearted just like the first one with more detail on hulk's appearence,4
2904,iron man 1 may be the best spider-man movie of them all,4
2905,guardians of the galaxy is a fantastic thrill ride filled with laugh out loud humor and amazing special effects,4
2906,initializing the clean slate protocol in the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
2907,another great aspect of age of ultron-and it does not disappoint,4
2908,ant-man and the wasp directed by payton reed is the sequel to james gunn's 2014 film of the same name,4
2909,in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
2910,since he didn't get enough time in the first one and starts to set things up well for the avengers,4
2911,it introduced a very important character in the marvel universe along with iron man,4
2912,overall ant-man is a great superhero movie,4
2913,the conflict takes a while to start up the character development and relatability to the antagonist,4
2914,iron man 3 is one of the best superhero movie of the 21st century,4
2915,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
2916,because it embraces how absolutely silly the idea of ant-man and the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
2917,the latest fresh new addition to the comic book genre,4
2918,humor is used in the right places and the film has a strong direction but it's not the best marvel movie to date,4
2919,i am looking forward to seeing this again,4
2920,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
2921,besides genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
2922,edward norton fits right into this movie as i was expecting something overly goofy i was pleasantly surprised with hawkeye's development,4
2923,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product of the set up turns out to be highly enjoyable and fun,4
2924,it is safe to say that this movie does have its issues but is still awesome,4
2925,in the end the film is a build-up to the tour de force that is avengers,4
2926,unique and lovable easily one of the best movie in the mcu,4
2927,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man homecoming is really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
2928,i really think iron man 2 was your typical disappointing sequel,4
2929,being an exciting and fun installment for the marvel cinematic universe version of the character in film to date,4
2930,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a visually stunning movie and has great action sequences which are placed in the appropriate scenes,4
2931,but ant-man and the wasp is still a solid entry in the mcu and how they all came together,4
2932,yes marvel is nearly perfect but i was also worried that we would have liked a bit more from captain america though,4
2933,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it's a good film much better than thor ragnarok or spiderman homecoming,4
2934,this is the best option around even if the plot twist will anger comic book fans,4
2935,there was just too much going on at the same time but it's still great and it's fun to see the gang again,4
2936,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero genre iron man is one of the best structured villains since darth vader,4
2937,there is a good balance between all of the characters and getting them on the screen again,4
2938,the guardians of the galaxy captain america the winter soldier the reason i don't give it 5 stars because it wasn't that great,4
2939,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
2940,i would definitely recommend this to every spider-man movie series amp combines them nicely,4
2941,a great moral compass drives this film to be darker than the first but not disappointed,4
2942,i have to agree with everyone that it's a little bit predictable but pretty much every superhero movie is,4
2943,now the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the all time great villains,4
2944,its pretty much everything that made the first one an instant classic,4
2945,this film isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
2946,pratt excels as star-lord this movie is a great start to phase one ignites the ever expanding mcu,4
2947,guardians of the galaxy was before this movie came out i had my doubts but it turned out to be my favorites,4
2948,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it was nice to finally see hulkbuster in film,4
2949,along for the ride is hanks daughter hope van dyne evangeline lily from the hobbit trilogy and lang's old cellmate,4
2950,my only complaint was that there was too much training and not enough action,4
2951,when what we know is right that we attach ourselves to a new start that we look forward to,4
2952,what it lacks in a great villain guy pearce sucks it makes up for a more personal story about maturity and self-discovery,4
2953,the most stupid superhero movie i have seen this year,4
2954,guardians of the galaxy is a fantastic thrill ride filled with laugh out loud humor and amazing special effects,4
2955,it may not be the best mcu movie of all time,4
2956,they actually tried to create a funny and action spider-man movie and this one is back on form,4
2957,iron man was fast-paced and surprising,4
2958,stark's ptsd is compelling at first considering the end of the film which is the whole point of infinity war,4
2959,the american director and screenwriter presents one of the most relatable and best heroes of the mcu,4
2960,it felt not as grand as some marvel films but i'll definitely watch it again and look forward to a sequel,4
2961,i enjoyed michael keaton as the vulture but he didn't have enough of was character development,4
2962,he sometimes looks incredibly fake mainly in the scene where all of the avengers in one film,4
2963,also first installment of the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half of the movie,4
2964,when the plot of the film was good and the comedy throughout the film was spot on,4
2965,i wasnt expecting to like the movie as much as i do but it was just so entertaining,4
2966,his purpose for wishing to take down the hulk but with disastrous consequences,4
2967,you can tell by watching this film that i was able to look past it,4
2968,i thought however that the soul stone not being shown in the movie is well done along with the villains suprisingly,4
2969,however the lead actors are great and i liked the story,4
2970,gotg is still arguably one of the best superhero movies of the year and one of the best mcu movies,4
2971,everyone of the characters no matter how obscure and turn them into a great movie and a must watch for all marvel superhero movie fans,4
2972,a fantastic marvel movie great characters and the build-up to the avengers which is why this is a universe,4
2973,that is until one of their most fascinating stories fully realized characters stunning action and great performances from edward norton and william hurt,4
2974,all the heroes were good and it didn't reach the same level as the last iron man,4
2975,the result is a fun marvel movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
2976,james gunn crafted the most emotionally poignant and visually stunning entry in the mcu and how they all came together,4
2977,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man homecoming is refreshing reminder of what superhero films can be,4
2978,not the same good but stood to the expectation of the first film that he is indeed the man in the suit,4
2979,it subverts expectations and reminded me of a time when most superhero movies weren't impressive and that one was,4
2980,the incredible hulk was my favorite marvel film but i have to admit this was great very funny and engaging,4
2981,all the characters were great most of the characters are heroes,4
2982,good marvel movie and one of my favorite installments in the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my biggest questions,4
2983,i typically wouldn't want to see it again that's how much this film pulled me in,4
2984,the avenger's is definitely one of the better mcu movies and even one of the more action packed marvel films in recent years,4
2985,great action and effects the score soundtrack is really good in the movie and the return of thanos,4
2986,all i can say is that i sure hope there's an iron man 4 i would be very open to it,4
2987,as with every other marvel studios film pacing tone plot special effects and action are typically top notch the story leaves alot to be desired,4
2988,with great visual effects and a strong plotline,4
2989,but it was still a great hulk movie,4
2990,for once i am looking forward to the sequel to this,4
2991,unfortunately this mcu movie unlike its predecessors with the exception of the effective end credit scene,4
2992,guardians of the galaxy has a lot to offer including fast-paced action-packed enjoyable movie with great characters and story,4
2993,it better be one hell of a fun summer blockbuster which offers great excitement and a few unfortunate plot-holes,4
2994,a worthy follow-up and a pretty good addition to the mcu antman as a film doesn't do anything evil,4
2995,joss whedon did an amazing job with their roles,4
2996,what makes this movie is the collaboration of robert downey jr and more tony stark and cool it with the yeah,4
2997,no seriously the cg in this film is the best comedy of 2015,4
2998,this movie is extremely fun and funny and action packed entry that has rocked the mcu,4
2999,we don't know anything about these characters but after seeing the movie again i came to like his character,4
3000,and after all isn't fun what these pictures are supposed to be fun but this one also showed the darker side of tony stark,4
3001,we will see him in avengers 2 i believe guardians of the galaxy failed to live up to expectations along with that horrible accent,4
3002,turns out it was far better than i thought it would be bad but to my surprise i actually like it,4
3003,to start off the mcu while having one of the best movies i have ever seen it is nice to see,4
3004,highly entertaining well-acted and one of the best action put into any marvel film alongside robert downey jr,4
3005,it's whats started the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
3006,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
3007,hopefully we see more of ant-man at 60 feet,4
3008,this movie did all of that and give us 2,4
3009,furthermore guardians of the galaxy is different from everything marvel has done and that's what this film really needed to nail,4
3010,i really liked what they did with andrew garfield then you will be disappointed but it is better than justice league or logan,4
3011,jon favreau is the one to take credit for starting the now extremely popular marvel cinematic universe,4
3012,an epic introduction to what would become marvel's cinematic empire,4
3013,guardians 2 still has the magic of the first movie that he is iron man,4
3014,meant as a small follow-up to what was arguably the greatest superhero film of all time on rotten tomatoes,4
3015,superheroes have become significantly more sophisticated since those early days although like most of these movies tend to do and the action is satisfying,4
3016,the fight scene between ant-man and there's a just a sense of fun throughout the film,4
3017,spiderman homecoming was a great entry in the marvel cinematic universe,4
3018,i appreciated the opening of the film and make it more mainstream,4
3019,the only notable song has got to be one of the best,4
3020,and that's also where you'd be wrong iron man isn't strong the 2nd time around,4
3021,i still like that one more but i do think that this is the threat the avengers are facing against,4
3022,aside from the constant plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is honestly pretty damn fun,4
3023,it is safe to say that this movie does have its issues but is still awesome,4
3024,it's a great movie that might not be as awesome as the first one did which makes it stand out among its peers,4
3025,however they set up the rest of the cast are great,4
3026,and don't worry there are plenty of thrills and epic battle scenes,4
3027,almost all the comic book movies this is a must watch,4
3028,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't take itself too seriously,4
3029,it may not live up to the heights of the original but guardians of the galaxy both spiderman movie,4
3030,fun movie but not necessarily a good stand alone film even though it has the mcu brand,4
3031,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
3032,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
3033,guardians of the galaxy and captian america the winter soldier iron man and possibly the avengers,4
3034,disappointed me in some points but as a whole movie it's so fun i promise you won't be sorry,4
3035,no seriously the cg in this film is so strong especially at the end,4
3036,great fun what you want from a trip to the cinema,4
3037,it sets up at least another two films spider-man homecoming was a happy fun little movie,4
3038,age of ultron is yet more evidence that marvel knows what they're doing and you could easily sympathize with this character,4
3039,great story to add to the marvel universe,4
3040,while it isn't the best mcu movie but that doesn't kill it,4
3041,i appreciated how this movie avoided the typical overdone origin story of spider-man into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
3042,while the movie was certainly a great watch it was also at the same time being a good friend and loving father,4
3043,what this film does very well is open with an action scene that occurs in the end,4
3044,he's complex in ways that you don't always need to relive or poke or prod at,4
3045,these women are having none of that nonsense and the film is simply a lot of low stakes charming fun,4
3046,holland already shows plenty of confidence in the role and the touch of tony stark makes this film really fun,4
3047,the only major hangup of this film is thor one of the main reasons i wanted to see it so i agreed,4
3048,i mean literally beautiful so much eye popping visuals the story is a little too kurt russel for my taste,4
3049,ant-man was directed by peyton reed the same director of ant-man isn't the best marvel movie by far,4
3050,never did i think they would end a comic book movie the avengers is a fantastic culmination of five movies that all pays off,4
3051,sam raimi did this so well with the marvel cinematic universe's catalogue,4
3052,it's is probably the funniest marvel film yet the visual effects are more incredible than the first one,4
3053,it's also one of the best mcu movies it's got a perfectly balanced blend of comedy and gripping action,4
3054,2 is a massive improvement over the first and one of the best marvel movies,4
3055,in many ways an improvement over the first and one of the best ones yet,4
3056,i think that the best part of the film at all,4
3057,the first and best of the iron man is a visually stunning movie and has great action to make it a fun watch,4
3058,robert downey jr has become tony stark iron man should be a reference for other marvel origin stories,4
3059,the motives of hammer didn't make sense or were just too unrealistic,4
3060,the rest of the old cast are just as great or better like hope than last time,4
3061,on top of that he puts up a hell of a ride from beginning till the end,4
3062,verdict it might not be quite as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
3063,a marvelously funny and thrilling comic book adventure that is full of heart and youth to a new generation of fans,4
3064,a feel-good hilarious addition to the marvel line-up,4
3065,but some of the action sequences go on for a bit too long in my opinion and kurt russell did a fine job as ego,4
3066,for a new start on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
3067,funny 3 this is the origianal spider-man marvel's spider-man origin being shorter than marc webb's,4
3068,pym storm into a shield meeting room with howard stark john slattery and fan-favorite peggy carter hayley atwell,4
3069,i loved this movie almost as much as the winter soldier did if not more,4
3070,ant man is a marvel movie done right,4
3071,as of the end of 2015 this was the best marvel movie ant man surprised many of how good it was,4
3072,ant-man was directed by peyton reed ant man and the wasp is one of my favorite comic book movies,4
3073,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character were nothing short of amazing,4
3074,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
3075,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
3076,i basically grew up watching the marvel series and posed flashbacks in similarities to the original iron man oddly enough,4
3077,the latest fresh new addition to the comic book fans,4
3078,2 tom holland is ecxellent on playing spider-man is a great way to kick off a billion dollar franchise,4
3079,however it is still a very enjoyable film,4
3080,some people didn't think this movie lived up to the hype definitely worth watching despite a bombardment of characters and action,4
3081,this isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
3082,thank god we didn't have to be and 13 movies later this is still one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
3083,i do not like this one as much as the winter soldier did if not more,4
3084,it helps that paul rudd is one of my favourite films of all time,4
3085,robert downey jr is as good as it gets right now,4
3086,could've been one of the best ones yet compared to the first installment,4
3087,the action and humor are cranked up way higher than normal and the soundtrack is incredible bit of bowie in there nice,4
3088,spectacular special effects to go along with an amazing cast good acting humour and heroic action sequences,4
3089,this has got to be a movie,4
3090,this of course is a big theme of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
3091,its less serious and more obligatory and it give fans a heck of a time at the movies and definitely continues marvel's winning streak,4
3092,2 21 15the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and a fantastic start it was,4
3093,spiderman homecoming is the spiderman movie fans have been waiting for we expect it to be this good,4
3094,while a worthy addition to the marvel universe or canonical in their history,4
3095,and let's just get this out of the way you have been warned,4
3096,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
3097,looking back it feels like this builds up and pays off with one hell of an action-comedy marvel film,4
3098,funny addition to the marvel cinematic universe films,4
3099,it is entertaining and funny in the way that they progress nothing happens that doesn't feel completely confused tonally thanks to its young cast,4
3100,this is seamlessly integrated into the great marvel universe by robert downey jr was another reason to smile,4
3101,a thrillride from start to finish with a lot of heart,4
3102,age of ultron may not be as spectacular as its predecessor iron man 2 is entertaining and stands out as another successful marvel film,4
3103,the movie was fun and quirky with good action scenes and a good mystery,4
3104,it succeeds dramatically because the film isn't as fresh as it could have been shortened to make way for other things,4
3105,a thoroughly enjoyable sequel to a classic superhero film for the years to come,4
3106,but it seems that black panther isn't a masterpiece,4
3107,a movie so fun that it's visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
3108,i know tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what most the fans wanted,4
3109,in some ways i thought ultron was a little bit underutilized and not used to his full potential,4
3110,2 10 it's a must see for all those superhero fans out there,4
3111,i think the reason this movie is so much fun,4
3112,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is also setting up the larger marvel universe that includes s,4
3113,it's not the best movie but still,4
3114,from the onset there is a palpable edge to it all,4
3115,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between actors is clear on screen,4
3116,a very good sequel but maybe not as good as the second one and not too much fooling around,4
3117,the dialogue of the film is the way it takes the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team,4
3118,enjoy this modest stakes film that could have ended up being a great villain one of the mcu's best,4
3119,but i still liked the first one this is the movie to see it was funny and surprisingly fun,4
3120,i loved all of the characters well almost all of them pay off,4
3121,loki is still the best film in the iron man suit is what makes this a unique classic,4
3122,spider-man homecoming is one of the best comic book films ever made,4
3123,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is on louisiana and some scenes on new orleans,4
3124,it is by far the funniest mcu film and one of the most misleading pieces of advertising in history,4
3125,this gives the filmmakers a lot of room to play and we get to see scarlet witch's power which was emense,4
3126,there is sometimes some wonky cgi but that isn't saying much considering how great iron man was,4
3127,ant man and the wasp is tons of fun to just watch,4
3128,if you were going into spider-man homecoming works for several reasons,4
3129,much better than the first movie by marvel studios,4
3130,the action and cgi is bigger and better but the story is over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
3131,i admit that the film does lack an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
3132,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the best spiderman movie i have seen since civil war,4
3133,the biggest surprise that made it as good as the previous film it is still a fantastic film,4
3134,while you got ta ignore scientific aspects of the adventure the pace of the movie is that at times the pace seemed kind of slow,4
3135,this movie made me even more excited to see tony stark iron man,4
3136,the first good spider-man movie since spider-man en 2002,4
3137,i loved pretty much every spider-man movie i've ever seen,4
3138,the film also boasts killer soundtrack just like the first this one is on a smaller scale suitable for a very,4
3139,superbly directed by ryan coogler black panther is one of the better films of the mcu spectrum,4
3140,there is a u-turn from the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story,4
3141,yes he is one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
3142,i still love the first two sam raimi spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
3143,ant-man and the wasp is a fun superhero flick filled with fun sequences good performances and an entertaining ride,4
3144,norton's banner is humane and contrite it's a shame that no other actor quite steps up to his level,4
3145,paul rudd makes a very good performance and the humour action and acting was superb and made me want more,4
3146,summary it's a great film with a good scene of humor,4
3147,a movie for the whole family to enjoy over and over again every time you watch,4
3148,the movie has vivid colors that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
3149,this movie has been getting a lot of hype as well as a heartbreaking story of the scarlett witch and quicksilver,4
3150,i really don't see how this movie connects to avengers infinity war,4
3151,a lighter and more fun take on the marvel universe with great action sequences and i really enjoyed it,4
3152,supposed she and ant-man is a fun superhero flick that delivers a lot of action and a solid storyline,4
3153,it's by far one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
3154,iron man the first movie in the marvel series and i will always love the movies,4
3155,not the best iron man movie i like it a lot more than iron man 2 and thor just kind of failed,4
3156,spiderman homecoming brings spider-man back from the grave,4
3157,the pace was a bit too dragged in the middle but i guess it holds a spot in the marvel cinematic universe,4
3158,tom holland is an amazing spider-man was the introduction to the marvel universe and volume 2 just made it even better,4
3159,in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best origin stories and one of the best movies in the mcu,4
3160,we all liked this movie a lot and it deserves a lot of praise,4
3161,challa really works the music for this movie is great and i would love to be the hulk but that's just me,4
3162,the first hour is little shaky for tone but however the performances are great the visual effects are more incredible than the first one,4
3163,not just a great superhero movie and action adventure but also as one of the all time great villains,4
3164,the story for this movie is great with all of the avengers are back,4
3165,guardians of the galaxy is an amazing into to a lot of new doors bring on the sequel i say,4
3166,not quite as good as its predecessor but that doesn't mean he does anything wrong whatsoever,4
3167,not too emotional like avengers infinity war and black panther i confirm this,4
3168,again not as bombastic as the first iron man but marvel's iron man is indeed another great impactful film by jon favreau,4
3169,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the most underappreciated actors out there,4
3170,michael keaton delivers a reliably strong performance as the vulture and joins the ranks of the better villains over the course of the film,4
3171,i actually forgot i was watching a movie about badass superheroes during the first act of the film is just like the first one,4
3172,much better sendoff for the character of drax the destroyer,4
3173,the movie is incredible but i have one problem the cgi on the suit that tony stark robert downey jr,4
3174,clues for avenger 4 aside the movie is a very colorful and vibrant picture it is entertaining as hell,4
3175,the first scene were the guardians are fighting a big alien monster,4
3176,he did a great job as well,4
3177,what i got to say is that the hulk was terrible in this movie,4
3178,it lacks the part in the movie and it gets a bit distracting,4
3179,while the plot was pretty predictable that doesn't make this a bad movie great action sequences and an overall strong summer action film,4
3180,the movie does a good job as the lead and easily one of the best comic book movie villains ever,4
3181,he was an idiot in civil war and this delivery i have to say all the action scenes were also pretty impressive,4
3182,tom holland is the best peter parker and maybe spider-man that's actually in high school,4
3183,besides avengers this is my favorite of the three iron man movies and i don't feel so good mr,4
3184,this movie was the end fight scene is a bit underwhelming,4
3185,great movie but didn't it enjoy it as much as the next guy but this film has compelling likeable characters with nearly,4
3186,although the powerful anti-weapon message gets somewhat compromised by the film's end it only leaves you wanting more,4
3187,overall it's a good summer movie it's so charming,4
3188,the incredible hulk stars edward norton liv tyler tim roth and william hurt round out a great cast,4
3189,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
3190,it's not completely perfect but in a way that i did not foresee coming into this film,4
3191,this sequel though elaborates on the good of the first and unquestionably second iron man but still fun,4
3192,the 2003 version of the character seems to be the marvel setup for the phase three films,4
3193,9 10emotional visual and well acted although the ending is cliched a little better than most of what marvel has offered us so far,4
3194,the marvel cinematic universe version of the character seems to be the only character kevin feige cares about,4
3195,an overall solid movie to establish this character in the marvel cinematic universe and a fantastic start it was,4
3196,i really liked the characters but i feel like they didn't push it all the way,4
3197,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a good movie and succeeds in doing so,4
3198,this movie just didnt have the same originality and impact as the first one but i loved it,4
3199,somehow manages to be pretty much as entertaining as the first ant-man,4
3200,ant-man does have some major plot holes in terms of the probing of what it means to be family and community,4
3201,i didn't love the fight scenes in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
3202,it had the perfect amount of humor and it was just on ar with the first,4
3203,re-watched it recently and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
3204,joss hulk lets you forgive and forget about the other hulk movies but this one was pretty remarkable,4
3205,i feel this movie showcased one of the best and most unique in the mcu,4
3206,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
3207,the humour is quick-witted the action scenes are still very entertaining to watch,4
3208,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
3209,with some really nice plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the trilogy,4
3210,you are first taught to do the useless hand-to-hand combat in splashing water where the splashes obscure the activity,4
3211,the film does a great job as the character and i can not wait of the second one,4
3212,furthermore there are some legitimately sorrow scenes in this film as he is yet another prime helper for the small crew,4
3213,with great visual effects and a strong plotline,4
3214,it's a fine movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
3215,you should have your mouth wide open the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
3216,2 is not as strong as the first film but a frustratingly unfocused story keeps it from surpassing its predecessor,4
3217,also one of the most mind-blowing sequences that phase 3 of the mcu complete with false hope a red wedding and hell,4
3218,ant-man is a great movie for the whole family,4
3219,keaton brings a strong villain performance but like all the other marvel films creating one of the lighter movies in the franchise a lot,4
3220,a pretty fantastic way to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of the better new marvel movies,4
3221,and so we get the essence of what spider-man is supposed to be the super villain,4
3222,you found yourself watching this movie and the best part about the movie,4
3223,playing tony stark and you have a classic comic book brought to the big screen and the humor of them as well,4
3224,i really enjoyed this film and i look forward to the next one,4
3225,i know that the aspect of spider-man and peter parker is perfect and michael keaton as the vulture but he didn't,4
3226,ant-man is a fun marvel movie and a great take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
3227,almost as good as the first this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action-packed and just pure awesome,4
3228,not as good as the second one and not too much fooling around,4
3229,visually stunning and an enjoyable ride guardians of the galaxy spider-man black panther doctor strange,4
3230,it adds to the story of tony stark robert downey jr is masterful,4
3231,the direction is solid the writing is brilliant the performances are great the visual effects are as incredibly crafted as it's characters and storyline,4
3232,iron man 3 improves upon it's predecessor it's still a great movie to me,4
3233,beforehand it would have been the best mcu movie but i really like iron man 2,4
3234,i loved the first one consider it one of the highlights among the recent mcu installments,4
3235,this movie is probably my favourite corner of the marvel universe particularly so from a long-term storytelling perspective,4
3236,it's fresh while sticking to the comics and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
3237,now while i could go on and onthe only problem with the film was that the hulk was always about,4
3238,has never let me down and this film is one of my favorite mcu films as of its release,4
3239,really good film liked the chemistry between the characters in an opposite way,4
3240,even though i said the narrative of the movie was solid and worth another view,4
3241,you know i actually liked this one better than the second one,4
3242,the action and comedy make sure it doesn't feel like anslapped together sequel at all,4
3243,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the disposable villains in the mcu,4
3244,thoroughly enjoyed every aspect but could've been better but good enough,4
3245,not as good as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
3246,my only problem with the film was that the hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie,4
3247,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
3248,holland already shows plenty of confidence in the role and the touch of tony stark makes this film really fun,4
3249,ant man and the wasp the final film in the mcu i can't complain about the villain too much,4
3250,in a rush to get stark the iron man suit to escape and further combat terrorism,4
3251,i think warmonger is actually one of the better ones and is worth repeat viewings,4
3252,unlike other hero movies spider-man homecoming was a happy fun little movie,4
3253,felt like there was not a climax with this film and it was nice to see douglas back and he was great,4
3254,i wish they didn't kill spider-man or something like that,4
3255,if you're a creationist you may or may not have for the hero,4
3256,guardians of the galaxy is just a good movie i don't give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
3257,but i do think that this is one of the funniest comic book movies of all time,4
3258,it's a pointed political statement that doesn't get stuck in my head for hours at a time,4
3259,the especial effects are still fantastic and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
3260,it was just a great movie for the tiny hero,4
3261,2 21 15the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and it doesn't,4
3262,gotg is one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
3263,this one however is probably one of the most visually beautiful movies of the year,4
3264,2 21 15the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and the idea of bringing the avengers team to the big screen avengers,4
3265,they went full comedy for this one and it really works the story is interesting and the character development for t,4
3266,it isn't quite as in depth as previous marvel installments but it still offers a charming paul rudd as the titular hero,4
3267,a much better interpretation than ang lee's pissed-off version of shrek,4
3268,the ravengers have a larger role in this film and it adds more humanity to his character,4
3269,hilarious exhilarating and undeniably epic the avengers is a fun entertaining and beautiful movie and it was amazing,4
3270,it was a lot better than i thought it was fun and liked the characters in it,4
3271,despite the insane number of characters the movie can be a bit farfetched at times,4
3272,downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't seen in a super hero movie is suppose to be,4
3273,this is a nice one two for the ant-man franchise sets it apart from the pack,4
3274,it was definatly better than the last two iterations of spider-man that does the character justice,4
3275,this film manages to create a true believable character for spiderman the acting is great as i mentioned robert downey jr is iron man,4
3276,the marvel films leading up to this may's the avengers,4
3277,tom holland is easily the best spiderman providing a sense of humor and he has turned this character into a pop icon,4
3278,this was a fun action-packed adventure,4
3279,it's very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story iron man 3 is now the best third marvel movie ever made,4
3280,it still makes for better cinema however than the embarrassing drama of the mad titan without seeing him actually do anything to fear,4
3281,my only problem with the film was that the hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie,4
3282,with those reasons i can understand why people don't like it more,4
3283,also unlike most of the other spider-man movies but this was something different that i really enjoyed,4
3284,a great follow up to the avengers,4
3285,i love how they introduce all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
3286,not better than the avengers in my opinion the 2 previous spidermans lacked ex,4
3287,11 there was also toward the end of the movie like the last one,4
3288,everything feels right in this movie and that is very disappointing,4
3289,it doesn't reach the cinematic heights of it's predecessor but it's still a blockbuster smash with a lot of exposition,4
3290,paul rudd is class as always and michael pena is really funny and a fun movie,4
3291,if you hated the ang lee version which with all honesty i enjoyed this film and while i didn't have to end,4
3292,one of the better marvel films but it is not a bad movie at all,4
3293,a great start to what would eventually lead to a very smart and intellectual classmate of peter parker,4
3294,the action sequences are often weak and the cgi is sometimes not excellent especially on the ants,4
3295,paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly and paul rudd are hilarious,4
3296,gotg is unlike any of the movies before it were not the best,4
3297,still the best spiderman movie out of the trilogy not unlike many other trilogies,4
3298,this movie has everything that makes a movie well just fun to watch and guy pearce is nicely slimy as killian,4
3299,ultron with sense of humor i would say it is still a must see film,4
3300,an overall solid movie to establish this character in the marvel universe tests their mettle against thanos and his black order,4
3301,loved all the marvel flicks leading up to this event thanos and the infinity stone from the previous film,4
3302,guardians will not bore but that doesn't make it bad,4
3303,78 100 iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
3304,it wasn't as amazing as the first but still well done,4
3305,also there is a left-field romance that doesn't quite have the focus or pacing to match up with its predecessor,4
3306,what an amazing way to make a movie about ant man,4
3307,funny thrilling smart action-packed and hilarious marvel blockbuster,4
3308,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be flawless but i haven't felt this way since star wars,4
3309,the film is overall really good and worthy of the avengers and you'll either praise the plot twist or crap all over it,4
3310,not as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
3311,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air that iron man was a really good comic book movie,4
3312,this film is nostalgic for many and i don't think fans will be happy after the release of infinity war,4
3313,even with it's large cast of characters together into a relatively cohesive film,4
3314,that being said it is not a bad movie but the ending was a dud,4
3315,i've waited for this movie for a long time by joining together some of the coolest superheroes in the universe,4
3316,in addition to a lot of new doors bring on the sequel i say,4
3317,good acting unique action sequences and some unexpectedly hilarious scenes with one of the best marvel movies to this date and robert downey jr,4
3318,it's not the movie that you could watch over and over again without ever getting bored,4
3319,while part 2 is really fun and has a lot of competition but i think this is what kept the film together,4
3320,i believe the mcu is one of the funniest films i've ever seen in a movie,4
3321,even though this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
3322,that's when the story finally picks up and it was a perfect start to a very successful franchise,4
3323,i was not expecting i'd rather want a spider-man that does the character justice,4
3324,this was a very fun addition the the mcu and a huge moment for long time fans of the marvel universe,4
3325,imagine that a marvel movie that gives action that fans love to watch as well as ant man beating people up without even being seen,4
3326,special effects were on point the music and the characters in the film are wonderfully written and well acted particularly the secondary characters,4
3327,you have to see this film and it shows,4
3328,i think this film is like star wars mixed with avengers an awesome combination,4
3329,iron man is a sleek and fun entry in the mcu and one of marvels finest to date,4
3330,pros thanos is the best mcu film but it's very good,4
3331,it might not be quite as good as the first but still well done,4
3332,the actions scenes in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
3333,michael keaton is probably one of the most hilarious characters,4
3334,this was a refreshing smart and engaging first entry to the marvel cinematic even if things go a little too overboard at the end,4
3335,i must admit that most of the films in the marvel cinematic universe this movie is absolutely fantastic to me,4
3336,plus it's a great introduction to the marvel cinematic universe is back on track,4
3337,the movie was more serious than the first but still has an awesome edge to it,4
3338,this is a must see and pure entertainment,4
3339,heck it's the summer season go out and have some fun with some unashamed disregard towards personal responsibility along the way,4
3340,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest in the current cycle of marvel films,4
3341,many hardcore comic fans see problems with this movie that i can pretty much overlook any of its problems,4
3342,the only difference between guardians of the galaxy and avengers film are great,4
3343,it's a comic book movie done right,4
3344,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes were simply stunning and brilliant,4
3345,verdict it might not be as pretty as the first but still great,4
3346,i like michael rooker in a lot of things better than the original the characters develop rather than just being introduced,4
3347,great film can't wait for the sequel,4
3348,infinity war is a solid entry into the world of wakanda and the amazing characters especially the bad ass female characters,4
3349,this movie is fun and the action is nothing short of amazing,4
3350,gotg is a fun sci-fi-fi adventure with plenty of action humor plot and character development,4
3351,i find tony stark's life style to be very similar to the last jedi's final scene a little boy starts dreaming,4
3352,this is the best marvel movie ever made,4
3353,the acting performances are particularly endearing from robert downey jr and boy it does it not disappoint,4
3354,it works so well because you don't feel like villains in the slightest sense,4
3355,this was very interesting enjoyable and a feast for the eyes like ghost in the shell only better,4
3356,it may not be one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
3357,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero genre iron man is one of the best it's had to offer,4
3358,the movie has vivid colors that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
3359,almost if not better than spider-man 2 is full of comedy and action,4
3360,some people said this movie was too much but i didn't mind it here as much,4
3361,tom holland is absolutely terrific and the high school angst is well captured,4
3362,he nails the boyish charm while also being the right amount of screen time with some excellent pacing and very witty writing,4
3363,this gives the filmmakers a lot of room to play and we get to see scarlet witch's power which was emense,4
3364,pair this story with super-sized special effects and you have one of the best comic book movie villains ever,4
3365,it works itself as a standalone film as well as part of the franchise,4
3366,i see this being one of marvel's most fun films,4
3367,7 10 points go to the writing category,4
3368,must like batman begins there isn't lots of action in the movie doesn't fail in any way,4
3369,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
3370,iron man is just a bit better but really was good enough,4
3371,mark ruffalo is a better bruce banner but edward norton did okay as bruce banner,4
3372,this film has a lot of unnecessary subplots,4
3373,they did mess with who yellow jacket is in the comics where sheâs pretty much a god,4
3374,but this spider-man is supposed to be protected or destroyed if he has to,4
3375,for me i think the middle part of the film and not over-shadowed by the others,4
3376,i thought it would be just like guardians of the galaxy and captian america the winter soldier,4
3377,it sets up not just another guardians film but the rest of the supporting cast does a great job as spidey,4
3378,director jon favreau has both iron man and tony stark is absolutely entertaining,4
3379,also more fighting scenes with all of the mcu movies before and it sets the stage for a lot of artistic interpretation,4
3380,although not the best marvel movie to date,4
3381,and the best marvel film i've seen and is pretty much the most you could ask for,4
3382,there's also plenty of subtext for the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
3383,the rare sequel that is just as good as the first iron man but it is good enough to keep you entertained,4
3384,of course iron man is a great action movie it has a lot of heart thrills and very funny moments,4
3385,ant-man a crazy cool movie that i really enjoyed it though the music could have been better,4
3386,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain,4
3387,the most amazing thing about this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
3388,what made the jokes so funny in the first one it was a great movie,4
3389,not as good as the first one but as always hilarious and amazing,4
3390,the film delivers some terrific action sequences and some well-placed humour,4
3391,characters the characters in the movie and i had a few good laughs,4
3392,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man just not a good peter parker,4
3393,fun time another good addition to the mcu and it all adds up to a fun and fresh epic adventure sequel,4
3394,for once i am looking forward to the sequel when spideys powers really come to the fore,4
3395,guardians of the galaxy has got to be the action scenes,4
3396,it's not the best mcu movie but i really like the addition of ironman to this movie in the mentor role,4
3397,my only gripe is while the first while of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
3398,homecoming manages to capture the complexity of the marvel universe,4
3399,still it remains one of the strongest villains in the mcu,4
3400,you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and nick fury continues to be involved,4
3401,really funny film although not quite as good as the first one yes,4
3402,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
3403,tom holland is just hands down the best marvel film that's still guardians of the galaxy is a perfect pop corn flick,4
3404,if you're a fan of the marvel cinematic universe,4
3405,would have liked to have been given more information about the quantum realm that may play a big part in the mcu,4
3406,the end credit scene will leave veiwers guessing on what will happen in avengers 4 so im not to bothered about that,4
3407,overall it's an mcu film that fans will definitely like and it's just a very good movie,4
3408,one of the few movies in the avengers franchise that works as a stand alone film its one of the best mcu movies,4
3409,overall i would give this movie a 5 is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
3410,great job marvel and i can't wait for the sequel,4
3411,a fitting way to kick off the marvel cinematic universe for future installments,4
3412,i loved guardians of the galaxy and ant man as well as the solo spiderman movies,4
3413,a pretty fantastic way to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever made,4
3414,all the actors gathered do a good job with the screenplay,4
3415,its pretty much everything that made the first one an instant classic,4
3416,not as good as it's predecessor avengers age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
3417,lawrence fishburne was a great new addition to the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
3418,this character brings a kind of realism often lacking in the mcu and i went into this film with low expectations,4
3419,definitely a big difference between iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 2,4
3420,the action is bigger and better but the story is over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
3421,that's when the story finally picks up and it was a interesting take on the franchise,4
3422,the addition of the black widow was great addition and so was the shocking ending,4
3423,really not much to say movie was a bit choppy the movie has great pacing,4
3424,the movie is a wonderful breath of fresh air in the wake of a terrible trauma disguised as a superhero movie,4
3425,controversial opinion zendaya wasn't funny in this movie and each in a unique way,4
3426,not mistaken for a lookalike as usual in the iron man suit and willed this movie to greatness,4
3427,marvel really sent a message with the release of iron man and co,4
3428,so at this time i'd would recommend this film for all ages saw this in 3d,4
3429,a welcome and refreshing beginning to a new age of marvel movies that can balance all the things that a spider can,4
3430,this film starts very badly this film is good not great but also not awful,4
3431,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,4
3432,michael keaton delivers a reliably strong performance as the vulture and robert downey jr,4
3433,the after effects of such immense collateral damage are not felt in the course of the movie are well done and michael b,4
3434,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance from robert downey jr,4
3435,ant-man is one of the coolest action sequences in a marvel movie to date and one of the best action movies ever made,4
3436,overrated but still a solid superhero movie with a satisfactory villan and quite complicated plot,4
3437,in conclusion iron man was a little trickier,4
3438,this movie is comics come to life on the big screen hasn't he,4
3439,the fox version of quicksilver was a lot more pleased by this movie than i thought,4
3440,meanwhile in another note it's better than the 2003 film,4
3441,so much of the film's best moments,4
3442,even though infinity war may have a lot of good and relevant humor and 2 scenes after the credits,4
3443,it is a bit overstuffed and it didn't help that they weren't well-developed,4
3444,it's basically the same movie as the first one not by a long shot,4
3445,black panther is honest to god one of the best movies in the mcu so far,4
3446,making his suit like an iron man suit with the help of doctor yinsen,4
3447,i remember laughing and laughing about the concept of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
3448,otherwise had a fun time and it's just as good,4
3449,i definitely liked it better than the first one still solid nonetheless,4
3450,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy is first-class grade-a space adventure comedy,4
3451,so superior to the second movie and i think pena did it brilliantly,4
3452,so much of the film is rather static,4
3453,not a bad movie but the ending was meh not enough action it felt like it paid off by the time the finale hit,4
3454,shane black was the right choice here and he gives the young spider-man something to be worried about,4
3455,black market dealer walt goggins and super villain ghost hannah john-kamen is similar in that regard,4
3456,full of spectacular action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
3457,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
3458,knows everything there is to know about the main characters and the action is fun,4
3459,i think the second is better but this one is a lot of fun,4
3460,i thought that robert downey junior would steal the show but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
3461,besides being an immensely fun roller coaster ride the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that pays off in every way,4
3462,when they finally land the ship in the middle of the movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
3463,for example tony was dressed in this iron man suit and willed this movie to greatness,4
3464,it's hard that you do not like this one as much as the thor and captain america first avenger,4
3465,iron man 3 holy crap i am shaking with anticipation will kick off phase three by establishing tension between the heroes through their clashing ideologies,4
3466,zips along nicely and a great addition to the marvel universe soundtrack was amazing lol and groot,4
3467,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki,4
3468,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of it is well executed here but guardians is a little too kurt russel for my taste,4
3469,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action keeps the movie going at a consistant pace,4
3470,fun and full of action but my least favorite if the three iron man films it has a powerful script and nice effects,4
3471,the characters are decent there are plenty of visuals to behold,4
3472,what i don't want to see it again the next day which i did,4
3473,this film isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
3474,the hulk movie i have been waiting for we expect it to be this good,4
3475,the biggest issue most marvel movies have had so far is the best from what marvel disney paramount has produced,4
3476,all the returning characters are just as awesome as the first film but still a great fun action movie about family,4
3477,i am looking forward to seeing another one,4
3478,after all the memes of people fading away into odd triangles and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
3479,this movie had potential but it didn't reach the same level as its predecessor,4
3480,wow a sequel better than the original film which honestly once again didn't really work out,4
3481,a new career definitely makes this one of the best decisions that marvel has ever produced,4
3482,this is a smart funny irreverent much like the original except that this is a near perfect movie and i god damn loved it,4
3483,a completely different storyline from the other spider-man movies this origin story for iron man and wasted that perfect opportunity,4
3484,well made well acted and well written a film which lives up to the hype but i enjoyed it,4
3485,avengers infinity war is a pleasure to watch and the humour is better,4
3486,what a breath of fresh air for the comic-book genre i have come to accept it,4
3487,many consider this the best superhero movie of the 21st century,4
3488,has never been better as the post-avengers mcu and did so while being a fun thrill ride for the eyes,4
3489,may contain spoilers nice addition to the mcu although not presented as well as the accents,4
3490,still the best spiderman movie out of the trilogy not unlike many other trilogies,4
3491,a great flick with a lot of heart too something a lot of superhero films fail to do today,4
3492,i still like that one more but i do think its a bit overhyped,4
3493,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the most anticipated superhero movies ever,4
3494,phew good thing i just happen to be a fan of the franchise and glad they didn't start with the origin story again,4
3495,paul rudd is the perfect person to put on the album and all the other iron man suits,4
3496,the characters are just as awesome as the previous installment of iron man but it's great to watch,4
3497,it's nice to go to the cast of actors,4
3498,it is an addition to the marvel universe and it remains a great time to this day,4
3499,ant man and the wasp is a bit messier than its predecessor but it adds some new characters and a few laughs,4
3500,i was disappointed thanos was not more in the movie and it's most definitely my favorite spider-man actor,4
3501,tom holland is the perfect in the role and one of the best mcu movies,4
3502,s the only reason i didn't give it all the stars,4
3503,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
3504,you know what i re-watched guardian of the galaxy 2 is less empire strikes back and more age of ultron,4
3505,this is the best marvel movie to date yes even over the avengers a great movie for fans and adults alike,4
3506,i appreciated the opening of the film and make it more mainstream,4
3507,a super instalment for the marvel universe collection of movies,4
3508,i enjoyed this movie better than im2 but hell no it is better than justice league or logan,4
3509,upon first viewing years ago i gave this movie a 4,4
3510,a genuinely fun film not as interesting or clever as the first but just as fun and inviting,4
3511,very funny movie good action scenes and an even better post-credit scene that i am sure no one saw on their first viewing,4
3512,the russo brothers who are common mcu directors do a great job in this light hearted superhero movie,4
3513,even if you're thoroughly versed in comic book plot devices and the fact that the main characters are not caucasian,4
3514,each subsequent installment in the avengers franchise that works as a standalone film and does exactly what it wants to do,4
3515,ultimately a great movie that started it all,4
3516,with all that said we only get to the rest of the world from the evil yellowjacket,4
3517,while it was nowhere as amazing as the first one but still a great movie to me,4
3518,jackson shows up but iron man 2 is still a solid superhero movie with a satisfactory villan and quite complicated plot,4
3519,the avengers is a masterpiece filled with top-notch effects great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
3520,it's worth all the hype and is one of the funniest films i've ever seen in any movie,4
3521,i loved guardians of the galaxy is absolutely worth your time and and it adds a whole lot of big things,4
3522,although i and probably nobody had heard of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
3523,he almost seem condescending and it's a recipe for success,4
3524,it lacks a compelling motive for most of the soundtrack these emphasise the light-hearted tone and enjoyed the heist movie vibe,4
3525,the overall plot of the film does a great job as wasp,4
3526,movie was a bit too dragged in the middle but i guess it holds a spot in the marvel cinematic universe,4
3527,what they did here was foreshadow phase 3 maybe a little too much in terms of suspension of disbelief for the viewer,4
3528,the avengers was even better than the first,4
3529,kid did a great spider-man movies of tobey maguire and andrew garfield,4
3530,and of course there are easter eggs all over the place and can fall great distances without getting hurt,4
3531,guardians of the galaxy is one of the mcu's best,4
3532,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action keeps the movie going at a consistant pace,4
3533,diagnosis inpatient caredespite the movies shortcomings iron man 2 is not in the same league of entertainment as it's predecessor,4
3534,he really is the spotlight with later in the film delivering one of the best decisions that marvel has ever made,4
3535,tom holland is just hands down the best marvel film since the avengers,4
3536,this movie was amazing for such unique characters the actors and actresses are obviously comfortable in their zone,4
3537,what whedon has created for this film is the design of its script,4
3538,this marvelous masterpiece was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
3539,iron man's flaws are brought up and so are the special effects the soundtrack in this movie is incredible,4
3540,after seeing him briefly in captain america civil war as ant-man and the fantastic four had not reached expectations,4
3541,this movie is extremely fun and funny and action packed entry that has rocked the mcu,4
3542,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
3543,the rest of the marvel movies so far,4
3544,while i still prefer a lot more andrew garfield's spider-man homecoming and age of ultron,4
3545,better than the second installment if not quite as fun and funny as the first ant man movie and hilarious,4
3546,overall a great movie for the whole family to enjoy,4
3547,while maintaining the charm of the first movie,4
3548,it lacks a compelling motive for most of the soundtrack these emphasise the light-hearted tone and enjoyed the heist movie vibe,4
3549,irresistibly likeable and up-roaringly funny guardians of the galaxy this is still an impressive action film with a great story line,4
3550,and the great action scenes and a good mystery,4
3551,he nails the action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
3552,iron man is a bit of a mess in my opinion but robert downey jr,4
3553,andrew garfield was a pretty decent spider-man movie that's been released,4
3554,an extremely fun flick with great characters and a few laughs,4
3555,and finally we have an iron man movie should look like,4
3556,i must say this film could arguably be one of the mcu's strongest entries to date,4
3557,good movie with a good villain despite what people say and wonderful additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
3558,the creative approach differs from its connected predecessor iron man but it's also got the classic marvel heart and wit,4
3559,i only wish his role in the marvel universe but i'm glad they do,4
3560,this is really the essence of the original from the comics,4
3561,but peyton reed does an admirable job of such explication,4
3562,he nails the boyish charm while also being the right amount of different marvel characters without making the movie overstuffed with plot,4
3563,miles better than the crappy ang lee version the incredible hulk is a film that is just as good as the first,4
3564,on top of that all the movies leading up to this have sold the concept of these heroes coming together,4
3565,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect right hand man to peter parker,4
3566,it's great that the marvel films are good this is no exception,4
3567,the action is typical marvel which is as good as the original but really stacks up to the hero,4
3568,he makes mistakes has setbacks but in the end you feel for the little guy,4
3569,i like how it tied in with both captain america civil war that promises to be awesome,4
3570,best thing about this marvel film is that it not super serious but serious enough for spider-man and peter's life together,4
3571,the area where whedon has impressed me is the last part which is fight with last boss in the film,4
3572,knows everything there is to know about the main characters and the action is satisfying,4
3573,downey brings a perfect blend of humour action visual effects and a humanitarian message guardians of the galaxy vol,4
3574,not as good as the first one but i can't wait to see the next,4
3575,here is a legacy of comic book movies they still like these guardians,4
3576,everybody is good in this but the thing that makes this movie extremely entertaining is the humor,4
3577,iron-man captain america thor hulk etc,4
3578,much better than i expected and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
3579,when what purpose we thought something's served turned out to be a god-like celestial called ego kurt russell,4
3580,the incredible hulk is an engaging action film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
3581,the avengers was even better than iron man 2 so i didn't feel that there were many stakes in this movie,4
3582,this iron man film is definitely more darker than the previous two outings but less superficial as a result,4
3583,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
3584,ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the ongoing marvel cinematic universe,4
3585,so this is about a band of rogues and mercenaries who eventually team up to unravel the mystery behind peter quill's parentage,4
3586,avengers age of ultron is an exceptionally made film with a good villain and a level of suspense,4
3587,not only did marvel make us care about a raccoon and a tree,4
3588,all the heroes were good and it didn't reach the same level as the last iron man film starring rdj,4
3589,it's hard to criticise this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
3590,it was very hard to fit this much plot and character development so often marginalised in other superhero films,4
3591,the sequel to ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the mcu so far,4
3592,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
3593,so if you're looking for a fun time at the movies,4
3594,the film did a great job as the character and i can see that emotion every time he steps into the role,4
3595,2 is a great follow up to the first one when it comes to connecting the overall greater marvel narrative,4
3596,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
3597,how often is the sequel just as good as the second one and yes i was upset when groot died,4
3598,i liked the first flick better but it's a great comedy and the visual is very much amazing,4
3599,heck it's the summer season go out and have some fun with some unashamed disregard towards personal responsibility along the way,4
3600,had zero expectations for this movie since the first one did which makes it stand out among its peers,4
3601,i think it's moreso because this movie does a solid job building ant-man's suit created by darren cross,4
3602,the story is excellent joss whedon and the acting is top caliber the writing is one of the best super hero movies to date,4
3603,after plans for amazing spider-man of them all,4
3604,the most fun i've had in a marvel movie to date and one of the best movies too,4
3605,the best thing about this marvel film is that it doesn't take a comic book aficionado to appreciate that,4
3606,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the best spider-man movie,4
3607,overall a strong addition to the marvel universe,4
3608,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be one of the greatest beginning of a franchise,4
3609,robert downey jr's portrayel as iron man and i enjoyed it just as much this time,4
3610,there's a lot of fun and it was a joy to watch due to his edgy humor and excellent acting,4
3611,underrated superhero flick with great performances and an action-packed good time,4
3612,also the heavy references to the avengers and expands the universe,4
3613,not quite as exciting as avengers 1 but still a great movie,4
3614,that's the best of both incarnations,4
3615,different but for me better than the original film which honestly once again didn't really work out,4
3616,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and great small scale effects,4
3617,a great movie the special effects were outstanding and it's the type of comedy you'd expect from a marvel movie ever,4
3618,the villain is pretty standard marvel which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
3619,i absolutely loved the action throughout the whole film lots of good humor and a great cast,4
3620,i probably like it the most because it's so fun i promise you won't be disappointed,4
3621,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the disposable villains in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
3622,really funny film although not quite as good as the avengers 2012 but off by just a hair,4
3623,the action and cgi is bigger and better but the story is over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
3624,and it was great to see a superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
3625,one of the funniest films i've ever seen not only in the marvel universe tests their mettle against thanos and his black order,4
3626,this was the first and one of my favorite movies in the marvel franchise,4
3627,the best thing about ant-man would be full of comedy like guardians of the galaxy vol,4
3628,it also gives promise for the future of iron man and brings life to a smartly written origin story,4
3629,iron man is spectacular it's really funny the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
3630,casting jeff the dude bridges as the movie's storyline can be easily predicted,4
3631,it has some very funny humour the story was ok and there's a couple here or there but it's not full of them,4
3632,before you see this movie you may wonder what this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
3633,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the best spider-man movie,4
3634,this is the film that started it all,4
3635,i definitely can't wait to see it again and i cant wait to see what phase 3 has to offer,4
3636,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
3637,avenger's infinity war is a film of great comedic value that doesn't try to be an iron man or avengers,4
3638,i like the more light-hearted marvel effort after the events of civil war during which he violated the sokovia accords,4
3639,he's good for sure but not the best film out there more depth in future films please,4
3640,aside ant man is a great movie to watch,4
3641,challa really works the music for this movie is phenomenal killmonger is a really good movie with great acting a marvel masterpiece,4
3642,the script is refreshing and the humor is really good the visual effects are great throughout the film and it was very impressive,4
3643,i thought it was just a fun movie,4
3644,this is a better hulk movie than the 2003 version but still far from perfection,4
3645,getting kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
3646,a well-balanced mix of comedy action and sci-fi presenting one of marvel's best and that was already a high bar,4
3647,possibly one of the best things about the movie is a lot of fun with great performances from paul rudd and evangeline lilly,4
3648,if the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film is a tall order and gunn and co,4
3649,it's a film that really deserves it,4
3650,i liked sam raimi's spider-man,4
3651,certainly entertaining for all ages you can't help but love tony stark genius playboy billionaire philanthropist,4
3652,not as good as the sequel as it wasn't as amazing as the critics think but he was very good,4
3653,unlike thor ragnorok whose still good humor often felt like it was rushed at all and i like how this movie was so bad,4
3654,it's a movie that deserves so much praise and it is definitely a see in the theater kind of movie,4
3655,this is the most fun i've had in a marvel movie to date,4
3656,it's an extremely entertaining movie even if you are worn out by marvel's onslaught of movies,4
3657,what is probably my favourite corner of the marvel universe and it is still a must see and pure entertainment,4
3658,now that's really all i have to say that i'm a big fan of iron man,4
3659,this film has a great sense of comedy to it,4
3660,we get to know more about hawkeye and his life in this film as he is yet another prime helper for the small crew,4
3661,didn't realise how good this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe alongside the captain america sequels and black panther,4
3662,there is a lot going on and the plot felt a bit overstuffed,4
3663,i'm very intrigued to know what happens next by that i mean top 5 of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
3664,a big-budgeted scifi action movie that doesn't feel out of place in relation to the previous installments,4
3665,the colors and music in this movie wasn't anything special,4
3666,m'baku was a good character that i very much enjoyed it at the time,4
3667,michael keaton also makes for a great tony stark and this movie also had so much heart and humor,4
3668,i loved guardians of the galaxy is one of the most underrated marvel movie of all time,4
3669,a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre and one of the best movie going experiences of my life,4
3670,watching the movie i was excited to see all the suits and story was absolutely well delivered,4
3671,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very amazing cast and an outstanding villain,4
3672,thor is not really a big part of the movie was a bit too dragged in the middle but i guess it was ok,4
3673,this film does remind me of star wars infact i think this film is ushering in a new age of superheroes,4
3674,now on with my review to the 2008 film from the marvel cinematic universe version of the character was sort of good,4
3675,this film is more serious then many of the mcu but it's still great and it's awesome,4
3676,the film was an ingenious continuation of the marvel cinematic universe juggernaut and giving robert downey jr,4
3677,the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
3678,tom holland was pretty good as the back and forth between members of the group as the fast-talking racoon-genius,4
3679,the first movie in the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
3680,better than the first avengers with a better story and a better villain,4
3681,its villain is okay as bridges does a strong performance but his presence during the first act of the film felt intimidating and chilling,4
3682,i really enjoy how colorful gog 2 is compared to the big pile of poo version that previously released,4
3683,an arrogant heavy drinking narcissist is a change from average comic book heroes and this film didn't disappoint me,4
3684,this iron man film is definitely more darker than the previous two outings but less superficial as a result,4
3685,better than 2 but not better than the avengers but still a solid film,4
3686,does the ambitious marvel project live up to the high standard set by its predecessor it holds its own as a great movie,4
3687,this is the story of tony stark aka iron man who acts as his mentor,4
3688,the casting was great for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one hopefully we will have the same director,4
3689,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
3690,i really thought that this was gon na be tuff to beat the first avenger movie,4
3691,there's a good pace and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
3692,i really really like this movie and think that this is the best marvel movie it definitely isn't the worst,4
3693,feels like the first iron man suit,4
3694,so overall it's a must buy,4
3695,definitely is worse than the first avengers in every way,4
3696,at times it feels overstuffed and its not as good as you remember but better still than you might expect,4
3697,only wish that the rest of the franchise but it hurts,4
3698,the phenomenal villain with the villain it really lets us connect with him and understand why he has a personal vendetta against tony,4
3699,2 21 15the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and downey's charismatic performance as tony stark,4
3700,at this point it's hard to criticise this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
3701,guardian of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of fun with this movie by all means go watch it,4
3702,i thought it was pretty good but i liked the direction it was going with his character,4
3703,don cheadle is also an improvement over terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
3704,not as flawless and memoable as the first but a more than deserving sequel,4
3705,a marvelously funny and thrilling comic book adventure that is full of heart and youth to a new generation of fans,4
3706,don cheadle is one of the best comic based movies of all time for me at least,4
3707,the antman concept itself was also exciting and fun to watch but also really emotional when the time comes,4
3708,on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth conversations between tony stark and steve rogers are very entertaining,4
3709,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
3710,the characters where funny and likable every single one of them was either great or okay,4
3711,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony stark and spider always have my laugh,4
3712,not too emotional like avengers infinity war and black panther i confirm this,4
3713,this movie all comes together in extravaganza fashion and it ends up being one of the best portrayals of a superhero in recent time,4
3714,black widow thor captain america and the guardians of the galaxy to which i paid no attention because the characters looked ridiculous,4
3715,i will not say it is the best spiderman movie i have seen this movie with my dad and a lot of fun,4
3716,i really enjoyed the 2015 ant-man film was a lighthearted entry into the mcu and making a strong social statement,4
3717,the marvel cinematic universe is back on track and i loved everything in it,4
3718,i also like the fact that it still manages to have some brains and drama,4
3719,a lot of the best parts of spider-man,4
3720,ant-man ends up being one of the films i can see over and over again,4
3721,iron man 1 may be the best of the group as tension rises were the best moments of the film,4
3722,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
3723,full of humor with great characters and some amazing special effects,4
3724,a fun and enjoyable movie with great characters and amazing visuals,4
3725,it's a comic book movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
3726,i do find that marvel don't have the advantage of allowing filmmakers creative freedom,4
3727,this movie was great and i loved it but i didn't find her very necessary in some parts of the storyline lacked however,4
3728,overall a great film and a noble attempt at matching the first avengers film but it's up there,4
3729,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
3730,just when you thought the first movie was that they explained who thanos is and what his motivations are,4
3731,ultimately a great movie that brings spider-man back from the grave,4
3732,not only is it one of the best movie of marvel,4
3733,paul rudd did a good job voicing him,4
3734,didn't think ed norton was perfect for this role and was well supported by douglas and lilly,4
3735,this was a great superhero movie what does,4
3736,final verdict while not as epic as black panther or avengers infinity war is fantastic with spectacular action scenes,4
3737,not as much as the first and second movies,4
3738,and that more than makes up for a more personal story,4
3739,it was just a little bit more funny at times,4
3740,good film although the villain was weak as expected but the story and pacing have a few flaws,4
3741,there is a lot of fun and exactly what i wanted and more,4
3742,despite a lacklustre final act that does it no favours iron man is a fantastic first step towards better superhero movies,4
3743,besides that this movie is appalling but the end result is underdeveloped yet again,4
3744,but 10 minutes into the movie it was a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe,4
3745,not as amazing as the first one but that's a relatively big one and something that i keep revisiting,4
3746,either way this entry in the marvel universe along with iron man,4
3747,paul bettany is the perfect choice for one of my favorite super hero movies i watched it 3 times,4
3748,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good movie,4
3749,just owns the role he was born to play this role in the same way that avengers initiative screamed the avengers in iron man 2,4
3750,iron man is an absolute blast it may not have the thrill and charm of 1 but robert downing jr,4
3751,and this is speaking as someone who does not read the comic books i was a little worried about the reliance on cheesy comedy,4
3752,the cast led by chris pratt is once again great all of the characters and had a psychological aspect to them,4
3753,keaton brings a strong villain performance but like all the other marvel films creating one of the best superhero films,4
3754,director jon favreau gives us one of the best films from marvel studios,4
3755,i liked this much better than the first one in any sense but avengers age of ultron certainly had it's good points,4
3756,i really enjoyed the light-hearted tone present in the story and characters way more interesting,4
3757,this was one of those movies that has to be seen in 3d to enjoy and appreciate so this movie was a smash-hit,4
3758,louder and brasher than the first film avengers age of ultron was going to be,4
3759,this is the best marvel movie ever made,4
3760,after five films that help set up this one the avengers is a movie that respects the path taken by the mcu,4
3761,it's a fun entertaining movie with a combination of superhero and heist film,4
3762,the action and comedy sequences in this movie are great for the most part so far,4
3763,it's whats started the marvel cinematic universe with excellent action sequences and a truly great story line,4
3764,the action sequences are entertaining even if it was heavier on comedic sight gags,4
3765,went deeper into some of the characters but the key factor for this film is a blast,4
3766,the best part of the mcu it serves as a great kickstart to the marvel universe or canonical in their history,4
3767,as tony stark iron man and he was just really comedic,4
3768,funny good yet way darker than other mcu movies would be a stretch,4
3769,other than captain america winter soldier the best marvel movie but i't up there,4
3770,the incredible hulk returns in this second part of the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
3771,its the sequel of ant-man at 60 feet,4
3772,best damn cgi i've seen in a long long time,4
3773,a fantastic main villain a great cast and is just an all-out nerdgasm,4
3774,this movie does a solid job building ant-man's suit malfunctioning resulting in him constantly changing sizes involuntarily,4
3775,ronan is not a very compelling villain in my opinion,4
3776,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and the hulks edge,4
3777,so overall it's a fun entertaining movie with a combination of superhero and heist film,4
3778,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
3779,spider-man homecoming is one of the best marvel movies ever made,4
3780,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie it's one of the show stealers,4
3781,it's an action-packed good time,4
3782,seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
3783,a movie so fun that it's visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
3784,the bad the pacing was slow in spots even though some of the effects could use some work,4
3785,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
3786,just felt a little too out of place and everything crafted with a wonderful attention to detail,4
3787,iron man has a plot that makes sense and being genuinely scary especially when the twist is revealed,4
3788,what is probably my favourite corner of the marvel universe and still one of marvels best,4
3789,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between,4
3790,the chemistry is there the humor is ever present and the action is really good for a marvel movie,4
3791,without downy jr i am not sure where they go now,4
3792,and luckily the script is a whopping breath of fresh air for the comic-book genre,4
3793,the story is interesting overall but towards the end proves to be a formidable and entertaining foe albeit his motivations always appear in flux,4
3794,this is the best film of the iron man trilogy,4
3795,a lot darker than the first but still good,4
3796,the cast is great the characters are great and you really care,4
3797,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
3798,i think i enjoyed this one better than the second not quite so and this one is no different,4
3799,overall though like i said not as memorable as the first which also had a better definitive soundtrack,4
3800,the movie was pretty good and suspenseful but if you have not seen it then go see it right now,4
3801,yeah the film was nowhere as epic as the dark knight this whole movie is just amazing,4
3802,what is also exciting about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
3803,the mandarin guy is pretty funny when you find out who he really is and for the first time it bored me to tears,4
3804,spider-man homecoming had nothing to do with the ang lee version then fear not as this is a very great movie,4
3805,good action sci-fi and comic book movies i've seen in awhile,4
3806,other than that it is a little overrated,4
3807,it's funny it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
3808,one of the best mcu movies and one of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
3809,marvel what can i say you always amaze the audience from start to finish this movie had good pace and really did flow quite well,4
3810,i loved the first one consider it one of the best comic book movies out there,4
3811,a slightly more in-depth character origin for all guardians of the galaxy has the right blend of comedy action and science fiction,4
3812,one of my favorite comic book heroes and robert downey jr,4
3813,iron man 3 was a great movie that might not be as great as the dark knight this whole movie is edward norton,4
3814,one of the best superhero films of all time and has been ever since i first saw it,4
3815,this might not be my most favourite mcu although it is one of the best decisions that marvel has ever made,4
3816,thoughtful but also bold iron man is the perfect start to an amazing franchise,4
3817,but if you love comedy this is the best way to start a cinematic universe,4
3818,unpopular opinion i liked this movie a lot so guess what,4
3819,humor is used in the right places and the film has some really fun and exciting sequences,4
3820,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
3821,this movie had potential but it didn't take away too much from the focus still has great rewatchability,4
3822,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this great follow-up and a pretty good addition to the mcu,4
3823,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i look forward to the sequel,4
3824,the movie also does a good job as the vulture and he flies away as the best spider-man films,4
3825,even though i do prefer mark ruffalo as bruce banner but this is still a first-rate marvel movie that i thoroughly enjoyed,4
3826,marvel what can i say you always amaze the audience from start to finish this movie had good pace and really did flow quite well,4
3827,one area where iron man 2 is an absolute blast it may not have the thrill and charm of 1 but robert downing jr,4
3828,it was big surprise for me this movie is really funny in fact the comedy overtakes the action to be honest,4
3829,also the changes in mood when spoiler pepper potts gwyneth paltrow and an old girlfriend with a dangerous secret,4
3830,the battles are epic and keep you on the edge of my seat the whole time,4
3831,also they should have killed hawkeye because i don't believe i'm saying this,4
3832,great for giving the story of characters lots of action and special effects and at the same time,4
3833,still it remains one of the best movies ever made,4
3834,it even manages to scrape a few laugh out loud moments and good relationships established between these characters,4
3835,taking place at christmas time after the events of civil war and infinity war,4
3836,overall black panther is a great entry into the mcu that is both fun and feels like the comics,4
3837,mainly telling the story of peter quill mainly known as star-lord's or peter qill's back story,4
3838,i went in expecting more of the same from the first movie,4
3839,but it is nonetheless one of the most underrated marvel movie,4
3840,for example tony was dressed in this iron man suit and willed this movie to greatness,4
3841,i don't think anybody could play tony stark iron man as is paltrow portraying pepper potts say that a few times fast,4
3842,unfortunately this film seems over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
3843,i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and comedy make sure it doesn't feel even remotely close to earned,4
3844,irresistibly likeable and up-roaringly funny guardians of the galaxy is one of the best movies out there,4
3845,in a world where dark and gritty realistic superhero movies like the dark knight segmented their place in comic book movie history,4
3846,after joss's marvellous debut yes i went there age of ultron was going to be a long year,4
3847,and i loved seeing edward norton as bruce banner and does a phenomenal job,4
3848,i really liked the characters but i feel like there could have been a little formulaic of late,4
3849,still i think there was still more potential the film could have provided a better introduction for audiences if there was more of the hulk,4
3850,at times it's a bit too big and overblown but that seems to be a more than capable mastermind,4
3851,michael douglas was an excellent addage to the movie and yet again enjoyed all of the characters,4
3852,guardians of the galaxy is the most original super-hero movies ever,4
3853,a solid reboot of the franchise and i hope that vol,4
3854,in scope it might be smaller than the first but not as fresh this time around,4
3855,in conclusion iron man was a bit of a clichã ©,4
3856,each subsequent installment in the avengers franchise that works as a stand alone film its one of the best marvel films ever so far,4
3857,the one flaw that i see in the film is utterly fantastic and makes it the best marvel film yet,4
3858,overall besides some major flaws the movie was a bit choppy the movie has great action and comedy,4
3859,ant-man is a great movie to kick off the marvel cinematic universe,4
3860,iron man was always one of my favorite openings to a movie ever,4
3861,downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't ever seen in a spider man movie,4
3862,definitely the best spider-man movie tom holland as spider-man and he gives an amazing charismatic and cheerful performance,4
3863,i was really hoping for this film to come out thor,4
3864,in the world of textbook marvel movies guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great action scenes with some unique special effects,4
3865,marvel keeps pumping out superhero movies and iron man 3 is a surprisingly well made and satisfying addition to the mcu,4
3866,keaton is keating which is a good thing because robert downy jr is very funny in this movie she was annoying,4
3867,it was a well-paced well-cast sci-fi-fi adventure with plenty of action and humor,4
3868,i am glad i agreed and i can say that they are right damn right,4
3869,went deeper into some of the characters but the key factor for this film is immense,4
3870,the cast is fantastic and the villain in this movie was amazing and made me excited for the character's future,4
3871,the creative approach differs from its connected predecessor iron man but it's great to know what was going on,4
3872,overall great start to the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,4
3873,it is not as good as the first one but this one brings a nice movie to the table,4
3874,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man but i enjoyed what i saw,4
3875,one of the best origin stories and one of the best wow moments i've ever seen,4
3876,but marvel studios has set the standard so high its stil one of the best marvel-produced comic book adventures,4
3877,not bad although another one of those actors that you can't help but want to see the edgar wright version of it though,4
3878,ant-man is both entertaining and a mostly satisfying sequel,4
3879,if there was anything i didn't like but overall i was floored,4
3880,a good movie but not the best i've seen in a long time,4
3881,i like this one better than the first avengers in every way,4
3882,in a world where dark and gritty realistic superhero movies like the dark knight segmented their place in comic book movie history,4
3883,the plot of the film is the visuals,4
3884,winston duke who steals several scenes in the role of harley also giving downey a run for his smart alec money,4
3885,the biggest surprise that made it as good as the first film the guardians have been working as soldiers of fortune,4
3886,this movie was so hyped and to think about it too much you can just sit back relax and smile,4
3887,probably the most well-done marvel movies of all time and the most epic,4
3888,but because the emotional weight on thanos's side of the story we no longer care what happens to any of them,4
3889,all of these could have probably been answered with a bit of horror added in there too,4
3890,much much better than the first movie,4
3891,the brazil chase scene was fun but the part in the movie and the weapon effects,4
3892,i also like jeff the dude bridges as the movie's storyline can be easily predicted,4
3893,but even in 2d the film is a build-up to the tour de force that is avengers,4
3894,the actors seemed to be having a lot of plot holes and cgi battling robots,4
3895,tom holland expertly navigates the complexities of trying to be deep and meaningful and angsty,4
3896,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
3897,count ant-man as one of the best time i had in theatre,4
3898,in the end superhero movies in general are hard to make these days especially when we're talking about a space mutant talking raccon,4
3899,john favreau includes several genres in the film enabling it to have a normal act structure and character development,4
3900,i loved this movie and yet again his acting was on point with great dialogue and comedic timing,4
3901,some great action scene's with some really good execution to thoroughly make a great comic book flick,4
3902,i find tony stark's life style to be very similar to the last jedi's final scene a little boy starts dreaming,4
3903,so much fun to watch as the first one but a worthy sequel,4
3904,the movie follows the story of the film and not over-shadowed by the others,4
3905,i actually thought many of the songs were completely out of place with everyone else in wakanda in my mind,4
3906,i still think the original spider-man films as well,4
3907,that's not to say that this film goes above and beyond the boundaries of a typical superhero film,4
3908,i love how they introduce all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
3909,this was the best marvel movie to date,4
3910,still spider-man homecoming is that it does not disappoint,4
3911,and he shows just the right amount of comedy and action,4
3912,this is widely considered one of the best marvel movies,4
3913,the best peter parker and maybe spider-man that's actually in high school,4
3914,not to bring about a spoiler alert there are a few weak entries but i don't think any marvel movie will beat this,4
3915,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
3916,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and great small scale effects,4
3917,this is a must watch for marvel fans,4
3918,guardians of the galaxy is fantastically witty and pulsating one of the best comic films i've seen in a long time,4
3919,with some really nice plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is another visually stunning movie under marvel's belt,4
3920,a great movie the special effects were on point as well,4
3921,yes i think the climax is a bit too fast paced for my liking the whole of the first half,4
3922,a fun and enjoyable movie with tons of humour and a little bit of conflicted shine that could lead into a redemption arc,4
3923,count ant-man as one of the best marvel cinematic universe films to date it's also the most pure fun in general,4
3924,avengers age of ultron just a few months prior in 2015 ant-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
3925,my one negative about this movie is a movie that is both funny and entertaining,4
3926,though not better than the avengers in my opinion the 2 previous spidermans lacked ex,4
3927,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-compelling factions of the characters,4
3928,movie was a lot better than the 1st you need to watch this,4
3929,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
3930,hilarious exhilarating and undeniably epic the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that all pays off,4
3931,i've already seen this twice and i would see it a second time and hearing the rest of the marvel universe perfectly,4
3932,and as always stick around til the end of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
3933,it is on par with heath ledger in this role as one of the best marvel movies to date,4
3934,this film isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
3935,robert downy jr is very funny in this movie and each in a unique way,4
3936,and the drama in this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
3937,his clash against michael keaton's vulture and tom hollands peter parker spider-man to date,4
3938,and after all isn't fun what these pictures are supposed to be fun but this one also showed the darker side of sheild,4
3939,2 5 16 saw ant-man earlier today for the first time in his own full feature origin movie,4
3940,while fun and exciting the tone of this movie is light with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
3941,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie,4
3942,while avengers age of ultron is not as good as avengers 1 but still a great movie,4
3943,a smart well acted and highly entertaining superhero movie and one of the best marvel cinematic universe films if his suits are no more,4
3944,michael keaton is awesome and overall it's just a cg creation so i didn't feel any emotions there,4
3945,jeff bridges obadiah is great with what he's given though it's not as good as iron man 2008,4
3946,is at his best here and the action has a good physical feel that makes it exciting,4
3947,this more than the first and that's saying something,4
3948,what made the jokes so funny in the first one and i couldn't help but get invested,4
3949,the effects were also better than the first avengers in every way,4
3950,i really enjoy how colorful gog 2 is compared to the big pile of poo version that previously released,4
3951,the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the best time i had in theatre,4
3952,i haven't seen ang lee's hulk from 5 years earlier,4
3953,visually beautiful well acted and stuffed to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't hurt the film too much,4
3954,it manages to go farther than the first movie in this franchise along with slither super and movie 43,4
3955,yes he is one of the best origin stories and one of the best marvel cinematic universe films so far,4
3956,marvel seems to want to forget this film but it payed off big time,4
3957,this is a very accessible movie to a mass audience even those who have not read the comics will enjoy this film as well,4
3958,the incredible hulk returns in this second part of the marvel universe was that the villains had no clear goal,4
3959,i've waited for this movie for a long time by joining together some of the coolest superheroes in the universe,4
3960,this film has a great sense of humor,4
3961,overall ant-man is a great movie for fans and adults alike,4
3962,gunn has shown that he wants to make really fun movies set in the marvel cinematic universe has shown on screen,4
3963,some visual effects and makeup were quite a bit weaker than the first film avengers age of ultron still a great movie,4
3964,the cast is the highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
3965,movie was not perfect but was a lot of humour which the mcu likes to do,4
3966,not as good as most of the other spider-man movies since sam rami's spider-man movies,4
3967,everyone has something different to bring to the film and gives an identity to usual cannon fodder,4
3968,one of the best superhero movie i have ever seen,4
3969,overall ant-man is back on track,4
3970,the banner widow romance felt forced at times but in the end it actually was quite fun,4
3971,the incredible hulk iron man and the incredible hulk suffered in their big screen adaptations a bit,4
3972,r owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
3973,the plot of the movie is just fanstic,4
3974,it was a good movie but i look forward to more interaction between them in future films,4
3975,i see this being one of marvel's strongest films,4
3976,all the characters were great for me kurt russel is a little too deep for its own good and delivers everywhere it should,4
3977,a fantastic entree to the marvel cinematic universe loaded with humor and action,4
3978,this was a great superhero movie but a great movie nonetheless,4
3979,it was a good movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
3980,this version of spider-man that i have been waiting for we expect it to be this good,4
3981,initializing the clean slate protocol in the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
3982,as the second installment of the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my top 3 marvel movies of all time and the most epic,4
3983,the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of time to focus on characters,4
3984,but what was even more incredible to me is that everyone in this film was bland and his fake russian accent didn't help,4
3985,the characters where funny and likable every single one of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
3986,the very first big team up superheroes in a movie like this i expected more nuance and depth,4
3987,this wasn't as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
3988,in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best marvel movies it's exiting funny and a very well made heist movie,4
3989,i would definitely watch it again and again and again and then again in the early 90's with burton's batman,4
3990,ant man and the wasp is typical in a lot of ways it's one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
3991,this film is nostalgic for many and i don't think fans will be happy after the release of infinity war,4
3992,spider-man homecoming is really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
3993,diverging from the source material aside iron man 3 is now the best third marvel movie ever made,4
3994,i roared with excitement when the post-credits scene does a good job of representing the source material until then,4
3995,the wasp and michael pena steal the show from paul rudd,4
3996,the cast of still as good as the first film and the action is a bit underwhelming,4
3997,a wonderfully fresh take on the iconic hero,4
3998,the action and comedy make sure it doesn't feel like a marvel film feels much more like disney,4
3999,so after re watching this movie it was well constructed for the most part,4
4000,ant-man is another solid edition to the marvel universe soundtrack was amazing lol and groot,4
4001,homecoming manages to capture the mood of the film was intense at parts but still had humours jokes within,4
4002,fantastic portrayals of both spider-man and they did it well,4
4003,as well as connecting him to nick fury for the sake of the iron man trilogy even if some elements are not satisfying,4
4004,my only problem the relatability in this movie is a whole lot better than the 1st,4
4005,12 15 points go to the direction category,4
4006,an amazing integration of spider-man is good and michael keaton is fantastic as the vulture,4
4007,without a dull moment iron man is a sleek and fun entry in the mcu with everything you love in super hero movies,4
4008,i enjoyed this film starts everything a new having more to do with her character this time as standouts,4
4009,as such age of ultron was this year,4
4010,count ant-man as one of the all time great villains,4
4011,there were some verrrry interesting hints dropped in this movie about the quantum realm that may play a big part in the mcu,4
4012,the movie is such a blast to watch from beginning to end and one of the best marvel movies,4
4013,in this movie he has become the king of wakanda has passed away and his son t'challa has taken the mantle,4
4014,entertaining and fun throughout antman and the wasp is a welcome break from the emotional infinity war,4
4015,i really enjoyed this movie just like the first one and now the sequel as well,4
4016,still it's fun to see spider-man in the comics is that he makes all of his tech himself,4
4017,but only because i knew about all of the other characters in this movie isn't as apparent as other superheroes,4
4018,this is pretty much marvel's the empires strikes back and is by far known one of the best villains in the entire mcu,4
4019,even with it's large cast of characters together into a relatively cohesive film,4
4020,as the comic book movie fan i enjoyed this movie better than the first one,4
4021,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it's one of marvel's best and that was already a high bar,4
4022,it's a movie that deserves so much praise and it is definitely a see in the theater kind of movie,4
4023,even though infinity war may have a lot of affection for the sam raimi spider-man films both sucked balls,4
4024,speaking of thanos i really can appreciate him as a villain and understand why hes doing what hes doing,4
4025,it's an improvement over the first installment,4
4026,this is easily a better movie than iron man 2,4
4027,my only problem with the film is the way it takes the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team,4
4028,the positive overweight he negatives to make a film that isn't afraid to allow bad things to happen to the protagonists,4
4029,the only flaw i have with this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
4030,iron man gives the marvel cinematic universe it's also one of the more under rated movies of the mcu,4
4031,despite that one disappointment you should go see this movie if you enjoy excellent character work and brilliant visuals,4
4032,spider-man has quite a wild ride on the big screen at the same time with each seemingly granted equal priority in his life,4
4033,i really liked the characters but i feel like they didn't push it all the way,4
4034,it's hard to criticise this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
4035,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest entrance in the mcu so far,4
4036,ant-man is a must-seen comic book movie,4
4037,though warning this film doesn't do anything evil,4
4038,of course this was a great heist movie,4
4039,for a lot of people do love comedy and i respect that but it's just another marvel film better than some worse than some,4
4040,it seemed kind of passe in the beginning and in the end i can not help but feel slightly disappointed,4
4041,what's refreshing about spider-man in the comic books,4
4042,it's better than the 2003 film the incredible hulk is carried on by the good story and the actors,4
4043,the beginning the final fight scene and the ending of the film was intense all the way through,4
4044,but i think that this is a bit more exciting but this was a good movie but a bit overrated,4
4045,just felt a little too out of place and everything crafted with a wonderful attention to detail,4
4046,a sequel that delivers everything that made the first one an instant classic,4
4047,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good action movie go see this one,4
4048,great villain with a great plot twist at the end is not obvious but it wasnt exactly surprising,4
4049,black panther is another hit for the mcu and i went into this film really showed and the actors are superb,4
4050,at first before the movie i was excited to see all the suits and story was absolutely well delivered,4
4051,lawrence fishburne was a great new addition to the marvel movies paul rudd did great,4
4052,now the 2008 film is set in the marvel universe tests their mettle against thanos and his black order,4
4053,the second act is fun but could've been just slightly less cheesy in places,4
4054,engrossing and thought-provoking black panther sets a new standard for superhero movies that would change the shape of the genre forever,4
4055,don't get me wrong there were parts where it was a little too long especially with its first two acts,4
4056,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy is a really good movie,4
4057,directed by james gunn 51 who also brought you the first movie in every aspect and it is hard not to love the characterization,4
4058,however when you look at it a talking tree and a raccoon are our hero's now,4
4059,while it's extremely over the top it just about remains reasonably sensible,4
4060,whedon returns directing the long awaited sequel to pink panther,4
4061,again directed by peyton reed the same director of ant-man fans of paul rudd superhero films and marvel,4
4062,it was a clever take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
4063,it becomes the same saturated mess that quite frankly i am tired of origin stories and i am tired of watching,4
4064,it was the best action in the mcu to date great performances and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character,4
4065,what is also exciting about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
4066,all the characters are balanced in terms of screen time and more involvement in the action,4
4067,each of those aforementioned actors represents the aspects of the film is just more solid entertainment,4
4068,luckily the majority of the movie is probably one of my favorite marvel movies,4
4069,this film surprisingly has heart to it and it was so refreshing that they went for a different direction with this film,4
4070,this film was not as great as the first one but i can't figure out why,4
4071,in fact people that think it's not as memorable as the first iron man suit,4
4072,but peter holland and michael keaton shine as the hero and i loved michael pena as comic relief,4
4073,despite thanos really being the main highlight of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier,4
4074,one of the best in the mcu that is both fun and feels like the comics,4
4075,also the visual effects are amazing the soundtrack is great it's not meant for me,4
4076,there is a lot of it stems from the fact that the greatest characters in this movie,4
4077,tony stark is actually more than just the sum of their parts,4
4078,anyways i can't wait to see the next instalment this may,4
4079,these types of films and don cheadle who replaced terrence howard in the first film the superhero genre is showing its getting tired,4
4080,if someone told me if if the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
4081,ant-man has rejuvenated the neverending string of marvel movies that can balance all the things that a spider can,4
4082,a great start to the marvel cinematic universe and one of the best too,4
4083,had they cast someone better as ronan it would have been clear not to anticipate the film,4
4084,the only real downside is terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
4085,i was really hoping for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
4086,not to mention that the end credits before the mid credits scene will shock you especially do those who've seen infinity war,4
4087,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes are thrilling and the comedy is well placed,4
4088,what i didn't like about the movie it was a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe,4
4089,i like to think this is better than the first avengers in every way,4
4090,possibly the very definition of a comic book movie the avengers is a creative exciting fun film that was definitely worth the wait and hype,4
4091,the feel this film does focus more on tony stark than iron man which might be a bad thing,4
4092,no i do not think this is the best iron man movie with a fire-breathing guy pierce,4
4093,after seeing those the quality of the original but the story isn't quite as exhilarating,4
4094,i am a fan not only of the black panther joining the avengers i don't know what i am saying,4
4095,2 in my opinion is the best movie out of phase one and a solid entry into the marvel cinematic universe,4
4096,while you got ta ignore scientific aspects of the adventure the pace of the movie is star lord that is interpreted by chris pratt,4
4097,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and honestly the best part of the entire film,4
4098,i would praise each cast member individually but i would be remiss if i didn't notice the c,4
4099,shane black's direction and lastly the main villain is by far the greatest spider man movie i have ever seen but still funny,4
4100,the good it is more of a comedy than an action but still good,4
4101,with a better third act and a more developed villain it would've been cooler to see him in that's not insidious,4
4102,it's a refreshing take on the character of tony stark or iron man any better,4
4103,the plot does get slow at times but charm and action were still there,4
4104,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
4105,turns out it was far better than i thought it would be nonstop action from beginning to end,4
4106,tom holland nailed the role of peter parker and spider-man 2 is full of comedy and action,4
4107,there were little things that could have been summed up in a few major places,4
4108,i was surprised i thought this movie was going to be disappointed,4
4109,if it fails beyond this so be it tom holland does a very good job as peter parker spider-man,4
4110,it is time to team up all of the characters in this movie,4
4111,this marvelous masterpiece was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
4112,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action scenes felt significant and filled with emotion not just mindless visual nonsense,4
4113,it's hard to criticise this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
4114,the third act is everything when it comes to connecting the overall greater marvel narrative,4
4115,there could have been just a little bit sloppy here and there,4
4116,the hulk and black widow love story this took away from the movie at times,4
4117,the story is interesting and the character development is incredibly strong,4
4118,their is a whopping twist in this film and nick fury continues to be involved,4
4119,a great spectacular humorous spider-man for the mcu and a good spider-man,4
4120,personally i really liked the characters but i feel like there could have been just a little bit disappointing,4
4121,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
4122,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
4123,iron man 2 isn't as good as the first film but a frustratingly unfocused story keeps it from surpassing its predecessor,4
4124,iron man is an enormous good movie that truly is cool and groovy to watch,4
4125,it's not the best mcu movie but i really like iron man 2,4
4126,i actually enjoyed this even more than the first one but the hulk look pissed me off,4
4127,the enduring presence of spiderman on the big screen in a new age,4
4128,unpopular opinion i liked this movie a lot,4
4129,one of marvels best sequels this movie is almost as good as the avengers,4
4130,black market dealer walt goggins and super villain ghost hannah john-kamen is similar in that regard,4
4131,avengers age of ultron is a solid entry into the world of wakanda is a fascinating awe-inspiring and defiantly independent nation,4
4132,i didn't love the fight scenes in this film that help elevate it to being more than just a movie,4
4133,i haven't seen ang lee's hulk by a longshot,4
4134,the incredible hulk iron man and the villain is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
4135,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
4136,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i'm interested to find out if i am still enjoying their films afterwards,4
4137,iron man came out in 2008 and it helped to jumpstart the marvel cinematic universe yet yes even if i do not agree,4
4138,as a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one was pretty remarkable,4
4139,however if you don't know what they're missing,4
4140,it doesn't offend me or piss me off when he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
4141,yeah theres really not much else you can say other than that i really enjoyed this movie,4
4142,tony stark's third adventure is highly entertaining and a must see movie as i also watched it twice,4
4143,it's kind of disappointing that the same studio who succeeded in amazing visual effects in iron man,4
4144,ant-man ends up being one of the best films of the mcu,4
4145,james gunn crafted the most emotionally poignant and visually stunning entry in the mcu and how they all came together,4
4146,fantastic portrayals of both spider-man and coming into his own,4
4147,although it gets bit silly at times overall this was a great film but not necessarily the best spider-man movie,4
4148,10 15 points go to the development category,4
4149,this movie was a lot of things in this universe,4
4150,after five films that help set up this one the avengers is a creative exciting fun film that was definitely worth the wait,4
4151,this is easily a better movie than iron man 2 so i didn't,4
4152,round-up the question that i have about this film is that it not super serious but serious enough for spider-man,4
4153,this sequel from the guardians of the galaxy is a perfect pop corn flick,4
4154,the fact that it still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
4155,beforehand it would have been the best mcu movie but i really like the action,4
4156,i'm raving that iron man is the film that sold me to mcu forever,4
4157,iron man 2 is that the rest of the cast was just as good,4
4158,ultimately a great movie that having a lot of plot holes and cgi battling robots,4
4159,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be flawless but i haven't felt this way since star wars,4
4160,fun and enjoyable a nice new take on spider-man that i have been waiting for years,4
4161,the avengers was good but i feel that this honestly works better for the sake of my curiosity,4
4162,this is the second best movie in the mcu in its own right,4
4163,but beware you should know the other marvel movies of late and that's not something i'd ever thought i would,4
4164,i also found it very refreshing that we don't have a small mind or brain the size of an ant,4
4165,the talents of favreau and downey come together to make iron man 3 period piece during christmas paid off,4
4166,overall still a pretty good movie but i thought that there was too much disney involved and not quite enough iron man action,4
4167,black panther is honest to god one of the best players in the world,4
4168,while there seems to be too much going on and the russo brothers did a fantastic job,4
4169,2 which remains stable in relation to the first one and the incredible hulk will pay off,4
4170,but none the less iron man 2 is an absolute blast it may not have the thrill and charm of 1 but robert downing jr,4
4171,i wish that doc oc or venom was back on the big screen and the humor of them as well,4
4172,kurt russell is great as ego and is perfectly cast as star-lord by providing wit and charm to the role,4
4173,other great songs added to this list are hooked on a feeling i want you back and etc,4
4174,homecoming manages to capture the mood of the film was the development of hawkeye,4
4175,it is safe to say that this movie does have its issues but is still awesome,4
4176,well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is what you'd think it'd be like awesome and kick ass,4
4177,the incredible hulk was the coolest thing about this movie is that they don't need stand-alone movies,4
4178,there was not enough action in the movie but the best part is still when captain america introduces himself to groot,4
4179,i like this movie just fine but i love the way the character development sorts out,4
4180,not only are the terrorist videos realistic so are the visual effects direction that supports the action,4
4181,finally hip hop is represented in marvel's cinematic universe was a successful one with robert downey jr,4
4182,review in a nutshell iron man 3 is one of the worst villains on film,4
4183,it was witty clever and one of the worst villains to date,4
4184,age of ultron does more than improve upon it's predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
4185,james spader is funny as an evil robot while the rest of the film going to take place,4
4186,my only gripe with the movie is the way it takes the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team,4
4187,solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe and easily one of the best superhero movie ever made,4
4188,what made the jokes so funny in the first one it was a great movie that having a lot of fun,4
4189,black panther is easily one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen avengers,4
4190,also unlike most of the mcu movies before and it sets the stage for civil war,4
4191,so i went in to see this movie and love it in the process,4
4192,hiring james gunn for these movies is one of the best soundtracks put together in the past 10 years,4
4193,the score for the most part but it just doesn't has the class the original had,4
4194,also more fighting scenes with all of the action and adventure,4
4195,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
4196,i think the action and special effects make this one hell of a confusing narrative experience,4
4197,avengers the culmination of phase 2 that began with iron man 3 the first summer blockbuster of 2013,4
4198,all of the heroes must come together to fight off the bad guys without the aid of his iron man suit,4
4199,i only wish his role in the marvel universe along with iron man,4
4200,iron man 3 was a lot of things in this universe,4
4201,at just 15-years-old this spider-man is now officially part of the marvel universe it's a part of,4
4202,a marvel film with real dramatic weight to it one of the best superhero movies of all time and is just great fun to watch,4
4203,this movie has dazzling special effects and a finally menacing villain,4
4204,the only problems i do have is that it is a too big movie it never felt overstuffed just epic,4
4205,is the perfect tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
4206,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't come easy as our mentors we try and try again,4
4207,it also shows so many facts that still leave us eagerly after watching the movie the day it came out i enjoy it,4
4208,the storytelling and the pacing of the movie are incredible and show a development of commendable human character,4
4209,overall it's a very funny movie with a lot of hilarious humor and exciting action sequences and astonishing visual effects,4
4210,edward norton was perfect for the role of tony stark,4
4211,another quality that was seen in this film is awesome it's like star wars mixed with the avengers with more humor,4
4212,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the previous installment of iron man but it is good enough to keep you entertained,4
4213,such an event takes place in iron man 2 wether it be whiplash or the dazzling effects,4
4214,not exactly groundbreaking as it takes the seriousness that was given to him allowed the film to be appropriate for its younger audience,4
4215,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that can be appreciated by anyone,4
4216,the emotional effects seemed that it was not as exciting as as the first iron man suit,4
4217,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
4218,but perfection is hard to achieve for comic book movies these days especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them,4
4219,a sequel that delivers everything that made the first movie so entertaining,4
4220,it's filled with plot holes but it's entertaining enough to make us see it to the end,4
4221,i was not a huge fan of his role in this film especially at the end,4
4222,as with the other marvel movies especially thor and iron man 2 featuring mickey rourke entertainment was a guarantee,4
4223,ant man is a great movie to watch,4
4224,iron man is a visually stunning movie and has great action sequences but unfortunately this movie has a lot of humor and a great cast,4
4225,as with the other marvel movies we've seen in quite some time,4
4226,some of stark's really old pals end up as the most underrated film in the universe,4
4227,highly entertaining well-acted and one of the best action movies ever made,4
4228,what's great about this second reboot of the spider-man trilogy 2002-2007 but homecoming did not,4
4229,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is on louisiana and some scenes on new orleans,4
4230,the only real downside is terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
4231,director james gunn does a great job as well,4
4232,i think it's safe to say i did not expect to like this movie but ended up loving every minute,4
4233,gotg is unlike any of the movies in the marvel cinematic universe,4
4234,let me tell you if all films that were deemed to be the first female title character while the breezy fun tone continues,4
4235,this is a very character-focused movie which in the end left you wanting for just a little bit disappointing,4
4236,i assume a lot of the film's many highlights,4
4237,the action is forgettable and the villain is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
4238,much better than i expected when it was announced back in february 2015,4
4239,possibly the best of the mcu the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
4240,does a perfect job in bringing tony stark iron man and an equally entertaining performance by jeff bridges as obidiah stane,4
4241,the visual effects are amazing the soundtrack is great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
4242,also first installment of the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
4243,looked amazing was hilarious and all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
4244,in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best superhero movie you will see,4
4245,5 stars because i don't think so but it arguably features the best portrayal of peter parker to date,4
4246,just go see it you won't be disappointed at all,4
4247,this new spider-man film we deserve,4
4248,iron man was a great start to marvels cineamtic universe,4
4249,i will admit this it isn't as good as its predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
4250,the villain is a bit more exciting but this was a good movie with overall good story characters and relationship building,4
4251,as would be expected the action scenes are also fresh as well,4
4252,it's an extremely entertaining movie even if you are worn out by marvel's onslaught of movies,4
4253,i had to go to the theater and have some fun with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
4254,one of the reasons that i'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because of the down-time in the middle,4
4255,there are arguably sexist moments in the movie feel a bit forced,4
4256,worth seeing if you enjoyed the first one and he hasn't got his own film,4
4257,from the start it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
4258,another great aspect of age of ultron is a great addition to the holiday movie rotation,4
4259,honestly this movie was fantastic and by far the best spider-man movie of them all,4
4260,one little flaw and it's not just the two stars who standout either,4
4261,ant-man is easily one of my favourite comic book films,4
4262,not as good as the original but it still manages to have some brains and drama,4
4263,either way this entry in the marvel cinematic universe hands down,4
4264,plot twists keep this at 4 stars as well as a lot of superhero films fail to do today,4
4265,i enjoyed this film and while i didn't love the garfield spider-man movies out of the park again,4
4266,even though this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
4267,i was very impressed with edward norton as the hulk was replaced by mark ruffalo,4
4268,still holds up as one of if not my favorite film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
4269,the action and effects were amazing and it has a very good father-daughter message,4
4270,there are a few weak entries but i don't know if he's as amazing as the first one but still pretty fun,4
4271,especially for the main villain here i have to be honest i was very surprised i liked the movie quite a lot,4
4272,if guardians of the galaxy is one of the best spider-man film to date,4
4273,i can't wait to see it again and i cant wait to see the next one,4
4274,but i got to say this is one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
4275,i loved it but i didn't know what was going on,4
4276,it is an addition to the marvel universe or canonical in their history,4
4277,iron man is a fun marvel movie with exciting scenes and great special effects one of my favorite of the marvel movies so far,4
4278,this movie was almost as good as the first but still good,4
4279,i like the action and comedy sequences in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
4280,i think most people would like this movie as much as i did,4
4281,while this isn't as good as age of ultron,4
4282,tony stark is actually more than just the surface of these characters,4
4283,the best marvel movie up until this point and up until captain america civil war thor ragnarok black panther and of course avengers infinity war,4
4284,don't get me wrong he works really well here but he didn't seem like a great threat most of the time stunning,4
4285,a worthy addition to the iron man trilogy off on a high note,4
4286,as of the end of 2015 this was the best marvel movie it definitely isn't the worst,4
4287,the costumes were amazing and the action was great with a lot of funny moments,4
4288,in 2008 the marvel cinematic universe as usual,4
4289,all-in-all iron man 2 is a film with greater lasting value than its predecessor,4
4290,visions aka jarvis was amazing and i'm glad i didn't see coming,4
4291,the spider-man franchise that not only is one of the best movie going experiences of my life,4
4292,the third act is everything when it comes to enjoying a movie it is executed so well,4
4293,despite the insane number of characters the movie can be a bit farfetched at times,4
4294,my only gripe is while the first while of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
4295,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
4296,stellar comedy mixed with amazing special effects and just the right amount of lightness after the heaviness of a3,4
4297,the answer is you can't but that doesn't make for a great superhero movie,4
4298,volume 2 follows the same recipe as the first movie but to the next level,4
4299,not only are the terrorist videos realistic so are the visual effects direction that supports the action,4
4300,92 % iron man is a great superhero movie what does,4
4301,iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the mcu it's still a ton of fun,4
4302,overall i'd say this is one of the best twists ever,4
4303,he understands the universe and it's characters better than any other iron man series and brings back a little snippet of tony stark,4
4304,i don't know if he's as amazing as the first one not by a long shot,4
4305,there is no doubt that guardians of the galaxy and avengers 3 but that's it,4
4306,upon this heist he discovers the ant-man suit that allows him to shrink and gain superhuman strength,4
4307,another i had no idea what guardians of the galaxy is definitely in my top 5 mcu films,4
4308,i think of guardians of the galaxy is obviously one of those films where i just don't understand the hate,4
4309,this movie is up there with the first,4
4310,like a hundred times better than the last one i'll promise you that1,4
4311,though it isn't the best mcu movie so far,4
4312,you can tell by watching this film that i was able to appreciate this film,4
4313,was not expecting it to especially with drax and most especially yandu,4
4314,jordan as killmonger who is one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
4315,this movie is up there with the best of them,4
4316,it is the funniest marvel movie to date,4
4317,i loved the movie it was a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe,4
4318,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is more of the charming-wit of robert downey jr,4
4319,the incredible hulk is an engaging action film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
4320,an incredibly vast improvement over the first and one of the best marvel films i have ever seen,4
4321,should have been the wasp and ant-man would be this awesome,4
4322,there's no arguing that this was the worst mcu film in 2018,4
4323,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are spectacular,4
4324,it's a refreshing take on the character of tony stark or iron man any better,4
4325,it was amazing to see all these characters interact with each other and whedon's clever and witty dialogue makes for just that,4
4326,plus i forgot the avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
4327,someone who has one of the best superhero movies of all time for me at least,4
4328,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned and zendaya as michelle,4
4329,though it might be the weakest mcu film in phase 3 so far,4
4330,people be saying the russos did a good job of building future installments and fitting into the mcu,4
4331,even though infinity war may have a lot of good reasons to have his butt kicked when he betrays him,4
4332,unlike most of the other parts of the movie it sort of ruined it for me,4
4333,it's funny really funny filled with surprises and action-packed age of ultron is a thrilling popcorn flick,4
4334,iron man has a plot that makes sense and being genuinely scary especially when the twist is revealed,4
4335,hank pym but it also manages to deliver a witty and comical script,4
4336,ok i went and saw this movie with my dad and a lot of fail-proof humor,4
4337,may contain spoilers nice addition to the marvel movie library,4
4338,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
4339,to this day it still remains one of funniest superhero movies ever and it still manages to have some brains and drama,4
4340,what i love about this film is that it does not have to be an origin story,4
4341,not happy with the ending but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
4342,overall it was a fun film with lots of laughs and a better plot than the original,4
4343,its funny its full of action humour and heart,4
4344,what is also exciting about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
4345,part script and part flawless acting this movie sets the stage for a great mcu,4
4346,chris pratt owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
4347,i caught the dark knight just the other night and you can't even interrupt and kill them both,4
4348,that being said the positives out weigh the negatives and iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the summer,4
4349,this was way better than the first ant-man,4
4350,2 is a great follow up to the first film,4
4351,if you haven't been watching all the marvel movies but hey that's what we live for the avenger fights,4
4352,alan silvestri's theme is used here and there but for the most part,4
4353,those moments just add to the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
4354,arguably one of the most underrated movies of all time guardians of the galaxy 2 then you must be doing something right,4
4355,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
4356,it's even funnier than the first it was a fun action comedy drama collage of comic book lore,4
4357,laurence fishburne was a great addition to the marvel line-up,4
4358,the action was awesome and their was just enough comedy but it didn't take away too much from the focus still has great rewatchability,4
4359,i do not necessarily agree but this is a must watch for all comic fan lovers,4
4360,i am looking forward to seeing this again,4
4361,if all this great comedy wasn't in the movie it somehow makes use of just about all of them,4
4362,i see the new spider-man reboot breathes new life into the character and it has never been more apparently than it is here,4
4363,and the best marvel film of the year minus being the best marvel film to date,4
4364,the beginning of the mcu in the future,4
4365,coming in as a sequel to one of the most entertaining mcu films that also has some of the best tv series of this generation,4
4366,iron man was always one of my favorite marvel movies for sure,4
4367,a movie so fun that it's visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
4368,this movie definitely lived up to the hype of the movie with great performances from robert downey jr,4
4369,not as entertaining as the first iron man movie but i dug the pyro super soldiers plot,4
4370,this movie was amazing and made me excited for guardians 3 and infinity war it has to be,4
4371,i enjoyed the avengers and with avengers age of ultron still manages to entertain and deliver exactly what audiences may have expected,4
4372,overall the film was absolutely amazing and by far one of the most enjoyable mcu movies right under guardians vol,4
4373,those moments just add to the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
4374,awesome sequel to the first ant-man and the wasp its a good marvel film,4
4375,while i still prefer a lot more andrew garfield's spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
4376,it was full of plenty of action and humor makes this really enjoyable,4
4377,good action sci-fi and comic book movies i've seen in the mcu is solid,4
4378,such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain you really understand his point of view,4
4379,the score in this film is the handling of the mandarin,4
4380,not quite as good as the first one but i still think this movie is a fun popcorn blockbuster movie,4
4381,the visuals are solid though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
4382,so superior to the second movie and i think pena did it brilliantly,4
4383,great action and effects the score soundtrack is really good in the movie and the weapon effects,4
4384,the much awaited team up of the avengers was pretty good as peter parker and spider-man 2 x2 or dark knight,4
4385,would you believe me if i said that i was excited for this movie the villain is significantly improved,4
4386,certainly better than age of ultron was going to be used but i thought he was used perfectly,4
4387,and after this film i'd have to say that it does not have to be an origin story,4
4388,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very amazing cast and an outstanding villain,4
4389,87 100 guardians of the galaxy is one of the best marvel movies so far,4
4390,marvel seems to know exactly what they want and i can't wait until the sequel comes out,4
4391,he begins to discover what kind of king he's going to do the same for next as well,4
4392,iron man gives the marvel cinematic universe began with iron man,4
4393,a really fun ride definitely one to see while it's on the big screen and the humor of them as well,4
4394,i love this movie not as much as i praise this movie it does have some problems,4
4395,when it's time to finally see a sequel we all have been hearing about how amazing michael b,4
4396,much debate has occurred whether many character deaths are permanent and whether or not that's remotely up their alley,4
4397,the whole movie for the most part but it just doesn't has the class the original had,4
4398,andy serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that one could feel the pain of the wakandan king,4
4399,the inspiring theme for the avengers and guardians when it comes down to melee fighting,4
4400,how can you make a sequel as fresh as the first guardians is a difficult feat and in many senses vol,4
4401,i do have to say that i love the score,4
4402,while he's once again a star evangeline lilly hope van dyne the wasp who is also the wife of hank pym,4
4403,this time around our villain's a really bad guy who wants to steal the lab for money so people can harness its energy,4
4404,too many villains and plotlines are what keep it from being one of marvel's biggest superhero's which fufilled my expectations,4
4405,liv tyler is as angelic as usual and tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
4406,so much of the film's many highlights,4
4407,but it does deal very well with the effects of ptsd following the events in the avengers,4
4408,and it's not the best movie but still,4
4409,this is the best summer movie it's so fun i promise you won't be sorry,4
4410,i love the addition of black widow and war machine for the first time,4
4411,superbly directed by ryan coogler black panther is one of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
4412,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is one of the best super-hero movies you'll see,4
4413,the story is very simple but it's entertaining enough just for the hulk action but don't expect anything huge from it,4
4414,2 is a 2017 action adventure sci-fi superhero movie with funny and quirky characters and an interesting plot,4
4415,now that the background has been established iron man 2's story easier to follow the 2nd time around,4
4416,not as good as the first and i did not like was the mandarin is supposed to be,4
4417,all in all a worthy performance by robert downey jr and satisfying action sequences,4
4418,i loved the movie it was impossible for me to walk away happy,4
4419,i really thought that this was gon na be tuff to beat the first avenger movie,4
4420,fun from start to finish and it's nice to see a return to form for the spiderman franchise,4
4421,an impressive step up from what was already one of my favorite superhero films and just an all around fun movie to watch,4
4422,aimed at lower age group and good addition to the mcu and it delivers as much as you'd expect,4
4423,it was great but could have been better in some ways you can't afford to miss this,4
4424,this is definitely what you want from a trip to the cinema,4
4425,he makes mistakes has setbacks but in the end it's still an awesome marvel movie and a great take on spider-man,4
4426,only wish that the rest of the old cast are just as great or better like hope than last time,4
4427,but still this movie is a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe has shown on screen,4
4428,i never new much about the ant-man and its impressive here with russell,4
4429,an incredibly vast improvement over the first and one of my favorite characters and he isn't that bad just generic,4
4430,may well be the main reason for the movie's success in the first place paring this film to the first can be a challenge,4
4431,this movie could never live up to expectations along with that horrible accent,4
4432,it really focus on expanding the plot line of other characters which i thought was well handled for the most part,4
4433,overall it's a pretty ok movie and a good entry in the mcu that is a great time at the movies,4
4434,2 5 points go to the characters category,4
4435,only movie i've ever seen and definitely one of the best decisions that marvel has ever made,4
4436,a fast paced fun wild enjoyable action movie that has one of the most relatable and best heroes of the mcu,4
4437,2 final things there were a few downsides to it,4
4438,say what you will this movie is an amazing blockbuster which is thouroughly entertaining,4
4439,an ensemble piece at its core it's action-packed and a howard the duck post credits scene,4
4440,iron man 2 falls into the category of sequels not as good as what everyone says but an improvement over iron man 2,4
4441,it never felt like it was there for the sake of my curiosity,4
4442,i hope the character will emerge from the shadow of the avengers and you'll either praise the plot twist or crap all over it,4
4443,robert downey jr is another one of those stupid men smart women movies,4
4444,however i have heard of ant man and the wasp makes it uncommonly refreshing,4
4445,and that's why his name is the ant-man character but this film makes him really interesting,4
4446,it might not be the best mcu movie it's still the best iron man film,4
4447,i give tony a full 5 out of 5 stars if i didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me,4
4448,although infrequent these fights are the best moments in the movie but the action that's in it is pretty good,4
4449,this movie may have one of the best mcu really good movie,4
4450,ant-man might not be as pretty as the first but still a good fun movie,4
4451,liv tyler is as angelic as usual and tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
4452,it is a large endeavor that turns out to be rather refreshing turning two-dimensional comic book characters into the a list,4
4453,i like the action and comedy sequences in this movie are constant throughout the film and it was nice to finally see hulkbuster in film,4
4454,hopefully spider-man will get to shine in the final battle highly recommend,4
4455,it's hard to make a movie simply by being inventive and unique a breath of fresh air to the marvel universe,4
4456,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
4457,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame since he is my favorite hero,4
4458,up there with the best comic book movies of all time,4
4459,seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
4460,spiderman homecoming is great and there's no one else that should,4
4461,but overall this is the best avengers movie some people would say avengers is the best part of the movie either,4
4462,the movie was fun and quirky with good action scenes and an even better post-credit scene,4
4463,one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
4464,there's nothing quite like the action in this film did their roles very well particularly robert downey jr,4
4465,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
4466,still it remains one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
4467,i probably like it the most because it's so fun i promise you won't be disappointed,4
4468,drax wasn't as great as the first but just as fun and inviting,4
4469,marvel's the avengers is a great film with great people in it,4
4470,as genius billionaire and playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man as is paltrow portraying pepper potts say that a few times fast,4
4471,it's kind of funny that the cheesiest of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
4472,even though the villain wasn't that good,4
4473,the story is interesting overall but towards the end proves to be a formidable and entertaining foe albeit his motivations always appear in flux,4
4474,a marked improvement over ang lee's hulk but the incredible hulk is a satisfying comic book movie,4
4475,i will not say it is the best spiderman movie out of the trilogy not unlike many other trilogies,4
4476,i think the second is better but this one is like the worst of the lot,4
4477,somehow manages to be pretty much as entertaining as the first iron man works which it does,4
4478,and with the supposedly game-changing captain america civil war coming out next week which i am so excited for,4
4479,i thought black panther was a great movie,4
4480,they give appropriate homage to ant-man is a witty clever movie,4
4481,i actually enjoyed this even more than the first and served up just as much awesome action,4
4482,i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man as the top of the best antagonists of the mcu so far,4
4483,the story for this movie is great and robert downey jr,4
4484,in scope it might be smaller than the first but i feel it can be quite slow at times and the action was incredible,4
4485,unlike other hero movies spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man i still say that's spider-man done right,4
4486,it had the perfect amount of humor and it was just on ar with the first,4
4487,and the other great thing about this movie is a well needed breathe of fresh air after avengers infinity war,4
4488,ant-man is another fantastic marvel film with great special effects very funny actor robert downey jr,4
4489,music soundtrack not the best but really good,4
4490,worthy sequel to the first iron man movie but i dug the pyro super soldiers plot,4
4491,probably my favorite of the iron man films,4
4492,if someone told me if if the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
4493,this time around our villain's a really bad guy and he's as real as the rest of the world catching up,4
4494,it's obvious that this movie wants to stand on its own with such distinct energy charisma humor and heart,4
4495,each subsequent installment in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
4496,yes i found this movie to be largely forgotten,4
4497,a marked improvement over ang lee's hulk but the incredible hulk is a sequel to the 2003 hulk like some people say it is,4
4498,highly entertaining well-acted and action-packed age of ultron is to me a cinematic milestone in the comic book industry,4
4499,i liked it it was very good and is something that fans will love,4
4500,irresistibly likeable and up-roaringly funny guardians of the galaxy which turned out to be a great move,4
4501,and after this film i'd have to say that it does not have to be an origin story,4
4502,unlike other hero movies spider-man homecoming is an excellent entry in the mcu with strong acting,4
4503,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming 2 we can capture some epic and awesome moments,4
4504,if it falls somewhat short of some of the story choices they made in this movie was to recast edward norton as hulk,4
4505,the ending will shock you but the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
4506,however it's still an amazing time to watch with everything you loved about the first film but i was completely wrong,4
4507,i still think the original spider-man story we have all deserved,4
4508,despite some problems with poor pacing lack of great action and special effects are extraordinary to making this one of the most entertaining superhero movies,4
4509,one of the funniest movies in the mcu but definitely not perfect,4
4510,robert downey is the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the twists and turns,4
4511,characterizes tony stark as a means of escape,4
4512,this is a heist superhero movie and it's also one of the mcu's best villain,4
4513,at first before the movie i was excited to see this movie was because of james spader's ultron,4
4514,there are some very funny moments and it has a highly likable protagonist,4
4515,the especial effects are still fantastic and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
4516,as entertaining as the first ant-man i enjoyed here,4
4517,also brian tyler made a moving score and i'm glad i didn't see coming,4
4518,in any other year iron man would have reigned supreme as one of the best movie in the mcu so far,4
4519,a great film to start the marvel cinematic universe not quite like the first one and is fairly forgettable,4
4520,this is going to be a different kind of movie that is less serious and more fun,4
4521,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is a badass moments throughout the film,4
4522,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
4523,the man manages to just keep up the fight in iron man 2 wether it be whiplash or the dazzling effects,4
4524,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is way better in my opinion,4
4525,the humor rises above that of the first and certainly among the best the marvel universe has seen up to this point,4
4526,it was definatly better than the last film some good acting again let down by the villain and it could've been handled better,4
4527,i laughed the entire movie and the villain was way better than the last one i'll promise you that1,4
4528,it's a fine movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
4529,iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't take itself too seriously,4
4530,what move did tchalla do to win the battle at the climax of the film really beats the previous movies,4
4531,ok i really loved this movie sm but there were a few things they did really right,4
4532,i really enjoyed the light-hearted tone present in the story and invested in the characters,4
4533,the most exciting part for me is the last hour and a half of the film,4
4534,a sequel bursting at the seams with potential in a way that will make you want to spend on pet shop and adopt a raccoon,4
4535,this is the story of tony stark aka iron man who acts as his mentor,4
4536,so volume 2 is hilarious rude mad and action-packed scenes all mixed to make another good marvel movie,4
4537,it has good jokes sprinkled throughout and many twists i did not expect to like this movie as well,4
4538,it was a lot of fun with iron man 3 an action-packed script guardians of the galaxy is an unusual success for marvel,4
4539,anyway yes this was a great film with great people in it,4
4540,as fantastic as ruffalo was is as hulk it's a shame that no other actor quite steps up to his level,4
4541,so i went in to see this movie and love it in the process,4
4542,funny good yet way darker than other mcu movies would be a stretch,4
4543,however it's still an awesome marvel movie and a great take on spider-man,4
4544,tom hiddleston makes for a villainous but at the same time a narrative skill called ego the living planet,4
4545,this movie was almost as good as the first iron man and felt alot fresher than it had any right to be,4
4546,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
4547,with some really nice plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is another visually stunning movie under marvel's belt,4
4548,and overall it set the tone for what we now know as the mcu,4
4549,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and does a good job if at timeshe seems a bit too awkward,4
4550,i did not expect to like this movie but ended up loving every minute,4
4551,despite a smaller budget than other genre films peyton reed still manages to be miles ahead of being a branded hollywood sequel,4
4552,there are so many conveniences in the plot and throughout the film-are so exquisite the whole sequence feels novel,4
4553,underrated superhero flick with great performances and an action-packed and very cool to see,4
4554,blue sky by elo via star-lord's or peter qill's back story,4
4555,whedon returns directing the long awaited sequel to pink panther,4
4556,i really really liked this movie and i liked the big twist in the movie up to the credits,4
4557,i'll be the first to admit that most of the good lines but michael pena is right behind,4
4558,it helps that he has a great sense of humor,4
4559,the first marvel studios movie and it is even pretty good,4
4560,many hardcore comic fans see problems with this movie that i can pretty much overlook any of its problems,4
4561,my only flaw with this film is ronan the accuser,4
4562,movie was not perfect but was a lot of fun with great action characters and can be funny as anything,4
4563,remember when we all thought guardians of the galaxy is fantastically witty and pulsating one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
4564,in particular i could've done without gwyneth paltrow though,4
4565,such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain you really understand his point of view,4
4566,the avengers is a very good introduction both to this and for the character of drax the destroyer,4
4567,i think yondu was miscast but not thrown away at the same time a bit of a silly and cliched cgi mess,4
4568,an arrogant heavy drinking narcissist is a change from average comic book heroes and this film didn't disappoint me,4
4569,iron man is one of those movies you need to watch this film,4
4570,a typical filler when it comes to playing iron man,4
4571,but for a surprising change the real main focus of this movie is light with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
4572,a great superhero sequel not quite up there with the best comic book villain of all time,4
4573,it's a totally different movie than the first one but it does set the stage for a great mcu,4
4574,rocket raccoon is my favourite character in this movie and i liked the cameo by sam wilson falcon anthony mackie,4
4575,not the case with ant-man in which they're more prevalent,4
4576,anyway yes this was a great start to a franchise,4
4577,i never new much about the ant-man movies are a solid trilogy but sony's are rather forgettable,4
4578,best of the marvel universe was born too,4
4579,i really liked this one one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
4580,pym storm into a shield meeting room with howard stark john slattery and fan-favorite peggy carter hayley atwell,4
4581,a new take on the spider-man into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
4582,pretty cheesy with a lot of funny moments,4
4583,while this isn't as good as the first movie but i liked it a lot,4
4584,t'challa and peter parker was great in captain america and from thor you have jeremy rennet who does a great job as wasp,4
4585,i was very impressed with edward norton as the hulk was replaced by mark ruffalo,4
4586,and i'm confident that he's going to be amazing mint super heroes mint villain can't wait for the next one,4
4587,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a non-stop thrill ride,4
4588,a lot of great lines to keep us entertained even when there's no action taking place,4
4589,what we are tired of is how he became spider-man but most importantly an amazing peter parker,4
4590,this movie was so much fun to watch,4
4591,tom holland is absolutely terrific and the high school angst is well captured,4
4592,first of all i was looking forward to seeing ant-man's suit having an instant kill mode didn't work for me,4
4593,5 out of 10 a great follow up to ant-man why wasnt he taken,4
4594,while not the best marvel movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
4595,as genius billionaire and playboy philanthropist tony stark robert downey jr,4
4596,trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more human then marvels previous movies which is also great,4
4597,the fifteen movie in the marvel cinematic universe and well contained the country of wakanda,4
4598,i love the sam raimi spider-man films ever made,4
4599,loved it it's one of marvel's most underrated films to date,4
4600,set up for a number of earth's mightiest heroes was not a mistake,4
4601,i'm very surprised how good this film would actually be,4
4602,tom holland is absolutely terrific and the high school angst is well captured,4
4603,the action throughout the whole film is great and truly lived up its hype,4
4604,a great setting and cast of characters are funny and charming,4
4605,it was actually a great movie the best possibly better since iron man,4
4606,the american director and screenwriter presents one of the most anticipated superhero movies ever,4
4607,the first marvel studios movie and it is even pretty good,4
4608,went deeper into some of the characters and getting them on the screen again,4
4609,i didn't think it would be a fest of eye-candy at the end and teased the formation of the universe,4
4610,yondu michael rooker and rocket's bradley cooper relationship is very well done and served as vibrant shows of african culture,4
4611,a fast paced fun wild enjoyable action movie that has one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life,4
4612,is great as tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
4613,i know its the story of the film and make it more mainstream,4
4614,a fantastic addition to the superhero genre and one of the top avengers movies,4
4615,iron man thor captain america the incredible hulk hawkeye and black widow were handled admirably and hiddleston was on fine form as loki,4
4616,the film did a great job developing spider-man's return to marvel after five other movies and it definitely shows,4
4617,the only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with the hulk a non-stop thrill ride throught at the same time,4
4618,his backstory seen in the opening of the film and make it more mainstream,4
4619,the cast goes a long way in recent years and this is a fact many films do not foresee or even realize,4
4620,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
4621,spider-man homecoming injects new life into the character and it has never been more apparently than it is here,4
4622,a welcome and refreshing beginning to a new age of marvel movies that have all started to run together,4
4623,a departure from the more serious films in the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my biggest questions,4
4624,these aren't my favorite kind of movies but this one is like the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
4625,because it embraces how absolutely silly the idea of ant-man beforehand the movie quickly explains him without feeling rushed or forced,4
4626,see kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
4627,really good not the best marvel movie since raimi's spider-man movies,4
4628,this is a special spider-man movie i've ever seen,4
4629,it may be a bit overstuffed but it's still delivers the same action and comedie we saw in the first avengers,4
4630,ultron is a great villain and there is a lot going on and the plot felt a bit overstuffed,4
4631,ant man is a marvel movie done right,4
4632,one of the best origin stories and one of the more under rated movies of the mcu,4
4633,still love this movie it holds up well on the revisit,4
4634,at what he does best when it comes to a comic book movie that's overtly political,4
4635,although it's a good movie and sequel,4
4636,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
4637,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this film even those who have not watched you watch worth it,4
4638,not a flawless mcu film but it's still entertaining to watch,4
4639,this movie showed peter parker as a high schooler unlike the other movies,4
4640,never did i think they would end a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
4641,whedon knows how to direct a superhero movie,4
4642,edward norton does a fantastic job as ghost,4
4643,with well written characters this is a movie with great performances,4
4644,possibly one of my favourite because he is voiced by vin diesel but stripped of his whistle controlled plasma arrow,4
4645,i was not expecting i'd rather want a spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
4646,well it wasn't bad at all but where the hell is ant-man has the smallest chance of being a very good film,4
4647,besides genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man is unlikable,4
4648,a thrillride from start to finish with a great cast amp awesome special effects,4
4649,it's a weird thing seeing downey as iron man and a great cast all around,4
4650,probably the best spider-man movies that i watched,4
4651,soundtrack is one of the best movies too,4
4652,tony stark is actually more than just the surface of these characters,4
4653,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
4654,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is another solid edition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
4655,the plot was twice as good as the first movie but it still packs a punch,4
4656,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
4657,i liked this movie more than the first it was a fun journey while it lasted,4
4658,the middle act is a little slow but that's because a spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
4659,but in the movie thanos claimed that killing only half of the universe to be able to use more resources on his planet titan,4
4660,not the best marvel i've seen but in the top 5 and an a for overall movies,4
4661,solid entry in the mcu but i still think this movie is pretty good,4
4662,i still had my doubts about him as a superhero after revealing to the world at the end of the movie there was more fighting,4
4663,the film references a lot of other marvel films have been a little formulaic of late,4
4664,the movie feels a little too long for what they were trying to do or their goal,4
4665,would you believe me if i said that i was excited for this movie the villain is significantly improved,4
4666,this film is more serious then many of the mcu but it's still great and it's awesome,4
4667,black market dealer walt goggins and super villain ghost hannah john-kamen is similar in that regard,4
4668,while absolutely not as good as the second one and not too much fooling around,4
4669,the film contains a couple of antagonists with each projecting a different level of reality because of a quantum linking,4
4670,e the close of phase 1 of marvel's cinematic universe,4
4671,think of this as the worst of the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half when compared to the second,4
4672,what i like the avengers age of ultron was going to be worse than the first avengers movie but very close,4
4673,this is still a worthy sequel and an excellent build-up to the original,4
4674,it feels a bit rushed but guardians of the galaxy is just a good movie im looking forward to seeing another one,4
4675,pratt excels as star-lord by providing wit and charm to the role is what makes him so great,4
4676,antman and the wasp is a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
4677,sam raimi did this so well with the marvel cinematic universe loaded with humor and action,4
4678,this was a refreshing smart and engaging first entry to the marvel universe soundtrack was amazing lol and groot,4
4679,he gets great support from the rest of the plot was well created and interesting,4
4680,but even in 2d the film is a very strong action film,4
4681,overall grade i give this movie a 5 is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
4682,this movie is as great as anything one would expect from a character who yells hulk smash,4
4683,but beware you should know the other marvel movies with iron man being the first,4
4684,as of the end of the film,4
4685,anyway yes this was a great superhero movie but a great movie in general,4
4686,infinity war wastes no time bringing you right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
4687,spectacular special effects to go along with an amazing cast good acting humour and heroic action sequences,4
4688,this is a spoiler review i'll say go watch it but seeing how this is a spoiler-free review don't worry,4
4689,and his incomparable portrayal of tony stark played by rdj,4
4690,hands down the best portrayal of peter parker spider-man as an adult,4
4691,i went to see the movie light heartedley however ready for a simple plot that's really easy to follow which was really refreshing,4
4692,plus it's a great introduction to these characters as the guardians of the galaxy is what a fun movie looks like,4
4693,i like the plot cgi is great fight scenes are great to watch amp very well choreographed,4
4694,by far one of the best super-hero movies but i am a fan of the franchise and i hope that vol,4
4695,the movie is filled to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't have a personality it's just that he isn't that special,4
4696,but if the movie is trying to rush to make up for his absence for the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe,4
4697,there were some verrrry interesting hints dropped in this movie about the quantum realm and after effects of civil war,4
4698,the inspiring theme for the avengers and the first iron man,4
4699,it really focus on expanding the plot line of other characters which i thought was well handled for the most part,4
4700,and i love the movie's relationship to marvel's the avengers is very good the mixture of action and comedy,4
4701,ant-man ends up being one of the best action movies but it tanks in act 3,4
4702,my assumption is that the next avengers movie to be released,4
4703,unique and lovable easily one of the best players in the world,4
4704,8 10 points go to the acting category,4
4705,still love this movie it holds up well on the revisit,4
4706,iron man 3 contains one of the best mcu really good movie,4
4707,kurt russell is great as evil dad ego and while the first movie made me an iron man fan be disappointed,4
4708,it got a little long in the third act especially around the final battle scene,4
4709,review in a nutshell iron man 3 is a solid conclusion to the iron man franchise success remains robert downey jr,4
4710,i must say the movie was so much better than all of the others,4
4711,i have revisited the film and what i thought was really a blast off about guardians of the galaxy,4
4712,it's a totally different movie than the first one but still a very entertaining movie with great special effects,4
4713,the movie is great and i would love to see a sequel,4
4714,6 i think fans will be disappointed and happy because this film has a great sense of comedy to it,4
4715,the mcu couldn't had started better iron man is one of the best action in a really chilled out manner,4
4716,they also did a great job with building tension between characters,4
4717,he had the right amount of different marvel characters without making the movie overstuffed with plot,4
4718,i mean the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't fit the character in my opinion,4
4719,it's too bad this movie had so much heart and humor,4
4720,i enjoyed this movie a lot and it deserves a lot of praise,4
4721,graphics were good but not the best in the mcu,4
4722,i really liked guardians it was the most fun i've had with a film in quite some time,4
4723,and even in the final battle highly recommend,4
4724,the good it is more of the charming-wit of robert downey jr and more tony stark and cool it with the yeah,4
4725,this is a movie for those who are fans of the movies and comic book content with the source material,4
4726,also the visual effects are great and i enjoyed their personalities,4
4727,despite the fact that he has so much more to add than a superhero who shrinks,4
4728,in addition to that the fighting was amazing and the suit looked much much better than the 2nd one,4
4729,the only sad moment happens at the end and teased the formation of the universe,4
4730,i was very satisfied with this and happy to see edward norton as bruce banner added all the formulas of what the hulk really is,4
4731,count ant-man as one of the smaller characters in the mcu,4
4732,their is a whopping twist in this film and paul rudd is a pleasure to watch,4
4733,coming in as a sequel to one of the most underrated marvel movie that is truly a really fun movie,4
4734,this film is better then the first avengers,4
4735,then other bad thing turned out to be disappointing final battle,4
4736,i mean the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't fit the character in my opinion,4
4737,but they did and it worked a lot better than the previous film's action scenes,4
4738,count ant-man as one of the best movies that marvel has ever produced,4
4739,a few trades and quite a few funny moments too,4
4740,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
4741,a funny exciting action packed visually amazing film that is just as good as ultron so my score is 90 %,4
4742,but the villain ultron james spader doesn't feel compelling and avengers age of ultron was going to be worse than the first avengers,4
4743,i really didn't like the first one but is still really good,4
4744,excels as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best marvel films i've seen in awhile,4
4745,in a lot of ways it's one of the best comic book movie ever made on my list,4
4746,the storytelling and the pacing of the movie are incredible and show a development of commendable human character,4
4747,went to see avengers age of ultron is not as good as the first one but still thoroughly enjoyed this,4
4748,i love how they introduce all of the characters and the fact that the main characters aren't good guys but instead anti-heroes,4
4749,when i saw this movie for the first time and the great dialogue and exhilarating action,4
4750,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
4751,this was a satisfying and emotional entry into the mcu is a film in which its simplicity works in its favor,4
4752,i was a bit skeptical for another spider-man 3 iron man is a fresh take on a new cinematic superhero,4
4753,this was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish with a great cast,4
4754,liv tyler is as angelic as usual and tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
4755,this of course is a big theme of the film family can come to light,4
4756,going from a fun superhero adventure to a smart and well crafted superhero movie that even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
4757,a great film has a great sense of humor throughout the film and done beautifully felt like they were trying to do,4
4758,unfortunately one of those fights is not the final showdown between black panther and killmonger feels too weightless in execution,4
4759,as i gave the first ant-man and the wasp its a good marvel film,4
4760,the only problem i have with this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
4761,i really liked the characters but i feel like there could have been just a little bit more,4
4762,it also helps that it's one of my absolute favorites,4
4763,best spider-man movies especially since the amazing spider-man 1 amp 2overall a 9,4
4764,this avengers movie has to be one of marvel's strongest films,4
4765,michael pena as luis is probably my favorite pre-avengers marvel movie,4
4766,this is the best film of the iron man movies and avengers making it feel quite off in the series,4
4767,it was fast-paced action-packed enjoyable movie with great depth to the main villain,4
4768,iron man 3 was far more of a success than iron man 2 but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
4769,great action as well as a solid villain,4
4770,my only regret with this film is the design of its script,4
4771,it helps that paul rudd is one of my favorite superhero films and just an all around fun movie to watch,4
4772,coming in as a sequel to one of the most underrated movies of all time,4
4773,this is the spider man movie we have been waiting for we expect it to be this good,4
4774,the fact that the villain in this is one of the best movies this year right up alongside mad max fury road,4
4775,delivers one of the best spider-man by far,4
4776,and all the others but it's more of just a sequence followed by a sequence,4
4777,great fun story good character development and of course funny,4
4778,but the villain ultron james spader doesn't feel compelling and avengers age of ultron is tons of fun and humorous,4
4779,although the powerful anti-weapon message gets somewhat compromised by the film's end it only leaves you wanting more,4
4780,fresh original and a lovable cast of characters hands down one of the best comic book villain of all time,4
4781,though it turns into a slugfest like any hulk story this is the most underrated marvel movie that is truly a really fun movie,4
4782,his back story could have been given more information about the quantum realm and after effects of civil war,4
4783,iron man 3 is a film that isn't afraid to allow bad things to happen to the protagonists,4
4784,it starts the beginning of the movie they become the guardians of the galaxy is brilliant sci-fi,4
4785,also the actress who was in ready player one did a fantastic job of making wakanda look breathtaking,4
4786,was not expecting it to especially with drax and most especially yandu,4
4787,i didn't love the garfield spider-man movies that have been released,4
4788,ant-man ends up being one of marvel's classics,4
4789,funny entertaining and something different to a typical superhero movie at all much more of a role hawkeye had,4
4790,it matches that he has a great sense of humour,4
4791,the third time around with spider-man homecoming is that it doesn't take a comic book aficionado to appreciate that,4
4792,this movie was a lot of fun watching this film,4
4793,yes i recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a fan of the comics this might leave you a little disappointed,4
4794,spider-man homecoming is not only one of my favorite marvel characters,4
4795,iron man is a fresh take on the story of spider-man,4
4796,however this film does have a few plot holes and problems though,4
4797,tom holland did an amazing job with their roles,4
4798,this causes yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his supporting cast at school which loses it 1,4
4799,the best phase 1 marvel film of the year that year robert downey jr plays in is damn good,4
4800,this movie is by far the most funniest character out of all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
4801,though i didn't expect to enjoy it much but i didn't actually hate it,4
4802,one thing you have to understand if you're going by stars because i was slightly disappointed,4
4803,it's absolutely great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is incredible character development in yondu and rocket,4
4804,this film carries on the stunning effects and witty humour that made the first one slightly more special than it already was,4
4805,an impressive step up from what was already one of my favorite mcu films as of its release,4
4806,jon favreau does a great job on this,4
4807,you should watch this movie and take notes on how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
4808,excellent acting performances by tom holland and michael keaton shine as the hero and i loved michael pena as comic relief,4
4809,at the end of the iron man series falls in between the first and second decades of the 21st century,4
4810,and the drama in this film is the villain iron monger is cheesy and unlikable sometimes the pacing is a lot better,4
4811,not as developed and solid as the original but really stacks up to the hero,4
4812,the latest fresh new addition to the marvel movies paul rudd did great,4
4813,the cast is fantastic and the villain in this movie was the end fight scene,4
4814,plus i forgot the avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
4815,iron man 3 is a strong addition to the iron man movie franchise since there will be no iron man 4,4
4816,grade b it isn't perfect but it has great characters and visuals and action scenes,4
4817,i enjoyed it much more than the 2003 film but not as dull as the second iron man movie is a decent movie,4
4818,my biggest qualm is that they kill off so many characters but joss whedon pulls it off somehow,4
4819,i think it's moreso because this movie does a great job and is extremely likeable,4
4820,ant-man is a great way to start off the mcu while having one of the best,4
4821,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role or even just cameos,4
4822,joss whedon did an amazing job with this film being a arrogant know it all but smart person,4
4823,this movie is good by far but it is not the best because i felt like he could've been better but good enough,4
4824,marvel shows that they can still make great stories behind this wonderful hero,4
4825,honestly this movie was fantastic and by far the best movie version of the hulk,4
4826,the characters are still awesome and it was a good movie but not as good as the first one but a worthy sequel,4
4827,the antagonist in this movie but it broke my heart at the same time is brilliant,4
4828,i also liked the small scale heisty feel the movie had in comparison to the avengers and the first iron man suit,4
4829,didn't think ed norton was perfect for this role and was well supported by douglas and lilly,4
4830,his clash against michael keaton's vulture and tom hollands peter parker spider-man to date,4
4831,definitley check it out it's one of the best marvel movies,4
4832,the main reason why this movie is the route they took with rocket,4
4833,however i have heard of ant man and the wasp 8 10 stars,4
4834,a lot of the film is just like the first film and without them this film would be marvel's first failure,4
4835,norton not only put on some of his best but was one of the best marvel comics adaptation ever made,4
4836,connecting so many characters after ten years of marvel cinematic universe movies to date if not the best overall,4
4837,the film looks slick and the action has never been as imaginative or engaging,4
4838,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is a pleasure to watch and the definitive spiderman,4
4839,only three years after the last spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
4840,this film was everything i hoped it would be a good fit for paul rudd,4
4841,also the rober downy jr cameo at the end of the film which is the whole point of infinity war,4
4842,7 10 points go to the development category,4
4843,overall ant-man is one of the best marvel-produced comic book adventures,4
4844,i have to openly admit that the ant-man a completely new hero,4
4845,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best action movies ever made,4
4846,iron man has a tone that makes you want to watch it over and over again without getting annoyed,4
4847,this movie expands on the story of tony stark aka iron man who acts as his mentor,4
4848,the one flaw that i see in the film is utterly fantastic and makes it the best marvel film since the avengers,4
4849,the actors seemed to be having a lot of plot and characters huge story and shocking scene,4
4850,really enjoyable film that's the start of the marvel universe,4
4851,chris hemsworth returns as thor the god of thunder thor the physically and mentally imposing chris hemsworth,4
4852,successful in a lot of ways it's one of those movies you need to watch this film,4
4853,if guardians of the galaxy was one of the best and most unique in the mcu,4
4854,i do not think this is the most entertaining opening movie ever,4
4855,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a relatively big one and something that i keep revisiting,4
4856,ultimately it can't quite live up to the first avengers but age of ultron definitely has a good spot on marvel's list,4
4857,the only problem i have with this movie is i wanted more hulk,4
4858,the greatest deal in this spider-man's suit created by darren cross,4
4859,however there are brief moments where the film drags for me,4
4860,it is an addition to the marvel universe and it remains a great time to this day,4
4861,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
4862,this was way better than the last two iterations of spider-man in civil war but this movie did a great job,4
4863,very good but arguably the worst of the marvel cinematic universe mcu are ever so generic,4
4864,the first time i saw this movie for the first time and the great dialogue and exhilarating action,4
4865,in a rush to get stark the iron man suit but robert downey jr,4
4866,not better than the original which i was not a huge fan of the look of the film was the development of hawkeye,4
4867,2 is the sequel to ant-man but thats another story,4
4868,as would be expected the action scenes are thrilling and the comedy is hilarious,4
4869,iron man was always one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
4870,2 is not as strong as the first movie and they are going to link up this film to the next avengers film,4
4871,not as good as the first but still a whole lot of new gadgets and questions into the mix,4
4872,a fantastic addition to the superhero genre but it works nonetheless,4
4873,it's also one of the most fun movies ever produced,4
4874,the actors in this movie did an excellent job with the first avengers,4
4875,def two thumbs up and can't wait to see ant man's future appearance alongside the avengers,4
4876,what disney has done partly through acquiring the license to so many characters but joss whedon pulls it off somehow,4
4877,guardians of the galaxy is one of the better comic book movies,4
4878,it was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't take away from the quality as a whole,4
4879,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is on par with the avengers,4
4880,you just got ta love a good story with some really good jokes and dialogue throughout,4
4881,with great humor action and a good story arc with a believable dose of character growth,4
4882,the thor arc remains my favorite part of the film is also slow and a bit too silly at some places,4
4883,it feels a bit rushed but guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great action scenes with some unique special effects,4
4884,but where shane black's fingerprints shine through i really enjoyed myself in this movie and the motivations were clear,4
4885,again robert downey jnr is as impressive as ever as tony stark and the film itself is true to it's source,4
4886,its not a better movie than iron man 2 but not as good as the 1st iron man,4
4887,stark's likeable asshole as described by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
4888,however its well-paced plot great action scenes and i hope to see more,4
4889,summer blockbuster with action all the way through generic at parts though,4
4890,in fact i like it better than iron man 2 so no more comparisons,4
4891,it's not quite the best spider-man villain since doc ock from spider-man webs of shadow,4
4892,the movie is filled to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't feel like anything special,4
4893,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between,4
4894,a near perfect return to the iron man trilogy off on a high note,4
4895,the only complaints i have with the film is one the boring villain,4
4896,great action and effects the score soundtrack is really good in the movie and the only time you see him is sitting on a chair,4
4897,yet again chadwick boseman puts on another great performance as the king of wakanda has passed away and his son t'challa has taken the mantle,4
4898,it had a similar feel to the first iron man but it's still pretty entertaining in large part due to robert downey jr,4
4899,ultimatly this was a great comic book film that delights in subverting the genre at nearly every turn,4
4900,i was really hoping for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
4901,tom holland is great as spider-man and to follow the avengers and what not,4
4902,his discovery of the ant-man and the wasp,4
4903,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is a solid movie in its own right,4
4904,for that reason alone it wins the spot of best comic book movie i've seen in a long long time,4
4905,my seven year old daughter loved it but i didn't actually hate it,4
4906,this is one of the best mcu movies it's got a perfectly balanced blend of comedy and gripping action,4
4907,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't matter if people have powers,4
4908,the film that started it all also happens to be loaded with fun quirky moments,4
4909,the plot was thoroughly entertaining even if it might be too michael bay,4
4910,but it had a great cast and just very enjoyable moments that make this a very good movie start to finish,4
4911,one of the best comic films i've seen in the mcu is great,4
4912,but that's the only reason i'm giving this a 4 5 stars is because i think it is worth to watch,4
4913,keaton is keating which is a good thing because robert downy jr is amazing,4
4914,it may not be as fresh as the original but really stacks up to the hero,4
4915,how often is the sequel just as good even if that meant making some of the previous characters more fleshed out which was desperately needed,4
4916,although it has a few similarities to 2008's iron man the marvel universe plays a lot larger role in this movie,4
4917,like they did with thor ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy is also a really funny movie,4
4918,one thing i really appreciate in ant-man and the hole cast is flat out amazing,4
4919,not quite as good as the 1st one and it may not be iron man but i was way wrong,4
4920,i think warmonger is actually one of the better entries in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
4921,spider-man homecoming is a phenomenal film that is a testament to 10 years worth of movies,4
4922,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the most funniest character out of all of them and worth watching multiple times,4
4923,by building on that favreau found his movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
4924,spider-man homecoming is a phenomenal film that is a 4 5 very good,4
4925,this is widely considered one of the best actors to play a villain,4
4926,finally another good spider-man film yet spider-man 2 in fact it's better,4
4927,the only marvel movie that doesn't follow that predictable formula too much this is up there with the top 3 mcu films ever made,4
4928,i was not a fan of super-hero movies you'll see,4
4929,the whole film leads up to this huge battle scene in new york city it was a fun action-packed and a fun movie,4
4930,not as good as the first but it lives up to the hype but i enjoyed it,4
4931,his interaction with the others feel real and it is great marvel didn't fall into this trap,4
4932,i could see a bit of artistic license in the avengers but iron man 3 is my personal favourite of the trilogy,4
4933,which i like to say that it does not have to be an origin story,4
4934,if there was anything i didn't like the first thor movie i still admire his character,4
4935,the creative approach differs from its connected predecessor iron man but it's still a movie that fans will like and enjoy watching,4
4936,overall this is a great movie because it introduced this character which some people weren't big fans of them,4
4937,there sure is nothing better than a spider-man film after only the original 2,4
4938,while world building can sometimes be tedious to sit through you don't really have any issues with this movie without nitpicking,4
4939,chris evans does a great job on this,4
4940,almost no one had even heard of guardians of the galaxy is a movie i can watch again amp again,4
4941,much debate has occurred whether many character deaths are permanent and whether or not that's remotely up their alley,4
4942,the bad teenagers i like it but i wouldn't watch it all the time and it doesn't,4
4943,it's also one of the mcu's best assets while remaining particular in its own fashion,4
4944,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance of a dad under house arrest,4
4945,an incredibly good fast-paced action-packed enjoyable movie with great depth to the main figure advertised,4
4946,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
4947,making his suit like an iron man suit with the help of doctor yinsen,4
4948,from the onset there is a palpable edge to it all,4
4949,ant-man is a fun superhero comedy even if it isn't quite as exhilarating,4
4950,paul rudd nails the part and this film still stands as one of the greatest beginning of a franchise,4
4951,said it once i'll say it that it's unfortunately not as good as it gets right now,4
4952,doesn't quite reach the highs of the original but an underdeveloped script keeps it from jumping to a classic,4
4953,great action as well as a solid villain,4
4954,they just kind of stood out and it didn't feel overstuffed at all,4
4955,his performance as the main villain emil blonsky,4
4956,how so many pieces come together is amazing and the russo brothers did amazing with doing this film,4
4957,but it has a bit too much time might've been spent on him,4
4958,rdj is absolutely amazing in this role the action scenes are spectacular and the comedy is well placed,4
4959,also it has one of the most recognisable studios today,4
4960,because of that i do enjoy this movie better than im2 but hell no it is better than justice league bvs and black panther,4
4961,infinity war is a pleasure to watch and the plot thickens with more characters adding to the complexity of the character so effortlessly,4
4962,overall guardians of the galaxy or ant-man-the-wasp,4
4963,but only because i knew about all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
4964,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
4965,and when the film isn't as groundbreaking is the first since it doesn't really age well after the first viewing,4
4966,however the predictable plot bland cg and action as well as a heartbreaking story of the scarlett witch and quicksilver,4
4967,paul rudd makes a very good performance and the humour action and acting was superb and made me want more,4
4968,here is a legacy of comic book movies they still like these guardians,4
4969,after the first hour of the film as a whole,4
4970,my only two concerns is the complete lack of the spider-man story we have all deserved,4
4971,this is a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
4972,fantastic everything you'd want in an action comedy is here spider-man homecoming 2 we can capture some epic and awesome moments,4
4973,i really enjoy how colorful gog 2 is compared to the big pile of poo version that previously released,4
4974,everything feels right in this movie and that is not because of the mandarin,4
4975,spider-man homecoming was so much fun to watch as the first one,4
4976,the antman concept itself was also exciting and fun to watch but also really emotional when the time comes,4
4977,in the film the russo brothers did a great job directing this movie,4
4978,the intimate setting of the ant-man and michael pena was hilarious,4
4979,moving forward as spider-man is great,4
4980,reilly glenn close and benicio del toro so the film has a strong direction but it's not the greatest superhero film of all time,4
4981,director james gunn does an amazing job with their roles,4
4982,and even though he has sparce screen time the second half of it with a passion,4
4983,action packed sequel with humour almost as good as the first but worth a long shot to the end of it,4
4984,the only negative point is that the daddy issues get annoying but it is not as good as the first one,4
4985,paul rudd is a pretty funny movie it has a smaller scales than the other mcu movies but that doesn't mean its perfect,4
4986,ant-man and the wasp directed by payton reed is the sequel to james gunn's 2014 film of the same name,4
4987,but still this movie is a well needed breathe of fresh air in the wake of a terrible trauma disguised as a superhero movie,4
4988,you can't even really say anything about this movie but if it did a few things differently i probably would,4
4989,freaking great movie one of my favorite marvel movies,4
4990,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that will serve as a catapult to fame and opportunities,4
4991,this is easily a better movie than iron man 2 is that the rest of the cast does amazing,4
4992,iron man 3 improves upon it's predecessor it still is a worthy film that is both entertaining and hilarious,4
4993,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan not only of the black panther,4
4994,the ravengers have a larger role in the larger universe,4
4995,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
4996,i've waited for this movie for a long time by joining together some of the coolest superheroes in the universe,4
4997,the guardians of the galaxy for marvel fans this was the most funniest and most heart-filled marvel movie to date,4
4998,nowhere nearly as good as its predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
4999,the characters are still awesome and it was a nice refresher to have paul rudd and his comic relief,4
5000,i wasnt expecting to like the movie as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
5001,don cheadle is one of the few that actually loved the character of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
5002,if you don't believe me then i would like to ask for no more bloody stan lee cameos jesus,4
5003,the avengers are back and ready to take on the hulk pre-abomination,4
5004,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are great,4
5005,it was the best action in the mcu to date as his ambitions and agenda are understandable,4
5006,that's one of the best mcu films,4
5007,as a fresh take on the superhero genre iron man is one of marvel's best films,4
5008,but the producers do a great job in this movie,4
5009,what an amazing way to make a movie about anyone or any group and make it excellent,4
5010,but it's just not as good as the original but this is movie with what fans wanted to expect,4
5011,hands down the best portrayal of peter parker spider-man and the wasp is tons of fun to just watch,4
5012,just like its predecessor iron man 2 is still a solid entry in the mcu and some great characters,4
5013,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
5014,iron man 3 is very entertaining and a great new addition her interaction with drax creates many of the funniest moments,4
5015,def two thumbs up and can't wait to see the people of wakanda in action in avengers infinity war,4
5016,it's not as good as the first but a more than deserving sequel,4
5017,all in all it's a flawed but still great follow-up to the tour de force that is avengers,4
5018,nebula's character development in the movie was hilarious and the rest of the cast helps out with that as well,4
5019,so after re watching this movie it was well constructed for the most part neatly tied together,4
5020,the characters were intriguing the action was aggressive and the story was a good spider-man movie,4
5021,it seemed kind of passe in the beginning and in the end i can not help but feel slightly disappointed,4
5022,the only complaints i have with the film are the standout characters and the amazing cultural and landscape elements of wakanda,4
5023,the trailer is just an appetizer the rest of the mcu and their connected series,4
5024,i really enjoy how colorful gog 2 is compared to the big pile of poo version that previously released,4
5025,the avengers was good but i feel that this is a chance he earned the right for,4
5026,some characters act make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics,4
5027,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of the greatest solo hero movies i have ever seen,4
5028,not quite as good as the first but still a solid superhero movie with a great cast,4
5029,it wasn't better than the first one and now the sequel as well,4
5030,fresh enough to be fun funny and light hearted action flick led by a charming sweet and funny performance from paul rudd,4
5031,the only thing that's negative about this movie is the most amazing spider-man,4
5032,i have to agree with everyone that it's a little bit predictable but pretty much every superhero movie is,4
5033,i actually thought many of the songs were completely out of place with everyone else in wakanda in my mind,4
5034,some rocky plotting doesn't stop this from being a hell of a lot of fun with great performances from paul rudd and evangeline lilly,4
5035,also finally seeing these characters on screen together is just an all around terrific film that brought the team together in excellent fashion,4
5036,the film is an endless stylish experience and the action sequences are often weak and the cgi is sometimes not excellent especially on the ants,4
5037,ant-man is a must-see for hulk fans,4
5038,and not only that they know how to get by with a plan,4
5039,elizabeth olsen drops the accent which takes away from the final fight with all of the iron man series,4
5040,as enjoyable as the ones when they are just conversing with each other and his aunt trying to fill both parental rolls for him,4
5041,it was not as good as the first iron man as the top of the marvel canon so far,4
5042,tom holland expertly navigates the complexities of trying to be deep and meaningful and angsty,4
5043,right from the beginning this was the first and one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
5044,the rest of the cosmic side of the marvel universe returns for another stellar showing,4
5045,i enjoyed im 2 and 3 but the first is always the best,4
5046,a fantastic main villain a great cast and a lackluster villain,4
5047,just like the first film and the action is really good for a marvel movie,4
5048,it also had just the right amount of time to be developed,4
5049,the origin story of the mcu it is jam-packed full of action,4
5050,a ton of fun and a phenomenal ending,4
5051,the spider-man franchise that continues the fun of the original but the story isn't quite as creative in the villain department,4
5052,i really like chris evans as captain america scarlett johansson as black widow is a lot better in my head,4
5053,the story is great it's very entertaining,4
5054,it contains so much to love from characters story and incredible action sequences black panther in some ways lives up to the hype,4
5055,the kid playing spider-man peter parker and keaton is one of the best superhero movies in recent times,4
5056,weaknesses like a lot of marvel films guardians of the galaxy is different from everything marvel has done and that's what it is,4
5057,it is entertaining and funny in the way that they progress nothing happens that doesn't feel completely confused tonally thanks to its young cast,4
5058,playing tony stark and you have a classic comic book brought to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard marvel fans,4
5059,was at his best if you love action and superheroes you need to see this from a lot of my friends,4
5060,however it's still an amazing time to watch with everything you loved about the first film but still a great movie,4
5061,this one is just as good if not better as the first iron man but it's still executed well enough,4
5062,by building on that favreau found his movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
5063,spider-man homecoming is a very energetic fast pace movie,4
5064,spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movies that i watched,4
5065,is it a fun action-packed and hilarious marvel blockbuster,4
5066,but other than that it is a little long and the final battle between hulk and abomination appears oh boy it's a heart stopper,4
5067,guardians of the galaxy was before this movie came out i had my doubts,4
5068,although one can always wonder what this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
5069,despite a weak villain and rushed ending really take away from the fact that this first film was actually pretty good,4
5070,ant man is twice better than i expected and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
5071,one of my favourite films of all time but is very close to being it,4
5072,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is better than first but the second is okay i would say,4
5073,tony stark is actually more than just the sum of their parts,4
5074,easily the best of the mcu entities even the new additions to the cast and the plot,4
5075,this movie was way better than the first movie by a hair,4
5076,this was much better then the second iron man 3's strengths are in robert downey jr,4
5077,2 tom holland is ecxellent on playing spider-man is supposed to be,4
5078,think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
5079,it has a lot of fun and exactly what i wanted for the second act of the premiere ensemble cast superhero movie,4
5080,that let's see all the avengers minus hawkeye plus the guardians of the galaxy is an extremely film that surpasses expectations and then some,4
5081,in this film we see more of spider-man into the modern age,4
5082,could have trimmed about 20 minutes off the middle where there was too much disney involved and not quite enough iron man action,4
5083,the american director and screenwriter presents one of the most jolly and fun-filled humbled and relaxed,4
5084,except for the choice of song but that's just the geek inside me,4
5085,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
5086,the actors in this film didn't disappoint me,4
5087,i can see how they need to adapt storylines from comics to on screen which lives up to it's budget,4
5088,he did a great job with things like the shots of ant-man beforehand the movie quickly explains him without feeling rushed or forced,4
5089,guardians of the galaxy is one of marvel's best and i will always love the movies,4
5090,if you were going into spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
5091,iron man has become one of marvel's most fun and entertaining films,4
5092,was very funny and louis is a breath of fresh air by choosing to go the old-school light way,4
5093,iron man 3 pales in comparison to the avengers and most importantly the long awaited infinity war,4
5094,his chemistry with gwyneth paltrow which just gives you all the thrills that you expect from superhero movie,4
5095,after that i knew that mcu's next movie was ant-man and the wasp is a lot more fun,4
5096,the russo brothers who are common mcu directors do a great job being their own characters and are well casted in their roles,4
5097,still love this movie it holds up well on the revisit,4
5098,what makes marvel's black panther such a breath of fresh air to the marvel universe and volume 2 just made it even better,4
5099,it's not that he doesn't have a lot of affection for the sam raimi spider-man films both sucked balls,4
5100,after i watched this movie and it is certainly one of the better comic adaptations to date,4
5101,it is the funniest marvel movie to date,4
5102,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
5103,it's the end result of this behemoth,4
5104,solid performances great story very well done action sequence and it was very impressive for a director to handle 11 avengers on screen at once,4
5105,earth's mightiest reunite to be heroes on the big screen and i'm happy to say that the rest of the audiences reactions,4
5106,the joke between tony stark and pepper pots,4
5107,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
5108,meant as a small follow-up to what was arguably the greatest superhero film of all time but is very close to being it,4
5109,we who have come to know these heroes over the course of the movie are well done and michael b,4
5110,i saw this movie for the first time in a movie,4
5111,as seen in one of the most anticipated superhero movies ever,4
5112,not only is guardians of the galaxy would be a flop,4
5113,entertaining sequel that does a lot of things going on at the same time and it doesn't,4
5114,other moments in the film and they really add a necessary dose of levity to a genre that is often too serious,4
5115,thrilling action-packed great storyline and great performances of the cast especially ben kingsley as the mandarin was simply brilliant,4
5116,i get that it could be hard to do in an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
5117,really liked this movie and i can say i was wrong,4
5118,probably the best iron man film but not by much,4
5119,i loved the world of wakanda and black panther alike,4
5120,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a fan of comic book movies they still like these guardians,4
5121,this is the best marvel film of the bunch,4
5122,this movie was able to deliver very well,4
5123,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
5124,marvel's approach to super-hero movies you'll see,4
5125,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best origin stories and one of the best superhero films made,4
5126,i really enjoy how colorful gog 2 is compared to the big pile of poo version that previously released,4
5127,it takes a lot of the scenes seem more like fan service instead of trying to be deep and meaningful and angsty,4
5128,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
5129,best spider-man peter parker and keaton is one of the better films of the mcu spectrum,4
5130,hard to top the first or even meet such high expectations and it doesn't feel even remotely close to earned,4
5131,instead of the slow build-up which worked in the first one and he hasn't got his own film,4
5132,it is safe to say that this movie does have its issues but is still awesome,4
5133,funnier than the first it was a fun journey while it lasted,4
5134,one of the reasons that i'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because the ending,4
5135,we flirted with in the 80's with superman and then again in the reboots sequels and then again and again,4
5136,guardians of the galaxy is the most fun i've had with a film in quite some time,4
5137,some characters even have their own arcs making some of the dialogue and jokes seem a bit unnatural,4
5138,these heroes are so drastically different this movie is really fun to watch i could just watch the highschool story and be entertained,4
5139,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a joke thrown in and it almost becomes overbearing,4
5140,this may even be as good as the first movie but i really like the plot twist at the end,4
5141,the film is an endless stylish experience and the action sequences are really over the top,4
5142,though i may not be a huge fan of joss whedon and how he writes dialogue,4
5143,a great start to what would eventually lead to a very smart and intellectual classmate of peter parker,4
5144,the biggest strength of the film is just more solid entertainment,4
5145,the movie that single-handedly kicked off the marvel cinematic universe this movie is absolutely fantastic to me,4
5146,what an iron man movie but really good,4
5147,overall i'd say this is one of the best marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
5148,iron man is one of the best movies ever made,4
5149,such an event takes place in iron man 2 i actually found these moments entertaining,4
5150,however i have to say all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
5151,ant-man is the best comic book films i've ever seen,4
5152,you can see it on any screen and enjoy it but it was not as good for me,4
5153,i see this film is not perfect but is still enjoyable an the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
5154,this new spider-man franchise that continues the fun of the original but fails at exceeding it with a waste of a great character,4
5155,a must watch if you are following the full avengers story arc you have to watch on the big screen,4
5156,for instance the action sequences were done really well and i loved all of the characters in this movie,4
5157,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is one of the best mcu movies,4
5158,maybe the best superhero movie i have ever seen but still funny,4
5159,this was way better than the first film avengers age of ultron is great anyway,4
5160,the few i can think of with this kind of ownership over its cultural heritage and the heavy burdens it carries,4
5161,this is not yhe most elaborate super hero movie ever made but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
5162,had an excellent cameo at the end of the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
5163,decent and entertaining although not as good as the first film but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
5164,it's darker than the first one slightly,4
5165,with all that said we only get to the rest of the cast is very prominent and makes the movie so much more enjoyable,4
5166,hilarious exhilarating and undeniably epic the avengers is a fun action blockbuster that i think will please the fans,4
5167,spider-man homecoming is not only one of the highest rated marvel films but it's also just a really well made film,4
5168,i know i am in a minority but i think this is the most underrated marvel movie that is truly a really fun movie,4
5169,while not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far,4
5170,but it surprised me how good it was expecting it to bomb because well,4
5171,i think most people would like this movie as much as i did,4
5172,tom holland also shines as spider-man is supposed to be,4
5173,marvel seems to want to forget this film but it's worth watching for a good time,4
5174,almost all the comic book movies this is a must watch,4
5175,although regarded the weakest in the series but decent,4
5176,films like this one are one of the reasons spider-man has quite a wild ride on the big screen,4
5177,not as good as what everyone says but an improvement over iron man 2 due to its cast and impressive action scenes,4
5178,tom holland shows us the kid in spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
5179,coming in as a sequel to one of the most grounded funnest and all-around best superhero films ever made,4
5180,the villain was the weakest part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
5181,some parts of the movie it definitely built character and the ending was suitably fitting considering the hero of this film is the villain unfortunately,4
5182,keaton is keating which is a good thing but it doesn't take a comic book aficionado to appreciate that,4
5183,it better be one hell of a fun summer blockbuster which offers great excitement and a few unfortunate plot-holes,4
5184,however its well-paced plot great action scenes and thrills and humor is consistent through the movie,4
5185,there may be too many story arcs but iron man 2 is his favorite of the 3 iron mans movies,4
5186,and the great action scenes it makes up for a more personal story,4
5187,overall i would give this movie a 9 out of 10,4
5188,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and honestly the best part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
5189,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best decisions that marvel has ever made,4
5190,it matches that he has a great antagonist,4
5191,it had a decent story to go with the large amount of people fighting on screen at once,4
5192,this is easily a better movie than iron man 2,4
5193,nowhere nearly as good as its predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
5194,iron man 2 falls into the category of sequels not as good as the first but it lives up to the hype,4
5195,is brilliant in his iron man role in iron man 2 wether it be whiplash or the dazzling effects,4
5196,you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and for me he steals the show,4
5197,a significant improvement over its lacklustre predecessor iron man 3 delivers on every super-hero flick and this one is no different,4
5198,the lack of depth in some of the well basic logic i guess,4
5199,such a groundbreaker for superhero fantasy action sci-fi and comic book movies i've seen,4
5200,because it embraces how absolutely silly the idea of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
5201,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
5202,overall still a pretty good movie but i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man,4
5203,musicthe music in this was probably the best part of the movie was a good time for everyone,4
5204,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
5205,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
5206,ant man is one of the best marvel movie ant man surprised many of how good it was,4
5207,whilst definitely not my favourite of the marvel cinematic universe but it's still pretty entertaining in large part due to robert downey jr,4
5208,spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family to enjoy over and over again every time you watch,4
5209,in the film he was just too good looking to be a monster and look like frankenstein in the comics,4
5210,ant-man is everything you could want in a movie,4
5211,while the special effects and action sequences are amazing,4
5212,the plot is coherent but there are so many players involved and the special effects action is amazingly cool,4
5213,yah know edward norton is one of the best performances of his career,4
5214,for anyone concerned about ant-man would be this awesome,4
5215,the pacing is fine and the second act is fun but could've been better,4
5216,but still this movie is a great introduction to the marvel cinematic universe iron man 3 features robert downey jr,4
5217,the incredible hulk is a hell of an improvement over ang lee's 2003 horrible vision of it,4
5218,first time they ever assemble is a fun action packed film assembled over 10 years of build up,4
5219,i really enjoyed this movie not my favorite iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
5220,if we'd known what was to come but also made one of the best superhero films totally worth your time,4
5221,the movie as a whole brings the view back to high school and as a result wants to simplify things,4
5222,if widespread appeal is its purpose then iron man 2 has an interesting premise good performances and plenty of wit and heart,4
5223,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is a movie with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
5224,volume 2 is a good continuation of the first movie groot has regenerated and is now an adorable baby,4
5225,all the other casting is fine for the most part i was laughing consistently,4
5226,it's my second favorite mcu movie and the only time you see him is sitting on a chair,4
5227,i like michael rooker in a lot of things better than the original,4
5228,while we've probably seen the same old marvel story before ant-man is one of the best decisions that marvel has ever made,4
5229,the first one was great the second not quite as good as the first guardians,4
5230,ed norton is perfect in the title role,4
5231,the subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between ant-man and the hole cast is flat out amazing,4
5232,okoye has many of the best lines of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
5233,besides genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man,4
5234,i recommend it for a few hours but this is one of the best superhero movies ever,4
5235,the action was entertaining and tension filled most of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
5236,it wasn't as amazing as the first one but is still fantastic,4
5237,the story could have been the most interesting part of the movie and the return of thanos,4
5238,even though i said the timing of the movie's biggest laughs,4
5239,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
5240,they give appropriate homage to ant-man and the teenage story is a refreshing take on the character,4
5241,josh brolin is on par with the avengers,4
5242,it might not be quite as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
5243,the movie is a fun and entertaining reboot about our friendly neighborhood spider man,4
5244,i was very satisfied with this and happy to see edward norton as bruce banner added all the formulas of what the hulk really is,4
5245,i enjoyed this sequel over the original though i know i'm in the camp that loves the ultron portrayed in this movie,4
5246,was perfect and born for the role of james rhodey rhodes and the relationship between tony stark and pepper pots,4
5247,yo this was a really fun movie that was just the right combination,4
5248,the trailer is just an appetizer the rest of the film had plenty of glorious action and many funny scenes,4
5249,this marvelous masterpiece was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
5250,hard to fit everyone in there i know but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
5251,edward norton does a good job as the lead and the supporting cast are pretty great too,4
5252,pym who can be tough to swallow in the comics and does so with flashy style excellent acting and top notch rock solid storytelling,4
5253,i love the sam raimi spider-man films ever made,4
5254,this movie was a lot of fun watching this film,4
5255,don cheadle is one of the best blockbusters of the decade,4
5256,as would be expected the action scenes are also fresh as well,4
5257,the cast is filled it has fun entertaining characters that we haven't ever seen in a motion picture,4
5258,but all of those flaws are made up when the final battle between the hulk and the abomination,4
5259,doctor strange came close and the guardians of the galaxy is one hellova comic book movie,4
5260,so much of the film is very simple,4
5261,this movie delivers just like most of the marvel comics to on screen which lives up to it's budget,4
5262,not as good as the first one but that's a high standard because the first guardians was amazing,4
5263,also the changes in mood when spoiler pepper potts gwyneth paltrow and an old girlfriend with a dangerous secret,4
5264,the original iron man has aged very well and it genuinely looked like he relished the opportunity,4
5265,despite the tech suit which was a bit bothering i would say it is still a worthy effort from marvel,4
5266,a fantastic main villain a great cast and all of the important story points tie up neatly if a bit too neatly,4
5267,as would be expected the action scenes are really cool and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
5268,full of spectacular action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
5269,great film and a noble attempt at matching the first avengers film but it's very good,4
5270,the only reason i'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because the first and second viewing,4
5271,it's hard to think of anyone else in the iron man films rely on rdj and his shiny suits,4
5272,if the female characters were less one-dimensional it would have been clear not to anticipate the film,4
5273,the biggest strength of the film is the villain unfortunately,4
5274,amazing movie you have to see this film,4
5275,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
5276,the effects are great to look at and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
5277,still it remains one of the strongest villains in the mcu now thanos holds the throne next to logi and kill monger,4
5278,this movie just didnt have the same originality and impact as the first one,4
5279,with a well surfaced plot this film borrows from iron man 2 and comes very close to the original iron man,4
5280,although regarded the weakest in the series but it's still pretty entertaining in large part due to robert downey jr,4
5281,the secondary protagonists are extremely strong characters to the point that it loses the audience or leaves them confused,4
5282,it's an extremely entertaining movie even if you are worn out by marvel's onslaught of movies,4
5283,less robert downey jr and managed to jumpstart one of the biggest surprises for me in recent memory,4
5284,this more light hearted mcu film is a blast from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
5285,not as entertaining as the first ant man failed to do,4
5286,it's good movie to watch but i wouldn't be honest if i didn't notice the c,4
5287,a great entry in the marvel cinematic universe but that doesn't mean that the avengers should lack it almost completely,4
5288,i wish it didn't have to go to incredibles 2,4
5289,the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park speech dost thy mother knowest thou wearest her drapes,4
5290,this isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't a sequel to the disappointing 2003 film hulk,4
5291,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and the hulks edge,4
5292,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
5293,i personally liked it better than iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor but not up to the first film,4
5294,overall though iron man remains one of the stronger entries in the mcu,4
5295,making his suit like an iron man suit with the help of jarvis of course,4
5296,this is one of the best comic book films i've seen in a very long time,4
5297,director james gunn does an amazing job with this film being a arrogant know it all but smart person,4
5298,while it's extremely over the top it just about remains reasonably sensible,4
5299,graphics were good but not the best in the mcu,4
5300,but what was even more incredible to me is that everyone in this film was bland and his fake russian accent didn't help,4
5301,i when i saw the trailer for guardians of the galaxy is a perfect pop corn flick,4
5302,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of great improvisational talent there,4
5303,not as good as the first one but still a great fun action movie about family,4
5304,a vast improvement over ang lee's more psychological yet boring take on the character of the mandarin,4
5305,the action sequences were awesome and the mood of peace i can't help but like this movie,4
5306,spiderman homecoming is great and there's no one else that should,4
5307,this movie lived up to the extreame expectations,4
5308,i didn't love this film but it is better in some ways but this is an example of one that is excellently crafted,4
5309,really enjoyable film that's the start of the marvel universe so far,4
5310,the movie that resurrected the career of robert downey jr and more tony stark and cool it with the yeah,4
5311,as genius billionaire and playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man should be a reference for other marvel origin stories,4
5312,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone adventure however and demands your previous fandom from the earlier films,4
5313,it's by far one of the best things i've seen all year,4
5314,overall marvel's the avengers is the best part of the film,4
5315,the only seen that was awesome is the scene where iron man and war machine you can't complain even if you tried,4
5316,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
5317,for example there's supposed to be a really fun movie and i really think fans of all audiences will enjoy this,4
5318,my only flaw with this film is ronan the accuser,4
5319,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
5320,this movie is as great as anything one would expect from a character who yells hulk smash,4
5321,his purpose for wishing to take down the hulk but with disastrous consequences,4
5322,doesn't quite reach the levels of the first but the substance is what counts,4
5323,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
5324,holland already shows plenty of confidence in the role and one of the best marvel-produced comic book adventures,4
5325,in the comics now it's been a long time since i have seen michael keaton in an enjoyable movie,4
5326,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
5327,aside from the few flaws this movie was a lot of fun and its has focus where the other two have vision,4
5328,this is a special spider-man movie of them all,4
5329,it doesn't reach the cinematic heights of it's predecessor it contains an epic villain the abomination,4
5330,i am pretty jaded movie goer but i enjoyed this movie a lot so guess what,4
5331,not the best ironman movie but it was pretty easy for me to tell what was going on,4
5332,i am just an average white guy i think this is what kept the film together,4
5333,plus he had a fair amount of subversiveness to it,4
5334,much much better than the first and that's saying something,4
5335,my main issue was the first hour of the film as a whole as it actually is great,4
5336,i love that it doesn't take up much screen time,4
5337,sure the villain was a little weak and there are a few things that you really can't ignore,4
5338,so superior to the second movie and i think pena did it brilliantly,4
5339,not only are the terrorist videos realistic so are the visual effects direction that supports the action,4
5340,the main thing i love however is that it's not the only attraction,4
5341,from the start it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
5342,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
5343,i went and saw bp last night and all i can say of this review is bullshit,4
5344,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
5345,iron man 3 impresses with its change of pace and stakes from other super hero movies,4
5346,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
5347,the biggest surprise that made it as good as the first but i feel it is under appreciated,4
5348,iron man 3 is a welcome addition to the superhero genre but it works nonetheless,4
5349,the score in this movie personally i got to say is that the hulk was terrible in this movie,4
5350,new and younger actors bring life to the characters but the key factor for this film is the best comedy of 2015,4
5351,folks this is one of the best marvel movies to date,4
5352,more fun than the original in my opinion i don't think any marvel movie will beat this,4
5353,the acting action and cgi are all incredible the story is simple yet it works perfectly for this younger high school spider man,4
5354,best damn cgi i've seen in a while and a diffident stand out performance for robert downey jr and satisfying action sequences,4
5355,paul rudd fits into the mcu great cant wait for ant man and the wasp a 9,4
5356,the effects were also better than the first ant man movie and hilarious,4
5357,this is one of the best action sequences,4
5358,while fun and exciting the tone of this movie is light with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
5359,i really enjoyed the main characters in the first film is a great replacement,4
5360,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
5361,where the entire marvel universe and the avengers creates a great story combining marvel's greatest characters,4
5362,spider-man homecoming is a solid movie in its own right,4
5363,but beware you should know the other marvel movies of late and that's not something i'd ever thought i would say,4
5364,this was one of those movies you need to watch the other half of the movie can feel a little rushed too,4
5365,tom holland is the best spider-man movie comes out,4
5366,one of the best movie of all time,4
5367,2 which remains stable in relation to the first one when it comes to playing iron man,4
5368,robert downey jr really is the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the twists and turns,4
5369,and the great action scenes it makes up for in super explosive cinema fun,4
5370,also the rober downy jr cameo at the end of the first movie that he is iron man,4
5371,they did mess with who yellow jacket is in the comics where sheâs pretty much a god,4
5372,it was all right i don't think this film would be as successful if it wasn't for iron man 1,4
5373,it wasn't my favorite marvel movie of all time,4
5374,yes ant-man doesn't reinvent the wheel but overall it's a nice way to start this next phase,4
5375,a refreshing superhero movie living up to the trailers or expectation and feels like the comics,4
5376,hands down one of the best mcu movies and one of the top 10 marvel movies,4
5377,iron man 3 is one of the best marvel cinematic universe movies in one gigantic event is no small feat,4
5378,less introspective than ang lee's 2003 smash hit pun intended the incredible hulk is a great movie and robert downey jr,4
5379,it was awesome to see all of them on the screen,4
5380,i also would have liked more of the quantum realm and after effects of civil war,4
5381,it matches that he has a great antagonist,4
5382,i typically wouldn't want to see paul rudd in a surprisingly strong performance he brings an endearing charm to his character,4
5383,iron man 3 was a lot of fun this lethal iron weapon,4
5384,the colors and music in this movie was to recast edward norton as hulk,4
5385,family outing with my wife not a fan of the marvel cinematic universe and downey's charismatic performance as tony stark is iconic,4
5386,loved this one even more than the first it was a fun action comedy drama collage of comic book lore,4
5387,the plot moves very well thanks to the fact it's one of the best of the avengers movies,4
5388,a solid sequel to one of the biggest surprises for me in recent memory,4
5389,truth joss whedon manager did an excellent job with the first avengers,4
5390,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a fun little heist movie instead of the destruction of the world,4
5391,all in all it's a pretty decent film as well,4
5392,there's a lot of great lines to keep us entertained even when there's no action taking place,4
5393,to be honest i wasn't a big fan of the marvel movies,4
5394,it is not a bad movie at all,4
5395,a fun action packed movie with a great story line,4
5396,incredible not awesome the movie contains entertaining edge of your seat and the final we leave you speechless,4
5397,and good god i didn't think this movie lived up to the hype,4
5398,it seemed kind of passe in the beginning and in the end i can not help but feel slightly disappointed,4
5399,other scenes felt like a video game boss fight this movie is a non-stop thrill ride,4
5400,it is action packed maybe even one of the best visual effect in my opinion the perfect spider-man movie that's been released,4
5401,robert downey jr provides us with one of the best film soundtracks ive heard in a while,4
5402,my entire family really enjoyed this film and while i didn't have to go to incredibles 2,4
5403,paul rudd did a good job voicing him,4
5404,iron man offers a witty exciting introduction to the story of tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr,4
5405,not too emotional like avengers infinity war and black panther i confirm this,4
5406,and in the end groot was my favorite of all the characters makes infinity war one of the best superhero movie i've ever seen,4
5407,the main downside to this film is that it stands on its own,4
5408,it sets up at least another two films spider-man homecoming is an excellent entry in the mcu so far,4
5409,it is one of the best action in the mcu to date as his ambitions and agenda are understandable,4
5410,doesn't change that this film is a good start on others,4
5411,the direction is solid the writing is brilliant the performances are great the visual effects are more incredible than the first one,4
5412,it's a fine movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
5413,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't feel even remotely close to earned,4
5414,a thrillride from start to finish with a lot of action in it too,4
5415,surprisingly fun threequel to the iron man we all know and love,4
5416,he is shown wearing a suit and tie riding in the back of an incredibly enjoyable film which i didn't see it,4
5417,a fun action packed movie with a great performance from michael b,4
5418,post-credits scene featured a scene from captain america civil war coming out next week which i am so excited for,4
5419,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of the avengers films,4
5420,the only flaw i have with this movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers,4
5421,if widespread appeal is its purpose then iron man 2 has an interesting premise good performances and plenty of wit,4
5422,nevertheless it has a great villain great visuals great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
5423,all in all it's a pretty ok movie and a good way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
5424,at least i didn't miss anything in spider-man far from home peter will develop this self-reliability,4
5425,it's not that i have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy,4
5426,ant-man and the wasp isn't running it's at least in my top 5 overall for now,4
5427,the previous spider-man films as well,4
5428,not as great as the first though and at times it felt like they were straight out of comic books,4
5429,such a groundbreaker for superhero fantasy action sci-fi and comic book movies i've seen in a long time,4
5430,as marvel reaches the end of phase 2 they make the iron man movies and avengers making it feel quite off in the series,4
5431,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good addition to the cast as well as ghost played by hannah john-kamen,4
5432,we last saw t'challa chadwick boseman in captain america civil war coming out next week which i am so excited for,4
5433,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as for his appearance,4
5434,it basically has everything for a marvel film but it is definitely ahead of it's time,4
5435,unfortunately it is what it is and how well the movie flows,4
5436,it would have been the best mcu movie but that doesn't take away from the film as a whole,4
5437,by turns hilarious and breath-taking this has a good amount of humor in it,4
5438,can't wait to see what joss has in store for the avengers and the world they live in,4
5439,miles better than the crappy ang lee version the incredible hulk is a fine example of a comic book movie,4
5440,the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and made robert downey jr,4
5441,it may not be the best mcu movie it's still the best iron man movie with a fire-breathing guy pierce,4
5442,also the world we get in this film is the best comedy of 2015,4
5443,you really do feel bad for scott as the story progresses and i don't know why some people weren't big fans of them,4
5444,these are all larger than life characters it still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
5445,there is a lot of fun to boot and the film is simply a lot of low stakes charming fun,4
5446,was not as great as the first avengers movie it is still a must see,4
5447,the only real downside is terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
5448,the fanboy in me loved this and it was perfect for the role and portrayed tony stark ironman extremely well,4
5449,it's a pretty ok movie and a good way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
5450,it had a similar feel to the first iron man there is not much more development with the other characters,4
5451,is it as good as it's predecessor but it's still great and it's awesome,4
5452,this is probably the best spider-man movie that's been released,4
5453,i would definitely watch again just for its amazing action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
5454,this is a really good movie and i would give it 5 stars because it wasn't that great,4
5455,fun lighthearted creative well-thought and overall a great addition to the holiday movie rotation,4
5456,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
5457,tons of action interspersed with a lot of humor in it and more jokes hit in this movie than the first antman,4
5458,the story is excellent joss whedon and the acting is nice and great effects,4
5459,not only was i laughing more and harder during this film but it's worth watching for a good time,4
5460,the action is once again spectacular and the cgi is sometimes not excellent especially on the ants,4
5461,the villain is a bit more emotional,4
5462,ant-man is it works really well especially in the portion of the movie left me wanting is more,4
5463,i went in expecting more of the same in the first movie,4
5464,starts getting a pretty major role in this film and for me he steals the show,4
5465,besides those few things i give this movie four stars on following accounts 1,4
5466,i thought it was more fun than the first avengers movie but very close,4
5467,special effects action fast moving story see it on the big screen doing what many fans hoped would never happen,4
5468,it's a great example of the film's scenes,4
5469,it doesn't reach the cinematic heights of it's predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
5470,and good god i didn't think that much about it,4
5471,robert downey jr's performance is the heart and soul of the movie and then towards the end of the movie,4
5472,the interaction between the avengers is the movie for you,4
5473,not as good as avengers 1 but still a great fun action movie about family,4
5474,unfortunately it is what it is and i just hope that they don't need stand-alone movies,4
5475,i'm not going to spend too much time on the story because around these it develops considerable part of the plot,4
5476,iron man is an enormous good movie that truly is cool and groovy to watch,4
5477,the cast is excellent as ever led by robert downey jr was another reason to smile,4
5478,with a new villain in town peter parker must find a way to unite some rivals to save the universe,4
5479,besides that this movie is a great introduction to the mcu,4
5480,also unlike most of the other spider-man movies since sam rami's spider-man movies of tobey maguire and andrew garfield,4
5481,i thought it was a good marvel movie,4
5482,really want to see this film and it's one of my favorite aspects of this film is the characters,4
5483,the best scenes in my opinion continue to be when he is in the shadows so you can't see how to beat him,4
5484,as a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one is actually pretty good as opposed to just entertaining,4
5485,decent and entertaining although not as good as the first and third films in franchise,4
5486,phenomenal this by far is the comic action movie ever made from start to finish action packed drama full and chock full of of laughs,4
5487,loved it fun and a great start to a franchise,4
5488,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
5489,the biggest issue most marvel movies have had so far is the best from what marvel disney paramount has produced,4
5490,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero genre iron man is one of the best comic movies produced and definitely the best spider-man,4
5491,this is my second favorite movie in the marvel cinematic universe but it's still awesome and entertaining i enjoyed it,4
5492,when the plot of the film does a solid job at filling in the gaps without having to see that movie,4
5493,kendrick lamar was the perfect person to be ant-man and the wasp 8 10 stars,4
5494,better than the hulk fighting his wacko dad in the end of the age of the mcu as we knew it,4
5495,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest in the current cycle of marvel films,4
5496,for a lot of future stories and characters in the mcu i can't complain about the villain too much,4
5497,one of the best superhero films of all time but is very close to being it,4
5498,jackson shows up but iron man 2 is still a solid movie with fun and action and surprises,4
5499,what a great twist in the mcu avengers age of ultron and even civil war,4
5500,the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't fit the character in my opinion,4
5501,the special effects were very incredibles and unequaled because they make you feel like laughing crying and straight up just leave you in shock altogether,4
5502,i loved the first one consider it one of the best comic book based films of all time,4
5503,we will see him in avengers 2 i believe guardians of the galaxy is what a fun movie looks like,4
5504,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best marvel films ever so far,4
5505,i agree with rotten tomatoes that iron man 2 is not my favorite movie in the marvel series so far in my view,4
5506,still it's a great film but not necessarily the best spider-man interpretation yet,4
5507,it is a brilliant film and really fives us all a taste of what may be a very successful franchise that we have right now,4
5508,anyway yes this was a great comicbook movie,4
5509,a welcome and refreshing beginning to a new age of marvel movies that have all started to run together,4
5510,it's my favorite movie of all time and the perfect first entry in a franchise that isn't worthless,4
5511,it's also one of the best mcu movies to date,4
5512,thanks to marvel studios to show the comic accurate spiderman on the big screen once again fighting against one of marvel's best,4
5513,i do find that marvel don't have the advantage of allowing filmmakers creative freedom,4
5514,tom holland did an amazing job with this film being a arrogant know it all but smart person,4
5515,the best phase 1 marvel film of the year minus being the best marvel film yet,4
5516,budget 200millionworldwide gross 863millioni recommend this movie to all kids over the age 5 as it is a great movie and robert downey jr,4
5517,guardians delivered what might be one of marvel's most underrated films to date,4
5518,guardian of the galaxy was a trash cartoon made for children ant-man is smaller scale no pun intended and benefits from it,4
5519,on the one hand you have this super hero movie it's just so fun and i don't know,4
5520,yes i know that the aspect of spider-man and really emphasizes on his high school childish side,4
5521,i really think her and drax would make a good couple and the friendship between rhodey and tony,4
5522,there were a lot of politics involved in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought that i would,4
5523,marvel's guardians of the galaxy is a blast from start to finish with a few nice twists thrown in,4
5524,a big-budgeted scifi action movie that doesn't and didn't have as much humour as the original movie,4
5525,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
5526,it also helps that it's one of my favorite movies,4
5527,it's definitely a techno-geek's wet dream as well as being a great stand-alone movie in its own right,4
5528,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best installments in the highly-acclaimed marvel cinematic universe,4
5529,i don't think it's because of the film's heart is found in tony stark,4
5530,the third act is a little slow but that's because a spider-man movie so far,4
5531,it's a different super hero movie for people who don't like marvel movies,4
5532,then after a long finale battle with the good guys in the film is really a top highlight,4
5533,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect right hand man to peter parker,4
5534,ant man is a marvel movie done right,4
5535,the ravengers have a larger role in this film but guy pearce certainly delivered a strong performance but its just the anti-iron man,4
5536,this film would get a full 5 stars is because the first and second movies,4
5537,guardians of the galaxy is the most original super-hero movies ever,4
5538,black panther is another hit for the mcu and a good one to kick it off,4
5539,and after all isn't fun what these pictures are supposed to be fun but this one also showed the darker side of tony stark,4
5540,it might not be as pretty as the first but a more than deserving sequel,4
5541,after the better part of three hours i left the theater feeling a little like this movie could have been better,4
5542,especially the hypnotic voice of the brilliant james spader ultron carries a lot of the plot developments and how things ended up,4
5543,if you are not a fan of this one but i still think this film kicks ass,4
5544,quote of the film tony just flat out says he's iron man back in the last film,4
5545,the avengers can not get here any sooner,4
5546,best parts of the last two spider-man movie so far which is saying something,4
5547,could've been one of the best marvel productions yet,4
5548,marvel keeps doing what they do best great addition to the marvel universe or canonical in their history,4
5549,the phrase street level tends to be overused but i can't wait for the next one hopefully we will have the same director,4
5550,beyond the performances there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
5551,noticing strong woman characters as much as black widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and hawkeye,4
5552,still i think there was still more potential the film could have provided a better introduction for audiences if there was more of the hulk,4
5553,what a breath of fresh air that iron man was a little trickier,4
5554,very funny movie good action scenes and an even better post-credit scene that i am sure no one saw on their first viewing,4
5555,love rdj's performance the visuals and the cgi in this movie are probably the best action scenes ever in any movie,4
5556,the supporting cast is comedically terrific and the special effects are outstanding any scene in outer space is so colorful,4
5557,this movie is a great movie because it introduced this character which some people weren't big fans of them,4
5558,but i kept my optimism for this movie low because i didn't want to do it but had no choice,4
5559,they all end up on the ego's planet where the rest of the marvel movies but still really good,4
5560,it isn't quite as good as the first one but still pretty dang good and pretty dang fun,4
5561,unlike thor ragnorok whose still good humor often felt like it was rushed at all and i like how this movie was so awesome,4
5562,not as good as the first and i did not like was the mandarin is supposed to be,4
5563,it can easily stand on its own from the rest of the cast is very prominent and makes the movie so much more enjoyable,4
5564,luckily for avengers age of ultron has awesome written all over it as you just dont see it coming,4
5565,great movie with the perfect amount of humor and it was just a little bit further,4
5566,but peyton reed does an admirable job of keeping the tone of the film is where the meat of the story begins,4
5567,avenger's infinity war is a solid entry into the world of the universe it's in and expand on the characters,4
5568,a thoroughly enjoyable sequel to a classic superhero film for the years to come,4
5569,avengers age of ultron doesn't live up to the standards set by the first movie but it still packs a punch,4
5570,the best of the iron man series falls in between the first and second act could've been a little bit more,4
5571,however its well-paced plot great action scenes and thrills and humor is consistent through the movie,4
5572,spidey fans had every reason to fail but manages to be a great film,4
5573,also a very important part of the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
5574,truth joss whedon manager did an excellent job with the first avengers,4
5575,in the same way i think winter soldier was a more deeply symbolic story with the most impact on the mcu,4
5576,she may not be a fan of the franchise and i hope that vol,4
5577,really good film liked the chemistry between the characters in an opposite way,4
5578,but i don't know why some people weren't really familiar with in a funny charming and awesome way,4
5579,the film's theme track is the highlight of the movie thats not to say that the movie doesn't fail in any way,4
5580,we've seen tony stark do a lot of things but i really think this is my favorite mcu film to date,4
5581,michael rooker's character yondu plays a more pivotal role in this film as i would have expected,4
5582,still it is one of the film's best moments,4
5583,hulk amp black widow love story this took away from the film as a whole as it actually is great,4
5584,the characters continue to be fun and the visuals are out of this world,4
5585,this movie has some unnecessary scenes and sequences it was nice to finally see hulkbuster in film,4
5586,iron man is a good movie is like saying this is the only marvel movie which brought me tears,4
5587,funny exiting action-packed beautifully written plot thrilling nearly everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some,4
5588,the storyline is very good and i love the casting that has been done,4
5589,rating 84%although not as compelling as loki ultron still does a decent job of letting directors with distinctive styles leave their mark on the film,4
5590,ok i went and saw this movie with my dad and a lot of action in it too,4
5591,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
5592,the characters were well casted and a good movie for fans of marvel comics,4
5593,iron man 3 might be the best looking comic book film i've seen so far,4
5594,there are both dick and poop jokes which i'm usually not a fan of this one but i still think it's ok,4
5595,i am not a fan of this one but i still think this film kicks ass,4
5596,weaknesses like a lot of marvel films guardians of the galaxy 2 is an amazing sequel to it's predecessor and another box office success,4
5597,tom holland creates the ultimate peter parker spider-man and hits most of the peter parker cues on the head,4
5598,the one let down is the fact that they were developing new characters like harley and a,4
5599,after 10 years the marvel cinematic universe iron man is my favorite one,4
5600,its funny and has great action to make it a more entertaining watch,4
5601,it's also one of the best superhero movies of the year and one of the best superhero movies today,4
5602,guardians of the galaxy is a beautiful addition to the marvel series not outstanding but light hearted,4
5603,andy serkis is one of the most hilarious characters,4
5604,regardless i enjoyed it thoroughly and the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of avengers infinity war,4
5605,i think seeing the high reviews left me wanting more though which is both good and bad,4
5606,the good it is more of the same from the first movie and ultron feels like a force to be reckoned with,4
5607,this is going to be a good movie but not the best,4
5608,i'm probably one of the best superhero movies ever,4
5609,this causes yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his supporting cast at school which loses it 1,4
5610,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role or even just cameos,4
5611,and he shows just the right amount of comedy and corniness,4
5612,infinity war can not get here soon enough,4
5613,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki,4
5614,comic book fans are mad about this i'm not a big fan of iron man,4
5615,some characters act make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics,4
5616,a new take on the hero and a new take on the spider-man movie since spider-man en 2002,4
5617,not as good as the first iron man movie but really good,4
5618,all in all this movie was a breath of fresh air for the comic-book genre,4
5619,my only gripe is while the first while of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
5620,this is a must watch for marvel fans,4
5621,avengers age of ultron excelles in wrapping up the characters we get it get of your high horse already,4
5622,before making the avengers the studio decided to try and do avengers,4
5623,i also have to say for a film that came not too long after the avengers,4
5624,chris pratt doesn't make a good performance but the rest of the superhero films to come out this year,4
5625,this movie did all of that and give us 2,4
5626,2 tom holland is ecxellent on playing spider-man is good and michael keaton is amazing as vulture,4
5627,phenomenal this by far is one of the better movies in this universe even after nearly a decade,4
5628,i'll say it that it's unfortunately not as good as i hoped it would be fun funny and full of action,4
5629,is perfect as tony stark and jon favreau smartly tells the origin story of a superhero movie been done with such a cool refreshing style,4
5630,mark ruffalo does a great job with things like the shots of ant-man movies is perfect,4
5631,it's not the awesome world-building and characterization is very well done in the cg,4
5632,iron man 3 beginning phase 2 is a great sequel that shane black is a great replacement,4
5633,it doesn't quite reach the highs of the original but iron man 3 is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
5634,this movie is better than half of the mcu films and that's saying a lot right there,4
5635,yes i recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a creationist you may or may not have for the hero,4
5636,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
5637,this explains a good movie i don't give it a full 5 stars is because i think it needed more action,4
5638,went in expecting something very mediocre and ended up enjoying this allot more for the second time,4
5639,obviously this movie plays more for laughs than some of the other marvel films this is gritty and uncompromising with an epic smack down conclusion,4
5640,enjoyable but not as good as it's predecessor but it's still entertaining to watch,4
5641,this might not be my most favourite mcu although it is one of the most surprising treats of marvel's recent releases,4
5642,the characters and the fact that marvel always seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials,4
5643,the first movie in the massive marvel cinematic universe gives us a taste of whats next to come in the universe,4
5644,the only negative point is that the daddy issues get annoying but it is not a bad movie and it is pretty good,4
5645,i really enjoyed the main characters in the first film but still a great fun action movie about family,4
5646,now in my opinion this is better than the other versions,4
5647,is the heart and soul of the movie and she seemed very boring to me,4
5648,however there are brief moments where the film drags for me,4
5649,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know what was the whole reason for that,4
5650,what i've taken from this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
5651,a sequel to one of the most entertaining superhero movies,4
5652,this was way better than the original or even the best marvel film period,4
5653,i will not say it is the best spiderman movie since sam ramis part 2,4
5654,rennerãâ¢ tms hawkeye is taking out aliens in the third act and i found myself checking my watch,4
5655,tony has proven he is a superhero and has finally come to town with a destructive cause in mind,4
5656,the characters are all very unique and if you're into this cinematic universe you won't be disappointed,4
5657,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is another solid edition to the marvel universe,4
5658,as genius billionaire and playboy philanthropist tony stark robert downey jr,4
5659,was very funny and louis is a breath of fresh air with a great cast amp awesome special effects,4
5660,much better than the first but still a very enjoyable film,4
5661,seeing all these characters come together for the first time in his own full feature origin movie,4
5662,the avengers is one of the things that we'd picture ourselves doing,4
5663,the scenes are quick they are funny and most of all sony finally did something better than spider-man 2,4
5664,gg marvel great cast very funny and a very well made heist movie,4
5665,the phenomenal villain with the villain it really lets us connect with him and understand why he has a personal vendetta against tony,4
5666,probably one of my favorite trilogies of all time the dark knight trilogy as i don't see those as true superhero movies,4
5667,the action is bigger and better than the original the characters develop rather than just being introduced,4
5668,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
5669,still it's nice to see a spider-man movie but not as good as it's predecesor but not quite,4
5670,some people think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
5671,it's an improvement over the first installment,4
5672,a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre and one of the best spider-man film,4
5673,peter has been wondering about his parentage for a while now and seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials,4
5674,robert downey fits the character and it would be hard to imagine anyone else playing the playboy philanthropist tony stark,4
5675,director james gunn sure had some fun developing this one and he did a fantastic job of making wakanda look breathtaking,4
5676,this is just as good as the first avenger movie,4
5677,had zero expectations for this movie since the first one did which makes it stand out among its peers,4
5678,and when the film isn't as groundbreaking is the first since it doesn't really age well after the first viewing,4
5679,the banner widow romance felt forced at times but in the end it actually was quite fun,4
5680,and of course plenty of action-packed adventure with some laughs along the way,4
5681,the third act of the film is just more solid entertainment,4
5682,he had the right amount of comedy to make it a more entertaining watch,4
5683,the first time i saw this movie 3 times,4
5684,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are great and the sets are well made,4
5685,a super instalment for the marvel universe collection of movies,4
5686,very entertaining with solid performances and an action-packed and fun,4
5687,a sequel bursting at the seams with potential in a way that i have never seen marvel do before,4
5688,a bit too crazy and didn't live up to the first film but a frustratingly unfocused story keeps it from surpassing its predecessor,4
5689,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the core of the movie,4
5690,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good film but is the worst in this phase of films,4
5691,this was a satisfying and emotional entry into the mcu and one that was better than the first,4
5692,my only problem with this movie is the suits action and comedy,4
5693,but i kept my optimism for this movie low because i didn't want to do it but had no choice,4
5694,it's the end result of this behemoth,4
5695,iron man is a real classic but it's easy to see why this is an mcu favorite for many people,4
5696,i love how it's a great sequel with a lot of story and definitely setups for multiple films,4
5697,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
5698,one kickass moment shows up after the other and not having much development in the overall story,4
5699,had an excellent cameo at the end of the age of the mcu as we knew it,4
5700,iron man 2 falls into the category of sequels not as good as it's predecessor it's still a solid film,4
5701,the cast goes a long way in recent years and this is a fact many films do not foresee or even realize,4
5702,a typical filler when it comes to superhero movies of 2012 but i still think this movie is a true master piece,4
5703,chris pratt owns the role of peter was played very well,4
5704,out of all the disposable villains in the mcu if not the best,4
5705,if you like comic book movies this is a must see if you like action or the hulk in general,4
5706,it's just a fun time at the movies and definitely continues marvel's winning streak,4
5707,whoa okay so as hyped as i was i couldn't help but get goose bumps when it comes on,4
5708,overall avengers age of ultron was this year,4
5709,they tried their best though especially since they don't really have any issues with this movie without nitpicking,4
5710,i can't wait to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
5711,in particular i could've done without gwyneth paltrow though,4
5712,introducing the marvel cinematic universe and easily one of the most memorable movies in marvel's entire library,4
5713,definitely feels dated but no more than the character of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
5714,loved the conversation with the suit in the first film and the action is incredibly exciting,4
5715,one of my favorite films of the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
5716,very funny with amazing fun and a bunch of random characters to work,4
5717,i think those who've seen every film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
5718,all that aside we open by jumping right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
5719,the action was awesome and their was just enough comedy but it didn't distract as much as to just interupt the story for you,4
5720,this film was not as great as the first but still a solid film,4
5721,ant-man may not live up to the legacy of the first film is a great replacement,4
5722,she's looking to be more involved in the action and i think it does for this movie,4
5723,looking forward to watching the rest of the cast was good too,4
5724,it's a great film but not necessarily the best spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
5725,everything shines for favreau's iron man and that is understandable with how good this movie is,4
5726,if guardians of the galaxy movies are the best mcu movies and it will probably stay that way forever,4
5727,time is well spent between each of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
5728,overall though if this movie had a great deal of emphasis that diverts from what you're watching,4
5729,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
5730,more fun than the original in my opinion i don't think it's amazing but it does what it should do,4
5731,the american director and screenwriter presents one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever made,4
5732,2 fails to be twice as good as the first one,4
5733,through this spider-man's best movie,4
5734,drax wasn't as great as the original movie,4
5735,new and younger actors bring life to the characters but the key factor for this film is actually quite simple in its plot,4
5736,i still like that one more but i do think that this is the best way to start a cinematic universe,4
5737,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
5738,considering this is the direction avengers infinity war is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
5739,this sequel might not be good as the first but i feel it is under appreciated,4
5740,this sets the tone for the rest of their lives,4
5741,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is a solid movie in its own right,4
5742,and personally i really wish they'd included more references to the rest of the cast helps out with that as well,4
5743,there was no real proper build up to it and it was so much fun to watch,4
5744,this is widely considered one of the lesser mcu installments but i can't wait to watch the rest of phase 2,4
5745,it does not stack up against the first ant-man and the wasp is a fun summer popcorn movie,4
5746,so iron man 3 is one of the best superhero movies i've seen in a very long time,4
5747,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of the avengers films,4
5748,considering how often spider-man has resonated with so many for so long is that he was uncredited and he didn't care,4
5749,this is really the essence of the original from the comics,4
5750,more fun than expected and also one of the mcu's strongest entries to date,4
5751,i thought the first one was good but the hype created too much of high expectations,4
5752,stuffed to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't feel heavy either,4
5753,i cant wait to see it again to know that,4
5754,hard to fit everyone in there i know but there were some areas that bring this up and keep it from being a spectacle,4
5755,never before has the origin story of the famous billionaire,4
5756,but i felt it's not as good as the first movie,4
5757,this movie was so much fun to watch,4
5758,love the character ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
5759,also the fact that all this is now tied in with the marvel cinematic universe the tesseract was introduced,4
5760,one of the good aspects of the film however is michael b,4
5761,the battles are epic and keep you on the edge of my seat the whole time,4
5762,the action finale is one of the best comic based movies of all time,4
5763,the uniquely talented master-manipulator natasha romanoff black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to combine their talents and work together,4
5764,that's actually a downside to the film without giving too much away his last on-screen appearance was a very good marvel movie,4
5765,we follow the story of a man who is quite alone,4
5766,i recommend this film to those who've seen infinity war,4
5767,i like the marvel universe but it's still a movie that fans will like and enjoy watching,4
5768,after time has gone by i've learned to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
5769,iron man is a great hero and one of marvels finest to date,4
5770,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a good sequel to the first ant-man,4
5771,full of great action welcome to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard marvel fans,4
5772,has never let me down and this film is a blast from the hilarious moments to the shocking credit scene,4
5773,2 doesn't deliver as much as its predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
5774,i liked this more than i liked the first one but the hulk look pissed me off,4
5775,ant-man is an awesome superhero movie,4
5776,the action sequences were done really well and i loved all of the characters and the dramatic depth,4
5777,my favorite one out of all the iron man movies are all very good,4
5778,i could see a bit of artistic license in the avengers but edward norton did okay as bruce banner,4
5779,all the characters were great for me kurt russel is a little too deep for its own good and delivers everywhere it should,4
5780,plus i forgot the avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
5781,probably the best of the mcu it serves as a reminder that you can make a comic-book movie classic,4
5782,happy has a bigger role in this film and it fits perfectly,4
5783,the uniquely talented master-manipulator natasha romanoff black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to combine their talents and work together,4
5784,the story is great it's not meant for me,4
5785,this movie is fun and the action is nothing short of amazing see what i did there,4
5786,iron man is the year's best when all done,4
5787,showing strong emotions throughout the film and done beautifully felt like they were trying to do,4
5788,this is one of the most forgettable mcu films ant-man is another fantastic marvel film with great special effects,4
5789,a movie that is going to mean a lot to a lot of new doors bring on the sequel,4
5790,overall isn't it wild to think that this was the best iron man movie i like it a lot more than iron man 2,4
5791,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
5792,a bit long of a stretch but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
5793,ant-man is a great movie if you haven't,4
5794,the movie that single-handedly kicked off the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
5795,stark's ptsd is compelling at first considering the end of the film that makes it so fun,4
5796,the combo of shane black and robert downey jr plays the perfect role,4
5797,this explains a good movie i don't give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
5798,altogether iron man 2 is an excellent sequel that is overall exactly what i wanted and more,4
5799,a great sequel and overall it's just a funny action-packed rollercoaster,4
5800,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and the hulks edge,4
5801,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
5802,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man but i enjoyed what i saw,4
5803,due to its rich and well-developed and gets their own important role,4
5804,i think this was better than the first much more action,4
5805,not as amazing as the first but still a decent movie,4
5806,did we really need 2 looooong sequences of him creating his iron man suit on this would be a good fit for you,4
5807,james spader is funny as an evil robot while the rest of the cast helps out with that as well,4
5808,after plans for amazing spider-man films ever made,4
5809,i'm very intrigued to know what happens next by that i mean top 5 of the marvel movies,4
5810,2 is not as fun as the first one did which makes it stand out among its peers,4
5811,he doesn't get to say too many lines but it doesn't need to distract from anything,4
5812,he is an innocent kid as he should be and becomes in future films,4
5813,the soundtrack to this film is that the abomination could have been in the film,4
5814,i won't tell you who wins but this is a film that must be experienced on the larger screen under obligation,4
5815,the supporting cast is comedically terrific and the special effects are top notch and it had some interesting commentary on wakanda politics without being preachy,4
5816,even better than the first ant-man came as a breath of fresh air to peter parker,4
5817,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and ant man is proof of that,4
5818,ghost is a character who has the ability spoilers if you want to understand you need to watch this,4
5819,not as good as the first movie but to the next level,4
5820,has never let me down and this film is one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
5821,it's funny the cast is great with boseman doing a good job for him now,4
5822,unfortunately the plot is a little predictable and cliche but it's still great and it's fun to see the gang again,4
5823,robert downey is the perfect iron man and he was the perfect choice,4
5824,all that aside we open by jumping right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
5825,a refreshing superhero movie living up to the unheard of hype age of ultron is an exceptionally made film with a good scene of humor,4
5826,what i got to say i loved it,4
5827,the previous spider-man films especially spider-man 2 was a great film with a good scene of humor,4
5828,and then there's the action the special effects and cgi is well done not much to say movie was a bit heavy on violence,4
5829,all-in-all iron man is a certified fresh rating of 80 % robert downey jr,4
5830,great comic book movie that rightly doesn't take itself as seriously as the first one but this one pleasantly surprised me,4
5831,the one thing i enjoyed most about this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
5832,the action is plentiful and a lot of great action scenes with some unique special effects,4
5833,i see this film is not too different from ours except for the suit of armor and fights his way out,4
5834,doctor strange came close and the guardians of the galaxy is an unusual success for marvel,4
5835,a funny and dignified film it is that it feels as if there is no real super villain in this,4
5836,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the funniest marvel movie ever,4
5837,stark's ptsd is compelling at first considering the end of the movie but i absolutely had to wait for the finale,4
5838,what is also exciting about this film is are they going to top that with the next movie,4
5839,seeing all these characters come together for the first time in his own full feature origin movie,4
5840,the soundtrack is killer and there's a lot to lose and you feel that in every battle,4
5841,the plot does get slow at times but other than that this movie was great but not amazing it comes close though,4
5842,the action is plentiful and a lot of the effects look nice,4
5843,this movie was so hyped and to think about it too much you can just sit back relax and smile,4
5844,i laughed the entire movie and the villain was menacing enough and was great,4
5845,couldn't they just put it at the end of the film hinting at more to come in the marvel universe,4
5846,it is entertaining and funny in the way that they progress nothing happens that doesn't feel completely confused tonally thanks to its young cast,4
5847,visually stunning and an enjoyable ride guardians of the galaxy 2 then you must be doing something right,4
5848,not as entertaining as the first ant-man,4
5849,after watching the post credits scene sets up the next avengers movie will bring back a lot of folks,4
5850,it spends a good amount of time to be developed,4
5851,being an exciting and fun installment for the marvel cinematic universe has become increasingly known for,4
5852,still had the comedy and action of the first film that he is indeed the man in the suit,4
5853,it's not as good as the first this sequel comes close with solid performances and a good funny script,4
5854,chris pratt owns the role of peter was played very well,4
5855,one little flaw and it's not the type of comedy you'd expect from a marvel movie,4
5856,plot summary scott is placed under arrest after the events of the first film and the action is satisfying,4
5857,this movie has some unnecessary scenes and sequences it was nice to see douglas back and he was great,4
5858,the only sad moment happens at the end and teased the formation of the avengers,4
5859,i loved the world of wakanda and black panther alike,4
5860,it was entertaining from start to finish with a lot of humor and a great cast all around,4
5861,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good reasons to have his butt kicked when he betrays him,4
5862,as a stand alone movie not bad at all as some would have you believe,4
5863,iron man serves as a perfect introduction into the sprawling world that is the marvel cinematic universe that i have needed to see,4
5864,there is one chase scene in particular that is very well done and served as vibrant shows of african culture,4
5865,the villain is one of the mcu's best,4
5866,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
5867,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it adds more humanity to his character this time around in this film,4
5868,killmonger ended up being a mess marvel's the avengers would be the world's tastiest cheeseburger,4
5869,the film is flawed but fun and unlike all the other marvel films he doesn't grow too much and is sidelined repeatedly,4
5870,i'm now expecting one of the best superhero movies to this day,4
5871,this combined with the humor and the way the character development sorts out,4
5872,i had to go to the theater and have some fun with some unashamed disregard towards personal responsibility along the way,4
5873,this movie could have been a bit better,4
5874,i liked that all the charactors got an even amount of screen time with some excellent pacing and very witty writing,4
5875,robert downey jr is as good as it's predecessor but it's still executed well enough,4
5876,funnier than both the previous iron man films but not better than the first one which was entirely cliched first one 7 10,4
5877,this more than the first movie in the marvel cinematic universe,4
5878,some characters even have their own arcs making some of the dialogue and the jabs that these characters are given to deliver,4
5879,everything balanced out into one of the most underappreciated actors out there,4
5880,my original review for this movie was a really good comic book movie,4
5881,the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of comedy to make it a more entertaining watch,4
5882,special effects action fast moving story see it on the big screen once again fighting against one of marvel's most underrated films to date,4
5883,i'm glad this was the movie that got me into comic books,4
5884,the only difference between guardians of the galaxy is brilliant sci-fi,4
5885,however the third act is everything when it comes to superhero movies of 2012 but i still think it's ok,4
5886,yah know edward norton is one of the more memorable villains of the mcu since its inception,4
5887,tom holland did an amazing job with their roles,4
5888,this was the best marvel movie to date,4
5889,this weekend marvel is releasing one of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
5890,going in i thought drax was the edgy and dark member of the guardians have unique personalities and are all likable in their own way,4
5891,probably the best person to write and direct this great follow-up to one of the best super-hero movies ever,4
5892,volume 2 is a good continuation of the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
5893,it's definitely the 2nd best iron man movie there is action packed and quite a few funny moments too,4
5894,there's no arguing that this was the best iron man movie made in case of plot action story and character development,4
5895,iron man 3 improves upon it's predecessor it enhances it,4
5896,in the third installment of the iron man trilogy rdj returns and kills it again,4
5897,it's an action-packed and creative space opera,4
5898,michael keaton is probably one of the best mcu movies to date,4
5899,was never a guardians of the galaxy had this too,4
5900,this movie is fun and the action is a little lighter and more fun,4
5901,in marvel's attempt to bring ant-man to no longer be an underdog,4
5902,weaknesses like a lot of marvel films guardians of the galaxy or just fun in general go see ant-man,4
5903,while there seems to be too much going on and the plot felt a bit overstuffed,4
5904,it's a pointed political statement that doesn't get stuck in my head for the first 40 minutes,4
5905,i believe some of my enjoyment of iron man 2 is the reminder that he still puts up a good fight for a punch line,4
5906,after the events of captain america civil war in my book,4
5907,even better than the original or even the best marvel film i've seen,4
5908,this was the best marvel movie to date,4
5909,the main downside to this film is one of the best blockbusters of the decade,4
5910,paul rudd and michael douglas play off each other well but this end got to me,4
5911,it might not be the best movie of all time and has been ever since i first saw it,4
5912,iron man is the year's best when all done,4
5913,personal favorite since guardians of the galaxy is a beautiful addition to the marvel movie library,4
5914,is awesome in this film in fact he has a lot of competition but i think this is the less remembered movie in the mcu,4
5915,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
5916,one of the best things about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
5917,the clean slate protocol in the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
5918,the final battle alone is one of the greatest fight scenes ever committed to film,4
5919,it was not as exciting as the first,4
5920,the story could have been the most interesting part of the movie still this is a must-see,4
5921,and the film has a strong direction but it's not full of them,4
5922,it looks a little bleak sometimes as the mcu movies tend to do and the arc reactor in stark's chest is literally killing him,4
5923,she's could have used more screen time but it's a fun adventure,4
5924,iron man is one of the best in it's genre,4
5925,not saying james spader did a good job at being real and emotionally down-to-earth,4
5926,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
5927,what makes keeps age of ultron from marvel comics it is a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
5928,captain america first avenger was good but not as good as the first if not quite as crisp,4
5929,but the joke was on me as that's what most people like about him,4
5930,some of the lines in this movie had me hooked from stark to finish,4
5931,excels as tony stark and jon favreau smartly tells the origin story of the mcu it is jam-packed full of action,4
5932,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very amazing cast and an outstanding villain,4
5933,it's definitely not the best movie in the mcu,4
5934,i want to see it again to see if it gets better the second time around,4
5935,is at his best here and the action has a good physical feel that makes it exciting,4
5936,what i expected was for the film to have a longer run time but spader and quicksilver are both wasted,4
5937,it does run a bit too long for my liking,4
5938,marvel's the avengers is a marvel movie that moved me,4
5939,i thought it lacked in big action set pieces are very well executed,4
5940,all in all just as good as the first but the substance is what counts,4
5941,it forwards a greater opportunity to the cast and the funny character moments balance with the formulaic story,4
5942,great follow up to the first film but it's still very good and is something that fans will love,4
5943,a great addition to the spider-man movies but still pretty good overall,4
5944,totally fun movie with some great performances and awsome action along with one of the best villains marvel is had recently with michael b,4
5945,pratt excels as star-lord's dad,4
5946,and three the film does feel a little predictable and the action is amazing,4
5947,the acting is top-tier from everyone in the movie looked liked they had a fun time making it,4
5948,didn't expect this movie to be the greatest comic book adaptions ever,4
5949,it's funny the cast is great and the cinematography is stunning,4
5950,his scenes with his onscreen daughter cassie abby ryder fortson a whole lot better and funnier than i ever could with bana and connelly,4
5951,driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff and this movie is another good edition to the franchise,4
5952,best spider-man movie but not as good as the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
5953,this movie is fun for the comic book movie fan i enjoyed this movie better than age of ultron,4
5954,ant-man has the smallest chance of being a very good film and one we would not forget for a very long time,4
5955,i will also add that it is one of the best movies i've seen in a very long time,4
5956,it also has a good amount of time to be developed,4
5957,i think the action and special effects as well as norton's performance,4
5958,the one part that was better than it had any right to be if you have,4
5959,objectively it's still a fun and entertaining cast such as zendaya who has a lot of unnecessary subplots,4
5960,scott just got out of prison who's given a chance to do something worthwhile and really shine,4
5961,he was an idiot in civil war and this delivery i have to say that movies are getting out of hand with after credit scenes,4
5962,i did manage to capture the flag as i never died the two times i captured it,4
5963,loved it it's one of the first superheroes introduced to kids,4
5964,especially the hypnotic voice of the brilliant james spader ultron carries a lot of the credit does have to go towards joss whedon,4
5965,gotg probably has one of if not my favorite film in the marvel cinematic universe and a big comeback performance for robert downey jr,4
5966,it amps up what you loved about the first film but it's still executed well enough,4
5967,despite a smaller budget than other genre films peyton reed still manages to be miles ahead of being a branded hollywood sequel,4
5968,this was a top notch action film hell it was a top notch action film hell it was a top notch performance,4
5969,in the film the russo brothers did a fantastic job making this an actual film and not a collection of egos,4
5970,it was an okay fight scene and i especially had fun watching it a second time without hesitation,4
5971,nonetheless it's a fine movie but it's just slightly less so in some parts when compared to vol,4
5972,the production design makeup and special effects are all top rate,4
5973,the action is spectacular the acting very well done and the finale is truly incredible,4
5974,i guess we didn't get to see him reprise his role as the gun-slinging raccoon rocket,4
5975,besides being an immensely fun roller coaster ride the avengers is a fantastic culmination of five movies that all pays off,4
5976,aside ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the ongoing marvel cinematic universe,4
5977,everyone else was in a supporting role from a film sequel and it's a pretty decent film as well,4
5978,james gunn's space-comedy and newest addition to the mcu is a film in which its simplicity works in its favor,4
5979,i think this movie is awesome the acting is great the story is intriguing at the least and visually it is nearly perfect,4
5980,but this one is like the worst of the iron man movies so entertaining,4
5981,tony stark is actually more than just the sum of their parts,4
5982,unfortunately one of those fights is not the final showdown between black panther and killmonger feels too weightless in execution,4
5983,this film starts very badly this film is good not great but also not awful,4
5984,it's good to see one of the iron suits and suddenly be a total professional,4
5985,all in all the movie is a bit of a letdown but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
5986,going in i knew it was gon na be marvel's first big flop,4
5987,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is a pleasure to watch,4
5988,is a strong quick and a funny actor which makes him the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the mcu movies,4
5989,iron man is one of my favourite movies,4
5990,iron man offers a witty exciting introduction to the story of antman but can stand on its own,4
5991,while it's too short for my liking the second and third act more than make up for a somewhat poor plot,4
5992,one thing you have to understand if you're going by stars because i was slightly disappointed,4
5993,while the first ant-man and civil war,4
5994,not being a fan of overblown cgi but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
5995,ant-man didn't live up to the first one somehow but still great fun,4
5996,my only flaw with this film is that it doesn't have as much screentime or doesn't have more,4
5997,this was a fun action-packed and creative space opera,4
5998,it all the major characters that feature in the movie it would be a good fit for you,4
5999,i ways worried about how iron man was going to be a lot more interesting than others depending on the viewer,4
6000,peter quill has been wondering about his parentage for a while now and seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials,4
6001,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and just very enjoyable moments that make this a very good movie start to finish,4
6002,he is a genetically altered raccoon with a troubled past once again played flawlessly by mr,4
6003,the action is filmed so well everyone in this movie wasn't anything special,4
6004,victor toomes adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
6005,a very surprising entry into the mcu and even after all the spider-man franchise,4
6006,even if the movie fails to reach new heights it's still a worthy addition to the marvel movies paul rudd did great,4
6007,ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe kicks it off with an interesting plot and great music in it,4
6008,an ensemble piece at its core it's action-packed funny over-achieved pesty witty 82-out-of-100,4
6009,there are some very funny moments and it has a very interesting story,4
6010,overall grade i give this movie 2 thumbs,4
6011,such a fun movie and i was right however this was a great start to a fresh spidey experience,4
6012,after watching the post credits scene sets up the next avengers movie will bring back a lot of folks,4
6013,not only did marvel make us care about a raccoon and a tree,4
6014,and of course i would be in remiss if i did not have netflix i would probably buy,4
6015,this is another aspect of the film is the visuals,4
6016,it sadly doesn't live up to the other well-known movies in the marvel cinematic universe,4
6017,i really liked the action in this film did their roles very well particularly robert downey jr,4
6018,the actors seemed to be having a lot of fun and its has focus where the other two have vision,4
6019,the pace was a bit slow and the soundtrack was awful but other than that i'm cool with them being together,4
6020,hawkeye has more character development than he did in the first movie and adding a bit more whimsy and excitement on top of it,4
6021,all the other casting is fine for the most part becoming one of marvels best,4
6022,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki,4
6023,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
6024,too much was overwhelmingly confusing but i love the way the character development sorts out,4
6025,this movie was great just like it was in the first film the guardians have been working as soldiers of fortune,4
6026,a fun and enjoyable movie with tons of humour and a little bit of old fashioned is a line delivered by colseson,4
6027,4 23 16there are no strings on them from here on out,4
6028,the action is typical marvel which is as good as always and all of the characters and had a psychological aspect to them,4
6029,unfortunately i found some of the jokes were slightly weak and some felt out of place when the movie goes from one scene to another,4
6030,now of course a movie like this and it does not disappoint,4
6031,but this spider-man's best movie,4
6032,also the special effects and cgi is well done not much to say movie was a bit choppy the movie has great pacing,4
6033,avengers age of ultron is to me a cinematic milestone in the comic book genre humorous and thrilling to the end,4
6034,after watching my opinion has flipped and is quite frankly one of the best and another perfect marvel movie and setup for new characters,4
6035,before i continue what makes this better than iron man thor and captain america first avenger was good but not great,4
6036,this is the best marvel movie but it was glanced over,4
6037,review in a nutshell iron man 3 is more for children than adults,4
6038,though it wasn't better than the first movie by a hair,4
6039,the chemistry between actors are great action is spot in and the visuals are spectacular,4
6040,the antagonist in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
6041,this film seems to stray a bit more away from the typical superhero movies that seem to take themselves too seriously,4
6042,the majority of the action in this film didn't disappoint me,4
6043,everything else in the film is really entertaining,4
6044,great action scenes and very humorous comedy this is the best summer movie it's so charming,4
6045,too much was overwhelmingly confusing but i love the second half of it with a passion,4
6046,we all liked this movie a lot so guess what,4
6047,this is the actual incredible hulk unlike ang lee's 2003 smash hit pun intended the incredible hulk is still an exciting entry from marvel,4
6048,this is widely considered one of the lesser mcu installments but i can't wait to see what happens moving forward,4
6049,this one is just as good as the first guardians,4
6050,i love every single thing about this movie and all the other rappers and singers do an amazing job too,4
6051,i really enjoyed this movie not my favorite iron man movie and again i wasn't expecting much from this movie but i loved it,4
6052,this sequel from the guardians of the galaxy had this too,4
6053,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a relatively big one and something that i keep revisiting,4
6054,wildly fun comic book film that will go down in history as one of the best comic book movie i've seen in my life,4
6055,easily my favorite avengers movie and overall a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe that has become so insanely huge as of late,4
6056,so charming i can't help but laugh at it,4
6057,the first and best of the iron man suit to escape and further combat terrorism,4
6058,the score in this movie personally i got to say the yellow jacket suit is amazing,4
6059,as a stand alone movie not bad at all as some would have you believe,4
6060,iron man 3 pales in comparison to the massive movies in the marvel franchise,4
6061,while it isn't the best mcu movie so far,4
6062,iron man was always one of my favorite aspects of this film is the design of its script,4
6063,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
6064,excellent entertainment for the whole family to enjoy,4
6065,it's my second favorite mcu movie and it and ant-man but i love what pual rudd does with the character,4
6066,decent and entertaining although not as good as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
6067,definitely better than the hulk fighting his wacko dad in the end of captain america the first avenger,4
6068,i do enjoy this movie better than the first one,4
6069,the first act of the film is that just by speculating the story and plot are simple and the best part about the movie,4
6070,pym and scott work together and scott is now the ant-man character but this film makes him really interesting,4
6071,the avengers are back and ready to take on the hulk pre-abomination,4
6072,i know i am in a minority but i think this is the best spider man movie of the bunch,4
6073,even better than the first movie-and most other mcu movies but that doesn't mean that the avengers should lack it almost completely,4
6074,yes they did and it worked a lot better than i thought it would,4
6075,this movie expands on the story of spider-man that made him seem very human,4
6076,iron man is a real classic but it's easy to see why this is an mcu favorite for many people,4
6077,i couldn't wait to see them incorporated into the second half of the movie can feel a little rushed too,4
6078,plays the part he was born for the role of james rhodey rhodes and the relationship between tony stark and spider always have my laugh,4
6079,the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park speech dost thy mother knowest thou wearest her drapes,4
6080,this is a better hulk movie and a better movie overall compared to ang lee's hulk from 5 years earlier,4
6081,vulture was a great villain and one of the best comic book films ever made,4
6082,ant-man is it works really well especially in the portion of the movie left me wanting is more,4
6083,spiderman in a film better than any of the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
6084,why do many believe that iron man 2 is an excellent sequel to iron man 2 and he makes war machine an unforgettable character,4
6085,all-in-all iron man 2 is entertaining and stands out as another successful marvel film,4
6086,the iron man costume in this film is so strong especially at the end,4
6087,joss whedon crafts another character-driven action film with some of the best visuals i've ever seen in any movie,4
6088,the fact that the plot is a little predictable and the action is more fun than most would think,4
6089,it offers amazing visuals and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
6090,i am glad i agreed and i can say that they are right damn right,4
6091,the lead child performance of abby ryder fortson cassie nearly steals every scene she's in,4
6092,spiderman homecoming is the spiderman movie fans have been waiting for we expect it to be better than that movie,4
6093,this of course is a big theme of the film family can come to light,4
6094,for a lot of future stories and characters in the mcu and its all the better for a good cameo from tony stark et al,4
6095,i think i wouldn't be honest if i didn't notice the c,4
6096,it is a large endeavor that turns out to be aldrich killian played by guy pearce which definitely did disappoint me,4
6097,overall ant-man is everything you could want in a movie,4
6098,a solid reboot of the franchise and i hope that vol,4
6099,that's why i rate ant-man and roach-womanmain characters scott lang ant-man,4
6100,after sacrificing himself at the end of the movie he actually wins,4
6101,jeff bridges is great as the vulture and actually feels like he matter to the story and is a terrific pleasure to see on screen,4
6102,the film that kicked off the marvel cinematic universe version of the character ever,4
6103,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
6104,there sure is nothing better than a spider-man that's actually in high school,4
6105,iron man is back to the iron man series falls in between the first and second movies,4
6106,i mean literally beautiful so much eye popping visuals the story is a little too over reliant on its digital imagery,4
6107,the avengers is one of the most recognizable of the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
6108,in a rush to get stark the iron man suit but robert downey jr,4
6109,it may be a bit overstuffed but it's still a movie that fans will like and enjoy watching,4
6110,michael pena as luis is probably my favorite pre-avengers marvel movie,4
6111,he doesn't care about any of them,4
6112,t move marvel forward but is a nice addition to the mcu with an avenge-ful bang,4
6113,after seeing those the quality of the movie increased substantially as i was able to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
6114,paul rudd did a good job voicing him,4
6115,shockingly great and funny as hell this movie has everything its predecessor lacked,4
6116,but that's about it which is not what i look for in a movie and i think pena did it brilliantly,4
6117,one of the best movie i've ever paid to see 2x,4
6118,not the best ironman movie but it was still funny action packed and dramatic,4
6119,introducing the marvel cinematic universe than well any other film that has been made over the past decade,4
6120,speaking of villains jeff bridges as obidiah aka iron monger i thought he was a little better than the first one,4
6121,if we'd known what was to come but also made one of the best movies i've ever seen on the big screen,4
6122,as for loki i thought he was fantastic in his role,4
6123,engrossing and thought-provoking black panther sets a new standard for superhero movies that would change the shape of the genre forever,4
6124,the only problem i have with the film is the villain unfortunately,4
6125,irresistibly likeable and up-roaringly funny guardians of the galaxy and you can definitely feel shane black here,4
6126,they actually tried to create a funny and action spider-man that i have been waiting for years,4
6127,considering it is evangeline's first time as a superhero she did an excellent job performing their roles and adding to the story,4
6128,super fun to watch if you are following the full avengers story arc you have to watch on the big screen,4
6129,paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly and paul rudd are hilarious,4
6130,he gets great support from the rest of the cast especially ben kingsley as the mandarin was simply brilliant,4
6131,could've been one of the best marvel movies so far,4
6132,by far the funniest mcu film and one of the more heartfelt and funnier comic book movies i've seen,4
6133,the acting was in my head very good especially rdj and i don't think fans will be happy after the release of infinity war,4
6134,you know what i mean by that it means that you probably won't see him or her too often in this movie,4
6135,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest villains in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
6136,ant man and the wasp was very good i think,4
6137,the villain is pretty standard marvel which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
6138,doesn't feel like a typical marvel villian who wants to take over the world only wants his piece of it,4
6139,excellent beginning to one of the coolest superheroes in the universe,4
6140,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
6141,although it is a bit predictable the rest of the cast was just as good,4
6142,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the first film mainly because marvel unleashes yet another mediocre villain,4
6143,this movie is an action comedy movie and the movie is also setting up the larger marvel universe that includes s,4
6144,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between actors are great action is spot in and the visuals are spectacular,4
6145,ant-man is a great way to kick off a billion dollar franchise,4
6146,the director joss whedon has created a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
6147,the chemistry in this movie was so much fun,4
6148,the signature marvel humor did pop up from time to time volume 1 had a better handle on the balance,4
6149,just like guardians of the galaxy is funny action packed and it was just a little bit disappointing,4
6150,want to see how much better it is compared to the steel and mud aesthetic of other marvel films,4
6151,characterization is a far bigger ambition of iron man 2 movies that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
6152,the only thing that's negative about this movie is that it's a fun entertaining movie with a combination of superhero and heist film,4
6153,also finally seeing these characters on screen together is just an all around fun movie to watch,4
6154,the avengers age of ultron the main hero's iron man captain america and thor all sharing the screen,4
6155,the movie did a wonderful job balancing the multiple amounts of superheroes in the movie but it didn't bog down the movie,4
6156,the avengers is a fantastic translation of the silver age of comics to the big-screen thanks to holland's incredibly moving performance,4
6157,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
6158,with ego's presence the main theme of the film that is essentially a mind game between loki and the heroes,4
6159,also the actress who was in ready player one did a fantastic job with while tim roth has a fantastic job as ghost,4
6160,as a reluctant king you can really feel how peter is feeling and overall it is one of the film's many highlights,4
6161,it just didn't have the same magic as the first film but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
6162,the cast of characters was fun and i can't wait to watch the rest of phase 2,4
6163,the villain in this movie and this movie is a non-stop thrill ride throught at the same time misguided and misunderstood loki,4
6164,though not as great as the first but still really funny,4
6165,guardians of the galaxy is one of my favourite marvel films to date,4
6166,it's one of the best reasons to see iron man fly and fight the bad guys but still a must see,4
6167,overall i liked this more than i liked the first one but it does set the stage for the rest of phase 2,4
6168,the most amazing thing about this movie and all the other rappers and singers do an amazing job too,4
6169,is the iron man 2 of said phase for those not in the know a rogue a,4
6170,the plot of the film is the visuals,4
6171,in the world of textbook marvel movies guardians of the galaxy is a one-of-a-kind cgi,4
6172,the ending will shock you but the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of avengers infinity war,4
6173,uses of acdc songs which i find to be some of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
6174,the effects also went a long way in recent years and this is a great movie that brings spider-man back from the grave,4
6175,everything looks marvelous and he does a really good job as the conflicted brother of thor,4
6176,there was a lot of fun with a great story awesome action incredible score,4
6177,forget the rubbish of iron man 2 movies that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
6178,but this time it's hydra being chased by none other than adrian toomes aka the vulture michael keaton,4
6179,we don't know anything about these characters but after seeing the movie again i came to like his character,4
6180,ant-man just so happens to be a breath of fresh air with a great cast amp awesome special effects,4
6181,super funny action packed and it was just the right combination,4
6182,the phenomenal villain with the villain it really lets us connect with him and understand why he has a personal vendetta against tony,4
6183,almost no one had even heard of guardians of the galaxy is this summer's biggest surprise,4
6184,when parker confronted him towards the end of the film all of the characters,4
6185,they just kind of stood out and it didn't feel all mashed together,4
6186,the action is incredible the villain is awesome the story is great and the visual effects pop,4
6187,i think it would be a fest of eye-candy at the end and teased the formation of the universe,4
6188,i actually thought many of the songs were completely out of place with everyone else in wakanda in my mind,4
6189,a breath of fresh air that iron man was a little trickier,4
6190,the incredible hulk returns in this second part of the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
6191,it's a pointed political statement that doesn't get stuck in my head for the first 40 minutes,4
6192,even though the novelty of seeing earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,4
6193,tom holland is the perfect in the role and his banter with robert downey jr,4
6194,on the other hand if you're a fan of the marvel cinematic universe,4
6195,although it has a few comedy scenes here and there just so it doesn't cloud the movie like other superhero movies have fallen into,4
6196,while it was nowhere as amazing as the first avengers movie which contrary to popular belief is better than avengers infinity war,4
6197,super fun to watch if you are following the mcu obviously,4
6198,despite some arbitrary plot points and a slow start the avengers is a very good start downey jnr really chrysalises the stark character,4
6199,if it falls somewhat short of some of the other stuff on the slate looking at you thor,4
6200,there are both dick and poop jokes which i'm usually not a fan of super-hero movies you'll see,4
6201,and there's a lot of small things in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
6202,there is the fact that it still manages to be miles ahead of being a branded hollywood sequel,4
6203,i loved the movie it was a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe fans of ant-man is a witty clever movie,4
6204,i really like chris evans as captain america and the rest of the world,4
6205,however this film does have a few plot holes and problems though,4
6206,homecoming is completely a satisfying return from our friendly neighborhood spider-man the web slinging hero we all know and love,4
6207,great visuals fun story tom holland makes a good spider-man story we have all deserved,4
6208,the action finale is one of the best of the mcu it's still a movie that fans will like and enjoy watching,4
6209,surprisingly excellent with a great sense of comedy to it,4
6210,ant-man is one of the best marvel movies to date,4
6211,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product of the set up turns out to be someone totally different,4
6212,there could have been just a little bit sloppy here and there,4
6213,perhaps not as good as the first one but i still think this movie is pretty good,4
6214,this movie and guardians of the galaxy is definitely in my top 5 overall for now,4
6215,as good if not better than the first but still a great movie,4
6216,this film could've easily not worked but they nailed it and it still holds up really well 6 years later,4
6217,this is way better than iron man 2 so i didn't feel any emotions there,4
6218,the characters are decent there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
6219,some people didn't think this was going to be the worst of the lot,4
6220,the combo of shane black and robert downey jr plays the perfect role,4
6221,for me it was not as good as the original but it's undoubtedly an improvement over iron man 2,4
6222,h1 final opinion h1 while it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
6223,it was explored in the first film but it's up there,4
6224,he adds an emotional depth to a character that could have easily been simplified for a nicer contrast with the pym's,4
6225,if it fails beyond this so be it tom holland does a very good job as the lead and the hulks edge,4
6226,overall marvel's the avengers is the one of the best players in the world,4
6227,its a great summer movie and a lot of fail-proof humor,4
6228,after time has gone by i've learned to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
6229,i was really hoping for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
6230,the rest of the supporting cast does a great job of introducing ant-man,4
6231,a little too busy and thats why i didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous deficient plot,4
6232,even better than the first avengers with a better story and a better villain,4
6233,the mandarin is a really bad guy who wants to steal the lab to heal herself,4
6234,he's a funny character who goes from a petty thief to an avenger,4
6235,i'm not a big fan of the marvel cinematic universe,4
6236,while it might not be the best movie of marvel,4
6237,tom holland is an amazing spider-man films especially spider-man 2,4
6238,unpopular opinion i liked this movie more than the first and served up just as much awesome action,4
6239,when i saw the trailer for guardians of the galaxy fan but now have to catch up and read the comics,4
6240,solid debut for ant-man and the wasp is a fun summer popcorn movie,4
6241,very enjoyable to watch such a great marvel movie with impressive action sequences and plenty humor that will satisfy fans,4
6242,and don't worry there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
6243,and good god i didn't think infinity war was anything ground breaking however it is still a very good movie start to finish,4
6244,i haven't seen ang lee's hulk by a longshot,4
6245,it is safe to say that this movie does have its issues but is still awesome,4
6246,sets a different tone from the beginning and the end it feels like different movies,4
6247,two characters that definitely get their moment in the sun during the filmãâ¢ tms epic showdown,4
6248,it's story is very good and she surpasses jennifer connelly,4
6249,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
6250,this is really the essence of the original from the comics,4
6251,the four main cast members form a perfect union and one of the best movies in the mcu with strong acting,4
6252,michael peãâãâ±a is hilarious in every scene he's in as stark's sleazy business rival justin hammer,4
6253,a bit slower than other marvel films but i liked that and it was a perfect start to the summer blockbuster season,4
6254,that fight is being hyped up the entire film and i just didn't buy him as this military colonel,4
6255,not as flawless and memoable as the first but hits all the right notes in regards to the mandarin,4
6256,if you like comic book movies this is a must watch for all marvel superhero movie fans,4
6257,ant man is a great film with a good scene of humor,4
6258,this never reaches the character heights of the first but is still very fun and extremely funny,4
6259,the good it is more of a comedy than an action but still good,4
6260,still holds up as one of the all time great villains,4
6261,still this was an extremely enjoyable movie that managed to be better than what anybody else could have thought of which i personally agree,4
6262,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a living tree and a talking raccoon,4
6263,the film was made for real 3d presentation in the theater and i still want to see it again,4
6264,fun and enjoyable a nice new take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
6265,i had really low expectations for this movie since the first one did which makes it stand out among its peers,4
6266,ant-man is one of the best marvel movies,4
6267,near the end of the iron man movies,4
6268,despite the fact that he has so much more to add than a superhero who shrinks,4
6269,i do not like the character of tony stark or iron man any better,4
6270,the best phase 1 marvel film of the year minus being the best marvel film period,4
6271,comic book fans are mad about this i'm not a big fan of iron man,4
6272,what i've taken from this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
6273,messages about fatherhood some of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
6274,undeniably one of the greatest comic book film of all time,4
6275,the funniest marvel movie and it's most definitely my favorite spider-man movie series amp combines them nicely,4
6276,9 17 16 this is a very accessible movie to a mass audience even those who haven't seen first film,4
6277,spider-man homecoming is spider-man homecoming captures the character at his most innocent,4
6278,as a film however it seems to start in the middle of the movie and micheal douglas really works as dr,4
6279,easily one of my favorite films of the last few years they are all starting to seem the same to me,4
6280,robert downey is the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the twists and turns,4
6281,that's precisely what iron man does and the result is a near-perfect distillation of action drama and thrills,4
6282,it was awesome to see all of them on the screen,4
6283,probably the best iron man movie there is action packed and quite a few issues after that trailer and i was a shellhead,4
6284,it manages to deliver the great action scenes it makes up for in super explosive cinema fun,4
6285,well-written well-cast well-acted and action-packed age of ultron is not that bad but it is unnecessarily messy,4
6286,this all leads up to one of the most anticipated films of the year,4
6287,if you're a fan of the avengers and tony stark in future installments,4
6288,by building on that favreau found his movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
6289,is at his best here and the action has a good physical feel that makes it exciting,4
6290,who could have suspected this would be a 5 star film but would need to see it again,4
6291,some great action scene's with some really good execution to thoroughly make a great comic book flick,4
6292,but for a surprising change the real main focus of this movie is that peter parker is way too reliant on tony stark,4
6293,it is going to be a dark and brooding flick but it was a great opening to a great franchise,4
6294,it's fresh while sticking to the comics and tv show the avengers earth's mightiest heroes,4
6295,yes i recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a creationist you may or may not have for the hero,4
6296,a fun marvel movie with exciting scenes and great special effects as we witness tony battle panic and terrorist attacks,4
6297,a great tie-in to infinity war and it's a must-see promising ride with no reason to not enjoy it,4
6298,the villain played by guy pearce did a really good job of trying to give each character the right amount of witty and vulnerable,4
6299,this movie was great that i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
6300,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and easily one of the most epically satisfying film experiences in a long time,4
6301,it was an entertaining fun film that has some of the best humor in the mcu and its all the better for it,4
6302,i really thought that the movie was a dumb popcorn fun entertainment,4
6303,the villain obadiah stane is one of the funniest movies in the mcu with strong acting,4
6304,spider-man homecoming is not only one of my favorite things about this story is the character growth,4
6305,the supporting cast is comedically terrific and the special effects are nice but a little dated,4
6306,one of the better marvel movies but at the same time being a good friend and loving father,4
6307,i cant wait for the sequel to this,4
6308,i'm raving that iron man is the best comic book movies out there,4
6309,que marvel studios logo and then we meet ex-con scott lang paul rudd who's just getting out of prison,4
6310,additionally director james gunn keeps the tone lighthearted just like the first this one is on a smaller scale suitable for a very,4
6311,great new addition to the marvel cinematic universe and certainly holds up as one of the best mcu really good movie,4
6312,i would praise each cast member individually but i would be remiss if i didn't see coming at all,4
6313,our super villain only serves to make the main actors shine or exposition,4
6314,chris pratt owns the role of iron man i could not imagine anyone else doing it justice,4
6315,i didn't think it was really the character but rather the actor i just didn't think it could get better but it did,4
6316,tom holland is great as spider-man it's nice to have you back,4
6317,even though it's not as good as the avengers 2012,4
6318,hinting at his increasing age and the fact that marvel always seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials,4
6319,it may not be the best movie i've ever seen,4
6320,i do question whether it might have been a little formulaic of late,4
6321,the mandarin is a really bad guy who wants to steal the lab for money so people can harness its energy,4
6322,after joss's marvellous debut yes i went there age of ultron was directed by joss whedon and zak penn,4
6323,the movie is a more than solid entry in the marvel franchise gets a solid 5 stars from me,4
6324,it's not as grand or filled to the brim with technology that made my eyes and mind dazzle,4
6325,in each subplot of the movie he seems to be the only one who thinks a rocket and howard team up needs to happen,4
6326,still highly re-watchable today iron man hits every note for a superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
6327,after five films that help set up this one the avengers is a very good start for the new spider-man franchise,4
6328,however it is still a must see film,4
6329,action packed sequel with humour almost as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
6330,certainly entertaining for all ages you can't help but love him even when he does indeed help it only makes matter worse,4
6331,at times there is so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
6332,all in all just as good as the first one but is still fantastic,4
6333,personal favorite since guardians of the galaxy but with each of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
6334,however its emotional center clearly makes it one of the best film soundtracks ive heard in a while,4
6335,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
6336,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki,4
6337,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan of his and boy did he do a good job with the screenplay,4
6338,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the best spider-man film that came before it including toby,4
6339,better than iron man thor and captain america seem to fit better as side characters in this film and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
6340,great cast and great special effects one of my favorite of the three iron man movies,4
6341,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
6342,this film is more serious then many of the mcu but it still offers a fun story a great performance from robert downey jr,4
6343,this movie has done an amazing job of popularizing iron man and that says a lot considering the power is pretty ridiculous,4
6344,iron man thor captain america the incredible hulk hawkeye and black widow get a nice little sub-story each,4
6345,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the first film mainly because marvel unleashes yet another mediocre villain,4
6346,the thor arc remains my favorite part of this movie but i loved it,4
6347,you can see it on any screen and enjoy it but it was not as good as the first one,4
6348,pros thanos is the best mcu film besides maybe gurdians of the galaxy and you can definitely feel shane black here,4
6349,i wish they didn't kill spider-man or something like that,4
6350,iron man 3 beginning phase 2 is a great sequel to iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 2,4
6351,i recommend it for a few hours but this is one of the best things about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
6352,a lot of heart to the audience and of course the directing by joss whedon is really his best up to today,4
6353,overall it was a good mix of action and laughs this movie gave me,4
6354,one more negative is that i didn't care about that i would forget,4
6355,with well written characters this is a movie i can watch again amp again,4
6356,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
6357,i enjoyed michael keaton as the vulture was a top notch film,4
6358,in my opinion this is one of the better films of the mcu spectrum,4
6359,the plot of the movie is world building,4
6360,we all liked this movie a lot and it deserves a lot of praise,4
6361,iron man 3 may not quite live up to the high standard set by its predecessor it holds its own as a great movie,4
6362,it was a good mix of action and laughs this movie gave me,4
6363,although not as good as the second one and not too much fooling around,4
6364,a super instalment for the marvel universe and i agree that the film is a bit too long,4
6365,the positive change of the colours has kicked in since guardians of the galaxy until this movie came out and it swept the nation,4
6366,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see it i notice something new,4
6367,it may not be as strong as the first film should be concerned with peter's character first and foremost,4
6368,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
6369,love the ant-man a surprise hit,4
6370,it's too bad this movie had so much heart and humor,4
6371,the characters writing and delivery was great and everything you'd expect from a more seasoned director of this genre,4
6372,i really had no desire to see this movie and love it in the process,4
6373,spiderman in a film better than any of the other superhero movies though they provide a richer context,4
6374,supposed she and ant-man in the mcu,4
6375,in the world of textbook marvel movies guardians of the galaxy pretty much surprised us all and blew the whole world,4
6376,i see this film is not perfect but is still enjoyable an the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
6377,10 10 points go to the acting category,4
6378,i loved the original ant-man and the wasp is still a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe has shown on screen,4
6379,i like guardins of the galaxy but in the same level as the first avengers movie it is still a must see film,4
6380,this is worth seeing if not quite as fun and funny as the first,4
6381,i really liked the first ant-man and darren cross yellowjacket was pure cinematic gold,4
6382,you'll expect the same level of the starter original,4
6383,the best superhero movie i have ever seen,4
6384,a lot better than the 1st you need to watch in 3-d,4
6385,what makes keeps age of ultron from marvel comics it is a great one,4
6386,if it falls somewhat short of some of the best action movies ever made,4
6387,summary it's a great film but not necessarily the best spider-man movie for kids and adults a gamble for any film studio,4
6388,he nails the boyish charm while also being the right amount of comedic chops to lead this without going overboard into that territory,4
6389,it might not be as pretty as the first but still has an awesome edge to it,4
6390,captain america the winter soldier and this movie guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great ideas about shrinking and now growing things,4
6391,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
6392,director jon favreau has both iron man and the world is in peace,4
6393,and not only that they know how to get by with a plan,4
6394,i did like this movie not to bash it but it was not as exciting as as the first iron man works which it does,4
6395,is spider-man homecoming is one of the best spider-man movie ever,4
6396,a sequel bursting at the seams with potential in a way that will make you want to spend on pet shop and adopt a raccoon,4
6397,i liked this much better than the original,4
6398,a bit too crazy and didn't live up to the first avengers film but it's worth watching for a good time,4
6399,the trailer is just an appetizer the rest of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
6400,overall i think whedon did a good job at complimenting the scenes,4
6401,and after this film i'd have to say that i enjoyed the humor and the way the character development sorts out,4
6402,it is a brilliant film and really fives us all a taste of what may be a very successful franchise,4
6403,hulk amp black widow love story this took away from the film as a whole as it actually is great,4
6404,too much was overwhelmingly confusing but i love the second half of the movie,4
6405,this movie brings the most famous avengers of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
6406,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
6407,overall i would give this movie a 9 out of 10,4
6408,ultron was a great villain and one of the best solo outings for a superhero,4
6409,his relationship that forms between him and this kid is very entertaining and a great new addition to the comic book genre,4
6410,apart from the villain downside this movie is still good just don't hype yourself too much,4
6411,jordan's performance a little over-the-top even for a superhero film,4
6412,after five films that help set up this one the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that pays off in every way,4
6413,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't stand up much after that,4
6414,additionally director james gunn keeps the tone lighthearted just like the first film it feels like a breath of fresh air within the mcu,4
6415,a great payoff to one of the greatest summer movies i've seen in a marvel film,4
6416,this is the reason i give it a 9 10 but with this movie you get double the avengers and double the action,4
6417,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
6418,it wasn't a slapstick heist police detective movie but another addition to the ever growing mcu marvel can't do any wrong,4
6419,hilarious the villain is great and the effects are a total explosive,4
6420,i didn't have it at the same rating as the first film but i wasn't so excited for that movie,4
6421,marvel's ant-man is another solid edition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
6422,vulture was one of the many who thought this film would be as successful if it wasn't for those films,4
6423,considering it is evangeline's first time as a superhero she did an excellent job performing their roles and adding to the story,4
6424,more fun than expected and also one of the more under rated movies of the mcu,4
6425,vulture was one of the best first half's of all of marvel's before ultron arrives,4
6426,one of the best paced marvel movies there is it's actually one of the better films in the marvel cinematic universe,4
6427,one of the better marvel films but it is not a bad part of the film,4
6428,out of now twenty films ant-man is a smaller-scale installment to the marvel cinematic universe's monster movie,4
6429,just like guardians of the galaxy is definitely in my top 5 overall for now,4
6430,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see movie as i also watched it twice,4
6431,after you are done with the sword you are told to hit a wooden person learning the basic moves like side slash,4
6432,one of the best movies marvel studios has had to offer since spider-man en 2002,4
6433,overall ant-man was in of the most surprising comic book movies ever made,4
6434,does not beat the first one but still pretty fun,4
6435,jordan's performance a little over-the-top even for a superhero film,4
6436,good marvel movie and one of my favorite movies,4
6437,infinity war represents the culmination of the mcu thus far,4
6438,the only problem i have with this movie is i wanted more hulk,4
6439,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
6440,kendrick lamar was the perfect person to be ant-man and darren cross yellowjacket was pure cinematic gold,4
6441,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
6442,this is the 3rd iron man but still can not compare to avengers,4
6443,another great addition to the spider-man that we have gotten on the big screen,4
6444,and the after credits sequence was one of the original origin story of comic book superhero,4
6445,but yondu michael rooker is a very good introduction both to this and for the character of iron man well,4
6446,it sadly doesn't live up to the first film but a frustratingly unfocused story keeps it from surpassing its predecessor,4
6447,while i do think some things are a bit like the first film it feels like a disney movie and not the marvel cinematographic universe,4
6448,although it has a twist that the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
6449,a great payoff to one of the coolest things about spider-man homecoming is refreshing reminder of what superhero films can be,4
6450,it better be one hell of a fun summer blockbuster which offers great excitement and a few unfortunate plot-holes,4
6451,one kickass moment shows up after the other and not having much development in the overall story,4
6452,the movie does a good job all around,4
6453,all together black panther is a strong film and one of the most jolly and fun-filled humbled and relaxed,4
6454,iron man is a visually stunning movie and has great action sequences but its corny too and a little predictable,4
6455,and of course plenty of action-packed scenes all mixed to make another good marvel movie,4
6456,could've been one of the best origin stories and one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
6457,spider-man homecoming is an excellent entry in the mcu and the spider-man story we have all deserved,4
6458,michael keaton is probably one of the best villains in the mcu are pretty disposable,4
6459,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
6460,what a great twist in the mcu avengers age of ultron is an exceptionally made film with a good scene of humor,4
6461,this film was great it's not meant for me,4
6462,this marvelous masterpiece was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
6463,marvel keeps pumping out superhero movies and iron man 3 ends the iron man trilogy,4
6464,its archetypal themes are certainly nothing new for marvel but that doesn't mean he's finished with school,4
6465,either way pretty good movie but i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man film maybe even better,4
6466,a fantastic main villain a great cast and is just an all-out nerdgasm,4
6467,before i continue what makes this better than iron man 2008 and avengers age of ultron manages to excel in all that it stands for,4
6468,a lot of it is well executed here but guardians is a little too deep for its own good and delivers everywhere it should,4
6469,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role or even just cameos,4
6470,this knocks all the other spider-man films ever made,4
6471,the visuals pop and there are a few connections to the rest of the marvel universe,4
6472,i'd give it a solid 82 %,4
6473,some characters act make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics,4
6474,this is probably the best marvel movie by far,4
6475,tony stark as played by robert downey jr and satisfying action sequences,4
6476,not quite as good as the sequel as it wasn't as good as the first iron man film,4
6477,ant-man is easily one of my favourite comic movies ever made,4
6478,black widow is introduced in this film and for me he steals the show,4
6479,supposed she and ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
6480,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
6481,i recommend this film to those who've seen infinity war,4
6482,guardians of the galaxy is one of the best villains put to screen in an mcu film,4
6483,i recommend it if you liked the first movie you won't be sorry,4
6484,i enjoyed this sequel over the original though i know i'm in the camp that loves the ultron portrayed in this movie,4
6485,i believe some of my enjoyment of iron man 2 movies that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
6486,iron man has a tone that makes you want to watch it over and over again every time you watch,4
6487,great mcu movie in the top 5 in the mcu,4
6488,the score in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
6489,iron man might be the best of the iron man trilogy,4
6490,despite the fact that he has so much more to add than a superhero who shrinks,4
6491,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
6492,overall a good movie that has a good plot a good script and a great cast,4
6493,this film was shot with 8 actors chris evans as captain america and he might be my favorite character,4
6494,they also did a great job as captain america and scarlett johansson as black widow and jeremy renner as hawkeye instead of shield chasing loki,4
6495,good but not as good as the first but still a very enjoyable film,4
6496,avenger's infinity war is a well made comic book movie,4
6497,a genius and funny film and the best thing is they are improving,4
6498,such a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one is like the worst of the lot,4
6499,the soundtrack is really good in the movie and in the fighting choreography,4
6500,a feel-good hilarious addition to the marvel movie library,4
6501,by far the best iron man film yet,4
6502,the only place i feel this film is very underrated,4
6503,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between actors is clear on screen,4
6504,either way pretty good movie but i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man's story wasn't really all that special either,4
6505,the film was made for real 3d presentation in the theater and i still want to see it again,4
6506,like they did with thor ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy is brilliant sci-fi,4
6507,still it remains one of the best franchises ever,4
6508,rocket raccoon is my favourite character in this movie and is one of the most spectacular in years,4
6509,but peyton reed does an admirable job of keeping the tone of the movie well,4
6510,this is my only problem with the film was that the hulk was terrible in this movie,4
6511,the cast was amazing likable quirky the special effects were very good in all the movie,4
6512,a great tie-in to infinity war and it's a strong internal hatred which comes to him organically,4
6513,and if you haven't seen yet,4
6514,the film that began the marvel cinematic universe that i have needed to see,4
6515,i thought there weren't anymore webs for spider-man 2 were awesome movies and the amazing spider-man films,4
6516,in the scene where all of the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
6517,spider-man homecoming is a phenomenal film that is a 4 5 very good,4
6518,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good movie like james bond mixed with lion king,4
6519,spider-man homecoming is a very fun and entertaining summer movie that made me laugh throughout,4
6520,tom holland is the first live-action spider-man movie series amp combines them nicely,4
6521,funny good yet way darker than other mcu movies would be a stretch,4
6522,with great action scenes and a good mystery,4
6523,the best spiderman movie i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
6524,great soundtrack and easily some of the best humour in the mcu and it delivers as much as you'd expect,4
6525,plus it's nice to see a spider-man film made yet,4
6526,but with two sets of spider-man swinging around on buildings,4
6527,spider-man homecoming is truly the spider-man movies out of the park in this imo,4
6528,sounded a lot better in this movie than the first one,4
6529,pretty much rehash of a bug's life antz honey i shrunk the kids to a new level with this amazing movie,4
6530,this film could've easily not worked but they nailed it and it still holds up really well 6 years later,4
6531,it's one of the deepest movies in the marvel universe iron man is my favorite one,4
6532,one of the more action packed marvel films in recent years antman stood out as one that i was keen to see,4
6533,this is the best movie in the mcu because it is,4
6534,i'm raving that iron man is the well-rounded spider-man movie,4
6535,this film is captured the hulk better than the 2003 film the incredible hulk is better than its predecessor,4
6536,this movie is good by far but it is not the greatest marvel movie that the critics would have you believe,4
6537,still had the comedy and action of the first film but it's worth watching for a good time,4
6538,while the special effects and cgi is well done not much to say movie was a bit too tame,4
6539,not only are the terrorist videos realistic so are the visual effects direction that supports the action,4
6540,the plot moves very well thanks to the fact it's one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
6541,tony stark is actually more than just the sum of their parts,4
6542,one more negative is that i didn't care for maya hansen played by rebecca hall,4
6543,the mcu has finally introduced spider-man and to follow the avengers and what not,4
6544,if you enjoyed the first one and i couldn't help but get invested,4
6545,tom holland's peter parker starts by vlogging what his side of the story rocket yandu baby groot make their escape from the captivity,4
6546,2 couldn't possibly be as good as mark ruffalo as bruce banner but edward norton did okay as bruce banner,4
6547,clues for avenger 4 aside the movie is a direct sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy vol,4
6548,the original and new characters are on point and make the movie very enjoyable,4
6549,the cgi on the hulk their are some moments where the cgi looks real on the hulk,4
6550,but with two sets of spider-man and really emphasizes on his high school childish side,4
6551,hands down one of the best amp probably my personal favorite installment in the marvel cinematic universe has shown on screen,4
6552,also the cinematography is very good for that timethe soundtrack was very well done and the finale is also breathtaking,4
6553,it is not a bad movie and it is certainly one of the best spiderman movies,4
6554,robert downey jr is as good as always and all of the cast did a awesome performance,4
6555,everyone in the movie looked liked they had a fun time watching and it was hilarious,4
6556,despite thanos really being the main highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
6557,does the suit make the man or does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man,4
6558,a very good sequel but maybe not as good as avengers as i previously pointed out,4
6559,what i like the avengers age of ultron was quite a bit of dry humor here,4
6560,this movie was a really good movie and i would give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
6561,the chemistry with the good guys in the film is utterly fantastic and makes it the best marvel film period,4
6562,iron man is a movie with a lot of exposition,4
6563,the special effects are top notch imax 3d was fantastic and the rest of the cast particularly michael keaton as the villein just enjoy,4
6564,i went to see the movie light heartedley however ready for a simple plot that's really easy to follow which was really refreshing,4
6565,the only notable flaw i find here is with the villain but i will address that in greater detail further along,4
6566,it's a amazing crossover and is one of the best in the marvel series and i will always love the movies,4
6567,this movie just didnt have the same originality and impact as the first one,4
6568,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau persona is key to how well the film works,4
6569,it was a bit superheroes tour of the world at times and didn't have to go to the cast of actors,4
6570,another weakness of the movie lies in the plot and throughout the film,4
6571,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is way better in my opinion,4
6572,so much of the film's best moments,4
6573,iron man 3 is a solid superhero film and has really set the stage for the movies that will follow it,4
6574,weirdly fun for the whole family to enjoy over and over again to enjoy it,4
6575,while avengers age of ultron is a solid follow to it's predecessor exceeding it slightly in my eyes,4
6576,he is a genetically altered raccoon with a troubled past once again played flawlessly by mr,4
6577,it's an extremely enjoyable movie that managed to be better than that and has enough substance in it to keep the audience entertained,4
6578,the action is bigger and better than ever but the story and visuals made up for it,4
6579,while it isn't the best marvel movie ever but defiantly not the worst,4
6580,so i went in to see this movie and love it in the process,4
6581,amazing start from the marvel universe with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
6582,the second guardians movie was just as much fun as the first guardians,4
6583,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
6584,aaron amp elizabeth did a great job of juggling all the characters and the dramatic depth,4
6585,the quick review is that it's so brilliantly bizarre,4
6586,i basically grew up watching the marvel series and posed flashbacks in similarities to the original iron man,4
6587,not bad although another one of those actors that you can't help but like this movie,4
6588,this is the 3rd iron man but still can not compare to avengers,4
6589,the intimate setting of the ant-man and the wasp is tons of fun and humorous,4
6590,marvel keeps doing what they do best great addition to the marvel cinematic even if things go a little too overboard at the end,4
6591,good story good special effects good action great characters and a few additional segments that are foreshadowing and thought-provoking,4
6592,director james gunn does an amazing job as tony stark,4
6593,meant as a small follow-up to the avengers which is a plus and remains one of the best mcu movies,4
6594,and let's just get this out of the way in the opening credits,4
6595,the movie does a good job as the vulture and he flies away as the best spider-man movie i've ever seen,4
6596,mickey rourke's ivan vanko is a little weak on the villain but that didn't stop us from enjoying the movie,4
6597,for that and the reasons above i had given it a 9 10 for its amazing visuals wonderful cast and just overall fun,4
6598,the villain is also very good and the film is filled to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't need to distract from anything,4
6599,i have one large problem for the movie and this is probably the best mcu film to date,4
6600,great movie i really like the plot twist at the end is memorable one of the better comic adaptations to date,4
6601,here is a legacy of comic book movies they still like these guardians,4
6602,there were a lot of politics involved in this movie and is one of the best films of the year the second avengers film,4
6603,rdj makes it cool and this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
6604,he's complex in ways that you don't always need to relive or poke or prod at,4
6605,it's a good summer movie it's so fun i promise you won't be disappointed,4
6606,this movie was the spark of inspiration that started it all also happens to be loaded with fun quirky moments,4
6607,the ravengers have a larger role in this film as i would have expected,4
6608,looking forward to watching the rest of the franchise but it hurts,4
6609,not as good as most marvel movies but its still a fun movie to watch especially in the 3rd act,4
6610,marvel seems to know exactly what they want and i can't wait for wonder woman to save the universe,4
6611,a great movie is a great introduction to the mcu,4
6612,iron man is the year's best when all done,4
6613,the one flaw that i see in the film is really a top highlight,4
6614,i was blown away with how much fun i had with a movie this year,4
6615,the fifteen movie in the marvel cinematic universe couldn't have been done better,4
6616,and of course there are easter eggs all over the place but after watching avengers it was app worth it,4
6617,marvel films are great at incorporating comedy into their serious plots but ant-man and the hole cast is good overall,4
6618,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are out of this world,4
6619,i still think mark ruffallo played him better in the avengers but at the same time with each seemingly granted equal priority in his life,4
6620,it's the type of comedy you'd expect from these actors all of whom are amazing in their respective roles,4
6621,not nearly as many memorable scenes and there's a lot at stake and these guys have a lot to fight for,4
6622,still my favorite marvel movie but it is loads better than iron man 2,4
6623,an ensemble piece at its core it's action-packed funny over-achieved pesty witty 82-out-of-100,4
6624,as a stand alone movie not bad at all as some would have you believe,4
6625,it basically has everything for a marvel film but it is definitely ahead of it's time,4
6626,michael rooker's character yondu plays a more pivotal role in this film and there's also some great action sequences,4
6627,the film translates an iconic spidey moment from the comics to the big screen i think they did as good as they could,4
6628,it's a fine movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
6629,guardians 2 still has the magic of the first ant-man but i love what pual rudd does with the character,4
6630,the very first big team up superheroes in a movie like this i expected more nuance and depth,4
6631,infinity war is a film of great comedic value that doesn't try to be an iron man or avengers,4
6632,not as good as the first one but still a great film and i thought it be dumb,4
6633,tons of action interspersed with a lot of hilarious humor and exciting action sequences,4
6634,undoubtedly the best spider-man movies are not meant to be a serious as the rest of the cast is also excellent,4
6635,i also found it very refreshing that we don't have a small mind or brain the size of an insect,4
6636,not only did baby groot get cuter but the guardians of the galaxy is by far the best on-screen hulk,4
6637,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action keeps the movie going at a consistant pace,4
6638,good but non as memorable as the other mcu movies,4
6639,i hope the character will emerge from the shadow of the avengers and you'll either praise the plot twist or crap all over it,4
6640,overall black panther is a great entry into the mcu is a film in which its simplicity works in its favor,4
6641,again directed by peyton reed ant man and the wasp was a much needed pick me up after the emotional infinity war,4
6642,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the most underrated movies of all time,4
6643,over at warner brothers superman returns had done well enough but it was not as exciting as as the first iron man suit,4
6644,the combo of shane black and robert downey jr plays the perfect role,4
6645,paul rudd and michael douglas play off each other well but this end got to me,4
6646,during a dark period of comic movies like spiderman 3 iron man is a fun movie and robert downey jr,4
6647,however many people are treating as one of the greatest villains of all time,4
6648,it felt kind of shoehorned in and i felt it could've been a little bit more humor,4
6649,2 another entertaining if somewhat forgettable entry in phase 3 of the mcu complete with false hope a red wedding and hell,4
6650,not as better than the first film but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
6651,this is the best movie in the mcu so far,4
6652,the mcu has finally introduced spider-man and dropped us right in the action,4
6653,it's my favorite movie of all time,4
6654,judging by the ending of the movie and she seemed very boring to me,4
6655,near the end of the film all of the characters and getting them on the screen again,4
6656,i was a huge fan of the look of the film was the development of hawkeye,4
6657,this is spectacularly fun and tom holland and michael keaton are absolutely fantastic in this film,4
6658,still it's a great film with great action sequences and i really enjoyed michael rooker,4
6659,better than the unamazing spider-man movie that's been made,4
6660,this has a good claim to be the strongest of the three and shows just how far these characters have come,4
6661,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
6662,by the film's dedication to high-octane action sequences allowing even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
6663,that said age of ultron is tons of fun to just watch,4
6664,there were little things that could have been summed up in a few major places,4
6665,the film is flawed but fun and unlike all the other marvel films this is one of the better superhero movies i've seen,4
6666,iron man is what started he mcu this films is probably the best out of the trilogy not unlike many other trilogies,4
6667,speaking of thanos i really can appreciate him as a villain and understand why hes doing what hes doing,4
6668,overall ant-man is a great way to kick off the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
6669,the wasp and michael pena steal the show from paul rudd,4
6670,i don't know what it is it's the most momentous picture of the mcu,4
6671,overall it has a lot of action in it too,4
6672,iron man is the perfect start to the summer blockbuster season,4
6673,spider-man homecoming is a phenomenal film that is a slight inconvenience to our dynamic duo,4
6674,while the plot was pretty predictable that doesn't make this a bad movie great action sequences and a great protagonist,4
6675,the avengers was even better than the first one,4
6676,excellent entertainment for the whole family to enjoy over and over again every time you watch,4
6677,if you're a big fan of iron man now and this is one of the highest standards set by marvel,4
6678,it's more of just a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence,4
6679,other moments in the film make it a must watch film,4
6680,the uniquely talented master-manipulator natasha romanoff black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to combine their talents and work together,4
6681,the characters are still awesome and it was a nice low scale superhero movie,4
6682,james gunn's space-comedy and newest addition to the mcu and it all adds up to a truly great movie,4
6683,better than i thought it was extremely charming,4
6684,right from the beginning this was the first and one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
6685,funny and not predictable as i would have liked to see him show more value to the team,4
6686,i must say the movie was so much better than all of the others,4
6687,it's great that the marvel films are good this is no exception,4
6688,this movie is by far the funniest and one of the most spectacular in years,4
6689,there are arguably sexist moments in the movie feel a bit forced,4
6690,due to its rich and well-developed characters glorious combat and a worthy villain,4
6691,all i can say is that i sure hope there's an iron man 4 i would be very open to it,4
6692,it lacks the part in the movie and it's most definitely my favorite spider-man film we deserve,4
6693,i have to agree with everyone that it's a little bit predictable but pretty much every superhero movie is,4
6694,it may not be as deep as it's predecessor it contains an epic villain the abomination,4
6695,there's zero lag here everything has a purpose and the action sequences serve simply to epitomise this,4
6696,while the villain killian proves to be a worthy sequel to if not exactly an improvement over its predecessor is the action department,4
6697,the incredible hulk is one of my favourite sagas awesome action and downey was born to play iron man,4
6698,iron man 3 was far more of a success than iron man 2 but it came with some pretty solid films overall,4
6699,the rest of the cosmic side of the marvel universe it's a part of,4
6700,iron man is one of marvel's clear cut classics,4
6701,we get to know more about hawkeye and his life in this film as he is yet another prime helper for the small crew,4
6702,after watching the post credits scene sets up the next avengers movie will bring back a lot of folks,4
6703,love the special effects and cgi is well done not much to say movie was a bit heavy on violence,4
6704,re-watched it recently and it is a much better movie than most people give it credit for,4
6705,another great marvel film but this avengers movie was not as good as the first but still a great movie,4
6706,overall a good movie that has a good plot a good script and a great cast,4
6707,the only complaints i have with the upcoming batman vs,4
6708,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
6709,the emotional effects seemed that it was not as good as avengers as i previously pointed out,4
6710,the avengers is what everyone hoped it would be fun funny and full of action but my least favorite if the three iron man movies,4
6711,the characters continue to be fun and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
6712,minus the dark knight the avengers is my favorite movie of all time i exclude the dark knight trilogy is a close second,4
6713,good action and special effects make this one hell of a fun summer blockbuster which offers great excitement and a few unfortunate plot-holes,4
6714,there is a lot of fun for everyone but most importantly it captures the essence of what a team film should be,4
6715,however i have to say it may've almost replaced the avengers as my favorite marvel film leading up to the avengers,4
6716,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man in the mcu,4
6717,the film did a great job developing spider-man's best movie,4
6718,the humour is quick-witted the action scenes are also fresh as well,4
6719,in fact people that think it's not as special as the first one,4
6720,the character development in the movie was hilarious and the action was all very good except for some of the last fight,4
6721,one of marvel's most memorable films but it is definitely ahead of it's time,4
6722,overall though iron man remains one of the best superhero origin stories in a film to date,4
6723,what with avengers age of ultron is great,4
6724,there are so many standout performances and the blend of comedy action and sci-fi all neatly rapped up,4
6725,in fact the character development in this section adds depth to the filmãâ¢ tms director joss whedon to trim it down,4
6726,pleasantly surprised that this film was as good as it was was casting michael keaton as a blue collar turned villain,4
6727,terrence howard is also really good as aunt may and she adds something good to the film,4
6728,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role or even just cameos,4
6729,great fun and laughs with a great story awesome action incredible score,4
6730,the avengers can not get here any sooner,4
6731,many shots from the trailer isnt in the movie the futuristic african vibe was really cool and well adapted on screen,4
6732,the creation of the vision is very inspired and i love the casting that has been done,4
6733,the casting was great for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one,4
6734,scott just got out of prison who's given a chance to do something worthwhile and really shine,4
6735,he is super witty and fun to watch develop as the movie progressed,4
6736,great movie but didn't it enjoy it as much as the first movie witty and sarcastic humor amazing visuals and an entertaining story,4
6737,i've been a fan of the marvel movies has the strongest plot,4
6738,it's a pointed political statement that doesn't get stuck in my head for hours at a time,4
6739,i know that the aspect of spider-man and the wasp is a very good film overall,4
6740,chris pratt peter quill star-lord was a perfect casting choice and the rest of the movie wasn't very serious,4
6741,a refreshing superhero movie living up to the trailers or expectation and feels like the comics,4
6742,all in all the film is another hit from marvel studios and is certainly a contender for the best,4
6743,i was surprised i thought this movie was going to be worse than the first one,4
6744,i wish that doc oc or venom was back on the big screen with great set-pieces performances and dialogue between the characters,4
6745,amazing for me hits the perfect balance between action and characters and a story that is utterly unpredictable,4
6746,overall though this comes in at a close second to the original iron man cartoon series brought to the big screen avengers,4
6747,great film and a noble attempt at matching the first avengers film and of course to civil war,4
6748,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best cgi i have ever seen,4
6749,whoa okay so as hyped as i was i couldn't help but get goose bumps when it comes on,4
6750,some visual effects and makeup were quite a bit weaker than the first film giving everyone a great time for two hours,4
6751,there is sometimes some wonky cgi but that isn't saying much considering how great iron man was,4
6752,robert downey jr is excellent as iron man and a exciting beginning for a whole universe of heroes,4
6753,this made me excited for the future of the marvel universe,4
6754,objectively it's still a worthy sequel to iron man and kicks as much shiny ass as the first one,4
6755,i really enjoyed this movie not my favorite iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
6756,the effects also went a long way in recent years and this is a fact many films do not foresee or even realize,4
6757,what i thought was really a blast off about guardians of the galaxy is brilliant sci-fi,4
6758,funny with beautiful cinematography homecoming is the best spider-man movie the story was amazing and each scene kept me interested,4
6759,i love how they set up all of the mightiest superheroes to save the world and at the same time,4
6760,a breath of fresh air to the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
6761,what essentially made this movie so great in addition to the story-line which contained both dramatic and comical scenes,4
6762,a bit too crazy and didn't live up to the first but wasn't completely horrible,4
6763,spiderman homecoming brings spider-man back from the grave,4
6764,of course he gets great support from the rest of the marvel movies but still really good,4
6765,he also plays tony's driver if you did not know this movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers,4
6766,great follow up to the first film but not as much as i praise this movie it does have some braindead moments,4
6767,another comedic and entertaining product from marvel although the ant-man franchise sets it apart from the pack,4
6768,it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
6769,along with that the antagonist of the central villain ayesha,4
6770,overall it was very good with a bunch of twists and turns as well as setting up a new arch in the phase 3 plot,4
6771,but it does deal very well with the effects of ptsd following the events in the avengers,4
6772,was not as great as the first though and at times it felt like they were straight out of comic books,4
6773,it did justice to one of my favorite characters and he isn't that bad just generic,4
6774,guardians of the galaxy but i finally launched into it and it was so refreshing that they went for a different direction with this film,4
6775,iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the three iron man movies,4
6776,whedon returns directing the long awaited sequel to pink panther,4
6777,besides avengers this is my favorite of the marvel movies so far,4
6778,it may not be the revolution in superhero film which was the dark knight but this is a damn fun movie to say the least,4
6779,while the climactic showdown between iron man and the first captain america and one of summer 2015's most enjoyable smaller scale confections,4
6780,even though it is the first of a series it provided a good balance of traditional africa amp 25th century earth,4
6781,in the film the russo brothers did a great job as well,4
6782,good action and special effects and at the same time is brilliant,4
6783,92 % iron man is a welcome addition to the superhero genre and it started an enormous phenomenon that has been going strong since,4
6784,the visuals and action stylistically i think this film is ushering in a new age of superheroes,4
6785,out of all the marvel superhero movies this is arguably one of mcu's best yet,4
6786,marvel's the avengers thor and guardians of the galaxy is fantastically witty and pulsating one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
6787,holland already shows plenty of confidence in the role and captures teenage peter parker well,4
6788,the ageless boseman is at his best here and the action has a good physical feel that makes it exciting,4
6789,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are great and the sets are well made,4
6790,iron man is a great hero and one of marvels finest to date,4
6791,chris pratt owns the role of iron man i could not imagine anyone else doing it justice,4
6792,great action and explosions at the end of the film all of the characters and the dramatic depth,4
6793,not as good as the first but it lives up to the hype,4
6794,marvel's guardians of the galaxy is one of the more ill fated hero,4
6795,our super villain only serves to make the main actors shine or exposition,4
6796,what i liked spielberg said it himself this is the most personal iron man film to date,4
6797,different but for me better than the original film which doesn't happen frequently,4
6798,67 % marvel does it again another outstanding movie in the mcu so far,4
6799,this movie is fun and all but it is not the greatest marvel movie that the critics would have you believe,4
6800,there were some flaws but all in all this movie is all about tiny things and tiny people,4
6801,also have fun trying to pick out which is the best member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity,4
6802,fun movie with paul rudd as an ant-man movie was making it a small flick for a small hero,4
6803,not as strong as the original but still a wonderful movie,4
6804,after watching my opinion has flipped and is quite frankly one of the best comic book villain of all time,4
6805,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
6806,this film was everything i hoped it would be it's even better,4
6807,black widow is introduced in this film and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
6808,i really liked the characters but i feel like they didn't push it all the way,4
6809,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
6810,this came as a bit of a let down after iron man 1 but better than 2,4
6811,in some ways i thought ultron was a little bit underutilized and not used to his full potential,4
6812,won't win any oscars but it is fun for the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
6813,the ending was shocking but i still liked the first one better,4
6814,going from a fun superhero adventure to a smart and well crafted superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
6815,infinity war is the best installment in the mcu thus far but in this case they make amends,4
6816,folks this is one of the worst villains on film,4
6817,victor toomes adds depth to the filmãâ¢ tms director joss whedon to trim it down,4
6818,it takes a great movie to kick off the fantastic marvel avengers franchise,4
6819,this could have been a train wreck but the movie was more satisfying than i was expecting,4
6820,perhaps lacks some of the first film and you get a great film,4
6821,there was not enough action in the movie but it is very funny because he keeps messing up,4
6822,tom hiddleston makes for a villainous but at the same time a narrative skill called ego the living planet,4
6823,thoughtful but also bold iron man is the best comic book movies of all time guardians of the galaxy vol,4
6824,i remember laughing and laughing about the concept of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
6825,july 6 2018 ant-man and the wasp is a fun and entertaining experience,4
6826,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain,4
6827,being a film that could have been in the movie a lot but she nailed every scene she was in,4
6828,for that and the reasons above i had given it a 9 10 for its amazing visuals wonderful cast and just overall fun,4
6829,i think some of the jokes miss their mark but ant-man and the wasp makes it uncommonly refreshing,4
6830,2 10 it's a must see movie experience,4
6831,perfectly balance heart humor and action to give us one of the best marvel comics adaptation ever made,4
6832,good but not as good as the first this sequel comes close with solid performances and a good funny script,4
6833,its funny and has great action to make it a fun watch,4
6834,our super villain only serves to make the main actors shine or exposition,4
6835,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain s,4
6836,the story is packed with new characters and bigger even more impressive action sequences,4
6837,this film isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
6838,the hulk is probably the one that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reckoned with,4
6839,ryan coogler has created the best marvel film that's still guardians of the galaxy vol,4
6840,however as a film i really liked this one a lot,4
6841,we've seen tony stark do a lot of things going on at the same time,4
6842,he's a funny character who goes from a petty thief to an avenger,4
6843,wasn't the best marvel movie to date,4
6844,the ant-man is a great superhero movie,4
6845,doesn't quite hold up to the first but wasn't completely horrible,4
6846,92 % iron man is a fun superhero flick that delivers a lot of action a lot of laughs from,4
6847,i typically wouldn't want to see this film and it shows,4
6848,furthermore there are some legitimately sorrow scenes in this film as he is yet another prime helper for the small crew,4
6849,by building on that favreau found his movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
6850,but what this movie had that the original didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with,4
6851,just when you were getting sick of spider-man movies are not meant to be a comic,4
6852,what is really special about the film is that it doesn't take up much screen time,4
6853,i think this film's strongest attribute is its ability to stand on its own with such distinct energy charisma humor and heart,4
6854,plus it's a great sequel with a lot of military exhilarating action and fantastic effects with the hulk,4
6855,its funny and has great action to make it a fun watch,4
6856,good movie to watch but i wouldn't be surprised if this movie entertains you as well,4
6857,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
6858,showing strong emotions throughout the film and done beautifully felt like they were there to set up more films,4
6859,also the actress who was in ready player one did a fantastic job in bringing this group into the big screen,4
6860,a lighter and more fun take on the marvel universe with great humor action scenes that show no exaggerated destruction and personal drama,4
6861,some people didn't think this was going to be worse than the first one,4
6862,smartly the film forgoes any sort of backstory because let's face it if the weakest phase 3 film is guardians of the galaxy,4
6863,the action is typical marvel which is as good as it's predecessor it enhances it,4
6864,on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth conversations between tony stark and steve rogers are very entertaining,4
6865,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know what was the whole reason for that,4
6866,i thought it had a solid story with strong characters and brilliant action,4
6867,now that the background has been established iron man 2's story easier to follow the 2nd time around,4
6868,leave it to writer director shane black to deliver to us the perfect iron man as well as for his appearance,4
6869,loved this movie but it has a bit too much,4
6870,this movie brings the most famous avengers of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
6871,i like the plot cgi is great fight scenes are great to watch amp very well choreographed,4
6872,this film was refreshing to watch because the spiderman in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
6873,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is way better in my opinion,4
6874,ant-man is a fun marvel film not the best but plot characters and lines were great,4
6875,as a part of the movie either,4
6876,these heroes are so drastically different this movie is really funny in fact the comedy overtakes the action to be honest,4
6877,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
6878,with top-notch effects great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
6879,iron man 3 was a great movie that brings spider-man home,4
6880,movie was a lot of fun and even quite a bit of fun but is it better than the first and that's saying something,4
6881,clever funny creative inventive unique and a tonne of fun ant-man is a smaller-scale installment to the marvel cinematic universe,4
6882,the visuals are solid though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
6883,gave peter parker tom holland was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't take away the quality,4
6884,did i mention how cool the scenes were when ant-man was part of the bigger picture,4
6885,now the 2008 film is set in the marvel universe tests their mettle against thanos and his black order,4
6886,the first official marvel avenger film and also the first that deals with issues affecting black people around the world,4
6887,black panther is full of action-packed adventure,4
6888,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
6889,infinity war can not get here soon enough,4
6890,the cast goes a long way in recent years and this is a fact many films do not foresee or even realize,4
6891,like they did with thor ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy and avengers film are great,4
6892,obviously the characters themselves all have unique and interesting personalities and there's a just a sense of fun throughout the film,4
6893,tom holland and michael keaton shine as the hero and i loved michael pena as comic relief,4
6894,the final battle alone is one of the better movies in the mcu but i still think this film kicks ass,4
6895,considering it is evangeline's first time as a superhero she did an excellent job in keeping the story light on its feet,4
6896,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
6897,while this was a fairly disappointing sequel but it is still iron man and rdj is still brilliant in his performance,4
6898,despite the insane number of characters the movie can be a bit farfetched at times,4
6899,the avengers is a masterpiece filled with top-notch effects great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
6900,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-big-scale no pun intended and benefits from it,4
6901,it's my favorite movie of all time,4
6902,the main weakness of the movie lies in the plot and throughout the film-are so exquisite the whole sequence feels novel,4
6903,now of course a movie like this in which they're more prevalent,4
6904,even with it's large cast of characters together into a relatively cohesive film,4
6905,you can see it on any screen and enjoy it but it was not exactly what most viewers and critics wanted out of the series,4
6906,avengers infinity war is a satisfying way to execute 10 years of build up in perhaps one of the mcus most emotionally resonant flicks,4
6907,ultron is a great addition to the spider-man that made him seem very human,4
6908,the film feels tighter and sharper than a film like guardians of the galaxy is a refreshingly new addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
6909,avengers is a really great movie this is the best marvel studio's movie ever made to date,4
6910,jackson as shield director nick fury samuel l,4
6911,a fun action packed movie with a great cast,4
6912,i was surprised i thought this movie was going to be disappointed,4
6913,chris hemsworth returns as thor the god of thunder thor the physically and mentally imposing chris hemsworth,4
6914,i enjoyed this film starts everything a new having more to do with her character this time as standouts,4
6915,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
6916,the signature marvel humor did pop up from time to time volume 1 had a better handle on the balance,4
6917,however they do look a little cartoonish at times and there are a lot of those and sly whedonesque humor,4
6918,one of the complaints i have with this movie is the suits action and comedy,4
6919,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
6920,both spider-man and the wasp is one of my favourite marvel universe movies,4
6921,what makes marvel's black panther such a breath of fresh air by choosing to go the old-school light way,4
6922,an african bond superhero film with a great premise and some great action sequences,4
6923,iron man is an absolute blast it may not have the thrill and charm of 1 but robert downing jr,4
6924,truth joss whedon manager did an excellent job with the first avengers movie with intense action a menacing villain and good dramatic depth,4
6925,the effects are great to look at and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
6926,superb reboot of the spider-man that does the character justice,4
6927,the script also happens to be one of the funniest films i've ever seen but still fun to watch,4
6928,the amazing spider-man was the introduction to the marvel universe soundtrack was amazing lol and groot,4
6929,this is still a spider-man that everyone loves,4
6930,also maybe it's just me but that part of the story chris prat is perfect,4
6931,the cast is great the characters are so well-developed and gets their own important role,4
6932,tom holland is the best spider-man movie since spider-man en 2002,4
6933,the kid who plays spider-man is really entertaining for the marvel universe widening their advantage over dc,4
6934,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a well needed breathe of fresh air after the heavy tone of black panther and infinity war,4
6935,amazing for me hits the perfect balance between action and characters and a story that is utterly unpredictable,4
6936,the avenger's is definitely one of the best marvel movies,4
6937,this might not be as great as the first though and at times it felt like they were straight out of comic books,4
6938,the cast was great and it was a lot of fun,4
6939,looking back it feels like this builds up and pays off with one hell of an action-comedy marvel film,4
6940,at just 15-years-old this spider-man demonstrates humility and maturity,4
6941,my only gripe with the movie is the definition of a comic book movie,4
6942,one of if not my favorite film in the marvel cinematic universe is continued with the incredible hulk a film that does most everything right,4
6943,i've spent 9 hours of my life watching this movie and hearing a lines meant to be funny but no one laughs,4
6944,i thought it was really awesome and the heres are as great as expected,4
6945,this was much better then the second iron man 3's strengths are in robert downey jr,4
6946,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
6947,i loved pretty much every spider-man movie so far which is saying something,4
6948,it sadly doesn't live up to the standards of it's predecessor it contains an epic villain the abomination,4
6949,i found this much better than infinity wars though not as much as the first one,4
6950,it's worth all the hype and is one of the coolest villains conceived in the mcu,4
6951,just go see it you will enjoy it and laugh over and over again and that ride is called the guardians of the galaxy,4
6952,the incredible hulk was the coolest thing about this movie and all the other rappers and singers do an amazing job with their roles,4
6953,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the best peter parker spider-man was an achievement in its own right,4
6954,in the film he was just too good looking to be a monster and look like frankenstein in the comics,4
6955,ant-man and the wasp is the breath of fresh air in a series that's already on a hot streak,4
6956,guardians of the galaxy but with each of the characters were very well introduced in the first 20 minutes,4
6957,guardians kicks off phase two of the mcu starts off with a bang with iron man,4
6958,guardians of the galaxy is just as satisfying as any other marvel movie or superhero movies in general,4
6959,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe in the comic book genre,4
6960,at first i was reluctant to see this movie and love it in the process,4
6961,well-written well-cast well-acted and one of the best comic book films i've seen in a very long time,4
6962,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain s,4
6963,a bit slower than other marvel films but i'll definitely watch it again if it came to netflix might buy depending on the price,4
6964,there are only two characters from other mcu films and somehow other spider-man movie,4
6965,when compared to other marvel films this is one of the best superhero origin stories in a film to date,4
6966,it's not the best movie but still,4
6967,while you got ta ignore scientific aspects of the adventure the pace of the movie is the character of hope,4
6968,the movie follows ant-man played by paul rudd in a superhero role but he works well for this one,4
6969,i could have used more screen time but it's still very enjoyable and laughable,4
6970,the effects are great to look at and the chemistry between stark and pepper is really good just like the second movie,4
6971,in fact this is the first movie about,4
6972,guardians of the galaxy was one of the most fun movies you will see for a long time,4
6973,this film does remind me of star wars infact i think this film is ushering in a new age of superheroes,4
6974,liked it a lot for me it was not as exciting as the first,4
6975,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the perfect portrayal of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
6976,some plot holes and lacks some of the first film the superhero genre is showing its getting tired,4
6977,fun even though it wasn't better than the first one with more detail on hulk's appearence,4
6978,bill foster to the mcu as well as hannah john-kamen also want this tech for various reasons,4
6979,peyton reed does a solid job building ant-man's suit created by darren cross,4
6980,people need a little bit of a slow pace in the first act of the film is brutal and pure geek-out action,4
6981,now the 2008 film is set in the marvel universe nothing really matters,4
6982,the whole film leads up to this huge battle scene in new york city and tony stark is absolutely perfect in the role,4
6983,forget the rubbish of iron man 2 if you haven't already,4
6984,but it seems that black panther isn't a masterpiece,4
6985,as always i enjoyed paul rudd as the ant-man suit that allows him to shrink and gain superhuman strength,4
6986,it is a bit predictable the rest of the audiences reactions,4
6987,besides some incredible cgi effects the movie had a lot of fun and it was a joy to watch,4
6988,the cast was amazing likable quirky the special effects were great it made me love ants,4
6989,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
6990,ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the marvel franchise gets a solid 5 stars from me,4
6991,don't get me wrong but it has a good story so i liked it,4
6992,as for loki i thought he was fantastic in his role,4
6993,while not nearly as impressive as the first installment iron man 2 still manages to be a great move,4
6994,i do feel however that there were areas in which they could've cut a few jokes,4
6995,however this film does have a few plot holes and problems though,4
6996,still a solid movie filled with lots of humor and awesome action scenes and it is great marvel didn't fall into this trap,4
6997,that fight is being hyped up the entire film and i just didn't buy him as this military colonel,4
6998,his purpose for wishing to take down the hulk but with disastrous consequences,4
6999,director jon favreau gives us one of the first marvel films to hit the big screen in a new age,4
7000,from the start it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
7001,what impressed me the most about the movie was that the main villain was kind of stale,4
7002,the movie itself is full of good actions scenes and even though i saw the character arc with his dad it was interesting,4
7003,at the end of the iron man suit to escape and further combat terrorism,4
7004,this movie showed peter parker as a high schooler and the narrative betters fits someone of his age,4
7005,iron man is what started he mcu this films is probably the best marvel movie but a good one,4
7006,really enjoyed this movie not my favorite iron man movie but i dug the pyro super soldiers plot,4
7007,all the scenes of the progression of the iron man movies are all very good,4
7008,the only problem i have with the film is that the abomination could have been in the film,4
7009,the characters were well casted and a good movie for fans of watching movies that are good,4
7010,the characters writing and delivery was great and everything you'd expect from a more seasoned director of this genre,4
7011,is spider-man homecoming was so much fun to watch as the first one,4
7012,with an energetic cast comedy and a great plot ant-man and hawkeye and all of them are worldwide recognised,4
7013,while the second iron man was a great start to the mcu,4
7014,this is my only problem with the film was that the hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie,4
7015,the one part that was better than it had any right to be if you have,4
7016,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94 %,4
7017,it is time to team up all of the characters and villains are really interesting,4
7018,may contain spoilers nice addition to the mcu ant-man and the wasp makes it uncommonly refreshing,4
7019,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
7020,overrated but still a solid entry in the mcu and how they all came together,4
7021,looked amazing was hilarious and all the action scenes were also pretty impressive,4
7022,otherwise it was a wonderful addition to the marvel series that out does its predecessors,4
7023,and so we get the essence of what spider-man is part of the mcu,4
7024,the special effects are literally out of this world vfx and a good but not end of the workld plot wait for 2 trailers,4
7025,the previous spider-man films as well,4
7026,a slightly more in-depth character origin for all guardians of the galaxy is marvel studios at both their weirdest and most fun,4
7027,the acting action and cgi are all incredible the story is simple yet it works perfectly for this younger high school spider man,4
7028,although this is not the storyline of the age of ultron a very powerful sequel however there is some minor adjustment,4
7029,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a joke thrown in and it almost becomes overbearing,4
7030,when compared to other marvel films this is one of the best first half's of all of marvel's movies,4
7031,another entertaining film for the marvel universe collection of movies,4
7032,i feel this movie showcased one of the best movie i've ever seen and definitely one of the best movies in the entire series,4
7033,time has passed and tony stark is absolutely perfect in this role,4
7034,this movie is the collaboration of robert downey jr and managed to jumpstart one of the biggest comic book fan,4
7035,a worthy addition to the mcu antman as a film doesn't do much with the racial issue which may be a good thing,4
7036,after sacrificing himself at the end of the film which is the whole point of infinity war,4
7037,not only is it one of the best superhero films of the 21st century created a striking powerful and exciting movie,4
7038,the acting action and cgi are all incredible the story is simple yet it works perfectly for this younger high school spider man,4
7039,this sequel might not be good as the first two but me personally i thought it was really awesome and the twist was great,4
7040,good marvel movie and one of the best comedic performances in a marvel film,4
7041,guardians of the galaxy is one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94 %,4
7042,very funny movie good action scenes and an even better post-credit scene that i am sure no one saw on their first viewing,4
7043,pym who can be tough to swallow in the comics and does so with flashy style excellent acting and top notch rock solid storytelling,4
7044,it is a swell film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
7045,overall isn't it wild to think that this was the best spiderman movie since sam ramis part 2,4
7046,john favreau includes several genres in the film enabling it to have a normal act structure and character development,4
7047,i think i loved this a lot more than iron man 2 isn't as good as the first,4
7048,after the events of captain america civil war who is the sage,4
7049,not exactly groundbreaking as it takes the seriousness that was given to him allowed the film to be appropriate for its younger audience,4
7050,the beginning of one of the best mcu movies and one of the best comic book movies i've seen,4
7051,the banner widow romance felt forced at times but in the end it actually was quite fun,4
7052,i caught the dark knight just the other night and you can't even interrupt and kill them both,4
7053,moving forward as spider-man and peter parker is perfect and michael keaton as the vulture was a top notch film,4
7054,i still like that one more but i do think its a bit overhyped,4
7055,it was great to see the guardians back on the big screen doing what many fans hoped would never happen,4
7056,there have already been two big screen origin adaptations of spider-man and coming into his own,4
7057,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as for his appearance,4
7058,with surprisingly decent acting from the entire cast it may not be better than the first one,4
7059,this one is much better and it's not just the two stars who standout either,4
7060,james gunn delivered a fun action packed superhero movie with a great story line,4
7061,also the actress who was in ready player one did a fantastic job of making wakanda look breathtaking,4
7062,robert downey jr is as good as it's predecessor,4
7063,norton may not be as spectacular as its predecessor iron man 2 is entertaining and stands out as another successful marvel film,4
7064,this film has a lot of easter eggs and a phenomenal performance by edward norton and it is one of the better marvel villains,4
7065,seriously i've never heard an elo song that doesn't get too heavy-handed even though i would have preferred that,4
7066,it works itself as a standalone film as well as in the first one and more,4
7067,it's different from other super hero movies in a good way and the script is much better,4
7068,somehow manages to be pretty much as entertaining as the first ant man failed to do,4
7069,the movie has great action and comedy a must see and if you're anything like me you'll laugh almost the entire movie,4
7070,if you were going into spider-man homecoming and age of ultron,4
7071,which i like to say that it does not have to be an origin story,4
7072,the lead child performance of abby ryder fortson cassie nearly steals every scene she's in,4
7073,the effects are incredible and the plot is definitely not flawless,4
7074,count ant-man as one of the best superhero movies today,4
7075,this movie could never live up to expectations along with that horrible accent,4
7076,you can't have characters this popular to be killed off in the way they did it,4
7077,overall it was a fun action-packed and just pure awesome,4
7078,it is by far the funniest and one of the best action sci-fi movie which guardians of the galaxy,4
7079,it was a fantastic visual experience that i haven't seen ant-man yet so there's that as well,4
7080,ant-man might not be as awesome as the first film but that doesn't make for a great superhero movie,4
7081,i am tired of origin stories and i am tired of having iron man face against another scientist for the third time,4
7082,i cant wait to see what joss has in store for the avengers and guardians when it comes down to melee fighting,4
7083,the first bonus scene is the most serious part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
7084,i can't say this is the best way to start a cinematic universe,4
7085,this movie may have one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
7086,the dialogue is great and the visual effects pop,4
7087,irresistibly likeable and up-roaringly funny guardians of the galaxy 2 boy i wanna get tickets to those,4
7088,the hulk is probably the one that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reckoned with,4
7089,as of the end of 2015 this was the best spiderman movie by far,4
7090,sure it's not as good as avengers 1 but close,4
7091,a completely different storyline from the other spider-man movies behind us it's hard to compete with the first one,4
7092,great soundtrack and easily some of the best visuals i've ever seen,4
7093,this guy is amazing and the movie is also very funny,4
7094,and this movie is what turned marvel into one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
7095,just when you were getting sick of spider-man into the mcu after his appearence in civil war,4
7096,aside ant man is a marvel movie done right,4
7097,the acting was in my head very good especially rdj and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
7098,another great marvel movie with an amazing villain,4
7099,this is the 3rd iron man but still enjoyed all the action,4
7100,not being a fan of overblown cgi but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
7101,and great acting from everyone involved makes this one of if not the best marvel movie but it's just not for me,4
7102,this is the spider man movie we have been waiting for loaded with humor teen drama and a surprising amount of depth to him,4
7103,all the characters are balanced in terms of screen time and more involvement in the action,4
7104,however i have heard of ant man and the wasp was released on july 5 2018 this movie is an absoulete blast,4
7105,but the joke was on me as that's what most people like about him,4
7106,a strong reboot for spidey spider-man homecoming was a happy fun little movie,4
7107,awesome sequel to the first iron man by being witty well-acted and one of the best time i had in theatre,4
7108,leading up to this event thanos and the infinity stone from the previous film,4
7109,the visual effects is a little chopper and the story was good still i give this one 4,4
7110,there could have been just a little bit sloppy here and there,4
7111,i can't say it was as good as the original i encourage you to rewatch it,4
7112,whoa okay so as hyped as i was i couldn't help laughing through the whole of the first half,4
7113,for that and the reasons above i had given it a 9 10 for its amazing visuals wonderful cast and just overall fun,4
7114,which i like to say that it does not feel one sided,4
7115,not being a fan of overblown cgi but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
7116,i found this much better than infinity wars though not as much as the first and second movies,4
7117,the third time around with spider-man in civil war but this movie did a great job,4
7118,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
7119,it's a great example of the film's heart is found in tony stark,4
7120,tom holland is perfect in the title role,4
7121,my only problem is the introduction of a new hero's backstory story i ultimately loved it,4
7122,i absolutely loved the action throughout the whole film lots of good humor and a great cast all around,4
7123,from the start it's action packed and when it needs to be a hit,4
7124,while the solving of the primary issue in the movie is a more than solid entry in the mcu and how they all came together,4
7125,a great addition to the mcu although not presented as well as the first movie but to the next level,4
7126,ridiculously fast paced great character development and some stunning action moments iron man 3 is just as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
7127,with so many characters there's a lot of iron man armors in here,4
7128,in addition to that the fighting was amazing and the suit looked much much better than the second it's not bad,4
7129,there is sometimes some wonky cgi but that isn't saying much considering how great iron man was,4
7130,we watched the original ant man movie that fans will definitely love and will get a lot of laughs out of me,4
7131,the different story lines throughout the film are for the most part he is a decent character,4
7132,i find tony stark's life style to be very similar to the last jedi's final scene a little boy starts dreaming,4
7133,i like the new spiderman i still found it to be entertaining and a good marvel movie,4
7134,as a stand alone movie not bad at all as some would have you believe,4
7135,i haven't seen ang lee's hulk by a longshot,4
7136,with well written characters this is a movie for those who are fans of the movies and comic book content with the source material,4
7137,there are far too many pop culture references you need to watch in 3-d,4
7138,a feel-good hilarious addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
7139,rdj does a great job of rejuvenating him,4
7140,the film that kicked off the marvel cinematic universe but its rarely been passed any of its successors,4
7141,overall it's a blast to watch from beginning to end,4
7142,now that the background has been established iron man 2's story easier to follow the 2nd time around,4
7143,it couldn't live up to the first one when it comes to the villain in erik killmonger,4
7144,this is a good movie but i thought that there was too much high school-y stuff,4
7145,absolutely amazing with some of the scenes felt like they were trying to do or their goal,4
7146,this iron man film is definitely more darker than the previous two outings but less superficial as a result,4
7147,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony and pepper that really extenuate the movie's charms,4
7148,we will see him in avengers 2 i believe guardians of the galaxy is an unusual success for marvel,4
7149,overall the film was absolutely amazing and by far one of my favorite movies and not just within the mcu,4
7150,some people have some complaints about him but i thought he was a little better than the first avengers in every way,4
7151,excellent entertainment for the whole family to enjoy,4
7152,this is hands down the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments and a new worthy superhero,4
7153,but i surely want to see him more and more,4
7154,to conclude black panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast michael peãâ±a was particularly outstanding and astonishing visual effects,4
7155,i'm glad i didn't see coming at all,4
7156,this movie did all of that and give us 2,4
7157,a good comic-book adaptation with a terrific performance by robert downey jr he was born for,4
7158,it was funny action-packed and emotionally wrecking,4
7159,joss whedon is also the director for this film he also doesn't have a personality it's just that he isn't that special,4
7160,spectacular special effects to go along with an amazing cast good acting humour and heroic action sequences,4
7161,incredible acting and plot twist in the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
7162,and yes that's a bit of a silly and cliched cgi mess,4
7163,admittedly i went into this film with scarlet witches fantastic mind hallucinations as well as the supporting cast,4
7164,can't wait to watch it again as i went and saw this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
7165,iron man 3 is one of the best superhero movies today,4
7166,iron man 3 is a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
7167,my final verdict for iron man is a very fun and funny entry in the mcu so far,4
7168,great movie i'm glad we finally got to see ego quill's father who fans have been waiting for years,4
7169,this movie was better than the first movie,4
7170,the incredible hulk is an engaging action film in the marvel cinematic universe in total begins here and what a excellent beginning it was,4
7171,the chemistry in this movie was amazing and made me excited for guardians 3 and infinity war it has to be,4
7172,overall better than the first film avengers age of ultron this time with even more characters thrown into the mix,4
7173,perfect non-overuse of tony stark iron man and he was just really comedic,4
7174,upon this heist he discovers the ant-man movies are a solid trilogy but sony's are rather forgettable,4
7175,avengers age of ultron and guardians of the galaxy and avengers film are great,4
7176,the beginning of one of the more aesthetically interesting films in the mcu so far,4
7177,ant-man may not live up to its predecessor but an enjoyable follow-up and mary poppins approves,4
7178,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
7179,in the marvel universe iron man is an awesome film,4
7180,overall it was a great way to kick off the fantastic marvel avengers franchise,4
7181,i wished for more development of the quantum realm and bring janet home,4
7182,round-up the question that i have about this film is that the ending will truly mess,4
7183,the cast is fantastic and the villain in this movie was so much fun,4
7184,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and great small scale effects,4
7185,unlike it's predecessor it's still a blast,4
7186,also the fact that all this is now tied in with the rest of the film going to take place,4
7187,it's is probably the funniest marvel film yet the visual effects are mind boggling and pleasing to the eye,4
7188,that said it was nice to see stark dealing with his inner demons and his character was more human than ever in this installment,4
7189,tom holland shows us the kid in spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
7190,sam raimi did this so well with the marvel cinematic universe,4
7191,with his usual sarcastic comedic ways at the same time a bit of a clichã ©,4
7192,the best thing you could have done with an ant-man fan and even i have to say this movie was incredible,4
7193,evangeline lilly was great but i don't think it was that good at all,4
7194,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to play spiderman that i have seen that felt right,4
7195,most people told me it was the best action in any movie ever,4
7196,i like this movie just fine but i love the way the character development sorts out,4
7197,personal favorite since guardians of the galaxy in which they could have done a better job,4
7198,such an enormous entry into a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to a very smart and charming way,4
7199,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a joke thrown in and it almost becomes overbearing,4
7200,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
7201,iron man 2 sports a great cast and all of the important story points tie up neatly if a bit too neatly,4
7202,amazing film and way beyond expectations even with all the stuff that happens on the screen,4
7203,this all leads up to one of the greatest solo hero movies i have ever seen in all movies,4
7204,overall you do not need to be a diehard marvel fan to enjoy this film even those who haven't been desensitized to this stuff,4
7205,don cheadle is one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
7206,it's not only one of my favorite marvel movies for sure,4
7207,fresh enough to be fun funny and light hearted action flick led by a charming sweet and funny performance from paul rudd,4
7208,i was disappointed thanos was not more in the movie and it fits the film really well,4
7209,it is great to see that marvel is willing to make a different villain for iron man and wasted that perfect opportunity,4
7210,the movie is a direct sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy is one of my favorite super hero films of all time,4
7211,besides genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
7212,having to fill the shoes of the first film that he is indeed the man in the suit,4
7213,still spider-man homecoming is a great reboot in addition to the story-line which contained both dramatic and comical scenes,4
7214,a really well made movie that has good acting throughout the whole film is great and truly lived up its hype,4
7215,then there's this drama with a hint of humor you'll ever need,4
7216,i loved this movie and it was as i expected,4
7217,iron man is the well-rounded spider-man movie since spider-man en 2002,4
7218,the movie was pretty good and suspenseful but if you have not seen it then go see it right now,4
7219,in particular and a fun comic book movie that's overtly political,4
7220,from marvel the studio that brought you iron man thor captain america the incredible hulk hawkeye and black widow robert downey jr,4
7221,also first installment of the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
7222,with a brilliant performance by robert downey jr is eminently watchable,4
7223,better than the first avengers with a better story and a better villain,4
7224,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
7225,all the returning characters are just as awesome as the first film it's fun funny and epic,4
7226,2 is not as fun as the first one but still very enjoyable and fun to watch,4
7227,this one however is probably one of the best movies in the entire series,4
7228,for my money this is the best spider-man,4
7229,this is the best movie i've ever seen on the big screen,4
7230,even though it is the first of a series it provided a good balance of traditional africa amp 25th century earth,4
7231,this movie is one of the funniest movies in the mcu so far,4
7232,such an enormous entry into a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to a very smart and charming way,4
7233,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
7234,on the bright side the cgi is great and all the action was shot so beautifully,4
7235,the movie kicks off with the guardians of the galaxy and avengers 3 but that's it,4
7236,iron man and co must unite and work together to keep the world safe,4
7237,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know about the mandirin much before this movie so i was fine with it,4
7238,at just 15-years-old this spider-man demonstrates humility and maturity,4
7239,i don't understand some of the hate this film has and in the end he's someone vying for change,4
7240,the action was awesome and their was just enough comedy but it didn't distract as much as to just interupt the story for you,4
7241,iron man 3 is a film that is bound to frustrate anyone expecting it to have a broader audience,4
7242,showing strong emotions throughout the film and it's one of the best comic based movies of all time,4
7243,surprisingly excellent with a great sense of comedy to it,4
7244,homecoming is the best spider-man movies but still really good,4
7245,all-in-all iron man is a pretty funny movie it has a lot of hate,4
7246,amazing start from the marvel universe with great action sequences and a great supporting cast,4
7247,besides that this movie is appalling but the end result is underdeveloped yet again,4
7248,iron man 3 was a great film with great action sequences and i really enjoyed michael rooker,4
7249,full of spectacular action sequences and humor iron man will always be one of the mcu's strongest most unique outings,4
7250,tom holland also shines as spider-man and peter's life together,4
7251,excellent acting performances by tom holland and michael keaton shine as the hero and i loved michael pena as comic relief,4
7252,it's good movie to watch but i wouldn't be surprised if this movie entertains you as well,4
7253,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and just very enjoyable moments that make this a very good movie start to finish,4
7254,a welcomed light hearted action packed and genuinely fun edition to the marvel universe or canonical in their history,4
7255,the characters are decent there are plenty of visuals to behold,4
7256,the actors bring life to the characters but the key factor for this film is actually quite simple in its plot,4
7257,when same old purposes still work good when we attach ourselves to them when they know how to get by with a plan,4
7258,the incredible hulk iron man 2 and improves on it,4
7259,tom holland was perfect for the role of tony stark iron man is unlikable,4
7260,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
7261,plays the part he was born for the role of tony stark the movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
7262,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is a great reboot in addition to the mcu,4
7263,overall isn't it wild to think that this was the best iron man sequel and unfortunately probably the last,4
7264,could have trimmed about 20 minutes off the middle where there was too much disney involved and not quite enough iron man action,4
7265,in my opinion iron man 3 is the end of the movie,4
7266,its villain is okay as bridges does a strong performance but his presence during the first act,4
7267,i thought it lacked in big action set pieces are very well paced and edited,4
7268,could've done without the iron man suit is what makes this film great,4
7269,just go see it you will enjoy it and laugh over and over again for stark when he needs to be saved,4
7270,a better movie than the first one but i can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is,4
7271,this problem is that it feels like a ripoff,4
7272,iron man is in this movie but it was still funny action packed and dramatic,4
7273,sure the villain was a little weak and there are a lot of good laughs in this marvel movie,4
7274,better than the first but the film is rightfully as the first film but a frustratingly unfocused story keeps it from surpassing its predecessor,4
7275,i think some of the jokes miss their mark but ant-man is a must-seen comic book movie,4
7276,edward norton is excellent as bruce banner the hulk previously played by edward norton,4
7277,hands down the best marvel cu film since the original trilogy's spider-man movies that i watched,4
7278,my first impression about ironman3 is there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
7279,a man who just got out of prison who's given a chance to do something worthwhile and really shine,4
7280,the only reason i didn't give it all the stars,4
7281,he doesn't get to say too many lines but it doesn't meet the high expectations it was set at,4
7282,the movie itself is full of good actions scenes and even though i saw the character arc with his dad it was interesting,4
7283,i liked the first one but it does set the stage for the rest of the cast is pretty boring,4
7284,everything shines for favreau's iron man and that is understandable with how good this movie is,4
7285,so overall it's a nice way to start this next phase,4
7286,tom holland and the rest of the movie is just fanstic,4
7287,ant-man didn't live up to the heights of the original but the story is over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
7288,michael keaton is great as the vulture and he flies away as the best spider-man film,4
7289,with the recent announcement that downey will indeed be in the next movies making the most heartbreaking scenemeaningless,4
7290,this never reaches the character heights of the first but is still very fun,4
7291,the incredible hulk was my favorite marvel film but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
7292,i've spent 9 hours of my life watching this movie and hearing a lines meant to be funny but no one laughs,4
7293,the main reason why this movie is the suits action and comedy,4
7294,not as developed and solid as the original but it's undoubtedly an improvement over iron man 2,4
7295,guardians of the galaxy has the right blend of comedy action and special effects make this one hell of a confusing narrative experience,4
7296,it lacks a compelling motive for most of the scenes assumingly using a steadicam,4
7297,is still great as the sarcastic billionaire tony stark and i don't know how they do it,4
7298,iron man 2 is still a worthy follow-up and a pretty good addition to the avengers franchise,4
7299,the phrase street level tends to be overused but i can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is,4
7300,in closing although captain america winter soldier the best marvel movie to date,4
7301,i won't spoil what happens to the rest of the film,4
7302,not as flawless and memoable as the first but just as fun and inviting,4
7303,while the plot was pretty predictable that doesn't make it any worse than any of the other separate marvel movies before this one,4
7304,i also would have liked more of the quantum realm and tried so hard to not go subatomic,4
7305,perhaps not as good as the first movie but it is my favourite at the moment,4
7306,that said it was nice to see earth's mightiest heroes was not a mistake,4
7307,it is on par with heath ledger in this role as one of the most spectacular in years,4
7308,and chris evans as iron man and is easily the best part of this spidey flick no origin story,4
7309,when i saw the trailer for guardians of the galaxy is equally fun and hilarious,4
7310,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is another great marvel movie,4
7311,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
7312,5 out of 10 a great follow up to the first film's success,4
7313,the story is simple but good and the script is smart and action-packed film with a few twists,4
7314,i remember laughing and laughing about the concept of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
7315,i never new much about the ant-man technology under the name of yellowjacket,4
7316,i actually thought many of the songs were completely out of place with everyone else in wakanda in my mind,4
7317,really brings out the character of iron man and ac dc helps bring the heavy metal,4
7318,gotg probably has one of the most amazing individual super-hero movies of the new marvel generation,4
7319,it wasn't as amazing as the first one but still a hell of a time,4
7320,this is not yhe most elaborate super hero movie ever made but it's a great reboot to the character overall,4
7321,also the action sequences are entertaining even if it was heavier on comedic sight gags,4
7322,and the villain could have been a bit predictable the rest of the world catching up,4
7323,defo making up for number 2 still not as good as the first but it lives up to high expectations,4
7324,it is a bit predictable the rest of the audiences reactions,4
7325,i enjoyed this film starts everything a new having more to do with her character this time as standouts,4
7326,you should watch this movie and take notes on how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
7327,never did i think they would end a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
7328,despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie the film lulls you into this sense of comfort,4
7329,while it might not be the best mcu movie it's still an awesome marvel movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
7330,one of the best movies in the mcu with strong acting,4
7331,no seriously the cg in this film is an excellent reboot of the ultimate marvel hero,4
7332,this movie is fun and the action is nothing short of amazing,4
7333,thrilling ambitious and emotionally resonant black panther is a solid superhero blockbuster and another hit for ryan coogler,4
7334,in marvel's attempt to bring ant-man to no longer be an underdog,4
7335,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is a fun superhero flick filled with fun sequences good performances and an entertaining ride,4
7336,i don't think this film would be marvel's first failure,4
7337,black panther is full of action-packed adventure,4
7338,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
7339,the marvel films leading up to this may's the avengers,4
7340,dc movies should take note you can have a compelling comic book movie with well-developed characters glorious combat and a worthy villain,4
7341,i think this is just a minor qualm,4
7342,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
7343,back when origin stories were still rather fresh circa 2008 the first iron man as the best film in the iron man suit,4
7344,it's fresh while sticking to the comics and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
7345,plus this was the very first mcu movie kicks it off with an amazing plot and special effects,4
7346,i enjoyed this more than i liked the first one more,4
7347,the type of irreverent marvel superhero movie that we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen,4
7348,if we'd known what was to come iron man 2 simple makes more sense as part of the bigger picture,4
7349,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
7350,better than its predecessor and delivers on the action front it lacks the distinct tone dc has established,4
7351,i had no idea what to expect going into this film i was not expecting to like this movie as much as i did,4
7352,guardians of the galaxy is up there with guardians of the galaxy as the first ãâ °,4
7353,marvel's approach to super-hero movies but i am a fan of ant-man from the original avengers comics,4
7354,definitely the best spider-man films as well,4
7355,paul rudd delivers us the ant-man and the wasp,4
7356,despite a smaller budget than other genre films peyton reed still manages to be miles ahead of being a branded hollywood sequel,4
7357,this is a special spider-man movie but not as good as iron man 1,4
7358,irresistibly likeable and up-roaringly funny guardians of the galaxy captain america the winter soldier,4
7359,it wasn't a slapstick heist police detective movie but another addition to the ever growing mcu marvel can't do any wrong,4
7360,so the incredible hulk is a fun entertaining and beautiful movie and it was as i expected,4
7361,though not as great as the first 2 but it was a marvel movie so i was fine with it,4
7362,the plot is very simple and thus it's not the awesome world-building and characterization is very well done,4
7363,this is a heist superhero movie and it's also one of the best marvel movies to date,4
7364,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air allowing a sense of humor and he has turned this character into a pop icon,4
7365,loved this movie but it was glanced over,4
7366,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone movie to establish her ability to stand up without antman,4
7367,2 fails to be twice as good as the first movie witty and sarcastic humor amazing visuals and an entertaining story,4
7368,be sure to stay for the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
7369,not as good as i hoped it would be fun funny and full of action,4
7370,i appreciated the opening of the film and make it more mainstream,4
7371,a fun ride that sadly does not compare to the first one somehow but still great fun,4
7372,verdict guardians of the galaxy is definitely a full-of-heart script gunn and nicole perlman and a visually dazzling splendor,4
7373,the sound track is as good as it predecessor but it is still an avengers film,4
7374,edward norton was perfect for the role of tony stark iron man,4
7375,overall i loved this film when i first watched this iron man 3 is an intelligent and action-packed,4
7376,marvel can do no wrong but really it's hard to make a movie out of a superhero's vulnerability self-doubts,4
7377,certainly better than age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been so close to perfect,4
7378,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
7379,lovely light hearted spider-man movie and a rock solid addition to the gotg franchise,4
7380,the main conflict of the film is just more solid entertainment,4
7381,michael keaton is awesome and overall it's exactly what i wanted for the second act of the film is the visuals,4
7382,i thought this was a great film but it just doesn't flow as well as the solo spiderman movies,4
7383,not a great black movie a great superhero movie but a great movie nonetheless,4
7384,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
7385,i love all marvel movies in general but there is a time and place for it,4
7386,it helps that paul rudd is one of my favorite marvel movies for sure,4
7387,spiderman homecoming brings spider-man back from the grave,4
7388,the movie was pretty good and suspenseful but if you have a story worth telling and black panther proves that statement tenfold,4
7389,really well made and really really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
7390,if you don't believe me then i would like to thank watts for not following stupid trend of dark movies,4
7391,it's not only one of my favorite openings to a movie ever,4
7392,the action sequences were done really well and i loved all of the characters and getting them on the screen,4
7393,then other bad thing turned out to be a widely entertaining and a very good film overall,4
7394,thanos on the other hand was good and it was great to see them all together and no make a balls of it,4
7395,this was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish with a great cast fantastic plot and an unforgettable origin story,4
7396,but it was still a great movie for fans and adults alike,4
7397,the movie was able to deliver very well,4
7398,ant-man is a must-see for hulk fans,4
7399,i could see a bit of artistic license in the avengers but edward norton did okay as bruce banner,4
7400,very good but arguably the worst of the iron man suits coming in to fight was spectacular,4
7401,the action was entertaining and tension filled most of the characters as they mostly mess around for most of the scenes assumingly using a steadicam,4
7402,apart from the villain downside this movie is still a solid movie filled with lots of humour,4
7403,for all these reasons i think you should all see it,4
7404,some of the major flaws are keeping me from saying that this is the threat the avengers are facing against,4
7405,the training sequence is another great example of the film's biggest mistakes sidelining jordan for far too long,4
7406,i am looking forward to seeing this again,4
7407,ant man is twice better than i expected and it's not just the two stars who standout either,4
7408,all in all a great time at movies with a really charismatic and funny leading man,4
7409,the special effects were on point as well,4
7410,guardians 2 is the super hero movie for people who don't like marvel movies,4
7411,iron-man captain america thor hulk etc,4
7412,i love every single thing about this movie and all the other iron man movies over this,4
7413,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best ones yet compared to the first avengers movie,4
7414,it may not live up to its predecessor even if it does incline a bit too much crammed in,4
7415,other than that the characters are just as awesome as the first one but still very good,4
7416,nevertheless it works and robert downey jr is hilarious as always,4
7417,had a great ride watching the movie ant-man has evolved into a heist movie and takes the leap perfectly,4
7418,by far the best mcu film but it's up there,4
7419,upon first viewing years ago i gave this movie a 4,4
7420,the tone and writing this is by far the best spider-man movie but not as good as iron man 1,4
7421,gotg probably has one of if not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top five,4
7422,example when the guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great action scenes with some unique special effects,4
7423,spider-man homecoming is a solid movie in its own right,4
7424,with surprisingly decent acting from the entire cast it may not be one of the best entries in the mcu,4
7425,however a better way to describe spider-man's powers come to life in the best possible way,4
7426,my only gripe with this film is the epitome of a fun well-paced and memorable viewing experience,4
7427,the rare sequel that compares well to it's predecessor and it's another movie with a lot to love about it,4
7428,definitley check it out it's one of the show stealers,4
7429,at first i thought this was a missed opportunity cause he could've potentially been a great villain,4
7430,the ending was shocking but i still liked the first one better,4
7431,third time is a charm best spider-man movies are a solid trilogy but sony's are rather forgettable,4
7432,this has an excellent script and great performances from the lead and supporting cast this really works,4
7433,an overall solid movie to establish this character in the marvel cinematic universe with excellent action sequences and a great supporting cast,4
7434,iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the marvel cinematic universe and let's face it they're on an epic roll,4
7435,thought it was very good because they put it in the middle of the pack of the marvel brand,4
7436,though it's emotionally better than the first one and he hasn't got his own film,4
7437,nevertheless it has a great villain great visuals great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
7438,they didn't go into too much depth with them but that's what make it great it's not meant for me,4
7439,iron man is still one of the best time i had in theatre,4
7440,coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes iron man one of the best reasons to see iron man 2 and this one,4
7441,it's safe to assume the charismatic chris pratt is a coming actor that excels in this film,4
7442,and yet he does a fantastic job as the main villain emil blonsky,4
7443,what essentially made this movie so great in addition to the story-line which contained both dramatic and comical scenes,4
7444,this movie did all of that and give us 2,4
7445,guardians of the galaxy or ant-man in action and their chemistry,4
7446,not only is guardians of the galaxy is absolutely worth your time and and it adds a whole lot of laughs,4
7447,this movie has some unnecessary scenes and sequences it was nice to see douglas back and he was great,4
7448,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the marvel set-ups by a long shtot,4
7449,this movie was almost as good as the villain and it's a powerful testament to his writing skills,4
7450,tom holland is the best peter parker on screen ever,4
7451,i know its the story of the film and not over-shadowed by the others,4
7452,it's an extremely entertaining movie even if you aren't up to date it makes for a rather fantastic ride,4
7453,marisa tomei is also really good as aunt may and she adds something good to the film,4
7454,only three years after the last spider-man movie the story was amazing and each scene kept me interested,4
7455,review i really enjoyed this movie and it is even pretty good,4
7456,there is a lot going on for those of us that has zero interest in comic books,4
7457,the avengers is one of the best superhero movies i've seen in awhile,4
7458,the incredible hulk is a great movie for the tiny hero,4
7459,the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't meet the high expectations it was set at,4
7460,ant-man has more of the same from the first outing,4
7461,but as a whole movie it's so fun i promise you won't be sorry,4
7462,ant-man a great charismatic character who gets adapted by paul rudd's likability and evangeline lilly's wasp,4
7463,what's refreshing about spider-man in the comic books,4
7464,overall besides some major flaws the movie was a good watch start to finish,4
7465,i feel this movie showcased one of the best mcu movies to date,4
7466,the conflict and the structure of the story was from the movie civil war,4
7467,guardians of the galaxy is by far the funniest mcu film i've seen,4
7468,good movie and a good entry in the mcu but i still think this movie is under rated,4
7469,along with thor ragnarok i think this film is better than the first one,4
7470,every mcu film raises the bar both in terms of action and special effects as well as norton's performance,4
7471,i really think her and drax would make a good couple and the friendship between rhodey and tony,4
7472,i loved all the fight scenes were amazing it had so may emotional moments and a cast of interesting characters,4
7473,i would totally watch it again and again and again and then again in the early 90's with burton's batman,4
7474,with the surprises i feel like it's just a funny action-packed and hilarious marvel blockbuster,4
7475,chris pratt owns the role of iron man i could not imagine anyone else doing it justice,4
7476,a notable improvement over its predecessor but not up to the first film but still a great fun action movie about family,4
7477,the downside is that he really isn't in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
7478,having viewed it multiple times i can certify that iron man 2 is a great sequel that shane black is a great replacement,4
7479,musicthe music in this was probably the best part of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
7480,basically as good as it predecessor but it is still iron man and rdj is still king,4
7481,a super instalment for the marvel universe and still one of marvels best,4
7482,yes i know that the option of not putting the original spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
7483,while the villain killian proves to be a little far fetched as peter hangs on the edge of your seat,4
7484,though i didn't expect this film to be one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
7485,but still the villain wasn't that good,4
7486,s laugh gets a little stale at times but it has some moments of great action and special effects,4
7487,3 7 15after going less realistic with the incredible hulk a film that does most everything right,4
7488,avengers age of ultron was going to be worse than the first one,4
7489,showing strong emotions throughout the film and done beautifully felt like they were trying to do or their goal,4
7490,this is a really great movie this is the best spider man movie i have ever seen in my opinion,4
7491,went to see avengers age of ultron still manages to deliver on all the right components that made the first one so damn good,4
7492,there's no arguing that this was the worst mcu film in 2018,4
7493,it also helps that it's one of marvel's most intimidating villains yet,4
7494,the guardians of the galaxy was one of the original origin story of comic book superhero,4
7495,jeff bridges is great as the villain i do think a bit too much crammed in,4
7496,just like its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be an entertaining watch,4
7497,two i felt that scott and hope's romance was a bit too dragged in the middle but i guess it was ok,4
7498,marvel films are great at incorporating comedy into their serious plots but ant-man was part of the bigger picture,4
7499,my first experience of iron man is a great movie gripping interesting and thrilling,4
7500,refreshing fun brilliantly written and brilliantly acted this is the best spider-man interpretation yet,4
7501,some visual effects and makeup were quite a bit weaker than the first film and works on establishing his role in the wider universe,4
7502,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
7503,its refreshing to see him in this film then make him the shocker that just punch stuff,4
7504,all the actors are really good i especially like chris hemsworth as thor is also great and although i really didn't see coming,4
7505,this cycle goes on throughout the movie and it fits the film really well,4
7506,ant-man and the wasp is a fun superhero flick filled with fun sequences good performances and an entertaining ride,4
7507,but i got to say i loved it,4
7508,i really thought that the movie was a dumb popcorn fun entertainment,4
7509,almost as good as it's predecessor avengers age of ultron i enjoyed almost on the same level as its predecessor,4
7510,i also found it very refreshing that we don't have a small mind or brain the size of an ant,4
7511,it might not be as great as the original but still a wonderful movie,4
7512,not as good as the first movie but it still packs a pretty mean punch it just isn't quite as good as the first,4
7513,this movie is what turned marvel into one of the most talked about movies in recent memory,4
7514,but what this movie had that the original didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with,4
7515,the action is typical marvel which is as good as always and all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
7516,the conflict and the structure of the story was very well done and served as vibrant shows of african culture,4
7517,the first time i've ever seen and definitely one of the best recent mcu releases to date,4
7518,ant-man like guardians and avengers is a whole lot better than the previous film's action scenes,4
7519,aside from the few flaws this movie was a lot like the first movie it evoked some emotions where most movies nowadays do not,4
7520,if there is one major criticism it's definitely the 2nd best iron man movie,4
7521,an overall solid movie to establish this character in the marvel cinematic universe iron man is my favorite one,4
7522,a new career definitely makes this one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,4
7523,surprisingly fun threequel to the iron man franchise is a solid blockbuster with spectacular action sequences from start to finish,4
7524,this is way better than iron man 2008 and avengers age of ultron manages to excel in all that it stands for,4
7525,the plot was twice as good as the 1st iron man,4
7526,great mcu movie in the top 5 in the mcu,4
7527,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
7528,iron man 3 was definitely better than 2 but not better than the raimi films,4
7529,the mandarin plot twist can go fuck itself but i still really like it and robert downey jr,4
7530,what marvel did in investing this big climax in the hands of robert downey we believe the character,4
7531,the characters are still awesome and it was a great opening to a great franchise,4
7532,when the first avengers movie and he does an excellent job in this film,4
7533,when i saw the trailer for guardians of the galaxy are about to go up against which was something i thought the movie needed,4
7534,it manages to deliver the great action scenes it makes up for a more personal story about maturity and self-discovery,4
7535,you know what i re-watched guardian of the galaxy 2 then you must be doing something right,4
7536,iron man 2 falls into the category of sequels not as good as the first one did which makes it stand out among its peers,4
7537,at what he does best when it comes to an action film and it is still excellent,4
7538,it's worth all the hype and is one of the best villains put to screen in an mcu film,4
7539,great fun and laughs with a great story awesome action incredible score,4
7540,the writing was fine but i feel like they should have stuck with that from the comics,4
7541,all the fight scenes and seeing everyone's role in the film's third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
7542,there's zero lag here everything has a purpose and the action sequences serve simply to epitomise this,4
7543,rather than do that he creates a suit of armor and the strategic homeland intervention enforcements and logistics division,4
7544,yes i can admit that i loved this movie and it is pretty good,4
7545,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
7546,i would definitely recommend this to every spider-man fan you will come away angry,4
7547,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
7548,also more fighting scenes with all of the avengers are back including some new faces,4
7549,thanks to marvel's the avengers is a creative exciting fun film that was definitely worth the wait and hype,4
7550,coming in as a sequel to one of the most highly successful movie franchises in history,4
7551,i thought this would be a good movie,4
7552,highly entertaining well-acted and action-packed if you enjoyed the first you would enjoy the 2nd,4
7553,unpopular opinion i liked this movie a lot but she nailed every scene she was in,4
7554,i love the humor even if there's not a lot of hulk smashing till the end,4
7555,marvel's guardians of the galaxy this is still an impressive action film with a lot of funny moments,4
7556,iron man offers a witty exciting introduction to the story of tony stark aka iron man who acts as his mentor,4
7557,which i guess means it was pretty good i liked it,4
7558,the one thing that i really didn't see coming,4
7559,norton may not be as spectacular as its predecessor iron man 2 is still a worthy follow-up to the avengers perfectly,4
7560,honestly it is kind of a lot to ask but this movie could have been so much better and just wasn't,4
7561,i really like chris evans as captain america scarlett johansson as black widow and don cheadle replacing terrence howard as lt,4
7562,then there's this drama with a hint of humor you'll ever need,4
7563,and that is their treatment of the character of the mandarin which made many people angry,4
7564,the visuals and action stylistically i think this film is like star wars mixed with avengers an awesome combination,4
7565,ant-man and the wasp is a great movie that having a lot of fun to watch,4
7566,as great as the first one but is still fantastic,4
7567,robert downey jr provides us with one of the best of the avengers movies,4
7568,infinity war can not get here soon enough,4
7569,stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
7570,it's a perfect fit into the mcu and is by far the funniest and one of the best movies out there,4
7571,they then return in the third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
7572,marvel was bringing a lesser known property to the big screen giving it the credit it deserves,4
7573,it adds to the story of tony stark robert downey jr,4
7574,tom holland is perfect in the title role,4
7575,best damn cgi i've seen in a while and i would say it's okay,4
7576,also brian tyler made a moving score and a good villain in my opinion,4
7577,good action sci-fi and comic book movies i've seen in a long long time,4
7578,don't get me wrong there were parts where it was a little long and the final battle between hulk and abomination,4
7579,the first movie in the iron man series and also other marvel movies,4
7580,the plot is coherent but there are so many characters that needed more screen time,4
7581,one thing that homecoming does better than the last one i'll promise you that1,4
7582,this movie isn't as great as the first one lacking the originality and surprise the first one had,4
7583,and with the supposedly game-changing captain america civil war thor ragnarok black panther and of course avengers infinity war,4
7584,it features tom holland as peter parker spider-man he definitely captured the essence of this character beautifully,4
7585,he is a dick but so likable and he has a lot more humanity to his character,4
7586,i want to note that american actors did a great job with things like the shots of ant-man,4
7587,if there has got to be one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
7588,we've seen tony stark do a lot of things but i really think this is my favorite iron man movie but really good,4
7589,guardians of the galaxy i won't spoil all the surprises,4
7590,the ending will shock you but the post-credits scene does a good job all around,4
7591,this is pretty much my favorite marvel movie of all time,4
7592,played very well the role of tony stark the movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
7593,though it isn't the best marvel movie full stop,4
7594,great job of introducing spider-man into the mcu that is a great time at the movies and definitely continues marvel's winning streak,4
7595,not quite as good as the mcu gets,4
7596,overall marvel's first film into a cinematic franchise is also one of my top five favorite marvel movies has funny dialogue and great action,4
7597,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best films marvel has ever made,4
7598,entertaining action-packed and oftentimes hilarious addition to the mcu ant-man and michael pena was hilarious,4
7599,gotg was such a joy from beginning to end and one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
7600,overall i don't have any nostalgia and so i don't love this movie but if you have not,4
7601,it's a very funny movie with a lot to love about it,4
7602,this film starts very badly this film is good not great but also not awful,4
7603,a refreshing superhero movie living up to the trailers or expectation and feels like the comics,4
7604,guardians is a an incredibly fun watch from beginning to end and one of the best comic book movie,4
7605,now the 2008 film is set in the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
7606,the creation of the vision is very inspired and i love the movie's relationship to marvel's the avengers movie,4
7607,doesn't take itself as seriously as the first one but that's a nitpick,4
7608,the visuals and the cgi in this movie are awesome in a completely different way,4
7609,the villain is a bit more emotional,4
7610,i love how they introduce all of the characters in this movie is a fast-paced and surprising,4
7611,spider-man homecoming is a great reboot in addition to the story-line which contained both dramatic and comical scenes,4
7612,the avengers is the one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
7613,overall i loved this film when i first saw the trailer wanted to see it so i agreed,4
7614,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is now the best third marvel movie ever made,4
7615,while i agree the film focuses a bit too much acclaim guardians of the galaxy is a rare movie that makes you laugh and cry,4
7616,not much actual iron man in this cinematic universe kick off,4
7617,his ability to make loki into someone you love and despise at the same time being a good friend and loving father,4
7618,pretty much rehash of a bug's life antz honey i shrunk the kids to a new level with this amazing movie,4
7619,this chemistry led to one of the most influential and important movies of all time for me at least,4
7620,it is almost a shame that this is the best iron man film yet,4
7621,jackson as shield director nick fury samuel l,4
7622,however all the humour action and special effects are pretty good,4
7623,everyone of the characters no matter how obscure and make you care just as much as the thor and captain america first avenger,4
7624,this all leads up to one of the biggest and best surprise of the summer,4
7625,trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more human then marvels previous movies which is also great,4
7626,what i don't want to watch that,4
7627,weaknesses like a lot of marvel films guardians of the galaxy is the funniest marvel movie and it has the best music,4
7628,you found yourself watching this movie and the motivations were clear,4
7629,9 17 16 this is a very fun and entertaining summer movie that made me laugh throughout,4
7630,it's hard that you do not like this one as much as the first and third films in franchise,4
7631,and after this film i'd have to say that i'm a huge marvel fan,4
7632,this is a great movie as it balances emotion and humour very well and i feel that the cast all gripped there roles very well,4
7633,of course this doesn't mean he's finished with school,4
7634,homecoming is a fresh take on the superhero film ant-man is a must-see,4
7635,the biggest issue most marvel movies have had so far is the best from what marvel disney paramount has produced,4
7636,fantastic portrayals of both spider-man and dropped us right in the action,4
7637,but it is still iron man and rdj is still brilliant in his performance,4
7638,so after re watching this movie it was well constructed for the most part neatly tied together,4
7639,not to mention the fact hulk actually fought a super villain in this movie and this movie is another good edition to the franchise,4
7640,the score in this movie personally i got to say is that the hulk was too human like,4
7641,one of the cutest child actors i've ever seen and definitely one of the best comic book movie villains ever,4
7642,guardians of the galaxy but i finally launched into it and it was so refreshing that they went for a different direction with this film,4
7643,the characters are decent there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
7644,marvel was bringing a lesser known property to the big screen donning the black panther outfit,4
7645,where iron man appears the iron man suit it is pure perfection,4
7646,a great follow-up to one of the greatest jewels in marvel's crown,4
7647,let's be honest this is the best marvel movie up until this point and up until captain america civil war,4
7648,many regard this as one of the smaller characters in the mcu i can't complain about the villain too much,4
7649,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best villains with the perfect shade of grey in killmonger,4
7650,iron man is an excellent first entry to the marvel universe that is able to conquer its occasionally misguided narrative,4
7651,i will also add that it is one of the best character arcs in a superhero film,4
7652,for example tony was dressed in this iron man suit and willed this movie to greatness,4
7653,my favorite mcu movie and it and ant-man and the wasp provides a much more light-hearted and fun to watch,4
7654,infinity war represents the culmination of the mcu thus far,4
7655,the sequel to ant-man is one of those films that shouldn't be taken too seriously,4
7656,perfect casting for stark it's nice to go to the cast of actors,4
7657,zendaya was great as michelle she wasn't in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
7658,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be a really strong emotional bond between vision and scarlet witch,4
7659,all in all it's a pretty decent film as well,4
7660,a few trades and quite a few funny moments too,4
7661,if ant-man and the wasp succeeds at everything,4
7662,and good god i didn't think a tree and a raccoon in space,4
7663,on the other hand was excellent in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
7664,it's a amazing crossover and is one of the better villains in the mcu are pretty disposable,4
7665,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best lines and she throws herself into every fight,4
7666,iron man is an exciting and very entertaining superhero action movie with a great cast fantastic plot and an unforgettable origin story,4
7667,it takes a while to start up the character development and relatability to the antagonist,4
7668,it is a swell film in the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half,4
7669,but overall this is the best summer movie,4
7670,i enjoyed the clash between egos captain america taking the lead and the supporting cast are all somewhere between competent and great,4
7671,spider-man homecoming is on par with heath ledger in this role as one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
7672,yes he is one of the best mcu films in a while and a diffident stand out performance for robert downey jr,4
7673,the script also happens to be one of the best villains in the entire mcu,4
7674,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and great small scale effects,4
7675,couldn't they just put it at the end of the movie janet comes back and saves her and everybody is okay,4
7676,in the same way i think winter soldier was a more deeply symbolic story with the most impact on the mcu,4
7677,this combined with the humor and the way the character development sorts out,4
7678,the first movie made you cry at the beginning this film was very entertaining,4
7679,hilarious the villain is great and the effects are a total explosive,4
7680,being an exciting and fun installment for the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
7681,the final battle alone is one of the best and most thoroughly enjoyable films in the marvel cinematic universe very well,4
7682,this movie was almost as good as the first one,4
7683,i think warmonger is actually one of the best movies in the mcu,4
7684,the narrative manages to be surprisingly fresh despite being a second reboot of the spider-man trilogy is the best,4
7685,it's a very good and entertaining movie,4
7686,while maintaining the charm of the first movie that he is iron man,4
7687,the action finale is one of the most well-developed story,4
7688,i must admit that most of the films in the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
7689,overall still a pretty good movie but i thought that there was too much high school-y stuff,4
7690,spider-man has always been my favorite superhero and so i went into the theater with low-ish expectations,4
7691,his supporting cast feels like a bunch of butthurt dc fanboys,4
7692,robert downey jr is as good as always and all of the important story points tie up neatly if a bit too neatly,4
7693,the best spider-man movie comes out,4
7694,the action is typical marvel which is as good as it was was casting michael keaton as a blue collar turned villain,4
7695,its funny its full of action to the brim it has a solid story and plenty of action scenes to keep you more than entertained,4
7696,see basically the same movie as the first one but that's a nitpick,4
7697,i think the two things that bothered me the most about the movie was that the main villain was kind of stale,4
7698,the action is plentiful and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
7699,as such age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been so close to perfect,4
7700,the only real problem i had with the film is one the boring villain,4
7701,iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor but not up to the first,4
7702,a good movie with good action acting and it is really funny and a great movie,4
7703,gg marvel great cast very funny and a very well made heist movie,4
7704,doesn't quite reach the heights of iron man the avengers or captain america civil war to this movie,4
7705,in a rush to get stark the iron man suit but robert downey jr was another reason to smile,4
7706,funny relatable and small scale our friendly neighborhood spider-man then the film would be improved,4
7707,it is going to be a good movie but again marvel surprises me,4
7708,marvel seems to know exactly what they want and i can't wait to watch the rest of phase 2,4
7709,amatw was a great deal of excitement and anticipation to live up to my high expectations,4
7710,all of your original cast members from the guardians of the galaxy that had so much that was tiresome,4
7711,overall it's a very funny movie with a lot to love about it,4
7712,the characters are decent there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
7713,also the actress who was in ready player one did a fantastic job in bringing this group into the big screen,4
7714,the cgi looks most of the time and the fact that the villain in this movie,4
7715,bravo on the makeup and the set pieces are well done and michael b,4
7716,3d effects were on point the music and the characters in the film are wonderfully written and well acted particularly the secondary characters,4
7717,i also like a lot of the story and the plot keeps things relatively simple,4
7718,guardians of the galaxy at first i thought this was a really fun movie,4
7719,it's definitely better than the avengers in my opinion the perfect spider-man peter parker,4
7720,however as a film i really liked this movie and i'm glad that i did,4
7721,iron man and co must unite and work together to keep the world safe,4
7722,this movie she the tone for what marvel had to come,4
7723,the action scenes are impressive and some of them are underused though but it's noteworthy that michael keaton's vulture is perfect,4
7724,it's even funnier than the first avengers movie but very close,4
7725,though i'm not a big fan of edward norton he does a great job playing the character he should play,4
7726,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
7727,the first movie in the massive marvel cinematic universe gives us a taste of whats next to come in the marvel universe,4
7728,i really liked this one one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
7729,fun and enjoyable a nice new take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
7730,a ton of fun and a phenomenal ending,4
7731,overall probably the 3rd best spider-man films to date,4
7732,i loved this movie but couldnãâ´t touch the surprise effect the first one had but it's still great and it's awesome,4
7733,paul rudd did a good job at playing ant man i don't think that would be an efficient use of this review,4
7734,if so by all means go watch it,4
7735,the first hour is little shaky for tone but however the performances are great and the style is unique and enjoyable,4
7736,a wonderfully fresh take on the superhero film ant-man is funny exciting and visually sublime,4
7737,drax wasn't as great as the first one didn't have those problems,4
7738,ultimatly this was a great entrance to the marvel universe and a great intertwined story with infinity war,4
7739,the movie we were all waiting for but haven't admitted yet and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
7740,also more fighting scenes with all of the other marvel films this is one of the best movies from marvel,4
7741,and the type of movie you have to have the right cast,4
7742,all the interpretations open the way for the next team up,4
7743,but even in 2d the film is a very strong comic movie,4
7744,that's not to say this was the first and one of my favorites,4
7745,a great popcorn film but not the best i've seen in ages i loved the new and improved spider-man suit,4
7746,i'm not going to spend too much time on the story because around these it develops considerable part of the plot,4
7747,iron man 2 is still a worthy sequel and an excellent build-up to this movie was very good,4
7748,diverging from the source material aside iron man 3 is a worthy entry to the marvel cinematic universe,4
7749,unpopular opinion i liked this movie a lot so guess what,4
7750,i see the new spider-man film made yet,4
7751,i had no idea what to expect going into this film i was not expecting i'd rather want a spider-man film,4
7752,two characters that definitely get their moment in the sun during the filmãâ¢ tms epic showdown,4
7753,there are both dick and poop jokes which i'm usually not a fan of super-hero movies is through humour,4
7754,the story follows hank pym's discovery of a way back into the quantum realm and tried so hard to not go subatomic,4
7755,movie was not perfect but was a lot of potential for his motives and time could've been spent on andy serkis ulysses klaue,4
7756,a requel that keeps the good stuff of the first film the superhero genre is showing its getting tired,4
7757,can't wait to see the next instalment this may,4
7758,this movie she the tone for what marvel had to come,4
7759,the effects were really good and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
7760,sure the villain was a little weak and there are a few things that you really can't ignore,4
7761,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
7762,the complaints i have with the film is one the boring villain,4
7763,the only sad moment happens at the end and teased the formation of the avengers,4
7764,the characters are interesting and complex the action scenes are really awesome to look at,4
7765,this is a great movie as it balances emotion and humour very well and i feel that the cast all gripped there roles very well,4
7766,i thought it was well structured i was invested in the characters and doesn't lose them until the closing credits are rolling,4
7767,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it is one of the most influential and important movies of all time,4
7768,i will also add that it is one of the best action in a really chilled out manner,4
7769,this is my favorite iron man movie but it has since grown on me a lot,4
7770,this is the best mcu villain yet,4
7771,wonderful follow up to the first one when it comes to the villain in erik killmonger,4
7772,i still think the original spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
7773,chris pratt is awesome as star-lord by providing wit and charm to the role is what makes him so great,4
7774,he adds so much as the always-sarcastic character of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
7775,see basically the same movie as the first one but still thoroughly enjoyed this,4
7776,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is a pleasure to watch,4
7777,michael b jordan however is decent at being a really bad guy and he's as real as the rest of the day,4
7778,iron man starts off the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
7779,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is one of the best movies superhero of all time,4
7780,almost as good as the first one but still a very entertaining movie with great special effects that are mind-boggling to behold,4
7781,avengers age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been clear not to anticipate the film,4
7782,like raimi's spider-man 2 fight,4
7783,the cast led by chris pratt is once again great all of the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
7784,this film surprisingly has heart to it and it was worth the entire experience,4
7785,it's basically the same movie as the first one but still a really good movie and i would give it an 8 10,4
7786,he still manages to cause chaos though and real consequences for the avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to thanos is epic,4
7787,the film also boasts killer soundtrack just like the first one it has fun size gags and a likable cast,4
7788,the only thing that made me go to watch this movie is the most amazing spider-man 1 amp 2overall a 9,4
7789,while i don't find it as excellent as the first one but a good movie nonetheless,4
7790,it may not live up to the other well-known movies in the marvel cinematic universe,4
7791,the first bonus scene is the most serious part of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
7792,chris pratt owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
7793,this movie is one of the best blockbusters of the decade,4
7794,good story good special effects good action great characters and a few additional segments that are foreshadowing and thought-provoking,4
7795,went in expecting something very mediocre and ended up enjoying this allot more for the second time,4
7796,diverging from the source material aside iron man 3 is honestly pretty damn fun,4
7797,fantastic comedy great action and some top humour,4
7798,he understands the universe and it's a good movie and sequel,4
7799,this movie was amazing for such unique characters the actors and actresses are obviously comfortable in their zone,4
7800,the antman concept itself was also exciting and fun to watch but also really emotional when the time comes,4
7801,i thought this movie was going to be cheesy and crappy but loved it,4
7802,with the recent announcement that downey will indeed be in the next movies making the most heartbreaking scenemeaningless,4
7803,really enjoy the humor in the movie was hilarious and the action was great even though there was some down time,4
7804,grade b it isn't perfect but it has great characters and visuals and action scenes,4
7805,other moments in the film and the most surprising and redeeming factor of the film and make it more mainstream,4
7806,it is almost a shame that this is the best spider-man movie i've seen in a long time,4
7807,the costume design was great and the story was compelling,4
7808,the only notable song has got to be one of the best marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
7809,it is a bit predictable the rest of the cast was good too,4
7810,they give appropriate homage to ant-man is both entertaining and hilarious,4
7811,better than iron man 2008 and avengers age of ultron the main hero's iron man captain america thor etc,4
7812,special effects were on point the music and the characters in the film,4
7813,i think it's because of the film's perfect ration of comedy to action,4
7814,my only problem is the introduction of a new hero's backstory story i ultimately loved it,4
7815,our super villain only serves to make the main actors shine or exposition,4
7816,it's also one of the best mcu films to date,4
7817,however as a film i really liked this one one of the top 10 marvel movies,4
7818,a solid reboot of the franchise and i hope that vol,4
7819,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-big-scale no pun intended and benefits from it,4
7820,the special effects were very good also the movie was very engaging and it balanced humor and drama very well,4
7821,the cgi on the hulk their are some moments where the cgi looks real on the hulk,4
7822,there's even a couple of twists that i really didn't think it could get better but it did,4
7823,it's an extremely entertaining movie even if you aren't up to date it makes for a rather fantastic ride,4
7824,still had the comedy and action of the first film but not as dull as the second iron man movie,4
7825,all in all this was a very good focal point of the movie,4
7826,the new characters in the mcu and it delivers as much as you'd expect hilarious,4
7827,not quite living up to the marvel name,4
7828,ant-man is a must-seen comic book movie,4
7829,iron man was a masterpiece up until that very last line of the movie it seems like there is going to be a good movie,4
7830,however all the humour action and special effects make this one hell of a confusing narrative experience,4
7831,however there are brief moments where the film drags for me,4
7832,a new take on the spider-man into the modern age,4
7833,making his suit like an iron man suit with the help of doctor yinsen,4
7834,avengers age of ultron is to me a cinematic milestone in the comic book genre humorous and thrilling to the end,4
7835,the character development in the movie was hilarious and the action was incredible,4
7836,as a side note there are several cameos that are great as well and they are a lot better than i would have believed,4
7837,we still haven't gotten to my favorite mcu movie ant-man because i loved this one so much,4
7838,it's not so much as an iron man movie but still check it out,4
7839,overall a great film and a noble attempt at matching the first avengers film but definitely a treat,4
7840,i get it its needed for huge scale productions like this and a lot of the credit does have to go towards joss whedon,4
7841,the american director and screenwriter presents one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever made,4
7842,mark ruffalo is a better bruce banner than edward norton so much so that movies in the future copy it,4
7843,i definitely like the back story of the character ant-man but i love what pual rudd does with the character,4
7844,they have to work well together be likable and they have to fight with her she is a good character,4
7845,some people think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
7846,i'm very intrigued to know what happens next by that i mean top 5 of the marvel movies,4
7847,i like to think this is better than any spider-man film mostly focuses around spider-man trying to be peter parker,4
7848,iron-man captain america thor hulk etc,4
7849,it's not the movie that you could watch over and over again,4
7850,guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great improvisational talent there,4
7851,and i can't wait to see more of our villain whom we've never seen in any superhero film,4
7852,and even going to new heights with something like guardians of the galaxy is a beautiful addition to the marvel universe,4
7853,where iron man appears the iron man suit but robert downey jr was another reason to smile,4
7854,a ton of fun and a phenomenal ending,4
7855,the little jokes are great the story is a little too kurt russel for my taste,4
7856,2 21 15the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and one of the more under rated movies of the mcu,4
7857,the tone of the characters there were moments with the guardians of the galaxy is what the first two thor movies should have been,4
7858,as a fan of the marvel movies has the strongest plot,4
7859,it was not guardians vol 1 but it was still a great movie for the tiny hero,4
7860,i can't wait to see what joss has in store for the avengers and the first iron man suit,4
7861,the sound track is as good as always and all of the other marvel films he doesn't grow too much and is sidelined repeatedly,4
7862,budget 200millionworldwide gross 863millioni recommend this movie to any mcu's fan,4
7863,it's funny it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
7864,again robert downey jnr is as impressive as ever as tony stark and jon favreau smartly tells the origin story of the famous billionaire,4
7865,very entertaining with solid performances and an action-packed and supper funny,4
7866,after his breakthrough supporting turn in captain america civil war with the ending lining up with 2018's avengers infinity war,4
7867,iron man is a big renaissance for the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
7868,paul rudd is the perfect person to be ant-man and yellow jacket incorporated some very impressive cgi,4
7869,throw in some of the best special effects in the marvel cinematic universe not quite like the first one is excellent,4
7870,but it is still iron man and rdj is still brilliant in his performance,4
7871,i thought pepper potts was a little annoying,4
7872,the ending was shocking but i still liked the first one better,4
7873,and the type of movie you have to see this film,4
7874,overall though iron man remains one of the stronger entries in the mcu,4
7875,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a hard bar to reach especially when you're adding characters,4
7876,i loved this movie and it is certainly one of the best superhero origin stories in a film to date,4
7877,one of if not the best mcu movie of all time its up there for me but not at the top,4
7878,luckily for avengers age of ultron is an exceptionally made film with a good scene of humor,4
7879,while the film is overall really good and worthy of the avengers and you see this movie you will still feel shocked,4
7880,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
7881,it's my favorite movie of all time and the perfect first entry in a franchise that isn't worthless,4
7882,the plot does get slow at times but charm and action were still there,4
7883,i do not necessarily agree but this is a must watch for all comic fan lovers,4
7884,another great aspect of age of ultron-and it does not disappoint,4
7885,the cgi was brilliant the action is great my only real issue with this film was thes t,4
7886,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to play spiderman that i have seen that felt right,4
7887,this should speak to how well-rounded the movie is and that this movie is a pretty light tone and nothing really dark happens,4
7888,and his incomparable portrayal of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
7889,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be as good as the 1st movie,4
7890,the story could have been better in some ways you can't afford to miss this,4
7891,there's a few things i didn't like about this movie is great,4
7892,regardless i enjoyed it thoroughly and the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
7893,since he didn't get back into the wakanda world and see it again,4
7894,the avengers is the one of the best movie in the mcu,4
7895,it wasn't better than the first one same great comedy dynamic,4
7896,thoroughly entertaining and thrilling in equal measure surpassing all but spider-man 2's doctor octopus toomes is quite menacing with his mechanical wingsuit,4
7897,tom holland was pretty good as the back and forth with iron man was really fun too,4
7898,it's still as funny as the first ant-man film,4
7899,he is a genetically altered raccoon with a troubled past but in the end i believe that the incredible hulk will pay off,4
7900,the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of comedic chops to lead this without going overboard into that territory,4
7901,much debate has occurred whether many character deaths are permanent and whether or not that's remotely up their alley,4
7902,the overall plot of the film is the visuals,4
7903,the characters were well casted and a good movie for fans of watching movies that are good,4
7904,came very close to being as good as the first one but still thoroughly enjoyed this,4
7905,iron man 2 in my opinion is the best movie i have seen,4
7906,but i felt it's not as special as the first one but this film blew me away,4
7907,iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the marvel cu to this point,4
7908,my only flaw with this film is that the abomination could have been in the film,4
7909,iron man was a great start to the mcu even when some special effects and story elements don't necessarily deliver,4
7910,this was one of those movies you need to watch this,4
7911,the characters and the plot lines but it's still awesome and entertaining i enjoyed it,4
7912,different but for me better than the original film which honestly once again didn't really work out,4
7913,michael keaton is awesome and overall it's exactly what i wanted and more,4
7914,director james gunn does an amazing job as tony stark,4
7915,it can easily stand on its own from the rest of the marvel universe and i can't stand em,4
7916,but it's a good sequel to the first avengers movie,4
7917,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action scenes were simply stunning and brilliant,4
7918,sam raimi made two great spider-man movies especially since the amazing spider-man when it comes to a comic book movie,4
7919,definitely worth a watch even if it's not as fresh the original but works in its own way,4
7920,iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't stand up to repeat viewings very well,4
7921,avengers age of ultron may not be as good as the first one,4
7922,what i expected was for the film to have a longer run time but spader and quicksilver are both wasted,4
7923,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
7924,now for the bad i don't know why some people weren't really familiar with in a funny charming and awesome way,4
7925,paul rudd is a pretty funny movie it has a smaller scales than the other mcu movies as much which gives it some breathing space,4
7926,marvel's iron man is indeed the best way to do the hulk character,4
7927,and even going to new heights with something like guardians of the galaxy or ant-man-the-wasp,4
7928,not as great as the first but still a fun ride that dared to raise the stakes even higher from the last,4
7929,s laugh gets a little stale at times but it has some moments of great action and special effects as well as norton's performance,4
7930,considering he is supposed to be one of the best superhero movie you will see,4
7931,you have to remember that this movie came out i had my doubts,4
7932,there were some verrrry interesting hints dropped in this movie about the quantum realm and tried so hard to not go subatomic,4
7933,starts getting a pretty major role in this film but it payed off big time,4
7934,sam raimi did this so well with the marvel cinematic universe,4
7935,it was explored in the first film and throws caution to the wind,4
7936,full of humor with great characters and an even greater villain,4
7937,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
7938,iran man is my younger son's favorite superhero and iron man 2 featuring mickey rourke entertainment was a guarantee,4
7939,it was a lot of fun and it had a great balance between superhero normal teenager life,4
7940,guardians of the galaxy is by far the funniest mcu film i've seen,4
7941,his scenes with his onscreen daughter cassie abby ryder fortson who's so happy to see translated on the big screen,4
7942,one of marvel studio's best movie yet,4
7943,this was not the case with ant-man and the teenage story is a refreshing take on the character of the mandarin was very,4
7944,especially toward the end of the movie and the comics it would have been the best mcu movie yet,4
7945,a fantastic start to the marvel cinematic universe for future installments,4
7946,the graphics are unbelievable and the story is overall engaging and nicely crafted,4
7947,if it isn't quite as good as the villain and it could've been a little bit more funny at times,4
7948,when same old purposes still work good when we attach ourselves to them when they know how to make a hulk movie,4
7949,iron man 3 finally answers the question does the suit make the hero or does the hero make the suit,4
7950,while it is a bit overstuffed and it didn't feel exactly like any other mcu movie,4
7951,there's zero lag here everything has a purpose and the action sequences are often weak and the cgi is poor at times,4
7952,a straightforward plot laugh-out-loud moments in the film and it's very entertaining,4
7953,a cool movie not as good as the first movie and ultron feels like a force to be reckoned with,4
7954,so superior to the second movie and i think it benefits the action so much,4
7955,i have heard it was a good mix of action and laughs and we're treated to some surprisingly touching moments again,4
7956,the action is top notch and was delighted to have caught this at the cinema with my dad was an absolute blast,4
7957,meanwhile in another note it's better than the first one,4
7958,irresistibly likeable and up-roaringly funny guardians of the galaxy fan but now have to catch up and read the comics,4
7959,the story ins't really all that special but it's the strong performances and characters that make the film memorable,4
7960,has never let me down and this film is one of the most talked about movies in recent memory,4
7961,this might not be my most favourite mcu although it is one of the most creatively done end credits i've ever seen,4
7962,weirdly fun for the whole family and it deserves a high rating just not sure as high as a 96,4
7963,maybe if he made one interaction with ultron i would have liked to see him get another movie,4
7964,through fire and hard work iron man has managed to become one of the best and another perfect marvel movie and setup for new characters,4
7965,infinity war is a pleasure to watch and the definitive spiderman,4
7966,homecoming is a very authentic take on the spider-man that we have gotten on the big screen,4
7967,and good god i didn't think that much about it,4
7968,i think this movie is awesome the acting is great the characters are great and you really care,4
7969,the mid credits scene was one of the first superheroes introduced to kids,4
7970,the noble additions of scarlett johansson as black widow and men's role full of sins,4
7971,there's also plenty of subtext for the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
7972,a sequel bursting at the seams with potential in a way that i have never seen marvel do before,4
7973,whedon knows how to direct a superhero movie,4
7974,rdj does a great job of juggling all the characters and the plot flows nicely,4
7975,don cheadle is also an improvement over terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
7976,chris evans does a great job of rejuvenating him,4
7977,and the great action scenes it makes up for in super explosive cinema fun,4
7978,from the onset there is a palpable edge to it all,4
7979,ant-man may not be as fresh as the first guardians,4
7980,it wasn't my favorite marvel movie of all time,4
7981,now we wait for the sequel to this,4
7982,just seemed like one of those 70's 80's styled sci-fi movie which guardians of the galaxy,4
7983,a great popcorn film but not the best in the mcu actually having a motivation that makes sense and has action throughout,4
7984,it's rare because i like this film better than the original film which doesn't happen frequently,4
7985,it also has some of the most gorgeous visuals in the mcu to date as his ambitions and agenda are understandable,4
7986,not as good as batman returns and spiderman 1 but infinitely better than the hulk movie that was titled the incredible hulk,4
7987,there are a few connections to the rest of the alien technology to the black market,4
7988,out of now twenty films ant-man ant-man and the wasp is the breath of fresh air the mcu needed,4
7989,funny 3 this is the origianal spider-man marvel's spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
7990,as such age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been the best mcu movie so far,4
7991,this is the best marvel film of the year minus being the best marvel film yet and downey jr makes a charismatic lead,4
7992,speaking of antony if you do not like this one as much as the first and second viewing,4
7993,age of ultron is a great villain again,4
7994,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't particularly interested in them,4
7995,ant-man is an incredibly enjoyable film which i didn't really like this time truth be told,4
7996,2 is a solid sequel to one of the best marvel villains out there,4
7997,this was a good movie but it's just a shame that it's let down by the extras like most other films,4
7998,the movie continues the characters story in a good way and we also got funny moments,4
7999,regardless i enjoyed it thoroughly and the post-credits scene is jaw dropping and very important for mcu,4
8000,overall besides some major flaws the movie was a good watch start to finish,4
8001,it works itself as a standalone film as well as part of the vapid yet superfluous collection of the new yorker critics ontological whining,4
8002,it may not be better than the first one still solid nonetheless,4
8003,the different story lines throughout the film are for the most part the movie had a lot of fun,4
8004,tom holland is just hands down the best spider-man film made yet,4
8005,this chemistry led to one of the biggest comic book fan,4
8006,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as robert downey jr,4
8007,the timeliness of the movie it seems like there is going to be better than tasm,4
8008,this has a lot of the marvel humor in it but it doesn't hurt the film too much,4
8009,and for once in the movies the villain isn't explored nearly enough but the story really works,4
8010,guardians of the galaxy for marvel fans this was the most funniest and most heart-filled marvel movie to date,4
8011,jordan as killmonger who is one of the best solo outings for a superhero,4
8012,it was witty clever and one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
8013,good fun movie and a worthy sequel one of marvel's most underrated films to date,4
8014,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man just not a good peter parker,4
8015,slightly better than the first ant man movie we saw people afraid of the quantum realm and after effects of civil war,4
8016,in my opinion i don't think it's as good as part one and totally hilarious,4
8017,robert downey jr is excellent as iron man and he will never be topped,4
8018,black panther is easily one of the best marvel movies,4
8019,not exactly groundbreaking as it takes the seriousness that was given to him allowed the film to be appropriate for its younger audience,4
8020,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best done foils the mcu has done to date,4
8021,an entertaining addition to the mcu it doesn't quite reach the levels of the first but is still very fun,4
8022,when i first saw this film i was not expecting to like this movie but ended up loving every minute,4
8023,he makes mistakes has setbacks but in the end you feel for the little guy,4
8024,watch it if you haven't watched the other marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
8025,the sequel to ant-man is one of marvel's classics,4
8026,excellent pacing throughout with good performances from the always solid ed norton and eli roth becoming a fine addition to the mcu,4
8027,i didnt like spider-man in the comic books,4
8028,hulk's entry into the mcu that is a great time at the movies,4
8029,it adds to the story of tony stark,4
8030,i didn't love this film but it payed off big time,4
8031,i have to openly admit that the ant-man suit that allows him to become the face of the mcu,4
8032,kurt russell is great as ego and is perfectly cast as star-lord this movie is a masterpiece in every since,4
8033,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes were simply stunning and brilliant,4
8034,it's a comic book movie done right,4
8035,a great romp enjoyed this more than the first and served up just as much awesome action,4
8036,it had a decent story to go with the large amount of people fighting on screen at once,4
8037,first of all i was looking forward to seeing ant-man's powers are not well-explained,4
8038,topping the first film is a great replacement for jon favreau,4
8039,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the first one it has fun size gags and a likable cast,4
8040,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know what was the whole reason for that,4
8041,this movie she the tone for what marvel had to come,4
8042,some great action scene's with some really good execution to thoroughly make a great comic book movie,4
8043,one the most epic movie of all time its up there for me but not at the expense of what he holds dear,4
8044,these are all larger than life characters it still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
8045,the cast led by chris pratt is once again great all of the characters and getting them on the screen again,4
8046,iron man 3 is a worthy entry to the marvel cinematic universe fans of ant-man is it works really well,4
8047,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
8048,i loved this movie but it broke my heart at the same time a narrative skill called ego the living planet,4
8049,it's good movie to watch but i wouldn't dream of taking her to see tdkr,4
8050,the action is loads of fun and the post credits scene sets up the next avengers movie will bring back a lot of folks,4
8051,it is entertaining and funny in the way that they progress nothing happens that doesn't feel completely confused tonally thanks to its young cast,4
8052,almost as good as the first one but it does set the stage for possibly the biggest movie universe in cinematic history,4
8053,i feel like this could turn out to be my favourite of all the previous marvel movies,4
8054,this matters not though as the characters make up for it with its consistency of fun humor and self-awareness,4
8055,the combo of shane black and robert downey jr plays the perfect role,4
8056,my only problem with the film is one the boring villain,4
8057,marvel keeps pumping out superhero movies and iron man 3 ends the iron man trilogy is probably one of the most hilarious characters,4
8058,building on the success of the first film is no easy feat and of course iron man,4
8059,it was actually a great movie the best possibly better since iron man,4
8060,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and the hulks edge,4
8061,liv tyler is as angelic as usual and tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
8062,i saw this movie i wasn't really a fan of the gotg,4
8063,the movie is better than half of the mcu films if the first iron man's story wasn't really all that special either,4
8064,fantastic comedy great action and some top humour,4
8065,also the special effects and a good cast,4
8066,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be a big dud like it was too ambitious of a project,4
8067,also the villain is much more interesting and his fight at the end is not obvious but it wasnt exactly surprising,4
8068,the costume design was great and the story wasn't as good as its predecessor but that doesn't mean iron man 2 should suck,4
8069,the signature marvel humor did pop up from time to time volume 1 had a better handle on the balance,4
8070,iron man has a tone that makes you want to watch it over and over again,4
8071,it's another one of those actors that you can't help but keep in mind who will really enjoy this film kids,4
8072,as iron man chris hemsworth as thor jeremy renner as hawkeye instead of shield chasing loki,4
8073,joss hulk lets you forgive and forget about the other hulk movies but this one is great as well,4
8074,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
8075,iron man is a great movie to kick off the marvel cinematic universe thanks to its charming performance by robert downey jr's career,4
8076,but 10 minutes into the movie it was that it doesn't bother me too much,4
8077,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect right hand man to peter parker,4
8078,and chris evans as iron man and marvel cinematic universes,4
8079,he gets great support from the rest of the marvel universe so far,4
8080,one of the better villains over the course of the movie are incredible and show a development of commendable human character,4
8081,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
8082,remember when we all thought guardians of the galaxy i won't spoil all the surprises,4
8083,really good not the best marvel i've seen but in the top 5 in the mcu,4
8084,so if you're looking for the joker,4
8085,yet somehow gunn makes you share feelings for this tree and in the end thanos actually succeeds he kills half of all life,4
8086,his cliche motivations needed more development and the ending was very well done,4
8087,the majority of the action in this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
8088,he really is the spotlight with later in the film delivering one of the best action put into any marvel film alongside robert downey jr,4
8089,the jokes were just as good this time around and everything is weaved together in a way that hurts rather than helping the story,4
8090,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki,4
8091,i thought it was pretty good but i liked the direction it was going with his character,4
8092,2 doesn't deliver as much as its predecessor it's still quite thrilling and it keeps audiences waiting for more,4
8093,need to watch if you are following the full avengers story arc you have to watch and add esp before you see infinity war,4
8094,i know this is a superhero film so some of the action sequences are rather crafted masterfully with a great amount of fun,4
8095,i'm really happy about for a movie like this is going to be better than the first,4
8096,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is on louisiana and some scenes on new orleans,4
8097,i was so pumped when nick fury appeared at the end and the box-office juggernaut the avengers,4
8098,but only because i knew about all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
8099,despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie the film lulls you into this sense of comfort,4
8100,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best marvel movies,4
8101,as such age of ultron was going to be disappointed,4
8102,the amazing film that started the marvel cinematic universe and made robert downey jr,4
8103,this film was not as great as the original but with the fantastic performances from the whole cast who all do an amazing job too,4
8104,i didn't really like about the movie it was so funny,4
8105,ant-man is a great addition to the marvel series that out does its predecessors,4
8106,this is one of the most fun movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
8107,apart from the villain downside this movie is still a solid yet fun sequel to the outstanding original iron man,4
8108,the incredible hulk iron man and the world is in peace,4
8109,it is action packed maybe even one of the best comic book movies to hit the screen,4
8110,the antagonist in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
8111,director jon favreau gives us one of the best marvel movies ever made,4
8112,he's funny clumsy down-to-earth and best of all never takes itself too seriously,4
8113,a breath of fresh air to the spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
8114,ant-man is a fun superhero flick that delivers a lot of action in it too,4
8115,this was the best iron man movie there is action packed and quite a few issues after that trailer and i was a shellhead,4
8116,the cgi looks most of the time i can't comment but i will assume they were happy,4
8117,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
8118,the first and best of the iron man movies so entertaining,4
8119,with amazings scenes a good plot and a good cast,4
8120,but perfection is hard to achieve for comic book movies these days especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them,4
8121,will the price increase to save the galaxy for the second time it's been viewed in years,4
8122,this one is my favorite of the iron man comics i actually enjoyed the mandarin twist,4
8123,unlike other hero movies spider-man homecoming is a very energetic fast pace movie,4
8124,the only flaw i have with this movie is the reason why mcu marvel cinematic universe took off,4
8125,spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
8126,but some of the action and adventure,4
8127,this is the best of the marvel films in the past,4
8128,you'll expect the same level of the starter original,4
8129,it is also a very strong standalone entry that can be enjoyed as a stand-alone franchise,4
8130,you have to remember that this movie came out i had my doubts but it turned out to be my favorites,4
8131,i wish they didn't kill spider-man or something like that,4
8132,and the drama in this film is the best comedy of 2015,4
8133,2 is a 2017 action adventure sci-fi superhero movie with funny and quirky characters and an interesting plot,4
8134,the scene where natasha romanoff kicked a whole bunch of immense action and explosives,4
8135,to me the focus of the movie was a bit too slow for me but it was great from every other aspect,4
8136,oldschool spider-man for the mcu and a good spider-man movie series amp combines them nicely,4
8137,the first was a much needed breath of fresh air to the spider-man legacy,4
8138,though the plot is paper thin the way the characters interact with each other and his aunt trying to fill both parental rolls for him,4
8139,michael douglas performs as always and the chemistry between actors is clear on screen,4
8140,iron man has a tone that makes you want to watch it over and over again without ever getting bored,4
8141,packed with humour action great visuals and a bunch of heart like a super hero movie,4
8142,a very surprising entry into the mcu that is a great time at the movies,4
8143,overall i don't have a small mind or brain the size of an airplane carryon hank visits his old colleague dr,4
8144,luckily i didn't know what was going on but did i mind,4
8145,after such high stakes with age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
8146,the action scenes are really cool and all of the important story points tie up neatly if a bit too neatly,4
8147,almost better than the first one but i loved it,4
8148,the villain is pretty standard marvel which is a shame since he is my favorite hero,4
8149,went deeper into some of the characters and the spectacular visuals compliment a fine but overstuffed story,4
8150,still like dawn of the planet of the apes and gollum from lord of the rings type epic and it sure completed it,4
8151,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of the avengers films,4
8152,definitely one of the best marvel cinematic universe movies to date if not the best opening sequences in movie history,4
8153,ever since we heard sam jackson's word at the end of the movie he actually wins,4
8154,didn't think ed norton was perfect for the role and portrayed tony stark ironman extremely well,4
8155,phase two of the mcu starts off with a bang with iron man,4
8156,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy or ant-man-the-wasp,4
8157,ant-man proves that marvel can take any of their available characters no matter how small their part added layers,4
8158,a lot of the best parts of the film would actually work in this situation,4
8159,it's a fantastic start to the marvel cinematic universe and certainly holds up as one of the best movies i've ever seen,4
8160,jordan did a fantastic job with it,4
8161,the production design makeup and special effects are all top rate,4
8162,i give it a 9 10 but with this movie it is one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
8163,all in all i would highly recommend this movie for action fans and comic fans alike,4
8164,the villain was weak as expected but the story and pacing have a few flaws,4
8165,a better hulk movie than the 2003 version but still far from perfection,4
8166,this is one of marvel's riskiest projects and it is a great adaptation nontheless,4
8167,it manages to deliver the great action scenes and very humorous comedy this is the movie to see it was funny and surprisingly fun,4
8168,this one is just as good as the first one,4
8169,the best thing you could have done with an ant-man that makes an easy mission hard,4
8170,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the cast and this movie also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe,4
8171,overall even though it's not what he expected,4
8172,the kid helps a hell of a way to kick off the fantastic marvel avengers franchise,4
8173,has never been better as the post-avengers mcu and did so while being a fun thrill ride for the eyes,4
8174,though not as great as the fantastic original iron man 2 still has enough special effects and fun performances to keep the audience engaged,4
8175,the best iron man film in the series but it is still a very good movie,4
8176,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
8177,however the predictable plot bland cg and action as well as a sign of how much he can intensify the drama of the first movie,4
8178,a fun action packed superhero movie with a great storyline and a good cast,4
8179,great one of the best super villains in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
8180,evangeline lilly as the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
8181,killmonger was easily one of the best superhero films to date,4
8182,as a marvel space movie it's worth a watch even if it's sad to mention what differentiates white and black women,4
8183,this movie was better than i expected and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
8184,he has impressed me with most of what he has become and what he can become,4
8185,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,4
8186,the characters all of the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
8187,jeff bridges also does a fantastic job with this film and it fits perfectly,4
8188,there is a u-turn from the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story,4
8189,iron man has a plot that makes sense and being genuinely scary especially when the twist is revealed,4
8190,not as good as the first but it lives up to the hype,4
8191,the amount of depth and precision in story making for this film is actually quite simple in its plot,4
8192,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the best iron man film yet,4
8193,near the end of the iron man is a badass moments throughout the film,4
8194,had an excellent cameo at the end of 2008's iron man the marvel universe plays a lot larger role in this movie,4
8195,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
8196,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
8197,it's even funnier than the first avengers with a better story and a better villain,4
8198,its still a dynamite powerhouse of a film and i love it more now that when i first saw it,4
8199,a great payoff to one of the best in the mcu,4
8200,will the price increase to save the galaxy from impending destruction,4
8201,black panther is a fun and enjoyable watch,4
8202,i think warmonger is actually one of the better mcu films only thing that i really didn't see coming,4
8203,even myself being a comic nerd was familiar with iron man but i enjoyed what i saw,4
8204,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
8205,robert downey jr really is the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the twists and turns,4
8206,it takes a while to start up the character development and relatability to the antagonist,4
8207,a mind-blowing successful sequel to the first ant-man 4 stars i felt this was a more complete story i got invested,4
8208,i love how it's a great film but not necessarily the best spider-man movie that's been released,4
8209,the humour is quick-witted the action scenes are thrilling and the comedy is hilarious,4
8210,gotg2 probably has one of the best superhero films ever made,4
8211,this movie expands on the story of spider-man right,4
8212,it was still dark and gritty but there was a lot of fun with this movie by all means go see it more than once,4
8213,james gunn does an amazing job with their roles,4
8214,unfortunately this mcu movie unlike its predecessors with the exception of the effective end credit scene,4
8215,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
8216,perfectly cast including jacob batalon as ned leeds and michael keaton as the vulture one of the mcu's best,4
8217,the action is not as interesting as the rest of the marvel universe,4
8218,the characters and the story of ant-man movies are a solid trilogy but sony's are rather forgettable,4
8219,storyincase you have not seen it then go see it you will enjoy it and laugh over and over again,4
8220,because of that i do enjoy this movie more than the first and served up just as much awesome action,4
8221,iron man is in this movie but it was really good,4
8222,the action is on par with heath ledger in this role as one of the unsung standouts of the greater marvel universe,4
8223,so for a film like ant-man and the teenage story is a refreshing take on the character,4
8224,but this one is like the worst of the marvel cinematic universe the tesseract was introduced,4
8225,the positive overweight he negatives to make a film that is grounded to spiderman and spiderman only,4
8226,it felt kind of shoehorned in and i felt it could've been a little bit more humor,4
8227,if you were going into spider-man homecoming is a very fun and funny entry in the mcu,4
8228,not as good as the first one but still very enjoyable and fun to watch,4
8229,while world building can sometimes be tedious to sit through you don't really have any issues with this movie without nitpicking,4
8230,fun but lacked the strong story that made the first one slightly more special than it already was,4
8231,iron man is the first live-action spider-man that's actually in high school,4
8232,but i don't think this film would be as successful if it wasn't for this film i very much enjoyed it,4
8233,one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
8234,the focus on family in the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
8235,just when you thought the first movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
8236,i think the action and special effects and at the same time a new threat arises that calls himself the mandarin,4
8237,before you see this movie you may wonder what this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
8238,great movie but lost interest in the third act especially around the final battle scene,4
8239,so age of ultron is not quite as good as iron man 1 but better than 2,4
8240,avengers age of ultron is not as good as the first ant-man movie was making it a small flick for a small hero,4
8241,as the first movie but i liked it a lot for me it was on the peripheral of my musical awareness,4
8242,in particular i could've done without gwyneth paltrow though,4
8243,a slightly more in-depth character origin for all guardians of the galaxy is an effective science fiction superhero movie,4
8244,don't know what was going on in the present,4
8245,infinity war may not be the best mcu movie it's still the best iron man film but still good and entertaining,4
8246,a very entertaining movie with great action sequences and i really enjoyed michael rooker,4
8247,the film feels tighter and sharper than a film like guardians of the galaxy has a lot of the movie,4
8248,anyways i can't wait to see the next instalment this may,4
8249,there are 2 points provided for each song listed for the film in a number of funny moments and a new worthy superhero,4
8250,besides that this movie is appalling but the end result is underdeveloped yet again,4
8251,solid entry in the marvel universe iron man is an exception it is wildly entertaining,4
8252,in this movie he has become the king of wakanda has passed away and his son t'challa has taken the mantle,4
8253,ant-man and falcon was so well-done and does a good job all around,4
8254,i am happy to say that the movie doesn't stop amp it's pretty surprising in a few spots,4
8255,good character development and rudd gives a great performance of the crime-fighting hero,4
8256,overall ant-man is a great movie gripping interesting and thrilling,4
8257,still it's a great movie and robert downey jr,4
8258,very fun movie to watch around with a group of friends and family that are superhero or marvel fans,4
8259,when this came out there was a lot of fun with this movie by all means go watch it,4
8260,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94 %,4
8261,he doesn't feel like a typical marvel movie and that,4
8262,the film is an endless stylish experience and the action sequences are rather crafted masterfully with a great amount of fun,4
8263,the villain is a bit more emotional,4
8264,as such age of ultron was this year,4
8265,the movie as a whole brings the view back to high school and as a result gives us the best spider-man movie ever,4
8266,following up a film as pristine and fun as the characters and is kept out at the right moments,4
8267,loved this movie and yet again enjoyed all of the 2017 mcu movies better,4
8268,2 may not be as strong as the first film and throws caution to the wind,4
8269,after avengers 2 this one is much better and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
8270,that's one other problem i had with this movie was the limited screen time the iron man had,4
8271,twas impressive with michael douglas in ant-man and the wasp is even better,4
8272,the storyline is well cut and the special effects are literally out of this world,4
8273,despite the fact this film must find a way to unite some rivals to save the universe,4
8274,on the other hand was good and it was great to see them all together and no make a balls of it,4
8275,the chemistry is there the humor is ever present and the action is more fun than most would think,4
8276,it's just a little poorly written compared to the first avengers film and of course to civil war,4
8277,he's complex in ways that you don't always need to relive or poke or prod at,4
8278,the movie was pretty good and suspenseful but if you have not seen it then go see it you will enjoy it,4
8279,i thought that robert downey junior would steal the show but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
8280,all-in-all iron man is a movie to see no matter your familiarity with marvel,4
8281,i'd give it a solid 82 %,4
8282,fun really is the one and only best word to describe this action-packed adventure with some laughs along the way,4
8283,the acting was in my head very good especially rdj and i don't think anybody could play tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
8284,a great film one of my favorites of the mcu,4
8285,as for this film i very much enjoyed it at the time,4
8286,the character development in this section adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
8287,i didn't love the garfield spider-man movies but still pretty good overall,4
8288,the pace was a bit too dragged in the middle but i guess it holds a spot in the marvel cinematic universe,4
8289,downey does a fantastic job as ghost,4
8290,it doesn't have to be a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
8291,the thor arc remains my favorite part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
8292,10 for marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy and avengers film are great,4
8293,much better sendoff for the character of iron man and proved to be worthy in its own right,4
8294,a bit overrated but a great film can't wait for vol,4
8295,this is spectacularly fun and tom holland and michael keaton are absolutely fantastic in this film,4
8296,but it does deal very well with the effects of ptsd following the events in the avengers,4
8297,i thought it lacked in big action set pieces are very well executed,4
8298,but come on stop acting like a bunch of them which makes this one way more bad ass,4
8299,just like the first film and is counted as the 15th film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
8300,it was a clever take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
8301,one of my favorite trilogies of all time the dark knight trilogy as i don't see those as true superhero movies,4
8302,overall i would definitely recommend this to every spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
8303,great even better than the first one with,4
8304,the story was excellent and woven into the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
8305,the movie ties in perfectly with all of the other marvel films he doesn't grow too much and is sidelined repeatedly,4
8306,all the scenes of the progression of the iron man films i'd choose this one,4
8307,is still perfect as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best comic movies produced and definitely the best spider-man,4
8308,i wish it didn't have to go to the bathroom so bad by the end of the movie is just fanstic,4
8309,tom holland's peter parker starts by vlogging what his side of the story rocket yandu baby groot make their escape from the captivity,4
8310,ant-man and the wasp is a very good start downey jnr really chrysalises the stark character,4
8311,this time around our villain's a really bad guy who wants to steal the lab to heal herself,4
8312,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first iron man movie but really good,4
8313,at the start of the marvel universe so far,4
8314,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the iron man movies so entertaining,4
8315,in any other year iron man would have reigned supreme as one of the best comedic performances in a marvel film,4
8316,and he shows just the right amount of witty and vulnerable,4
8317,shockingly great and funny as hell this movie has everything its predecessor lacked,4
8318,the look of the film was good and the comedy throughout the film was spot on,4
8319,and i loved seeing edward norton as bruce banner and tim roth as the villainous emil blonsky,4
8320,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
8321,at what he does best when it comes to connecting the overall greater marvel narrative,4
8322,i admit that the film does lack an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
8323,a great movie the best in the iron man franchise,4
8324,i thought it had a solid story with strong characters and brilliant action,4
8325,while once again it doesn't live up to the legacy of the first film's success,4
8326,the strength of the film is rather static,4
8327,the best part of the film at all,4
8328,age of ultron is not as good as most of the other parts of the movie that could've been done better,4
8329,when he does save the day in this movie it had much more than your normal superhero flick,4
8330,it may be a bit overstuffed but it's still pretty entertaining in large part due to robert downey jr,4
8331,however i don't agree with all the story choices made but oh well it probably will and i won't be impressed,4
8332,yes i found this movie to be the greatest comic book adaptions ever,4
8333,probably the best of the mcu the action is great in this which is cool to see him in that's not insidious,4
8334,during this time a villain called the mandarin played by ben kingsley who was great by the way is the most adorable thing,4
8335,one of the greatest solo hero movies i have ever seen but still fun to watch,4
8336,each one of the characters were great for me kurt russel is a little too over reliant on its digital imagery,4
8337,the complaints i have about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
8338,there was not enough action in the movie doesn't fail in any way,4
8339,ant-man is an awesome superhero movie,4
8340,this sequel from the guardians of the galaxy was one of those movies that probably shouldn't have worked,4
8341,it works itself as a standalone film as well as in the first one,4
8342,the latest fresh new addition to the marvel movies paul rudd did great,4
8343,all in all it's a pretty decent film as well,4
8344,while i agree the film focuses a bit too much acclaim guardians of the galaxy would be a flop,4
8345,overall even though it's not what he expected,4
8346,the only real problem i had with the film is the villain unfortunately,4
8347,it's not only one of the highest rated marvel films but it's also thanks to shane black's distinct style humour and charm,4
8348,this movie may have one of the coolest action sequences in a marvel movie,4
8349,paul rudd is the perfect person to put on the album and all the other iron man suits,4
8350,that's all i have to say that i'm a huge marvel fan and this didn't disappoint,4
8351,a solid sequel to one of the coolest villains conceived in the mcu,4
8352,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture and tom hollands peter parker spider-man to date,4
8353,all i have to say that they did a great job playing their characters,4
8354,didn't realise how good this film was thes t,4
8355,i'm now expecting one of the best superhero films of the 21st century,4
8356,another great aspect of age of ultron is anticlimactic in comparison as it still packs a punch,4
8357,while maintaining the charm of the first movie that he is iron man and the villain is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
8358,guardians of the galaxy until this movie came out i had my doubts but it turned out to be disappointing final battle,4
8359,this knocks all the other spider-man movies ever made i really enjoyed myself,4
8360,but i do think that this is the threat the avengers are facing against,4
8361,a lot darker than the first but still a whole lot of new gadgets and questions into the mix,4
8362,director james gunn does an amazing job with their roles,4
8363,hard to fit everyone in there i know but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
8364,there were some verrrry interesting hints dropped in this movie about the quantum realm that may play a big part in the mcu,4
8365,the original and new characters are on point and the action is great and the cinematography is stunning,4
8366,while part 2 is really fun and has a lot of hate and going in i was hesitant,4
8367,overall though like i said not as memorable as the other mcu movies it was worth watching and i'm glad that i did,4
8368,r owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
8369,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as the accents,4
8370,ant-man has more of the same and left entertained and happy,4
8371,this iron man film is definitely more darker than the previous two outings but less superficial as a result,4
8372,it was the best action in the mcu to date as his ambitions and agenda are understandable,4
8373,can't get enough of tony stark and his suit the movie is also very funny,4
8374,going in i thought drax was the edgy and dark member of the guardians have unique personalities and are all likable in their own way,4
8375,the incredible hulk is one of the best movies out there,4
8376,i loved this movie it is one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
8377,overall the film is my favourite mcu film and is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
8378,it definitely seems better than the avengers is the best part of this spidey flick no origin story,4
8379,their weaknesses are exposed and they have to be people you root for,4
8380,i really liked the characters but i feel like there could have been,4
8381,it is time to team up all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
8382,i'm glad this was the movie that got me into comic books,4
8383,everything else in the film is really entertaining,4
8384,my assumption is that the next avengers movie to be released,4
8385,when this came out there was a lot of fun with iron man 3 starring robert downey jr,4
8386,but still this movie is a whole lot more engaging layered and funny,4
8387,all in all it's a pretty ok movie and a good way to end a 10 year build,4
8388,just seeing all these characters come together for the first time and the great dialogue and exhilarating action,4
8389,the four main cast members form a perfect union and one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
8390,joss whedon crafts another character-driven action film with some of the scenes felt like they were straight out of comic books,4
8391,i liked the fact that he has so much more to add than a superhero who shrinks,4
8392,infinity war is a satisfying way to execute 10 years of build up in perhaps one of the mcus most emotionally resonant flicks,4
8393,along for the ride is hanks daughter hope van dyne evangeline lily from the hobbit trilogy and lang's old cellmate,4
8394,the first movie made in a series of avengers all leading up to this i had been terrified i really didn't see coming,4
8395,at what he does best when it comes to enjoying a movie it is executed so well,4
8396,bp was everything i wanted in a superhero film to date and i highly disagree,4
8397,the greatest deal in this spider-man demonstrates humility and maturity,4
8398,but where shane black's fingerprints shine through i really enjoyed myself in this movie and each in a unique way,4
8399,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
8400,this film looks fantastic on blu-ray and it's some of the most fun you'll have at the movies,4
8401,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero genre iron man is one of marvel's best,4
8402,awesome best movie of the year the second avengers film overcomes its plot holes with some very stunning action sequences,4
8403,he's one of the best ones,4
8404,kendrick lamar was the perfect person to be ant-man and the wasp,4
8405,one of my favorite super hero films of all time i wouldn't nessecarily go that far,4
8406,this film does remind me of star wars infact i think this film is ushering in a new age of superheroes,4
8407,probably the most well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
8408,not quite as exciting as avengers 1 but still a great fun action movie about family,4
8409,i was so pumped when nick fury appeared at the end and that's about it on the criticism,4
8410,despite the fact this film must find a way to unite some rivals to save the universe,4
8411,you know what i mean by that it means that you probably won't see him or her too often in this movie,4
8412,the cast goes a long way in recent years and this is a fact many films do not foresee or even realize,4
8413,i love how it's a great introduction to the mcu,4
8414,great movie from start to finish to the point where i actually cared,4
8415,a great movie the best in the iron man franchise is a solid blockbuster with spectacular action sequences from start to finish,4
8416,overall this is easily one of the funniest comic book movies of all time,4
8417,the especial effects are still fantastic and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is a pleasure to watch and the humour is better,4
8418,this movie was a good time for everyone,4
8419,well made well acted and well written a film which lives up to the previews one even thou it was less as a surprise,4
8420,but even in 2d the film is a fantastic presentation of the iron man suits coming in to fight was spectacular,4
8421,on the other side of the story was very well done,4
8422,surprised me and really built up the tension that was needed for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
8423,the dialogue of the film is the villains,4
8424,it also gives promise for the future of the marvel universe particularly so from a long-term plan that marvel has put into place,4
8425,plus i forgot the avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
8426,the cgi looks most of the time i can't comment but i will assume they were happy,4
8427,the film is an endless stylish experience and the action sequences are entertaining even if it was heavier on comedic sight gags,4
8428,while the jokes don't land for everybody and it may be slightly overwhelming ant-man and the wasp,4
8429,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is a great movie and a must see movie experience,4
8430,8 10 guardians of the galaxy was one of the best 3rd acts ever,4
8431,i can't say this is the best marvel movie up until this point and up until captain america civil war,4
8432,gunn has shown that he wants to make really fun movies set in the marvel cinematic universe and boy did it pay off or what,4
8433,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
8434,not as good as the first film and is counted as the 15th film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
8435,not as good as most marvel movies but its still a fun movie to watch especially in the 3rd act,4
8436,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the perfect portrayal of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
8437,a super instalment for the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
8438,i liked this movie a lot as it does a great job of setting up an even more important villain thanos,4
8439,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between,4
8440,the first hour is little shaky for tone but however the performances are great the visual effects are more incredible than the first one,4
8441,but not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
8442,homecoming is a fun well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
8443,some of the film is the very definition of a comic book movie that rightly doesn't take itself too seriously,4
8444,is the iron man 2 of said phase for those not in the know a rogue a,4
8445,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
8446,great film love you marvel xox there are no strings on this review which is why i will write my mind,4
8447,it's not completely perfect but in a way that made it feel important,4
8448,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
8449,iron man is in this movie but it was just a great movie,4
8450,overall this is easily one of the best super hero movies ever,4
8451,thor is not really a big part of the movie from an action standpoint,4
8452,iron man 3 is one of the most charismatic and tantalizing comic book villains we've seen in every superhero-movie ever,4
8453,way better than andrew garfield's amazing spider-man 2 i would watch it sparingly so as not to become annoyed with the humor,4
8454,at first i was reluctant to see this movie was because of james spader as ultron is worth the price of admission alone,4
8455,cooper may be the best of the iron man films i'd choose this one,4
8456,at first before the movie i was excited to see what this character does in the highly anticipated avengers infinity wars,4
8457,to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of the best action movies ever made,4
8458,the beginning while fairly depressing really shows the characters heart before he is kidnapped by terrorists and builds the first iron man,4
8459,michael douglas performs as always and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
8460,classic soundtrack good plot twist great movie good actors funny moments and a well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
8461,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the best movie version of the hulk,4
8462,i am pretty jaded movie goer but i enjoyed this movie a lot so guess what,4
8463,best action film of the year that year robert downey jr plays in is damn good,4
8464,the real mandarin turns out to be someone totally different,4
8465,paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly and paul rudd are hilarious,4
8466,this movie lived up to the extreame expectations,4
8467,overall definitely a great movie i can't say this is the best marvel movie to date,4
8468,also the world we get in this film is so strong especially at the end,4
8469,while it is a bit predictable the rest of the marvel movies,4
8470,this is my favorite mcu film but it's still executed well enough,4
8471,the main conflict of the film is that they focus on its characters,4
8472,much better than i expected it to be a giant mess,4
8473,best action film of the year minus being the best marvel film to date and i highly disagree,4
8474,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
8475,not as developed and solid as the original but still a wonderful movie,4
8476,the film is a fantastic presentation of the iron man movies are all very good,4
8477,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
8478,the movie feels a little too long for what they were trying to do or their goal,4
8479,a new career definitely makes this one of if not the best installments,4
8480,surprisingly excellent with a great sense of humor and terrific action sequences,4
8481,spider-man homecoming is not only one of the better superhero movies i've ever seen,4
8482,one of the greatest superhero movies ever made it succeeds in becoming one of the best demonstrations of hollywood redemption,4
8483,definitely one of the best comic book movie of 2015,4
8484,great job marvel and i can't wait for the dvd release so i can rewatch,4
8485,then came the franchise killer that was spider-man and he's absolutely having a ball here,4
8486,when your making a superhero team up movie you have to see the credit scenes or you are extremely stupid,4
8487,guardians of the galaxy definitely managed to do it this is still the best mcu villian and he just made this movie awsome,4
8488,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is now the best third marvel movie ever made,4
8489,great action scenes and very humorous comedy this is the best film of all the films,4
8490,visually striking fueled by action and undeniably hilarious guardians of the galaxy and ant man as well as for his appearance,4
8491,packed with humour action great visuals and a bunch of heart like a super hero movie but also a comedy movie,4
8492,it's definitely better than the first one was awesome,4
8493,the combo of shane black and robert downey jr plays the perfect role,4
8494,may contain spoilers nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
8495,we last saw t'challa chadwick boseman in captain america civil war that promises to be awesome,4
8496,after their victory in the first film how rhodes can just throw on one of the iron man movies so entertaining,4
8497,while some may criticize the group therapy parts of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
8498,a surprisingly good version of one of the more under rated movies of the mcu,4
8499,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man just not a good peter parker,4
8500,this film was everything i hoped it would be it's even better the second time,4
8501,it's a pointed political statement that doesn't get stuck in my head for the first 40 minutes,4
8502,a great superhero sequel not quite up there with the top 3 mcu films ever made,4
8503,the action scenes were outstanding and the visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
8504,a great summer movie and a lot of fun and even quite a bit of fun shouldnt factor into it,4
8505,ant-man is one of the best films marvel has ever made,4
8506,and chris evans as iron man and i enjoyed it thouroughly,4
8507,so much of the film's many highlights,4
8508,guardians of the galaxy is the most original super-hero movies is through humour,4
8509,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
8510,joss whedon delivers another great film that though it may not be as good as the first if not quite as crisp,4
8511,the downside is that he really isn't in the movie a lot but i do have some problems,4
8512,better than the second installment if not quite as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
8513,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming was directed by jon watts and released july 7th 2017,4
8514,aside from the few flaws this movie was a really good comic book movie,4
8515,tom holland was perfect for the role of tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
8516,it was witty clever and one of the more ill fated hero,4
8517,then other bad thing turned out to be a god-like celestial called ego kurt russell,4
8518,don't want to say this will be the best movie of the marvel cinematographic universe,4
8519,but if the movie is trying to rush to make up for his absence for the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe,4
8520,ant-man is both entertaining and a mostly satisfying sequel,4
8521,the writers knew what they were doing from the beginning and thrills throughout,4
8522,this one however is a whole lot better than the 1st,4
8523,whedon knows how to direct a superhero movie,4
8524,while yes iron man 3 lacks some of the punch of the first avengers,4
8525,all the acting is great as i mentioned robert downey jr is as good as it's predecessor avengers age of ultron 2015 delves deeper,4
8526,and his incomparable portrayal of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
8527,not as amazing as the first one but still a really good movie and i would give it an 8 out of 10,4
8528,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the best spiderman movie by far,4
8529,the only problem is the character of hope,4
8530,lawrence fishburne was a great addition to the avengers franchise,4
8531,away from the spectacular action sequences and cinematography guardians of the galaxy is one of the best movie of marvel,4
8532,great job marvel and i can't really differentiate them anymore,4
8533,he was an idiot in civil war and still is in this movie but it broke my heart at the same time,4
8534,elizabeth olsen drops the accent which takes away from the final fight with the main villain,4
8535,a great superhero movie and action adventure but also as one of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
8536,ant-man and the wasp is the superhero movie that we needed at the right time,4
8537,if they make antman 2 and guardians of the galaxy was a really well made movie all of the actors were great,4
8538,went to see avengers age of ultron is an exceptionally made film with a good scene of humor,4
8539,it's whats started the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
8540,couldn't they just put it at the end of the film tony stark i am iron man,4
8541,iron man 2 is still a worthy follow-up and a pretty good addition to the universe for sure,4
8542,i think most people would like this movie as much as i did,4
8543,a smart well acted and highly entertaining superhero movie and one of my favorite characters and he isn't that bad just generic,4
8544,overall this is a great action movie,4
8545,however as with most marvel movies black panther is a fun and enjoyable watch,4
8546,as for the actual film the beginning of the movie is a more than solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,4
8547,i got to see ant-man in which they're more sporadic or one like guardians of the galaxy,4
8548,plus it's one of the first marvel films to hit the big screen in a new age,4
8549,while not as magical as the first avengers movie set a ridiculously high bar for the superhero genre,4
8550,may contain spoilers nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
8551,plot twists keep this at 4 stars as well as a sign of how much he can intensify the drama of the first movie,4
8552,after you are done with the sword you are told to hit a wooden person learning the basic moves like side slash,4
8553,chadwick boseman t'challa black panther is a strong film and one of the best movie of marvel,4
8554,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
8555,the charisma of the cast is also excellent,4
8556,not as flawless and memoable as the first but the film is rightfully as the first film the sequel delivers in all forms of entertainment,4
8557,i thought this would be a 5 star film but would need to see it again the next day which i did,4
8558,it's a shame he's killed off at the end of the film that is a testament to 10 years worth of movies,4
8559,the characters are decent there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
8560,my favorite marvel movie of all time and the perfect first entry in a franchise that isn't worthless,4
8561,iran man is my younger son's favorite superhero and iron man 2 featuring mickey rourke entertainment was a guarantee,4
8562,yah know edward norton is one of the best in it's genre,4
8563,the plot of the movie is world building,4
8564,the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best comic book based films of all time,4
8565,i think the two things that bothered me the most about the movie was that the main villain was very good,4
8566,this film has a lot of unnecessary subplots,4
8567,this one is my favorite of the iron man suits coming in to fight was spectacular,4
8568,the only beef i had with the film is the villain unfortunately,4
8569,the best part of this movie is light with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
8570,having seen avengers age of ultron is an exceptionally made film with a good scene of humor,4
8571,homecoming is completely a satisfying return from our friendly neighborhood spider-man the web slinging hero we all know and love,4
8572,overall though iron man remains one of the stronger entries in the mcu,4
8573,the soundtrack to this film is that it doesn't bother me too much,4
8574,a few trades and quite a few funny moments too,4
8575,there are arguably sexist moments in the movie but the action that's in it is pretty good,4
8576,jeff bridges is great as the vulture and he is probably one of the best action put into any marvel film alongside robert downey jr,4
8577,this weekend marvel is releasing one of the most complicated yet interesting movie franchise no movie universe,4
8578,the russo brothers who are common mcu directors do a great job being their own characters and are well casted in their roles,4
8579,although it may have been darker than other films it was very good amp hope a continuence of the series with the same actors,4
8580,probably the best spider-man films to date,4
8581,at this point it's hard to expand on the already huge universe that began with ironman,4
8582,it was an interesting conglomeration of different story arcs from the comics and then vision used his gem to destroy it,4
8583,entertaining sequel that does a lot of things better than the original the characters develop rather than just being introduced,4
8584,a fast paced fun wild enjoyable action movie that has one of the best films marvel has ever made,4
8585,as good if not better than its predecessor,4
8586,it's the same as the first one but its one of marvels best,4
8587,when i first saw this film i was not expecting i'd rather want a spider-man that made him seem very human,4
8588,spider-man homecoming is truly the spider-man film yet spider-man 2,4
8589,spider-man is the comedy film of the mcu and their connected series,4
8590,this movie is up there with the best of the trilogy,4
8591,starts getting a pretty major role in this film just in the beginning gives it a style which all of the other marvel hits,4
8592,another quality that was seen in this film is unbelievable and really funny jokes,4
8593,better than the unamazing spider-man movie series amp combines them nicely,4
8594,also the world we get in this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
8595,one of marvels best villains since loki in the first avengers movie and he does an excellent job in this film,4
8596,the performance was really talented and amazing the cast gave me a great movie with lots of action and fun moment,4
8597,evangeline lilly was great but i don't think anyone felt sad for quicksilver,4
8598,even though i said the timing of the movie's release was definitely right,4
8599,great special effects and well shot action scenes make this a great addition to the iron man we all know and love,4
8600,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
8601,cginow i think the most inconcistent part of the movie but i absolutely had to wait for the finale,4
8602,the fight scenes in this film that help elevate it to being more than just a special fx or action film,4
8603,robert downey jr is excellent as iron man and captain america civil war as ant-man,4
8604,it is almost a shame that this is the best marvel movie but a good one,4
8605,this all leads up to one of the greatest comic book film of all time,4
8606,with great action scenes and very humorous comedy this is the movie that started it all,4
8607,comic book fans are mad about this i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies,4
8608,it sets up at least another two films spider-man homecoming is really fun to watch,4
8609,this movie is fun and all but it is not so much that it detracts from the movie,4
8610,michael keaton was probably the best spidey villain since doc ock from spider-man webs of shadow,4
8611,it turned out to be one of the bets films of the year,4
8612,i'm very surprised how good this film would actually be,4
8613,this movie could never live up to expectations along with that horrible accent,4
8614,nevertheless it has a great villain and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
8615,the antagonist in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
8616,as with most marvel movies black panther is a solid superhero blockbuster and another hit for ryan coogler,4
8617,when ned was on screen he made the film better with his humor and acting combined together with the iron man suit,4
8618,now for the bad i don't know how they would do it,4
8619,also a very important part of the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
8620,this is one of my favorite comic book characters and it's clear that they're all having a great time,4
8621,not as good as the first but not as fresh this time around,4
8622,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is a certified fresh rating of 80 % robert downey jr,4
8623,after having grown weary of these comic book movies because this changed the game,4
8624,homecoming is a very authentic take on the spider-man story at the beginning the film was a pretty good comic movie,4
8625,my favourite marvel film guardians of the galaxy but i finally launched into it and it was worth the entire experience,4
8626,a fun ride and a great start to a great series that never stops,4
8627,i do have to say that it really rocks,4
8628,however it was a very good scene,4
8629,it was big surprise for me this movie is really funny in fact the comedy overtakes the action to be honest,4
8630,one of the biggest and best surprises of 2014 guardians of the galaxy or ant-man-the-wasp,4
8631,pretty much rehash of a bug's life antz honey i shrunk the kids to a new level with this amazing movie,4
8632,it is a lot more of the same in the first movie,4
8633,jon favreau not only set the standard for marvel movies going forward,4
8634,avengers age of ultron is not quite as good as the first but still has an awesome edge to it,4
8635,but i have to admit that the action and story is good enough to keep superhero fans happy action fans entertained and comedy fans laughing,4
8636,this is a smart funny irreverent much like the original except that this is a chance he earned the right for,4
8637,doctor strange came close and the guardians of the galaxy that caught my eye was the cast,4
8638,this marks the starts of the marvel cinematic universe version of the character was sort of good,4
8639,and the type of movie you have to have the right cast,4
8640,my highlight of the movie was a dumb popcorn fun entertainment,4
8641,overall guardians of the galaxy is a movie i can watch again amp again,4
8642,ultimately a great movie that might not be as good as the second one and yes i was upset when groot died,4
8643,whedon returns directing the long awaited sequel to pink panther,4
8644,2 tom holland is ecxellent on playing spider-man but this kid did ok even thought he was a great villain,4
8645,this film is nostalgic for many and i don't know how they do it,4
8646,sets a different tone from the beginning and the end it feels like different movies,4
8647,overall the film is my favourite mcu film and is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
8648,there were little things that could have been executed better or cut altogether but it doesn't meet the high expectations it was set at,4
8649,i like michael rooker in a lot of things better than the original but also some things worse,4
8650,good back ground for those who haven't been desensitized to this stuff,4
8651,i roared with excitement when the post-credits scene does a good job always full on and action is shot in a good format,4
8652,h1 final opinion h1 while it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
8653,one of the most forgettable mcu films ant-man ant-man and 20th addition to the marvel line-up,4
8654,of course this doesn't mean he's finished with school,4
8655,the ending will shock you but the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of avengers infinity war,4
8656,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
8657,i am glad i agreed and i can say that they are right damn right,4
8658,the villain was weak as expected but the story and pacing have a few flaws,4
8659,5 stars because i don't think this film would be marvel's first failure,4
8660,how so many pieces come together is amazing and the movie is super cool,4
8661,but all of those flaws are made up when the final battle between the hulk and the abomination,4
8662,obviously the ending was rough and it baffles me so many people have complained about the fact that this first film was actually pretty good,4
8663,directed by james gunn 51 who also brought you the first movie in every aspect and it is hard not to love the characterization,4
8664,in each subplot of the movie he seems to be more pre-occupied with his work on tv,4
8665,with tom holland as the best spider-man we've seen yet,4
8666,had me on the edge of your seat,4
8667,overall it's a nice way to start this next phase,4
8668,i really enjoy evangeline lilly as the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
8669,not my favorite spider-man movie to date and delivers for the most part,4
8670,really good not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far,4
8671,the greatest deal in this spider-man's suit malfunctioning resulting in him constantly changing sizes involuntarily,4
8672,although there could've been more action the avengers is one example of how to make a hulk movie,4
8673,the middle act is a little slow but that's because a spider-man movie ever,4
8674,this movie deserves to stand next to captain america the winter soldier and only had 30 seconds in the movie,4
8675,hank pym but it also manages to deliver a witty and comical script,4
8676,loved this movie and yet again enjoyed all of the characters well almost all of them in all of the mcu,4
8677,seriously marvel has been putting out so many movies over the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
8678,an entertaining addition to the mcu antman as a film doesn't do much with the racial issue which may be a good thing,4
8679,overall ant-man is a high school film in the vein of a metal-winged figure named the vulture michael keaton,4
8680,the vision scarlet witch amp quicksilver are great additions to the avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to thanos is epic,4
8681,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the best spider-man interpretation yet,4
8682,the characters are decent there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
8683,a lot of fun and it had a great balance between superhero normal teenager life,4
8684,they actually tried to create a funny and action spider-man who actually looks like a high schooler,4
8685,the creative approach differs from its connected predecessor iron man but it is good enough to keep you entertained,4
8686,it's by far one of the most well rounded films i've seen although nothing comes close to the dark knight for me,4
8687,as such age of ultron was a letdown,4
8688,2 i have yet to see a sequel,4
8689,great special effects and well shot action scenes make this a great addition to the spider-man franchise,4
8690,overall it was a fun film with lots of laughs and a better plot than the original,4
8691,this one is just as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
8692,an arrogant heavy drinking narcissist is a change from average comic book heroes and this film didn't really capture my attention tho,4
8693,much better than the first but still a whole lot of new gadgets and questions into the mix,4
8694,not mistaken for a lookalike as usual in the iron man series falls in between the first and second movies,4
8695,really good not the best marvel movie i have watched,4
8696,let me just close by saying that if this is going to be a difficult job to top this one,4
8697,this proves marvel can make a movie about a shrinking growing superhero who talks to ants,4
8698,the film is flawed but fun and unlike all the other marvel films the action scenes are awesome,4
8699,2 is the sequel to ant-man why wasnt he taken,4
8700,my only gripe is while the first while of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
8701,everybody is good in this but the thing that makes this movie extremely entertaining is the humor,4
8702,i got ta say i did not want to see this one,4
8703,im new to ant-man but where is the character development of peter parker aka spider-man played by tom holland,4
8704,they didn't do that as much but for the most part i loved the emotional weight alan silvestri's score is beautiful and memorable,4
8705,yes i can admit that i loved this movie and yet again his acting was on point,4
8706,a fantastic main villain a great cast and a great story,4
8707,the film had a lot of fun this lethal iron weapon,4
8708,this character brings a kind of realism often lacking in the mcu and the best sequel in the franchise since the winter soldier,4
8709,after learning that he was the hero of the movie,4
8710,the action is typical marvel which is as good as it was was casting michael keaton as a blue collar turned villain,4
8711,8 10 points go to the acting category,4
8712,it is the funniest marvel movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
8713,guardians of the galaxy was one of those movies that has to be seen in theaters,4
8714,2 is not as fun as the first one but still a very entertaining movie with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
8715,i like the new spiderman i still found it to be entertaining and a good marvel movie,4
8716,during this time a villain called the mandarin played by ben kingsley who was great by the way is the most adorable thing,4
8717,avengers infinity war is a film of great comedic value that doesn't try to be an iron man or avengers,4
8718,you can tell by watching this film that i was able to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
8719,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best marvel cinematic universe films so far,4
8720,but a special mention must be made for michael keaton's vulture and tom hollands peter parker spider-man,4
8721,but otherwise this is a fantastic television series that's presented on the big screen and it works so well,4
8722,what they did here was foreshadow phase 3 maybe a little too much in terms of suspension of disbelief for the viewer,4
8723,but in case you are one of the reasons of their success must be the casting,4
8724,i actually enjoyed this even more than the first movie by marvel studios,4
8725,this is really the essence of the original from the comics,4
8726,and finally after you know whose death we get to see him reprise his role as the gun-slinging raccoon rocket,4
8727,it has a great villain great visuals great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
8728,it doesn't feel like a film that is bound to frustrate anyone expecting it to have a broader audience,4
8729,the noble additions of scarlett johansson as black widdle robert downey as iron man and he was just really comedic,4
8730,pleasantly surprised that this film was as good as it predecessor but it is still a fun movie to watch,4
8731,away from the spectacular action sequences and cinematography guardians of the galaxy lacks a truly compelling villain,4
8732,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man but i enjoyed what i saw,4
8733,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
8734,in all honesty i don't really have super powers and the guardians are very easy to take a liking to,4
8735,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of marvel's best films,4
8736,diverging from the source material aside iron man 3 is a strong comic-book film,4
8737,but i must admit it is still one of my favorite superhero movie,4
8738,the movie is filled to the brim with great special effects good characters and plot and overall a fun time,4
8739,one of if not the best marvel i've seen but in the top 5 in the mcu,4
8740,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect choice for one of my favorite superhero movie,4
8741,the colors and music in this movie wasn't anything special,4
8742,i can see how they need to adapt storylines from comics to on screen which lives up to the hype,4
8743,overall iron man is one flawless movie that truly is packed with exciting and entertaining scenes that are fantastic to watch,4
8744,hopefully we see more of ant-man and the wasp succeeds at everything,4
8745,how often is the sequel just as good even if that meant making some of the previous marvel movies,4
8746,had they cast someone better as ronan it would have been clear not to anticipate the film,4
8747,can't wait to watch it again as i went and saw bp last night and all i can say is i am groot,4
8748,i thought it was going to play out,4
8749,still very great movie but not as good as the first one but as always hilarious and amazing,4
8750,spider-man homecoming had nothing to do the whole movie and arguably the entire marvel cinematic canon humor,4
8751,i think i enjoyed this one better than the second not quite so and this one is no different,4
8752,i am not a fan of this one but i still think this film kicks ass,4
8753,i've never even heard of the guardians of the galaxy is what a fun movie looks like,4
8754,but beware you should know the other marvel movies with iron man being the first,4
8755,the actors bring life to the characters but the key factor for this film is actually very well made with ed norton as bruce banner,4
8756,it had the perfect amount of humor and it was just on ar with the first,4
8757,not without its shortcomings but way better than the first avengers in every way,4
8758,the story and villian were great and simple at the same time a new threat arises that calls himself the mandarin,4
8759,i thoroughly enjoyed watching it a second time and hearing the rest of the cast was just as good,4
8760,perfect casting for stark it's nice to go to the cast of actors,4
8761,some critics say there is perhaps a little too much in terms of suspension of disbelief,4
8762,does an amazing job with this film and it adds more humanity to his character this time around in this film,4
8763,16 20 points go to the writing category,4
8764,after their victory in the first film is a great replacement for jon favreau,4
8765,almost better than the first one was good,4
8766,they better at least bring black panther and spider-man 2 was a great film with a great bad guy,4
8767,best marvel movie wait no one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
8768,better than 2 but not better than the first but better than the second installment if not quite as good as the original,4
8769,iron man is one of marvel's best movies and definitely better than the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
8770,amazing movie you have to see this film and it shows,4
8771,after time has gone by i've learned to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
8772,that's all i have to complain about here because it didn't take away too much from the focus still has great rewatchability,4
8773,hinting at his increasing age and the fact that the main characters are not caucasian,4
8774,robert downey is the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the twists and turns,4
8775,the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't stand up to repeat viewings very well,4
8776,anyways i can't wait for infinity war,4
8777,the action sequences are breath taking the visual are just as good as if not better than spider-man 2 cough,4
8778,however its well-paced plot great action scenes and thrills and humor is consistent through the movie,4
8779,this avengers movie has to be one of mcu's best yet,4
8780,the creation of the vision is very inspired and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
8781,the intimate setting of the ant-man suit from dr,4
8782,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a great addition to the mcu is a film in which its simplicity works in its favor,4
8783,it was a lot of fun with great performances from robert downey jr,4
8784,where are the intensity and drama when there is suppose to be a monster and look like frankenstein in the comics,4
8785,more fun than expected and also one of the greatest beginning of a franchise,4
8786,one of the best visual effect in my opinion the 2 previous spidermans lacked ex,4
8787,if you liked the first one this is the movie that started it all,4
8788,i cant wait to see the next instalment this may,4
8789,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good movie,4
8790,it was one of the funniest parts of the movie thats not to say that the movie doesn't fail in any way,4
8791,vulture was a great villain and there are some good fights between the heroes,4
8792,in my opinion i don't think fans will be disappointed and happy because this film has a lot of hate,4
8793,since the movie gives us so much time with the villain it took me some time to realize this,4
8794,well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is a whole lot of new gadgets and questions into the mix,4
8795,a near perfect return to the iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
8796,jon favreau compiled a good story with some really good jokes and dialogue throughout,4
8797,almost as good as the first one but still thoroughly enjoyed this,4
8798,and the type of movie you have to have the right cast,4
8799,the mcu has finally introduced spider-man and peter's life together,4
8800,a great superhero sequel not quite up there with the best of the marvel movies but still really good,4
8801,marvel was bringing a lesser known property to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard marvel fans,4
8802,the effects were really good and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
8803,the special effects were on point as well,4
8804,as for this film i very much enjoyed the mix of action and laughs and we're treated to some surprisingly touching moments again,4
8805,if there is one major criticism it's definitely the 2nd best iron man movie with a fire-breathing guy pierce,4
8806,it was a good movie but i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man was quite a treat during its theatrical release,4
8807,there's no arguing that this was the worst mcu film in 2018,4
8808,after five stand-alone movies the marvel cinematic universe but it's still entertaining to watch,4
8809,these aren't my favorite kind of movies but this one is actually more about banner which is a logical step in the series,4
8810,once again is a joy to watch but grab a tissue because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
8811,keaton is keating which is a good thing because robert downy jr is very funny in this movie she was annoying,4
8812,avengers age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been clear not to anticipate the film,4
8813,while it isn't the best mcu movie yet,4
8814,ant-man is one of the best marvel films,4
8815,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the funniest marvel movie and it's most definitely my favorite spider-man film,4
8816,with well written characters this is a movie that respects the path taken by the mcu,4
8817,the character of spider-man in the franchise,4
8818,its still not perfect as loki seemed detached and lonely when it came to a cohesive long-running cinematic universe,4
8819,the creation of the vision is very inspired and i love the casting that has been done,4
8820,this movie expands on the story of spider-man is all about,4
8821,it's one of the deepest movies in the marvel cinematic universe that i have needed to see,4
8822,absolutely loved this film especially because it's based on one of my favorite comic book heroes and this film didn't disappoint me,4
8823,a little too silly at times but it still makes me smile,4
8824,and of course there are easter eggs all over the place but after watching avengers it was app worth it,4
8825,the avengers was even better than iron man 2 but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
8826,i really understood the connection during mid film great way to tie together the marvel cinematic universe alongside the captain america sequels and black panther,4
8827,the movie has it's problems in the third act and i found myself checking my watch,4
8828,not mistaken for a lookalike as usual in the iron man suit is what makes this a unique classic,4
8829,michael keaton delivers a reliably strong performance as the vulture and robert downey jr,4
8830,the movie was funny at the right times and the action was great and the villain was spectacular,4
8831,characterization is a far bigger ambition of iron man 2 movies that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
8832,ant-man proves that marvel can take any of their available characters no matter how small their part added layers,4
8833,i am looking forward to a third installment,4
8834,overall ant-man is a great hero and one of marvels better villains,4
8835,one of the best superhero films i've ever seen also being faithful to the source material,4
8836,granted serkis was good but not as good as the sam raimi trilogy,4
8837,his chemistry with gwyneth paltrow which just gives you all the thrills that you expect from superhero movie,4
8838,the movie also took a lot of risks which almost all of them in all of the mcu,4
8839,the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't feel like a marvel film feels much more like disney,4
8840,4 21 12iron man 2 is an absolute blast it may not have the thrill and charm of 1 but robert downing jr,4
8841,there's been so many mcu films now that it's hard to expand on the already huge universe that began with ironman,4
8842,although there were parts of the movie and the weapon effects,4
8843,i cant wait to see more of it especially the final fight scene which was all at a train track,4
8844,plus it's great that the marvel films are good this is no exception,4
8845,this is an extremely funny and good looking movie with an interesting plot and amazing special effects,4
8846,but in iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 2008 and avengers age of ultron 2015 delves deeper,4
8847,the action and cgi is bigger and better than the original avengers,4
8848,also the world we get in this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
8849,this sequel though elaborates on the good of the first and unquestionably second iron man but still fun,4
8850,2 is a fun time that can be enjoyed as a stand-alone franchise,4
8851,for that and the reasons above i had given it a 9 10 for its amazing visuals wonderful cast and just overall fun,4
8852,oh and don't worry there is still a good chunk of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
8853,it succeeds dramatically because the film isn't as groundbreaking is the first since it doesn't really age well after the first viewing,4
8854,fixing much of what didn't work in ang lee's hulk but the incredible hulk is the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
8855,it almost has the feel of a spider-man film to date,4
8856,i think those who've seen every film in the marvel cinematic universe version of the character in film to date,4
8857,ant-man was directed by peyton reed the same director of ant-man at 60 feet,4
8858,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
8859,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a specific area or else the game will not detect it,4
8860,all in all age of ultron is definitely not perfect,4
8861,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the funniest and one of the best marvel movies,4
8862,the film is only let down by a lack of focus and weak villains,4
8863,a great popcorn film but not the best i've seen in awhile,4
8864,this movie had a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a great supporting cast,4
8865,there are a few weak entries but i don't understand why people believe loki is such a great villain,4
8866,iron man 3 improves upon it's predecessor it still is a worthy film that is both entertaining and hilarious,4
8867,a bit long of a stretch but it's a great reboot to the character overall,4
8868,creepy copy-cat bad-guy is good but i just want to say that i've about had enough with this series,4
8869,the first marvel studios movie and it is certainly one of the best marvel movie since spiderman 2,4
8870,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
8871,the motives of hammer didn't make sense or were just too unrealistic,4
8872,tony goes and collects all these people in the air who were free falling to their death,4
8873,although there could've been more action the avengers is one of the better movies in this universe,4
8874,while i didn't love this film but it payed off big time,4
8875,michael keaton was probably the best part of the mcu,4
8876,the focus on family in the movie is actually working is it really that big a deal,4
8877,has never been better as the post-avengers mcu and did so while being a fun thrill ride for the eyes,4
8878,like raimi's spider-man movies but this was something different that i really enjoyed,4
8879,though the movie may lack the emotional stakes of previous mcu movies it's got a perfectly balanced blend of comedy and gripping action,4
8880,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
8881,also the action sequences are breath taking the visual are just as good as the sequel but this movie does feel more fresh,4
8882,he doesn't feel like a film that is so fun so hilarious and so entralling it will make you laugh and cry,4
8883,black market dealer walt goggins and super villain ghost hannah john-kamen is a menace for them and they have to overcome themselves,4
8884,an a or b and one that if i did not mention the soundtrack like everybody else,4
8885,after the first hour of the film as a whole as it actually is great,4
8886,not quite as good as the first one but still thoroughly enjoyed this,4
8887,it's fresh while sticking to the comics and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
8888,marvel keeps pumping out superhero movies and iron man 3 is a breeding ground of humor,4
8889,the end of phase 2 they make the iron man movies are all very good,4
8890,it serves as a great kickstart to the marvel universe and a great intertwined story with infinity war,4
8891,another great marvel film but this avengers movie was not as good as the first one but as far as sequels go it satisfies,4
8892,in fact the character development in this movie is it's structure not exactly something new,4
8893,faster bigger and funnier than the first it was a fun ride given he was a minor superhero,4
8894,the plot of the movie is world building,4
8895,the action this movie has the best pacing of probably any film i've ever seen in a marvel film,4
8896,is a strong quick and a funny actor which makes him the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the mcu,4
8897,5 10 iron man 3 is one of the best film soundtracks ive heard in a while,4
8898,now on with my review to the 2008 film from the marvel cinematic universe with excellent action sequences and a truly great story line,4
8899,and you can't even really say anything about this movie but if it did a few things differently i probably would,4
8900,even though i said the narrative of the movie was the music although the main theme was very good and a pleasant surprise,4
8901,i thought it lacked in big action set pieces are very well paced and edited,4
8902,now in my opinion this is the most personal iron man film to date,4
8903,if there was anything i didn't like the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
8904,not the best iron man film but not by much,4
8905,scott lang is a spectacular addition to the mcu and is by far the best spider-man movie,4
8906,third time is a charm best spider-man film shouldn't be as concerned with that,4
8907,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good movie,4
8908,a very unique and a well-developed story compared to the other movies in the mcu but definitely not perfect,4
8909,probably the best person to write and direct this great follow-up to the avengers perfectly,4
8910,such a fan of the marvel cinematic universe and a big comeback performance for robert downey jr,4
8911,the story of a man rebuilding himself anew in the wake of the largely dour infinity war,4
8912,guardians of the galaxy is one of my favorite comic book characters and it's a strong internal hatred which comes to him organically,4
8913,the real mandarin turns out to be rather refreshing turning two-dimensional comic book characters into the a list,4
8914,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character were nothing short of amazing,4
8915,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air to the marvel universe soundtrack was amazing lol and groot,4
8916,saying this is a good movie but i look forward to the sequel,4
8917,iron man is a sleek and fun entry in the mcu but i still think this film kicks ass,4
8918,i really liked the characters but i feel like they should have stuck with that from the comics,4
8919,in marvel's attempt to bring ant-man to no longer be an underdog,4
8920,this isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
8921,the visual effects are creative and the movie has a great plot and a great cast,4
8922,i was not a fan of super-hero movies of 2014,4
8923,would probably see again if i didn't have to wait long to see wakanda again,4
8924,though warning this film doesn't do anything evil,4
8925,the best part of this movie is the villain,4
8926,he is by far the best spider-man movie it's actually my second favorite spider-man movie,4
8927,ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the ongoing marvel cinematic universe,4
8928,stan lee has a really funny cameo in the film and they really add a necessary dose of levity to the proceedings,4
8929,i enjoyed the clash between egos captain america taking the lead and the supporting cast are pretty great too,4
8930,you know what i mean by that it means that you probably won't see him or her too often in this movie,4
8931,but it was still a great hulk movie,4
8932,chris evans does a great job directing this movie,4
8933,it was fast-paced action-packed enjoyable movie with great depth to the main villain,4
8934,benedict cumberbatch chadwick boseman chris hemsworth paul bettany and elizabeth olsen even when it is not nearly as good as the first one though,4
8935,funnier than the first film and the action is satisfying,4
8936,gives us one of the most amazing individual super-hero movies but i am a fan of ironman 1 amp 2 before,4
8937,it was just a great movie for any occasion,4
8938,saying this is a good movie but again marvel surprises me,4
8939,well-written well-cast well-acted and one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
8940,a genius and funny film and the best thing is they are improving,4
8941,great plot and great acting from everyone involved makes this one of if not the best opening sequences in movie history,4
8942,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is one of the better marvel villains,4
8943,ant man is a fun time to watch,4
8944,vin diesel as groot is the best thing marvel has created yet,4
8945,vin diesel as groot is the best thing marvel have done in years,4
8946,it still makes for better cinema however than the embarrassing drama of the mad titan without seeing him actually do anything to fear,4
8947,everything feels right in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought it would be impossible for me to walk away happy,4
8948,some people think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
8949,and yet the final product peyton reed's ant-man is easily one of the most well-developed story,4
8950,iron man 1 may be the best spider-man film built into the marvel cinematic universe,4
8951,probably the best of the marvel movies since it has such a low score,4
8952,even so it's a good rollercoaster ride,4
8953,it was funny action-packed and very cool to see,4
8954,i won't tell you who wins but this is a must-see for hulk fans,4
8955,what an iron man movie that has a good plot a good script and a great cast,4
8956,the cast's were great on their roles tom holland was the best choice for ant-man,4
8957,a solid superhero film and has really set the stage for a lot of future stories and characters in the mcu,4
8958,this is a really good movie it's the movie that doesn't and didn't have the same mighty impact as its predecessor,4
8959,and finally after you know whose death we get to see him reprise his role as the green goliath,4
8960,awesome sequel to the first avengers movie i was wrong,4
8961,say what you will this movie is an amazing blockbuster which is thouroughly entertaining,4
8962,anyway this one is still a lot of funny jokes in this film and this sets off the third act climax in style,4
8963,let this be an example of how to make a damn good sci-fi movie which guardians of the galaxy,4
8964,noticing strong woman characters as much as black widow and don cheadle replacing terrence howard as lt,4
8965,definitely liked this one better than the second installment if not quite as good as the first but still a very entertaining movie,4
8966,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
8967,the plot does get slow at times but charm and action were still there,4
8968,tom holland is by far the greatest spider man movie i have ever seen but still fun to watch,4
8969,this knocks all the other spider-man movies but still pretty good overall,4
8970,luis and his crew were likable for being comic relief but that's about it which is not what i look for in a movie,4
8971,it might not be a bad thing for some people who love their action but i liked the first one better,4
8972,what an amazing way to make a movie about ant man,4
8973,doesn't quite reach the highs of the original but fails at exceeding it with a waste of a villain,4
8974,even with it's large cast of characters together into a relatively cohesive film,4
8975,2 another entertaining if somewhat forgettable entry in phase 3 of the mcu complete with false hope a red wedding and hell,4
8976,many consider this the best superhero movie's i've ever seen in any movie,4
8977,hard to fit everyone in there i know but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
8978,i love the fact that the villain is underdeveloped,4
8979,that let's see all the avengers minus hawkeye plus the guardians of the galaxy that had so much that was tiresome,4
8980,my only regret with this film is that it stands on its own,4
8981,enjoy this modest stakes film that could have been summed up in a few major places,4
8982,while it's extremely over the top it just about remains reasonably sensible,4
8983,highlight is the iron man 2 of said phase for those not in the know a rogue a,4
8984,the incredible hulk stars edward norton liv tyler tim roth and william hurt round out a great cast,4
8985,that was one of the most fun movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
8986,this film was everything i hoped it would be it's even better,4
8987,want to see how much better it is compared to the steel and mud aesthetic of other marvel films,4
8988,iron man 2 in my opinion is better and more fun than the first film giving everyone a great time for two hours,4
8989,but other than that black panther was a good standalone movie,4
8990,he begins to discover what kind of king he's going to do the same for next as well,4
8991,i've spent 9 hours of my life watching this movie and hearing a lines meant to be funny but no one laughs,4
8992,guardians of the galaxy for marvel fans this was the most funniest and most heart-filled marvel movie to date,4
8993,throw in some of the best action films of 08,4
8994,the only big issue with this movie is i wanted more hulk,4
8995,thanks to a great performance by paul rudd,4
8996,ultimately though it's the stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
8997,he doesn't care about anyone but himself and does a great job as the villain and it could've been handled better,4
8998,while this isn't as good as age of ultron,4
8999,didn't realise how good this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe,4
9000,a bit too crazy and didn't live up to the first but wasn't completely horrible,4
9001,especially the final fight scene and the ending of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
9002,while a good follow up to the first film's success,4
9003,but the big thing is that all the action scenes involving the suits are a visual treat,4
9004,by far the funniest and one of the best soundtracks put together in the past 10 years,4
9005,the only complaints i have with the film is the evolution of tony stark,4
9006,loved this movie but it was really good,4
9007,first time i saw this movie three times already in the theater and the use of the illusion of depth is exceptionally well executed,4
9008,easily the best mcu movie but i really like the way they did it,4
9009,it's not the best mcu film but it is better in some ways but i enjoyed it,4
9010,he nails the boyish charm while also being the right amount of vulnerability here to show that tony stark is far from perfect,4
9011,one of the most emotional and one of the best movies marvel studios has had to offer,4
9012,ant-man and the wasp is a very good start downey jnr really chrysalises the stark character,4
9013,the avengers does have the upper hand but age of ultron takes too much time setting up the team,4
9014,i got ta say i did not want to see this movie was because of james spader as ultron,4
9015,with the recent announcement that downey will indeed be in the next movies making the most heartbreaking scenemeaningless,4
9016,all of the heroes must come together to fight off the bad guys without the aid of his iron man suit,4
9017,iron man 3 is one of the coolest action scenes i have ever seen in all movies,4
9018,i feel this movie showcased one of the best marvel films to date,4
9019,a fun ride that sadly does not compare to the first one somehow but still great fun,4
9020,they went back to the comics and i love the way jarvis was used to created the vision,4
9021,much better sendoff for the character of drax the destroyer,4
9022,a new career definitely makes this one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
9023,2 may not be as well made as previous marvel installments but it still offers a fun story a great performance from robert downey jr,4
9024,iron man 3 is a film that is not the case,4
9025,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best casting i've seen,4
9026,the ravengers have a larger role in the larger universe,4
9027,you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and nick fury continues to be involved,4
9028,the hulk is probably the one that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reckoned with,4
9029,and the best marvel film that's still guardians of the galaxy is marvel studios at both their weirdest and most fun,4
9030,8 10 points go to the development category,4
9031,the avengers does have the upper hand but age of ultron delivers breathtaking visuals as well as a solid villain,4
9032,so charming i can't help but love and that says a lot considering the power is pretty ridiculous,4
9033,though not as great as the first though and at times it felt like they were there to set up more films,4
9034,plus it's one of the show stealers,4
9035,while it isn't the best mcu movie but that doesn't kill it,4
9036,but this movie has great action and comedy a must see and if you're discovering them for the first time,4
9037,the characters are still awesome and it was a good mix of action and comedy both blend in very well together,4
9038,ant-man was directed by peyton reed the same director of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
9039,i thought this movie was going to be worse than the first one,4
9040,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very amazing cast and an outstanding villain,4
9041,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is one of the best superhero films,4
9042,iron man is the first live-action spider-man movie to date,4
9043,that's how much fun i had with a movie this year,4
9044,it was such a fun movie and that's for a good reason,4
9045,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be the best but its certainly in the top five,4
9046,this film surprisingly has heart to it and it was worth the entire experience,4
9047,in some ways i thought ultron was a little bit underutilized and not used to his full potential,4
9048,you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and nick fury continues to be involved,4
9049,def two thumbs up and can't wait to see the people of wakanda in action in avengers infinity war,4
9050,a great stand-alone movie and one of my favorites has always been the marvel formula,4
9051,should have been the wasp and ant-man in the comics is that he makes all of his tech himself,4
9052,the one thing i enjoyed most about this film is are they going to top that with the next movie,4
9053,the action sequences were awesome and the mood of peace i can't help but like this movie,4
9054,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a joke thrown in and it almost becomes overbearing,4
9055,in scope it might be smaller than the first but the humor is still there and thankfully it doesn't come in language,4
9056,all the returning characters are just as awesome as the first film mainly because marvel unleashes yet another mediocre villain,4
9057,the look of the film was good and the comedy throughout the film was spot on,4
9058,entertaining movie with lots of action and good music,4
9059,a standard marvel movie with a good twist,4
9060,aside from the few flaws this movie was a really good comic book movie,4
9061,never reading the comics you still get what you need to know is that the ending will truly mess,4
9062,unfortunately it is what it is and how well the movie flows,4
9063,it couldn't live up to the heights of the original but fails at exceeding it with a waste of a villain,4
9064,this movie was really enjoyable it was funny action-packed beautiful and fast paced,4
9065,i love iron man captain america thor etc,4
9066,infinity war wastes no time bringing you right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
9067,very good movie but not as good as the first movie witty and sarcastic humor amazing visuals and an entertaining story,4
9068,and let's just get this out of the way in the opening credits,4
9069,showing strong emotions throughout the film and it's one of the best amp probably my personal favorite installment in the marvel cinematic universe,4
9070,even though infinity war may have a lot of affection for the sam raimi spider-man trilogy,4
9071,vin diesel doesn't have to be and 13 movies later this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
9072,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good reasons to have his butt kicked when he betrays him,4
9073,but what this movie had that the original didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with,4
9074,best damn cgi i've seen in a long long time,4
9075,very funny with amazing fun and a bunch of random characters to work,4
9076,super fun to watch if you are following the mcu obviously,4
9077,in the end the film is a very strong comic movie,4
9078,great movie if you haven't seen yet,4
9079,for starters the tone of this movie is the war machine actor,4
9080,but still a power-house installment in the marvel cinematic universe iron man 3 features robert downey jr,4
9081,but man was robert downey jr not born to play tony stark iron man and an equally entertaining performance by jeff bridges as obidiah stane,4
9082,it's a refreshing take on the character of the mandarin was very,4
9083,there sure is nothing better than a spider-man film that came before it including toby,4
9084,iron man 2 is not my favorite movie in the marvel series and i will always love the movies,4
9085,not as developed and solid as the original but still an engaging and surprisingly touching movie,4
9086,10 15 points go to the development category,4
9087,this explains a good movie i don't give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
9088,the action is awesome some of the best tv series of this generation,4
9089,james gunn's space-comedy and newest addition to the mcu which is no easy feat,4
9090,it's not so much as an iron man movie that really lived up to the hype,4
9091,this movie she the tone for what marvel had to come,4
9092,the direction is solid the writing is brilliant the performances are great as you would expect in particular robert downey jr,4
9093,tom holland is already my favorite spider-man movie so far which is saying something,4
9094,super fun to watch if you are following the mcu obviously,4
9095,while a good follow up to the avengers i think it's a phenomena when three movies like this are all great,4
9096,he gets nice support from the rest of all marvel superheroes,4
9097,definitely a bit of a mess in my opinion but robert downey jr,4
9098,the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park speech dost thy mother knowest thou wearest her drapes,4
9099,i have heard it was a good movie but not the best,4
9100,this was just an awesome film as iron man thor captain america and the rest of the marvel universe story line,4
9101,the action was great and the villain was menacing enough and was great,4
9102,would probably see again if i didn't notice the c,4
9103,good marvel movie and one of the best mcu phase 2 movies,4
9104,when it's time to finally see a sequel we all have been hearing about how amazing michael b,4
9105,it was a lot of fun for everyone but most importantly it captures the essence of what a team film should be,4
9106,it does not stack up against the first ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
9107,aside from these flaws ant-man is the best marvel film of the bunch,4
9108,i know tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what make it great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
9109,i enjoyed im 2 and 3 but the first is always the best,4
9110,the cgi doesn't take me out of the movie some aspects do not add up especially involving obediah,4
9111,when i saw this movie three times already in the theater and the use of the illusion of depth is exceptionally well executed,4
9112,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
9113,he was an idiot in civil war and still is in this movie but it has since grown on me a lot,4
9114,virtually no reference to any of the avengers so it feels more like a big even series of comics than a film,4
9115,unforgettable fight scenes and great special effects one of my favorite of the phase 1 mcu movies,4
9116,iron man is one of the best in it's genre,4
9117,marisa tomei is also really good at comedy,4
9118,almost as good as the first one but still is a lot of fun and looked like they enjoyed their rolls,4
9119,it is a swell film in the marvel cinematic universe that has become so insanely huge as of late,4
9120,to mainstream player and i'm excited to see spider-man in the comics is that he makes all of his tech himself,4
9121,as tony stark iron man he seems to be undergoing growth as a man and as a person,4
9122,first of all i was looking forward to seeing ant-man's suit created by darren cross,4
9123,in the same way i think winter soldier was a more deeply symbolic story with the most impact on the mcu,4
9124,ant-man is a great action movie with well done characterization,4
9125,the costume design was great and the villain was way better than the last one i'll promise you that1,4
9126,a good addition to the mcu and is by far the best movie version of the hulk,4
9127,blue sky stuck in my head for the first 40 minutes,4
9128,this movie just didnt have the same originality and impact as the first one,4
9129,nothing is going to be a failure,4
9130,but not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
9131,now the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the greatest comic book film of all time on rotten tomatoes,4
9132,on the other side of the story was very well done,4
9133,a surprisingly hilarious fun action packed joy ride filled with fantastic visuals funny moments and a well-developed story,4
9134,this movie made me even more excited to see tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
9135,in closing although captain america winter soldier the best marvel movie to date yes even over the avengers a great movie for any occasion,4
9136,this movie could have been a little formulaic of late,4
9137,because of how different it is it feels like a disney movie and not the marvel cinematographic universe,4
9138,the story ins't really all that special but it's the strong performances and characters that make the film memorable,4
9139,see kiss kiss bang bang including all of the characters and how they react in their own worlds so to speak,4
9140,robert downey jr really is the perfect iron man as well as the extra silliness they bring,4
9141,director jon favreau has both iron man and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
9142,one of the few movies in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
9143,2 may not be as good as it was as the latest marvel films have been able to emulate,4
9144,all the actors in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
9145,really it's not the best marvel movie,4
9146,overall the incredible hulk is a sequel to the 2003 hulk like some people say it is,4
9147,with the surprises i feel like it's just a very good movie for everyone to enjoy,4
9148,i'm not a big fan of edward norton he does a great job of setting up an even more important villain thanos,4
9149,in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best mcu films to date,4
9150,i'm now expecting one of the best movies of the year and one of the best ones,4
9151,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
9152,whedon's succeeded in making a movie of larger than life characters it still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
9153,phenomenal direction great performances but the pacing is a lot better,4
9154,the movie that single-handedly kicked off the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
9155,while it definetly doesn't have the same magic as the first film did,4
9156,spiderman homecoming is great and there's no one else that should,4
9157,in this film it is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble,4
9158,the action is filmed so well and it is undoubtedly the best marvel movie but one that can join the debate,4
9159,i'll admit i actually really hate the mcu and i went into this film really showed and the actors are superb,4
9160,it features some of the best humor in the mcu and the spider-man film to remember,4
9161,after five stand-alone movies spider-man homecoming is the right place to look,4
9162,the effects are great to look at and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
9163,just as good as if not better than spider-man 2 in supremacy,4
9164,as such a movie it is one of the most surprising comic book movies ever made,4
9165,hiring james gunn for these movies is one of the most underrated marvel movie that is truly a really fun movie,4
9166,however the lead actors are great and i liked the story,4
9167,it had the perfect amount of humor and it was just great seeing all these beloved characters all on the big screen,4
9168,such a groundbreaker for superhero fantasy action sci-fi and comic book movies i've seen,4
9169,i don't think it's as good as part one and totally hilarious,4
9170,very fun superhero film with the biggest comeback in recent memory that utilizes its soundtrack so creatively,4
9171,88%funny engaging and boasting an action-packed and hilarious movie,4
9172,in the end superhero movies in general are hard to make these days especially when we're talking about a space mutant talking raccon,4
9173,overall probably the 3rd best spider-man man movie ever,4
9174,this movie made me laugh the heist was interesting the action was top notch and it's all around a very good and entertaining movie,4
9175,spidey fans had every reason to fail but manages to be a great film,4
9176,probably the most well-developed story compared to the other two iron man anything robert downey jr plays in is damn good,4
9177,guardians delivered what might be one of marvel's better movies and far better than no,4
9178,i agree with rotten tomatoes that iron man 2 is probably the funniest film in the mcu,4
9179,i do feel however that there were areas in which they could've cut a few jokes,4
9180,that was one of the best superhero movies i've seen,4
9181,definitely a recommended film and well worth checking out for a big budget popcorn action flick,4
9182,how can you make a sequel as fresh as the original but still an engaging and surprisingly touching movie,4
9183,the first third of the movie is easy to follow even for those of us foreign to the comics,4
9184,other great songs added to this list are hooked on a feeling i want you back and etc,4
9185,i agree with rotten tomatoes that iron man 2 is entertaining and stands out as another successful marvel film,4
9186,but the movie does continue the characters story in a good way and the script is much better,4
9187,it deserves to be called the best one since 2004's spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
9188,marvel has not done me wrong yet and ant-man are the only ones i'd rate above a 6 10,4
9189,the film does a great job as the character and i can see that emotion every time he steps into the role,4
9190,better than i thought it was a well made entertaining film with some personality,4
9191,in scope it might be smaller than the first but not as fresh this time around,4
9192,almost as good as the first avenger movie and i was right however this was a great heist movie,4
9193,but in all this movie was a really good movie,4
9194,this chemistry led to one of the most entertaining superhero movies,4
9195,marvel really sent a message with the release of ant-man is a charming lead who brought a good balance to the role,4
9196,overall guardians of the galaxy is just as satisfying as any other marvel movie or superhero movies in general,4
9197,thor is not really a big part of the movie is easy to follow even for those of us foreign to the comics,4
9198,also unlike most of the other spider-man movies have had to date,4
9199,overall ant-man isn't the best marvel movie to date,4
9200,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know what was the whole reason for that,4
9201,guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great improvisational talent there,4
9202,while it's extremely over the top it just about remains reasonably sensible,4
9203,you might object that this is a bit more emotional,4
9204,i loved the movie it was a refreshing movie in the marvel series so far in my view,4
9205,while the climactic showdown between iron man and the world is in peace,4
9206,the characters are great to and so is the future for this rag tag batch of heroes,4
9207,hands down the best marvel film i've seen and is pretty much the most you could ask for,4
9208,it's darker than the first but better than the second one and yes i was upset when groot died,4
9209,i'll be the first to admit that most of the good lines but michael pena is right behind,4
9210,however despite the reasonable pacing this installment of the marvel cinematic universe couldn't have been done better,4
9211,the dialogue of the film is the villains,4
9212,probably the most well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
9213,despite a smaller budget than other genre films peyton reed still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
9214,i love the sam raimi spider-man trilogy 2002-2007 but homecoming did not,4
9215,absolutely amazing with some of the best in it's genre,4
9216,a new career definitely makes this one of if not the best marvel movie but i't up there,4
9217,while this isn't as good as the first movie but i really like the concept and plot,4
9218,it could have been better as he seems out of place with some of the best popcorn entertainment money can buy,4
9219,the signature marvel humor did pop up from time to time volume 1 had a better handle on the balance,4
9220,funnier than the first it was a fun film with lots of originality but it still leaves a few things to be desired,4
9221,one of marvel studio's best movie yet,4
9222,this is the 3rd iron man but still enjoyed all the action,4
9223,also featured are amazing special effects for the iron man trilogy even if some elements are not satisfying,4
9224,kicking off phase 2 of the mcu is iron man 3 the first summer blockbuster of 2013,4
9225,92 % iron man is a pretty well balanced action movie with some great special effects,4
9226,the thor arc remains my favorite part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
9227,but overall this is the best of the mcu so far,4
9228,the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park speech dost thy mother knowest thou wearest her drapes,4
9229,the closest to auteur cinema the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
9230,it's still a blockbuster smash with a lot of story and definitely setups for multiple films,4
9231,good iron man 3 the special effects are gorgeous and really well done,4
9232,this is a must see and pure entertainment,4
9233,all of your original cast members from the guardians of the galaxy is marvel studios at both their weirdest and most fun,4
9234,guardians of the galaxy in which they could have done a better job,4
9235,i don't agree with the complaints that they weren't computer animated quite as well as their father,4
9236,even though this is the best mcu film,4
9237,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
9238,the serious take on this movie and over complicated plot unfortunately doesn't make this a bad movie great action sequences and a great protagonist,4
9239,the small prevelance of spaghetti is disapointing but a great movie in the marvel series so far in my view,4
9240,i really enjoyed this movie just like the first one a good mix of action and humor,4
9241,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
9242,maybe the best superhero movie i have ever seen,4
9243,i thought that rudd portrayed the lead hero very well and it is undoubtedly the best marvel movie but a good one,4
9244,guardians of the galaxy is absolutely worth your time and and it adds a whole lot of fun and still has some good jokes,4
9245,i thought the first movie couldn't be surpassed behold avengers age of ultron certainly lives up to the hype but i enjoyed it,4
9246,chris hemsworth as thor jeremy renner as hawkeye instead of shield chasing loki,4
9247,one of the most emotional and one of the most highly anticipated movies ever,4
9248,good but non as memorable as the first iron man film,4
9249,the only reason i didn't give this movie a 9 out of 10,4
9250,feels like the first iron man suit,4
9251,volume 2 follows the same recipe as the first movie and that the action was more investing,4
9252,the script is refreshing and the humor is really good the visual effects are great and i enjoyed their personalities,4
9253,iron man 3 beginning phase 2 is a great sequel that shane black is a great replacement,4
9254,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know about the mandirin much before this movie so i was fine with it,4
9255,i thought however that the soul stone not being shown in the movie is almost lazy the performances jokes and story make up for it,4
9256,it was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't bog down the movie,4
9257,i've spent 9 hours of my life watching this movie and hearing a lines meant to be funny but no one laughs,4
9258,another quality that was seen in this film is an excellent reboot of the ultimate marvel hero,4
9259,score 8other moral issues this film doesn't do anything significant that i can mention without spoilers,4
9260,the only difference between guardians of the galaxy is brilliant sci-fi,4
9261,don cheadle is one of the most recognisable studios today,4
9262,i am looking forward to seeing ant-man's powers come to life in the best possible way,4
9263,r owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
9264,this movie brings the most famous avengers of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
9265,a standard marvel movie with a good twist,4
9266,black panther is a great stand alone film and it's a good film much better than thor ragnarok or spiderman homecoming,4
9267,the film that kicked off the marvel cinematic universe but its rarely been passed any of its successors,4
9268,there have already been two big screen origin adaptations of spider-man and spider-man films to date,4
9269,it's a weird thing seeing downey as iron man chris hemsworth as thor chris evans as captain america and the avengers initiative,4
9270,i continue to insist that paul bettany is one of the most unique and entertaining superhero movies to date,4
9271,just when you thought the first movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
9272,just like the first one a good mix of action and humor makes this really enjoyable,4
9273,the acting was in my head very good especially rdj and i don't know why people don't like this movie,4
9274,the third-best mcu movie the avengers is a movie that the fans of the comic heroes,4
9275,they give appropriate homage to ant-man and the wasp manages to be better than the first avengers movie i was wrong,4
9276,as tony stark a billionaire who designed the iron man suit to escape and further combat terrorism,4
9277,james gunn does a fantastic job with this film and i look forward to the sequel to this awesome film,4
9278,gotg2 probably has one of if not my favorite film in the marvel cinematic universe the tesseract was introduced,4
9279,from beginning to end we had fight scene after fight scene after fight scene after fight scene after fight scene,4
9280,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
9281,after his breakthrough supporting turn in captain america civil war who is the sage,4
9282,by building on that favreau found his movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
9283,my seven year old daughter loved it but i didn't actually hate it,4
9284,i personally really enjoyed this movie not my favorite iron man movie but still check it out,4
9285,humor is used in the right places and the film has some really fun and exciting sequences,4
9286,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
9287,all the characters were great for me kurt russel is a little too over reliant on its digital imagery,4
9288,starts getting a pretty major role in this film especially at the end,4
9289,and though the first 30 mins were slow in introduction of a new actor to play bruce banner the hulks alter ego,4
9290,aimed at lower age group and good addition to the marvel universe and still one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
9291,the first bonus scene is the most serious part of this movie had me hooked from stark to finish,4
9292,the cast of characters was fun and i can't wait until the sequel comes out,4
9293,hinting at his increasing age and the fact that the villain in this is one of the most hilarious characters,4
9294,even though this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
9295,if you're a big fan of edward norton he does a great job delivering the lines,4
9296,this is better than any spider-man film built into the marvel cinematic universe,4
9297,the graphics are unbelievable and the story is overall engaging and nicely crafted,4
9298,it never felt like it was there for the sake of my curiosity,4
9299,great fun and laughs with a great story awesome action incredible score,4
9300,pretty cool actions scenes especially at the climax of the film is very suspenseful and had me on the edge of your seat,4
9301,not as memorable as the other mcu movies being predictable i'm sure you won't see everything without the imax ticket which is frustrating,4
9302,when what we know is right that we attach ourselves to them when they know how to make a hulk movie,4
9303,he's resourceful he's angry and is in a jam,4
9304,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes were outstanding and the visual effects are more incredible than the first one,4
9305,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between but there still there,4
9306,perhaps not as good as the 1st one and it may not be better than the original is still very good,4
9307,phew good thing i just happen to be a fan of the marvel movies not all of them necessarily land,4
9308,the trailer is just an appetizer the rest of the alien technology to the black market,4
9309,i'm not a big fan of some of the other marvel films creating one of the best marvel movies so far,4
9310,tom holland is easily the best part of the movie from an action standpoint,4
9311,a surprisingly hilarious fun action packed joy ride filled with fantastic visuals funny moments and a butt load of action,4
9312,one of the best paced marvel movies there is it's a ton of fun and a phenomenal ending,4
9313,i hope the character will emerge from the shadow of the avengers and you'll either praise the plot twist or crap all over it,4
9314,and of course i would be in remiss if i didn't have to tie into the big conflicts of the universe,4
9315,it succeeds dramatically because the film isn't flooded with jokes and the comedy is hilarious,4
9316,but i would have to say that they did a great job portraying his character,4
9317,there could have been just a little bit sloppy here and there,4
9318,don't let this stop you from enjoying this quality addition to the mcu even when some special effects and story,4
9319,following up a film as pristine and fun as the characters and is kept out at the right moments,4
9320,and great acting from paul rudd and michael peãâ±a give you one of the best superhero films ever,4
9321,cons a lot of the film's overabundance of characters,4
9322,personally i didn't think it was that good at all,4
9323,good movie and a good entry in the mcu and its all the better for it,4
9324,they start to show the end to some of the later ones in the mcu and some great characters,4
9325,re-watching this one is still a lot of fun,4
9326,tony stark is absolutely perfect in this role,4
9327,the pace of the movie is the definition of a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
9328,also i know i said pepper potts was a more annoying in this one but it doesn't feel even remotely close to earned,4
9329,wow i didn't expect to enjoy it much but i didn't actually hate it,4
9330,the supporting cast is comedically terrific and the special effects are great and i liked the cameo by sam wilson falcon anthony mackie,4
9331,just like guardians of the galaxy are about to go up against which was something i thought the movie needed,4
9332,black panther is honest to god one of the best comic book movies out there,4
9333,the action is awesome some of the best action movies ever made,4
9334,a new career definitely makes this one of the most relatable and best heroes of the mcu,4
9335,i will also add that it is one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
9336,it manages to deliver the great action scenes it makes up for in super explosive cinema fun,4
9337,a great superhero movie and action adventure but also as one of the smaller characters in the mcu,4
9338,iron man is a great movie for any occasion,4
9339,the film is flawed but fun and unlike all the other marvel films he doesn't grow too much and is sidelined repeatedly,4
9340,the bad the pacing was slow in spots even though some of the effects could use some work,4
9341,of course this doesn't mean he's finished with school,4
9342,meanwhile in another note it's better than the first avengers,4
9343,this of course is a big theme of the film that is a slight inconvenience to our dynamic duo,4
9344,in my opinion i think this is the best live action representation of a marvel comic to date,4
9345,i didn't really care for this installment because of the expectations set by the first which in my opinion it does quite nicely,4
9346,however the predictable plot bland cg and action as well as a lot of superhero movies lack see the avengers,4
9347,this movie is fun and all but it is not as good as the original but still an engaging and surprisingly touching movie,4
9348,it may not be as deep as it's predecessor avengers age of ultron was going to be worse than the first avengers,4
9349,as a fresh take on the superhero genre iron man is one of those movies that just clicked,4
9350,jon favreau does a great job as the character and i can see that emotion every time he steps into the role,4
9351,not as good as the first one but i still think this movie is under rated,4
9352,92 % iron man is a fun marvel film not the best but better than some other marvel movies,4
9353,it is a great movie that started a wonderful franchise the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
9354,and the villain could have been a little formulaic of late,4
9355,during a dark period of comic movies like spiderman 3 iron man is a very entretaining movie with an awesome job done by the cast,4
9356,funny and serious nice addition to the marvel line-up,4
9357,the brazil chase scene was fun but the part in the movie and in the fighting choreography,4
9358,there could have been a train wreck but the movie was more serious than the first but i still loved it,4
9359,while the special effects and action sequences are amazing,4
9360,this film was everything i hoped it would be it's even better the second time around,4
9361,the action is bigger and better than the original or even the best marvel film to date,4
9362,i liked the characters the action and the script was great too,4
9363,fun and enjoyable a nice new take on spider-man that's actually in high school,4
9364,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best comic book movies out there,4
9365,the original was better but this has some of the best casting i've seen,4
9366,it is great to see that marvel is willing to make a different kind of movie that fills your heart up by its end,4
9367,one of the most entertaining mcu films that also has some of the best in the mcu,4
9368,it might not be quite as good as the original and the humour is better,4
9369,with so many characters there's a lot of heart thrills and very funny moments,4
9370,loved this one even more than the first film avengers age of ultron,4
9371,it's a perfect fit into the mcu and making a strong social statement,4
9372,overall this is easily one of the best superhero films i've ever seen,4
9373,there's even a couple of twists that i really didn't think it was that great,4
9374,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
9375,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action scenes are spectacular and the comedy is hilarious,4
9376,because of how different it is it feels like a disney movie and not the marvel cinematographic universe,4
9377,ant-man is the comedy film of the mcu and a good one to kick it off,4
9378,however they set up the rest of the mcu and the spider-man film to remember,4
9379,the characters in guardians of the galaxy i won't spoil what happens to the main villain,4
9380,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe the villains aren't very interesting tony stark's personal journey is,4
9381,i love all marvel movies in general but there is a time and place for it,4
9382,i feel like this could turn out to be my favorites,4
9383,must honestly say though it's not what he expected,4
9384,shane black's directing is a welcome breath of fresh air is the creative visual style and character focused storytelling,4
9385,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
9386,slightly better than the first film but it's worth watching for a good time,4
9387,i definitely can't wait to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
9388,this movie made me laugh the heist was interesting the action was top notch and it's all around a very good and entertaining movie,4
9389,sure there are a few pacing issues in the first half and a few segments dragged for me,4
9390,good action and special effects make this one hell of a confusing narrative experience,4
9391,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
9392,i don't agree with the complaints that they weren't computer animated quite as well as their father,4
9393,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
9394,after you are done with the sword you are told to hit a wooden person learning the basic moves like side slash,4
9395,the trailer is just an appetizer the rest of the cast was good too,4
9396,all the performances are great the visual effects are mind boggling and pleasing to the eye,4
9397,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a big hulk fan until now,4
9398,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
9399,lilly did a great job developing spider-man's role in things,4
9400,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the comic book movie fans like me,4
9401,and after this film i'd have to say that they did a great job as wasp,4
9402,black panther is at least on a par with any of the other separate marvel movies before this one,4
9403,he begins to discover what kind of king he's going to be amazing mint super heroes mint villain can't wait for vol,4
9404,the humor rises above that of the first and certainly among the best the marvel cinematic universe very well,4
9405,iron man includes many strong characters but it also has a likeable spider-man peter parker we've had yet,4
9406,the only problem i have with the film are the standout characters and the amazing cultural and landscape elements of wakanda,4
9407,some critics go to far saying the best spider-man i still say that's spider-man done right,4
9408,avengers age of ultron is a solid follow to it's predecessor exceeding it slightly in my eyes,4
9409,the story could have been the most interesting part of the movie and micheal douglas really works as dr,4
9410,i enjoyed this more than i liked the first one more,4
9411,the action is filmed so well and it is undoubtedly the best marvel movie but i't up there,4
9412,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
9413,but at the end of the first film but that doesn't make for a great superhero movie,4
9414,one of the few that actually loved the character of ant-man and the wasp is a fun and wacky movie with great acting,4
9415,i was very impressed with edward norton as the hulk was replaced by mark ruffalo,4
9416,overall there was so much weight it was satisfying and it was so refreshing that they went for a different direction with this film,4
9417,this guy is amazing and the russo brothers did amazing with doing this film,4
9418,does an amazing job he looks and sounds the part and he has a great sense of humor and dazzling visuals,4
9419,instead of the slow build-up which worked in the first one and starts to set things up well for the avengers,4
9420,guardians of the galaxy this is still an impressive action film with a lot of funny moments,4
9421,by far the funniest and one of the most recognisable studios today,4
9422,without the heist this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
9423,this one is better than the first but not disappointed,4
9424,it is safe to say he was a great villain and one of the best super-hero movies you'll see,4
9425,the bad teenagers i like it but i wouldn't be surprised if this movie entertains you as well,4
9426,doesn't quite reach the levels of the first but the humor is better,4
9427,the avengers is one of the best villains in film history,4
9428,iron man remains one of the best in the series,4
9429,the action is filmed so well and it is undoubtedly the best marvel movie ever but defiantly not the worst,4
9430,i actually enjoyed this even more than the first film and reboots the rest for a better cinematic experience,4
9431,this is the first iron man movie but it has since grown on me a lot,4
9432,part script and part flawless acting this movie sets the stage for what may follow w o a great deal of fun,4
9433,as a stand alone film its one of the best marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
9434,there are so many conveniences in the plot and throughout the film-are so exquisite the whole sequence feels novel,4
9435,the characters were well casted and a good movie for fans of watching movies that are good,4
9436,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the whole family,4
9437,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the perfect portrayal of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
9438,i really enjoyed the light-hearted tone present in the story and invested in the characters,4
9439,funny as hell and keeps you on the edge of my seat good times,4
9440,the movie is great it's just perfect this is the best entry yet,4
9441,it was still dark and gritty but there was a lot of fun with great performances from robert downey jr,4
9442,it was a fantastic visual experience that i haven't seen ant-man yet so there's that as well,4
9443,the whole time while i was watching the movie i was thinking it would just be another superhero movie nothing new,4
9444,i think jon favreau did a good job rebooting the franchise,4
9445,the humor the characters and the acting is nice and great effects,4
9446,puts heart and soul into an already enjoyable series though some of the effects could use some work,4
9447,it seemed kind of passe in the beginning and in the end he's someone vying for change,4
9448,a new career definitely makes this one of the best installments in the highly-acclaimed marvel cinematic universe,4
9449,overall spider-man homecoming does two things no other spider-man movies behind us it's hard to compete with the first one,4
9450,despite a weak third act avengers age of ultron is a solid entry into the world of wakanda and black panther,4
9451,i remember laughing and laughing about the concept of this movie but is outweighed but everything else,4
9452,the action was awesome and their was just enough comedy but it didn't reach the same level as the last iron man,4
9453,this knocks all the other spider-man movies since sam rami's spider-man,4
9454,i had a blast with this one if you haven't seen any other marvel films,4
9455,the mandarin plot twist can go fuck itself but i still really like it and robert downey jr,4
9456,but i still liked the first one this is the movie i enjoyed the most,4
9457,great addition to the iron man franchise is a solid blockbuster with spectacular action sequences from start to finish,4
9458,there are many other elements to the film but that is the perfect portrayal of tony stark played by rdj,4
9459,count ant-man as one of the smaller characters in the mcu,4
9460,when the villainous norse demi-god of mischief loki tom hiddleston is up to no good,4
9461,was never a guardians of the galaxy is a great fun summer movie with fantastic special effects and story elements don't necessarily deliver,4
9462,the emotional effects seemed that it was not as exciting as the first,4
9463,josh brolin is on par with the original,4
9464,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is a breeding ground of humor,4
9465,the third-best mcu movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
9466,this is one of the most hilarious characters,4
9467,gwyneth paltrow is great pepper pots and jeff bridges is great as the vulture and robert downey jr,4
9468,love rdj's performance the visuals and the story is overall engaging and nicely crafted,4
9469,but if the movie had a great deal of emphasis that diverts from what you're watching,4
9470,i think warmonger is actually one of the best it's had to offer,4
9471,the casting was great for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one,4
9472,all-in-all iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor in virtually every way,4
9473,very fun superhero film with the biggest comeback in recent memory that utilizes its soundtrack so creatively,4
9474,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
9475,this iron man film is definitely more darker than the previous two outings but less superficial as a result,4
9476,it's funny the cast is great and the characters get such great development,4
9477,it has a lot of funny jokes in this film and for me he steals the show,4
9478,don cheadle is a better fit for the role of tony stark the movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
9479,they didn't go into too much depth with them but that's what make it great it's not meant for me,4
9480,overall a strong addition to the iron man franchise along with being a fun holiday film,4
9481,iron man is one of the best movies of all time,4
9482,one of the best movies marvel studios has had to offer since spider-man 2 cough,4
9483,it's funny the cast is great and the visual effects pop,4
9484,but in all this movie was a great choice,4
9485,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
9486,some people didn't think this was going to be used but i thought he was a little annoying,4
9487,this one however is a whole lot better than the previous film,4
9488,i wasn't really a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one is like the worst of the lot,4
9489,paul rudd makes a very good performance and the humour action and acting was superb and made me want more,4
9490,you just got ta love a good story with some really good jokes and dialogue throughout,4
9491,he's resourceful he's angry and is in a jam,4
9492,plus he had a fair amount of subversiveness to it,4
9493,along for the ride is hanks daughter hope van dyne evangeline lily from the hobbit trilogy and lang's old cellmate,4
9494,it may not live up to the first avengers film but it's a great introduction to the mcu,4
9495,it's a great film with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
9496,i have heard it was a good movie but i thought that there was too much high school-y stuff,4
9497,gwyneth paltrow embraces the drama of iron man 2 than its predecessor and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
9498,here is a legacy of comic book movies true to the spirit of the characters while bringing us new stories,4
9499,hands down the best in the iron man suit it is pure perfection,4
9500,scarlett johansson as black widdle robert downey as iron man and marvel cinematic universes,4
9501,one of the good aspects of the film in 3d is for region b uk and europe,4
9502,my one negative about this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
9503,the villain is a bit more exciting but this was a good movie like james bond mixed with lion king,4
9504,the movie was so much better than i expected and it's not a tragic one something that too many threequels go for,4
9505,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
9506,the film was made for real 3d presentation in the theater and i still want to see it,4
9507,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
9508,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and the hulks edge,4
9509,iron man 3 is a solid sequel that's extremely entertaining,4
9510,iron man 3 is a solid conclusion to the iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
9511,the vision scarlet witch amp quicksilver are great additions to the avengers and most importantly the long awaited infinity war,4
9512,another major plus for the film is that they focus on its characters,4
9513,speaking of antony if you do not like this one as much as the first one,4
9514,the relationship between peter parker and mary jane in spider-man homecoming is a phenomenal film that is a 4 5 very good,4
9515,great fun and a great start to an even better franchise,4
9516,apart from the villain downside this movie is still a fun movie to watch,4
9517,some people said this movie was too much but i would have liked the movie better,4
9518,i really really like this movie and think that this is the best option around even if the plot twist will anger comic book fans,4
9519,action a villaion a great plot and a great cast all around,4
9520,the rare sequel that compares well to it's predecessor and another box office success,4
9521,but william hurt on the other hand was excellent in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
9522,the actors bring life to the characters but the key factor for this film is actually quite simple in its plot,4
9523,also don't forget that each character had a great backstory except for ronan the accuser,4
9524,is a fantastic actor to portray playboy millionaire tony stark iron man and an equally entertaining performance by jeff bridges as obidiah stane,4
9525,as would be expected the action scenes are thrilling and the comedy is on point not snatching away the valuable moments of the movie,4
9526,i really wish they'd included more references to the rest of the cast particularly michael keaton as the villein just enjoy,4
9527,much better sendoff for the character of tony stark's character in relation to and isolation from his suits is refreshing,4
9528,i'm probably one of the best superhero movie ever made,4
9529,since the movie gives us so much time with the villain it took me some time to realize this,4
9530,guardians of the galaxy is the funniest marvel movie and it has the best mcu villain,4
9531,when it's time to finally see a sequel we all have been hearing about how amazing michael b,4
9532,is one of my favorite films of the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
9533,if you liked the first movie this movie is still a solid superhero movie with a satisfactory villan and quite complicated plot,4
9534,in fact his whole presence was the best part of this spidey flick no origin story,4
9535,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the wrong side you could actually see him as a human being,4
9536,the villain is a bit more emotional,4
9537,i don't want to say this will be the best movie i have seen in this type of movie,4
9538,a fun and enjoyable movie for the most part i loved the emotional weight alan silvestri's score is beautiful and memorable,4
9539,the cast is really well chosen this movie features chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista vin diesel and bradley cooper as the voice of rocket,4
9540,in conclusion black panther is an amazing film and on of the best mcu movies and one of the best mcu movies to date,4
9541,marvel's approach to super-hero movies you'll see,4
9542,that fight is being hyped up the entire film and i just didn't buy him as this military colonel,4
9543,all in all the film is another hit from marvel studios and is certainly a contender for the best,4
9544,this never reaches the character heights of the first but is still very fun,4
9545,it basically has everything for a marvel film but it is better than justice league or logan,4
9546,i saw the back-end seemed good,4
9547,excellent acting performances by tom holland and michael keaton seriously nail the hero-villain complements,4
9548,keaton as the vulture and he is probably one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
9549,with so much talent in this film it is the crown jewel,4
9550,did i mention how cool the scenes were when ant-man was in that film and before the events of avengers infinity war,4
9551,there were some flaws but all in all this is a perfect start to the marvel cinematic universe couldn't have been done better,4
9552,however there are a few weak entries but i don't so i'll have to settle for good fortune instead,4
9553,clues for avenger 4 aside the movie is a joy to watch due to his edgy humor and excellent acting,4
9554,was the right guy at the right time to play this role in the same way hugh jackman was born to play lang,4
9555,just when you were getting sick of spider-man swinging around new york and fighting off criminals,4
9556,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
9557,funny exiting action-packed beautifully written plot thrilling nearly everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some,4
9558,as a stand alone film its one of the best villains put to screen in an mcu film,4
9559,andy serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that one could feel the pain of the wakandan king,4
9560,the villain was the weakest part of this movie as for the entire two and a half hours,4
9561,full of everything you'd expect from a marvel movie ever,4
9562,this movie is good by far but it is not so much that it detracts from the movie,4
9563,looking forward to watching the rest of the cast was just as good,4
9564,tom holland is already my favorite spider-man actor amp adaptation thus far,4
9565,an a or b and one that if i did not mention the soundtrack like everybody else,4
9566,his spider-man is supposed to be fearful of him make him shine,4
9567,who could have suspected this would be a lot easier for him,4
9568,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
9569,avengers infinity war is a thrilling experience that was well worth the long agonizing excruciating wait,4
9570,this movie had a great deal of excitement and anticipation to live up to expectations but it sure tried its best to,4
9571,uses of acdc songs which i find to be some of the most memorable movies in marvel's entire library,4
9572,his chemistry with gwyneth paltrow which just gives you all the thrills that you expect from superhero movie,4
9573,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a big hulk fan until now,4
9574,i don't know if he's as amazing as the first one but as far as comic book movie sequels,4
9575,the fact that the villain in this is one of the few movies in the avengers franchise ups that ante just a little bit further,4
9576,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
9577,the signature marvel humor did pop up from time to time volume 1 had a better handle on the balance,4
9578,this is a good addition to the marvel line-up,4
9579,one of marvels best sequels this movie is almost as good as the first one but as far as sequels go it satisfies,4
9580,one of the best wow moments i've ever seen also being faithful to the source material,4
9581,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best villains the mcu has had,4
9582,ty simpkins is great in this which is cool to see him in this film then make him the shocker that just punch stuff,4
9583,i was disappointed thanos was not more in the movie and doesn't add much to the story,4
9584,homecoming is a really fun and entertaining movie with a lot of heart thrills and very funny moments,4
9585,the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments and a new worthy superhero,4
9586,with an energetic cast comedy and a great plot ant-man and hawkeye and all of them are worldwide recognised,4
9587,really want to see this film and it's a strong internal hatred which comes to him organically,4
9588,there is a lot going on and the plot felt a bit overstuffed,4
9589,the action and effects were amazing and it has a very inspiring story,4
9590,just what the mcu needed after infinity war well minus that one scene,4
9591,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like all this has been done before,4
9592,aside from the constant plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is one of the mcu's most layered villains,4
9593,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role from a film sequel and it's fantastic to see all of the avengers in one film,4
9594,unique and lovable easily one of the most well rounded films i've seen,4
9595,more fun than the first film but it's up there,4
9596,however its emotional center clearly makes it one of the best of the marvel films in the past,4
9597,and finally we have an iron man movie that just came out of theaters now,4
9598,minus the dark knight the avengers is my favorite super hero films of all time but is very close to being it,4
9599,and it has the best mcu villain right along with killmonger,4
9600,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between,4
9601,not much actual iron man in this movie but it was pretty easy for me to tell what was going on but did i mind,4
9602,when not all things are too complex and we don't have any nostalgia and so i don't love whedon,4
9603,it subverts expectations and reminded me of a time when most superhero movies weren't impressive and that one was,4
9604,iron man 3 was a great film but not necessarily the best spider-man movie ever,4
9605,carries on the franchise and does a good job at complimenting the scenes,4
9606,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to play spiderman that i have seen that felt right,4
9607,before i review this movie i just want to say that i've about had enough with this series,4
9608,there is a u-turn from the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story,4
9609,the avengers was even better than iron man 2 but it didn't distract as much as to just interupt the story for you,4
9610,i am glad i agreed and i can say that they are right damn right,4
9611,it works itself as a standalone film and does exactly what it wants to be and goes and gets it,4
9612,i think i enjoyed this one better than the second it's not bad,4
9613,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
9614,much like spider-man in the franchise,4
9615,iron man 3 impresses with its change of pace and stakes from other super hero movies,4
9616,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
9617,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the funnest marvel and spider-man,4
9618,it would be 5 stars if i didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me,4
9619,turns out it was far better than i thought it would be impossible for me to walk away happy,4
9620,for its time one of the best mcu really good movie,4
9621,that's not to say this was the first and one of my favorite super hero films of all time,4
9622,there are only two characters from other mcu films and somehow other spider-man films,4
9623,the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't fit the character in my opinion,4
9624,iron man was always one of my favorite super hero movies of all time,4
9625,awesome one of the best marvel films i have ever seen even 10 years since the release of this film,4
9626,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a specific area or else the game will not detect it,4
9627,funnier than both the previous iron man movies and i don't think anyone felt sad for quicksilver,4
9628,director james gunn does a great job of juggling all the characters it had plenty of humor while keeping a decently dark tone,4
9629,one of the best in the marvel series and i will always enjoy again and again,4
9630,though it isn't the best marvel movie ive seen since ant-man,4
9631,so superior to the second movie and i think it does for this movie,4
9632,ant-man is a great movie that started a wonderful franchise the marvel cinematic universe which viewers are treasuring these many years later,4
9633,this time around our villain's a really bad guy who wants to steal the lab for money so people can harness its energy,4
9634,the way that each and every single one of them was either great or okay,4
9635,the cast was great and it was a joy to watch and the humour is better,4
9636,it was witty clever and one of the best marvel movies,4
9637,iron man 3 was action packed witty entertaining and left me wanting more though which is both good and bad,4
9638,it's just so fun and i don't feel so good mr,4
9639,this is an extremely funny and good looking movie with an interesting plot and amazing special effects,4
9640,without the heist this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
9641,does not beat the first one but still a really good movie it's the movie that doesn't quit,4
9642,not a flawless mcu film but it's still great and it's fun to see the gang again,4
9643,i would be lying if i said i wasn't disappointed when i first saw the lego set i went yay,4
9644,at the end of the iron man trilogy is probably one of my fav mcu movies loved everything about it,4
9645,the villain was the weakest part of this movie had me laughing so hard these moments were fitted into the script perfectly,4
9646,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't come easy as our mentors we try and try again,4
9647,tom holland continues his fantastic work from captain america civil war that promises to be awesome,4
9648,he's good for sure but not the best film out there more depth in future films please,4
9649,and the whole thing wraps up with one of the best mcu films ant-man is a baller movie,4
9650,i have to be honest i don't understand why so many people found age of ultron to be a disappointment,4
9651,one of my favorite comic book characters and it's clear that they're all having a great time,4
9652,the phenomenal villain with the villain it took me some time to understand the bad guys and save the girl,4
9653,that fight is being hyped up the entire film and i just didn't buy him as this military colonel,4
9654,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
9655,overall iron man is one flawless movie that truly is packed with exciting and entertaining scenes that are fantastic to watch,4
9656,the best scenes in my opinion continue to be when he is in the shadows so you can't see how to beat him,4
9657,my only gripe is while the first while of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
9658,the production design makeup and special effects are all top rate,4
9659,if it falls somewhat short of some of the best visuals i've ever seen in any movie,4
9660,definitely a big difference between iron man 2 and comes very close to the original iron man film,4
9661,of course he gets great support from the rest of the cosmic side of the marvel universe perfectly,4
9662,unpopular opinion i liked this movie a lot but i do think it's only as good as the avengers 2012,4
9663,this explains a good movie im looking forward to seeing another one,4
9664,is still great as the sarcastic billionaire tony stark and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
9665,although he is barely in his suit the action scenes are still very entertaining to watch,4
9666,funny good yet way darker than other mcu movies would be a stretch,4
9667,do because guardians of the galaxy is a fun and enjoyable watch,4
9668,the villain was engaging and so was the further expansion of the character of the mandarin,4
9669,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time,4
9670,whedon returns directing the long awaited sequel to pink panther,4
9671,i really really like this movie and think that this is a chance he earned the right for,4
9672,pretty awesome but there were so many great moments in the film make it a must see,4
9673,i had really low expectations for this movie since the first one didn't have those problems,4
9674,i even love this movie more than the first film and reboots the rest for a better cinematic experience,4
9675,if homecoming proved anything it was that it doesn't have the same mighty impact as its predecessor,4
9676,a genuinely fun film not as interesting or clever as the first but worth a long shot to the end of it,4
9677,he is super witty and fun to watch develop as the movie progressed,4
9678,and chris evans as iron man and is easily the best spiderman providing a sense of humor and dazzling visuals,4
9679,it works the only thing that made me go to watch this movie more than once,4
9680,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony and pepper that really extenuate the movie's charms,4
9681,but i have to admit that the action and story is good enough to keep superhero fans happy action fans entertained and comedy fans laughing,4
9682,michael keaton is probably one of the best spider-man actor amp adaptation thus far,4
9683,overall it was a lot of fun with iron man 3 leading into phase 3 to begin with ant man,4
9684,he is an innocent kid as he should be and becomes in future films,4
9685,that being said the positives out weigh the negatives and iron man 3 is an immensely satisfying movie that is sure to dazzle and amaze,4
9686,overall it has a lot of funny moments,4
9687,i was blown away with how much fun i had with a movie this year,4
9688,iron man 3 was action packed witty entertaining and left me wanting more though which is both good and bad,4
9689,the one part that was better than it had any right to be if you have,4
9690,a good worthy addition to the marvel universe or canonical in their history,4
9691,defiantly one of the better parts of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
9692,the final fight scene and the ending of the movie it seems like there is going to be better than the first,4
9693,not saying james spader did a good job screenwriting and acting in this movie,4
9694,lilly gets to come into her own as the wasp and we want to see more,4
9695,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
9696,while it isn't the best mcu movie to date,4
9697,plus it's a great sequel with a lot of flat humor but otherwise a somewhat entertaining movie,4
9698,like a hundred times better than the last two iterations of spider-man,4
9699,chris pratt is awesome as star-lord by providing wit and charm to the role is what makes him so great,4
9700,iron man 3 is one of the best superhero movie you will see,4
9701,in this movie he has become the king of wakanda has passed away and his son t'challa has taken the mantle,4
9702,as iron man chris hemsworth as thor is also great and although i really didn't see coming at all,4
9703,had a great ride watching the movie ant-man because i loved this one so much,4
9704,the characters were well casted and a good movie for fans of watching movies that are good,4
9705,if the female characters were less one-dimensional it would have been the best mcu movie yet,4
9706,i would also consider this a comedy just as much as the winter soldier did if not more,4
9707,the latest fresh new addition to the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half,4
9708,one of the best super-hero movies is through humour,4
9709,the first twenty to twenty five minutes are a bit dry and boring but the movie overcomes her time and time again,4
9710,the cast is the highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
9711,not as good as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
9712,i think joss whedon has put just the right amount of screen time and more involvement in the action,4
9713,an exciting addition to the mcu it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors,4
9714,funny and serious nice addition to the marvel slate of movies,4
9715,namely the villain is yet again a really funny entry in the mcu that is both fun and feels like the comics,4
9716,now in my opinion this is the most entertaining opening movie ever,4
9717,i didn't think a movie like this in which they're more prevalent,4
9718,the vision scarlet witch amp quicksilver are great additions to the avengers and most importantly the long awaited infinity war,4
9719,a genius and funny film and the best thing marvel have done in years,4
9720,the adult heart of the marvel universe in the comic book genre humorous and thrilling to the end,4
9721,it's one of the first and unquestionably second iron man but still feels fresh,4
9722,the first twenty to twenty five minutes are a bit dry and boring but the movie overcomes her time and time again,4
9723,yes he was menacing and evil but when you really watch the movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
9724,guardians of the galaxy is that rare blockbuster that inspires one to make a movie about a group of heroes that almost nobody knows,4
9725,on the character even better cartoon itself becoming one of the best comic book based films of all time,4
9726,i thought however that the soul stone not being shown in the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
9727,this marks the starts of the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
9728,great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is a time and place for it,4
9729,probably one of marvel's more marginal characters but they have an excellent script and great performances from edward norton and william hurt,4
9730,so this is about a band of rogues and mercenaries who eventually team up to unravel the mystery behind peter quill's parentage,4
9731,and i'm glad that i didn't care for maya hansen played by rebecca hall,4
9732,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story is great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
9733,the incredible hulk iron man and the villain is not as interesting as the rest of the movie other 2,4
9734,the quantum universe had one of the best movies of all time,4
9735,honestly i don't want to see this one,4
9736,by far one of the most fun action packed and exciting finale's i have ever seen in a spider man movie,4
9737,the action and humor are cranked up way higher than normal and the soundtrack is incredible bit of bowie in there nice,4
9738,minus the dark knight the avengers is my favorite super hero movies i watched it 3 times,4
9739,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
9740,when the first avengers movie and he does an excellent job in this film,4
9741,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone film for him was a bold move by marvel,4
9742,michael keaton also makes for a great tony stark and this movie also had so much heart,4
9743,the best thing about this marvel film is that it doesn't bother me as much anymore but it would've been a great villain,4
9744,even though it is a very complex and well laid out story and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
9745,tom holland is absolutely terrific and the high school angst is well captured,4
9746,this film starts very badly this film is good not great but also not awful,4
9747,quite honestly unless you want this movie ruined for you it's hard to think of anyone else in the iron man franchise,4
9748,while iron man 3 is one of the best films of the year,4
9749,it's not completely perfect but in a way that keeps on par with the original,4
9750,the fifteen movie in the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my favourite marvel films,4
9751,joss hulk lets you forgive and forget about the other hulk movies but this one was pretty remarkable,4
9752,special effects were on point the music and the great action scenes it makes up for in super explosive cinema fun,4
9753,part number 2 and it was just a fun ass movie,4
9754,truth joss whedon manager did an excellent job with the first avengers,4
9755,but they knocked it out of the park as tony stark,4
9756,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it adds more humanity to his character,4
9757,this is a fun movie and that's for a good reason,4
9758,but still a power-house installment in the marvel cinematic universe fetches yet another greatly directed cinematic piece of art,4
9759,i thought pepper potts was a little annoying in iron man 2 and he makes war machine an unforgettable character,4
9760,it doesn't quite meet the standard set by its predecessor but age of ultron takes too much time setting up the team,4
9761,that my friends is a whole new level of depth to the character of robert downey jr,4
9762,ant-man is a very fun sci-fi-fi adventure with plenty of action and comedy,4
9763,it's worth all the hype and is one of the best comic book movie of 2015,4
9764,the movie is such a blast to watch and it's more than just a real goodtime action flick,4
9765,hell in the end of the movie is world building,4
9766,many hardcore comic fans see problems with this movie that i can pretty much overlook any of its problems,4
9767,everything balanced out into one of the most exciting movies out there,4
9768,liked it a lot ultron was a great villain but he honestly wasn't that memorable,4
9769,on top of that it was one of the most mind-blowing sequences that phase 3 of the mcu,4
9770,i have watched it a few times and each time i see it something else new that i hadn't rated it three years ago,4
9771,i think this movie is a great movie,4
9772,this film is nostalgic for many and i don't think anyone else could have played iron man like he did,4
9773,so the third spider-man reboot breathes new life into the character and it has never been more apparently than it is here,4
9774,there's no arguing that this was the best spiderman movie i have seen,4
9775,superbly directed by ryan coogler black panther is one of the most surprising comic book films i've ever seen,4
9776,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man in the franchise,4
9777,spiderman homecoming was a great entry in the marvel cinematic universe,4
9778,baby groot was adorable as always and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
9779,this movie is a well needed breathe of fresh air in the superhero genre,4
9780,it provides excellent entertainment from the moment you sit down to watch a marvel movie,4
9781,a thoroughly enjoyable sequel to a classic superhero film for the years to come,4
9782,considering he is supposed to be one of the bets films of the year,4
9783,an a or b and one that if i did not mention the soundtrack like everybody else,4
9784,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of the film is the villains,4
9785,five years later we got the rebooted amazing spider-man franchise that continues the fun of the original but guardians of the galaxy vol,4
9786,everything balanced out into one of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
9787,the creative approach differs from its connected predecessor iron man but it's still an action packed joyride of fun but a little overrated,4
9788,the director of the movie did a good job of balancing the serious moments and comedic moments,4
9789,i hope the character will emerge from the shadow of the larger world of heroes namely the avengers,4
9790,5 out of 10 a great follow up to it's prior film,4
9791,the area where whedon has impressed me is the last part which is fight with last boss in the film,4
9792,is a strong quick and a funny actor which makes him the perfect iron man and he will never be topped,4
9793,ever since we heard sam jackson's word at the end of the iron man series and brings back a little snippet of tony stark,4
9794,we don't want to say this will be the best movie i've ever seen in a movie,4
9795,one thing you have to understand if you're going by stars because i was slightly disappointed,4
9796,i found this movie to be largely forgotten,4
9797,i didn't love the garfield spider-man movies we've already seen it's still very enjoyable and fun to watch,4
9798,great follow up to ant-man is undeniably entertaining and lots of fun,4
9799,although at times it feels overstuffed and its not as good as you remember but better still than you might expect,4
9800,i still think the original spider-man films as well,4
9801,is it the best spider-man movie and this one is back on form,4
9802,almost cough amazing spider-man but this kid did ok even thought he was a great choice for this role,4
9803,while the solving of the primary issue in the movie is well done along with the villains suprisingly,4
9804,this movie made me even more excited to see tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
9805,the movie that kicked off one of my favourite duos of all time,4
9806,we still haven't gotten to my favorite mcu movie and the only time you see him is sitting on a chair,4
9807,but it is nonetheless one of the most underrated movies of all time,4
9808,visions aka jarvis was amazing and i'm glad that i didn't care to be honest,4
9809,despite a weak third act avengers age of ultron has a lot to do with that,4
9810,the story is not perfect but is still enjoyable an the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
9811,the only problems i do have is that it is a too big movie it never felt overstuffed just epic,4
9812,the biggest surprise that made it as good as the original i encourage you to rewatch it,4
9813,and this is speaking as someone who does not read the comic books,4
9814,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe returns for another stellar showing,4
9815,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
9816,without a dull moment iron man is a well made movie not just by marvel's standards,4
9817,best marvel movie i have seen in this type of movie,4
9818,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be him being aided by tony stark his friend knows his secret,4
9819,the follow-up to what was arguably the greatest superhero film of all time but is very close to being it,4
9820,a new and unique addition to the marvel universe and i can't wait for the sequel,4
9821,fantastic portrayals of both spider-man and iron-man,4
9822,the only major hangup of this film is the design of its script,4
9823,the hulk and black widow love story this took away from the movie at times,4
9824,it sets up at least another two films spider-man homecoming is carried by its comedic script,4
9825,when choose somethings and name them because you thought it would be impossible for me to even blink,4
9826,ed norton is perfect in the role and his banter with robert downey jr,4
9827,throw in some of the best in the entire mcu,4
9828,i still consider the raimi series the better one only because he is a great marvel movie on a small scale,4
9829,he isn't a bad villain but he is very clichãâ © and cheesy moments that bog down some dramatic moments,4
9830,visually beautiful well acted and stuffed to the brim with great special effects good characters and plot and overall a fun premise,4
9831,nonetheless iron man is a movie with a lot of heart too something a lot of superhero movies lack see the avengers,4
9832,i enjoyed this film starts everything a new having more to do with her character this time as standouts,4
9833,tom holland is perfect as spider-man is supposed to be fearful of him make him shine,4
9834,i definitely like the back story of the character ant-man,4
9835,kid did a great spider-man movies but still pretty good overall,4
9836,see kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
9837,like a hundred times better than the last one i'll promise you that1,4
9838,great job marvel and i can't wait for part 2,4
9839,the soundtrack to this film is one of my favorite superhero movies lots of great action great characters and a good story,4
9840,he sometimes looks incredibly fake mainly in the scene where all of the avengers in this film actually turns out to be highly enjoyable,4
9841,especially the hypnotic voice of the brilliant james spader ultron carries a lot of the plot developments and how things ended up,4
9842,it's better than the first ant man and captain america respectively,4
9843,a little too busy and thats why i didn't give it five stars is because i think it is worth to watch,4
9844,all the characters were great for me kurt russel is a little too over reliant on its digital imagery,4
9845,this movie could have been a bit predictable the rest of the cast was good too,4
9846,chris pratt is the best part of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier,4
9847,the movie does a good job all around,4
9848,i do not necessarily agree but this is a film that isn't afraid to allow bad things to happen to the protagonists,4
9849,my only two concerns is the complete lack of the spider-man story we have all deserved,4
9850,was born to play tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
9851,the rare sequel that is just as good as the first in my opinion,4
9852,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best popcorn entertainment money can buy,4
9853,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action keeps the movie going at a consistant pace,4
9854,i'm very surprised how good this film was the lack of a moving score and i'm glad i didn't see coming,4
9855,i didn't love the garfield spider-man movies out of the park,4
9856,went in expecting something very mediocre and ended up enjoying this allot more for the second time in his career,4
9857,i got to see ant-man in which they're more prevalent,4
9858,2 is not as fresh as iron man 1 but a bit better than iron man thankfully,4
9859,the chemistry in this movie was the end fight scene is a bit underwhelming,4
9860,in fact his whole presence was the best part of this movie is light with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
9861,my boyfriend wanted to see this movie with that mindset,4
9862,the original was better but this has some of the most memorable fights between a hero and villain it does have some flaws,4
9863,she's looking to be more involved in the action and i think it does for this movie,4
9864,there are tender moments shared between scott and his daughter's relationship and chemistry,4
9865,it was all right i don't think it's because of the film's perfect ration of comedy to action,4
9866,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
9867,homecoming is an extreme departure from all the spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
9868,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be the best mcu movie so far,4
9869,the end credit scene will leave veiwers guessing on what will happen in avengers 4 so im not to bothered about that,4
9870,iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the group as the fast-talking racoon-genius,4
9871,while perhaps given a bit too much time might've been spent on him,4
9872,but i wouldn't be honest if i didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me,4
9873,the best part is that he was one of the best movie i've ever seen,4
9874,hands down the best marvel cu film since the original trilogy's spider-man movies ever made,4
9875,re-watched it recently and it is a great movie with or without the mcu,4
9876,yes i was one of the best movies i've ever seen and definitely one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
9877,plus it's a great example of the film's heart is found in tony stark,4
9878,the fight scenes in this movie are constant throughout the film and done beautifully felt like they were there to set up more films,4
9879,best parts of the last two spider-man movie since spider-man 2,4
9880,the classic flawed yet charming character scott lang is under house arrest after the events of captain america civil war to this movie,4
9881,and let's just get this out of the way you have been warned,4
9882,oh and don't worry there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
9883,this movie by far in the top 5 and an a for overall movies,4
9884,the action is loads of fun and the post credits scene mas lalo mo aabangan ang part ii ng infinity wars eh,4
9885,although infrequent these fights are the best moments in the movie but it is loads better than iron man 2,4
9886,a great summer movie and a lot of fail-proof humor,4
9887,not a fan of this film when i first saw the lego set i went yay,4
9888,shane black's direction and lastly the main villain is by far the funniest marvel movie to date,4
9889,yes they did and it worked a lot better than what i was expecting,4
9890,the film has a great sense of comedy to it,4
9891,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
9892,a solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
9893,some characters act make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics,4
9894,it was a clever take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
9895,its refreshing to see him in that's not insidious,4
9896,will the price increase to save the galaxy for the second time it's been viewed in years,4
9897,iron man is what started he mcu this films is probably the best out of the 3 of them,4
9898,again directed by peyton reed ant man and the wasp its a good marvel film,4
9899,the story is brilliant and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
9900,marvel finally mad a movie with all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
9901,and it has the best mcu villain right along with killmonger,4
9902,the director joss whedon has created a film that is grounded to spiderman and spiderman only,4
9903,the banner widow romance felt forced at times but in the end i can not help but feel slightly disappointed,4
9904,the villain don't need to love comic books to love this movie warts and all,4
9905,the combat is buggy the the training mode is one of the most jolly and fun-filled humbled and relaxed,4
9906,and of course plenty of action-packed scenes all mixed to make another good marvel movie,4
9907,the film was an ingenious continuation of the marvel cinematic universe mcu are ever so generic,4
9908,all in all this movie was a great choice for this role,4
9909,an incredibly vast improvement over the first and one of my favorites form marvel,4
9910,2 delivers just as much as an action film because this is by far the funniest mcu film i've seen,4
9911,iron man is a welcome addition to the superhero genre but quite the ride,4
9912,so i went in to see this movie was because of james spader as ultron is worth the price of admission,4
9913,i recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a fan you'll enjoy this movie,4
9914,filled with spectacular action sequences and humor iron man will always be one of the best movies in the mcu,4
9915,the action has some issues and there are some good fights between the heroes,4
9916,i assume a lot of the action sequences are well done,4
9917,a truly sensational way to tie together the marvel cinematic universe movies in one gigantic event is no small feat,4
9918,this is the beginning of the end of the film tony stark i am iron man,4
9919,not the best ironman movie but it was pretty easy for me to tell what was going on,4
9920,the script also happens to be one of the film's overabundance of characters,4
9921,heck even the first iron man as the best film in the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
9922,in fact people that think it's not as good as the first one but is still fantastic,4
9923,but it was a light hearted like the rest of the film going to take place,4
9924,norton's banner is humane and contrite it's a shame norton's contract fell through and we didn't get the remote with them,4
9925,but there were a lot of politics involved in this movie and that is not because of the mandarin,4
9926,the movie itself is ant-man's suit created by darren cross,4
9927,it is a large endeavor that turns out to be aldrich killian played by guy pearce did a really good job,4
9928,norton not only put on some of his best but was one of the original origin story of comic book superhero,4
9929,iron man 3 is still a very good movie that doesn't and didn't have as much humour as the original movie,4
9930,thanks to marvel's the avengers thor and guardians of the galaxy and avengers film are great,4
9931,straight before or straight after i don't care if dead is only dead for a limited timespan,4
9932,part script and part flawless acting this movie sets the stage for civil war,4
9933,super funny action packed and it was just the right amount of screen time,4
9934,it would be 5 stars if i didn't give it all the stars,4
9935,solid action packed movie with great characters and some amazing special effects,4
9936,great even better than the first one slightly,4
9937,josh brolin was the perfect casting choice for tony stark,4
9938,while it's too short for my liking the second and third act more than make up for it as there were absolutely hysterical scenes,4
9939,age of ultron is a solid follow to it's predecessor exceeding it slightly in my eyes,4
9940,there's even a couple of twists that i really didn't like the first one but still pretty dang good and pretty dang fun,4
9941,he's resourceful he's angry and is in a jam,4
9942,guardians of the galaxy and takes place 3-months after the events of captain america civil war and avengers infinity war,4
9943,black panther is another hit for the mcu and a great entry in the mcu,4
9944,after five stand-alone movies the marvel cinematic universe that has become so insanely huge as of late,4
9945,really good film liked the chemistry between the characters in an opposite way,4
9946,a sequel bursting at the seams with potential in a way that will make you want to cheer,4
9947,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good addition to the mcu thanks in large part to paul rudd's performance,4
9948,the only flaw i have with this movie is the collaboration of robert downey jr,4
9949,one thing you have to understand if you're going by stars because i was slightly disappointed,4
9950,iron man has a tone that makes you want to watch it over and over again,4
9951,whedon returns directing the long awaited sequel to pink panther,4
9952,if so by all means go watch it,4
9953,what i did like most about the film is that they focus on its characters,4
9954,everything looks marvelous and he does a really good job,4
9955,it serves as a reminder that you can make a comic-book movie with no shame,4
9956,a good comic-book adaptation with a terrific performance by robert downey jr is eminently watchable,4
9957,yet somehow gunn makes you share feelings for this tree and in the end thanos actually succeeds he kills half of all life,4
9958,it was definatly better than the last two iterations of spider-man peter parker,4
9959,thanks to its charming performance by robert downey jr was another reason to smile,4
9960,i enjoyed this more than i liked the first one better,4
9961,it's directly tied to the first avengers but age of ultron definitely has a good spot on marvel's list,4
9962,the final fight scene and the ending of the film was the development of hawkeye,4
9963,instead of the slow build-up which worked in the first one and he hasn't got his own film,4
9964,a solid sequel and another good addition to the cast in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
9965,the one that started it all also happens to be one of their best efforts,4
9966,it's definitely better than the hulk fighting his wacko dad in the end of the movie he actually wins,4
9967,best of all the three iron man movies and avengers making it feel quite off in the series,4
9968,s the only reason i'm giving this a 4 5 stars is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
9969,definitely a bit of a mess in my opinion but robert downey jr was too much of a comedian he has to stop,4
9970,yes i know that the aspect of spider-man swinging around on buildings,4
9971,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the perfect in the role and one of the best films in the marvel cinematic universe,4
9972,if i had to poke one other flaw it would be a good movie but its not that good to me,4
9973,and i say that understanding how great spider-man movies behind us it's hard to make a movie about ant man,4
9974,the entire third act i just had a blast with this flick,4
9975,i want to see it again and i cant wait to see more of in the mcu,4
9976,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
9977,awesome f king movie very emotional at the end still wish they didn't do that as much but for the most part,4
9978,this might be the funniest marvel movie and it's a strong internal hatred which comes to him organically,4
9979,may contain spoilers nice addition to the marvel series that out does its predecessors,4
9980,on the bright side the cgi is great and all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
9981,my favorite part of this movie but i'm not familiar with the genre,4
9982,even though i said the narrative of the movie was a good watch start to finish,4
9983,if you liked the first movie this movie is still a solid entry in the marvel franchise but it's not supposed to,4
9984,fun action film with a great bad guy,4
9985,its archetypal themes are certainly nothing new for marvel but that doesn't mean he does anything wrong whatsoever,4
9986,totally different from the other marvel films creating one of the lighter movies in the franchise a lot,4
9987,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the most anticipated superhero movies ever,4
9988,would probably see again if i didn't notice the c,4
9989,i love how they introduce all of the characters and the great visual style,4
9990,the ravengers have a larger role in this film but guy pearce certainly delivered a strong performance but its just the anti-iron man,4
9991,this is my favorite iron man movie and again i wasn't expecting much from this movie but i'm not familiar with the genre,4
9992,more fun than the original in my opinion i don't think it's amazing but it does what it should do,4
9993,even though there isn t as much iron man in this movie but it broke my heart at the same time,4
9994,there have already been two big screen origin adaptations of spider-man that both of the previous incarnations lacked,4
9995,it feels a bit rushed but guardians of the galaxy is one of my top five favorite marvel movies has funny dialogue and great action,4
9996,the first twenty to twenty five minutes are a bit dry and boring but the movie overcomes her time and time again,4
9997,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-big-scale no pun intended,4
9998,the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and easily one of the best super-hero movies of the new marvel generation,4
9999,it spends a good amount of time to be developed,4
