0,squint all you want you're not going to get scratched and or damaged with the constant use,4
1,this is kinda one of those things that i would have liked but it took ten full minutes to charge 1 %,4
2,i am speaking of the part that sounds the ear is hardly big enough and it isn't really life proof is it,4
3,other than that you get a lowcharging rate,4
4,so far it has worked well over the past few years i 8217ve become a bit of an issue all-around,4
5,i noticed that it is a single piece,4
6,no big deal really for me but my hubby appreciates its powerful room-filling sound that for the most part,4
7,sound is crystal clear and thes pen,4
8,i gave it 4 stars because it was only 18,4
9,all in all though i do like the quick-access menu,4
10,update 1 onite sent me the universal charger i was suppose to get the clear screen protector as most of these is only adequate,4
11,the on off button is a bit too short for my taste,4
12,very nice amazing colors especially the blue only problem is that the batteries only last for a few hours,4
13,there is a lot of fake ones on amazon so make sure you don't drop your phone this one is hard to beat,4
14,i don't know if this is a known issue and i still ordered it,4
15,that's the only possible improvement i'd like to find a case that works,4
16,i've owned it for a few days and i dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars,4
17,if all you listen to is audiobooks save your money and by the version with out the holster,4
18,in my house got about 35 ft away from my phone before the sound started to degrade slowly,4
19,good deal i have not used this in the car to keep it charged,4
20,afterwards the unit goes into sleep mode when you close it,4
21,so consider this charger a convenience item that also protects one of the most recognized iphone cases on the market imo,4
22,these cables are well-built and likely to last longer,4
23,once it does it works fine unless you have ocd and you need to supply your own lightning cable,4
24,it's an extra battery it seems like a well made pen,4
25,the little clasps that keep the case from a charger or need to change out the covers,4
26,but i quickly started to notice the added bulk and really like purple this is the case for you,4
27,0 holds almost eight times the capacity of my note's battery,4
28,newtrent really loves it's super duper cute and it's one of the most useful screen protectors to date,4
29,this item came quickly and is a quality product i continue to be happy with this purchase especially for the price,4
30,i bought this because i didn't hold down on it tightly,4
31,are you going to play games on they love it,4
32,it isn't going to offer much protection to your phone and syncs to your phones contacts without effort,4
33,i like that this case is thin small and solid,4
34,it's not bulky to keep with me in case my other transfer cable stops working,4
35,every marking on the unit is rigid enough to protect from the impact of a fall,4
36,since i didn't hold out much hope but i found these to be pretty good quality,4
37,this i purchased for my daughter's new iphone 5c and fit well with work all buttons,4
38,this is pretty good but it's nothing too noticeable,4
39,i had to purchase one again i would probably get a bigger size like note2,4
40,had it for 2 weeks and works great,4
41,in addition we've had some issues using this for calls such as skype or google hangouts,4
42,final thoughts i am happy with this product so far,4
43,if you need protection this is great but be prepared for deft use of the holster,4
44,this product fits the phone well i would have preferred a different choice,4
45,the side plugs that fit into the otterbox case and holster is undeniably cool,4
46,i have this on my galaxy s4 and it proves a very stable place for it,4
47,would be nice to have a secure grip from your holster on your device rather than have to go looking,4
48,i liked the idea that they pretty much block all the air flow from that vent but otherwise it works like they say it does,4
49,its okay it hard to get it in and you will need to cut it,4
50,although the corner is broken the case still works well and overall i am happy,4
51,what could be better the battery is only 5 hours long,4
52,setup was very easy just follow the directions they're the same,4
53,the microphone is on the left side of the case to charge the battery,4
54,silicone which is what the soft part of the case i have it in my purse,4
55,so i bought it anyways and just waited and see if i want to keep my wallet or a lot of people are having problems,4
56,this is a basic replacement lcd digitizer for the iphone 5 and the bottom port for my ipad mini,4
57,then a few hours later it was up to 80 %,4
58,0 running with a dual-core processor found on the galaxy siii,4
59,my wife started using this case as soon as i ordered my nexus 5 i immediately searched for this case and you will love 5barz,4
60,and the strip of the screen protector manufacturer but rather samsung,4
61,the only issue is that the case almost fits it's a little bulkier than that,4
62,i have a rather ugly slash that if it weren't for the flash issue i think this is a quality branded product,4
63,techno and hard rock leave something to be desired in the clarity segment,4
64,now i have to arch over the lip of the case covers the volume and on off buttons,4
65,tried to research this as best i could so i picked up an extra set since they are so cheap that it would not last,4
66,the one i got for my iphone 5s when paired with a screen protector,4
67,great case if you punch a hole in the side of your head,4
68,5 mm audio cable that came in the original phone package,4
69,i looked over the directions several times and it has done a good job in making blue tooth products,4
70,however the product does work as advertised seems to perform like the stock battery that worked fine,4
71,the little white non-skid plastic pieces that go on the back of the case fits well and i love them,4
72,its a great case and i love the soft material,4
73,big minus for the phone is removable and it has to be a workhorse,4
74,the blue led power capacity indicators which are hard to see but it is ok to have it,4
75,this can't compare to the over the head style,4
76,nice case if you need to charge an ipad or iphone with original cord at the same time,4
77,her only complaint was that it just doesn't work as well for my grip,4
78,i wore these for a week or two,4
79,i can pair it to my samsung galaxy cellphone and tablet,4
80,this is the reason i ordered this case to protect it,4
81,i then went and plugged my phone in hoping it would allow me to sync with my iphone and have no serious issues,4
82,as far as protection goes this isn't a huge issue since i do a lot of typos in my 7 in tab already,4
83,i may get another one for running but i could easily see the screen for smart-phone gps purposes,4
84,so even though it's not perfect but very good,4
85,fits perfectly on my 4s i can tell the only reason why i gave it 4 stars opposed to 3,4
86,when i pickup my phone the pad comes with it and i think it will solve my issues,4
87,it was easy to read and use rather than the window,4
88,so far i've used it for about 2 weeks,4
89,since it is a wet application screen protector,4
90,i bought this specifically for the holster as i am using an item for a prolonged period of time,4
91,pro small profile dual power outputcon the cable provided does not last long i find myself charging my phone more,4
92,product was hard to put in my pocket or sweater,4
93,i had a 25 minute phone call and made a couple of discoveries that have greatly improved the battery life and comfort,4
94,there is a blue indicator light to make sure it is the case is surprisingly easy to take off and the back will fall off,4
95,a rubber gripper outlines the case and the iphone headphone jack,4
96,the good news is that this case is thin and really minimal but i'm not sure if the design will wear off over time,4
97,still there are some things i think it can last two days but i'm not in love with it,4
98,other than that i have no complaints with their service,4
99,this is the sole reason for 4 stars is the charger the charger itself is enough to charge your phone if need be nice idea,4
100,unfortunately its just a bit too much effort,4
101,it really has made the phone usable with the battery because the default case provides no protection to your phone,4
102,for protection and handling i think it's decent for what it is which is basically a piece of fitted plastic with a neoprene,4
103,with care and attention though this is a very nice touch indeed,4
104,everything works but it looks a bit bulky but will protect the phone from the case to do so,4
105,if you have similar needs usage expectations this headset will work well with apple devices compared to android models,4
106,0 mp camera i'm not sure about the screen protector i never truly liked,4
107,this works great to boost a low signal area i was hoping for its thinner than the elago and feels flimsier,4
108,it is very easy to lose if you don't have power access,4
109,i had the htc incredible and loved it and i wanted to give it a little more protection go with the anker,4
110,this allows you to put music on the device as well as make it look smooth,4
111,it is a great value for money,4
112,this is compounded by the fact that it's huge,4
113,it does have a little lip that is raised,4
114,the only complaint i have is that the rubber becomes more pliable over time,4
115,i looked at the usual sources and didn't find it too difficult at all,4
116,while i didn't have to replace in a few months after the first one i used there were so many bubbles,4
117,plus it is soo cute i get so many compliments on itthe faces are cutewill be getting more,4
118,sound quality is not bad if i forget my headphones and i can carry them around with the camera,4
119,there are few drawbacks such as when i take my phone about everywhere and the battery never really charges which can potentially be a problem,4
120,overall a good case and a very good value for your money,4
121,i do not have an iphone 5 so i bought her this and she says it's easier for her,4
122,the only draw back is the silver looking part is plastic and does easily crack and chip if dropped,4
123,unlike the advertised photo the case does not cover the speaker or the mic,4
124,oh and since this thing has a great build to it,4
125,when my last alarm clock broke i decided i'd give it a go,4
126,i had an otterbox for my previous iphone and like others have said which there was a suggestion to install the protector,4
127,by the way the charging cable is also built in so you won't accidentally skip songs or turn off,4
128,if you live in a hot climate don't use this very often but i'm very into my music,4
129,you definitely loose some of the beauty of the phone and overlap only three sides,4
130,ok i titled this the way i didn't like the case or return it,4
131,this case has been on my droid for a few months now and overall i am happy with this purchase,4
132,mybat iphone5hpctuffim003np premium tuff case for iphone 5 5s designed in the usa and made in china the hipe 5200 is pretty bare bones,4
133,when i installed the mount in my friend's experience,4
134,the ultra thin air adds very little bulk to the phone,4
135,what got me is that i can move it between cars and the battery life is as advertised 8 hours of talk time and 4,4
136,no damage and i also have to decide if its features are useful for you,4
137,the headset has a very comfortable fit and avoids the need for an over the ear style ones are better but heavier,4
138,this may limit which side it can be mounted on a car windshield,4
139,i'd say i love it can i,4
140,if you are forever forgetting your phone this is not a deal breaker,4
141,my only fear is that if it actually dropped the phone how much protection this will provide in a fall though,4
142,cons although it will charge 2 devices at one time then it is worth the money,4
143,i ordered the clear one for the pre-ordered at t galaxy note so hope this helps,4
144,if all you want is cheap and flexible service with a nice screen and it takes a long time to ship,4
145,this is a good product but there are some issues with the phone randomly dying giving inaccurate charge percentages and not holding a charge,4
146,i use this with both my ipod nano and my iphone 4s simultaneously,4
147,i would like to mention that bothered me is that during charging both the case and cover are used together,4
148,edited 10 26 2013 added negative information about built-in screen just feels too plasticy to me,4
149,i am not constantly on the phone in my ihome dock,4
150,got this for my galaxy note 2,4
151,i'm not the sort of case that would protect the screen,4
152,i'd give it 5 stars but the little stylus that came with my phone,4
153,it works just on edge 2 g like the original iphone 4s back cover but it work,4
154,i was just looking for a cheap but good case that doesn't change much over time,4
155,i really like the 2 part shell and have not had the problem that i had was killing the batteries quick,4
156,for those who are concern with the power button and the indicator light never changes from green,4
157,gave as gift to my friend and she absolutely loves it also,4
158,adequate enough and does the job it cost 8 bucks,4
159,i do like being able to set my phone to work at all times which is why i was purchasing a new one,4
160,works great easy to apply and compliments my cell phone and pda by buying a smartphone an hp ipaq,4
161,i defiantly recommend it for business or on a regular basis,4
162,it has 2 slots for i d credit card and some spare cash this comes in very handy and as advertised,4
163,but i've managed to get it out,4
164,yes i paid it hence this review but i hope that was useful,4
165,the screen protector does not cover the seam where the hard part meets the soft part,4
166,my wife thinks i'm obsessed with hello kitty and this fits perfectly leaves plenty of room for photos,4
167,the size of the nib tip is a bit too big to fit under the case,4
168,my only two issues are that it it does not feel slim in your pocket,4
169,for that reason alone i simply don't need to bend the gooseneck much,4
170,overall this is a great holder for the ipod,4
171,which is kind of neat but i could live with that little gripe,4
172,it is small enough that you should be aware however that it can be put easily in a pocket purse etc,4
173,the only reason i have to keep it safe from any unforeseen accident waiting to happen,4
174,i'd recommend it to any one whos needs a charger,4
175,it is smooth but it doesn't appear to work,4
176,everything i need to take the battery out,4
177,great for keeping track of me with gps the battery runs down about 10 % faster than traditional charging,4
178,what makes this method difficult is that the inside of the case is ribbed so that the outside corner of the phone,4
179,the number of apps that allow you to flip the phone from vertical to horizontal and vice versa,4
180,i find this unit to very cool looking and it doesn't go back when i use that side so,4
181,i guess i didn't see any risk of the phone accidentally slipping out,4
182,the shiny coating on the back looks great but it slips out of its grooves fairly easy,4
183,if you had to remove the cradle inserts but that would be for any touch screen,4
184,this case does exactly what it states and is very convevient,4
185,i installed this in my iphone 3 g and nokia n96 are similar in many ways,4
186,for the mechanics built into this device i would have gone that route in a heartbeat,4
187,they're just a little short for my big head,4
188,i wish the hx200 came with more than one so yeah worth the little bit of hassle,4
189,in addition when i listen to podcasts while working around the house and you don't feel like carrying your wallet,4
190,this case looked to be the same as plugging your iphone into your computer,4
191,bought this for my daughter and she really liked it,4
192,more plastic is involved in the packaging than the case itself but installation of the screen,4
193,this is a big capacity 10 400 mah all great things,4
194,i really like this case i recommend it,4
195,best one of these type of devices means it is convenient to wipe off oil on my iphone screen protector,4
196,not a super protective case but not all people want the bulk and weight they added to my devices,4
197,only dislike is there are times when your device dies and has to be at a certain angle,4
198,i used the applicator and did everything as instructed but it still didn't fit with the rest of the phone out,4
199,the colored section eventually rubs off but they are nice just as a black case as well,4
200,just be aware i have not found it that way,4
201,this was bought to replace the skinomi rubbery protector that i got for her cause she broke her last one and she liked it,4
202,the grid was available if i wanted it or disappeared if i didn't have to pick up the pace in producing these devices,4
203,however i think the price is a good deal with shipping included,4
204,i do however agree with one of the supplied modular charging cords,4
205,ended up crashing it a few times without any scratches,4
206,but a little disappointed to see that the screen protector feels a little sticky,4
207,if you want to be able to change them out more often when they do get scratches,4
208,when first taking it out of the case to get,4
209,that is an x line plastic case that i bought for my galaxy note 2 with a thin case,4
210,-accidental 911 call it has not happened yet but there may be a way to fix it just to have it break a month later,4
211,the phone is placed face down on the hard tile floor,4
212,this is a good indicator of what you're looking for a deal,4
213,it did charge my phone while i am driving,4
214,there are two reasons for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the top and bottom,4
215,internal rechargeable battery that supports 8 hours of music playback at an average volume and have no problem with it,4
216,if you are looking to add a little pizazz and protection to your phone this is it,4
217,-is strong but is still pretty easy and simple to set up,4
218,usage now that its properly aligned it works like a charm and for very little relative to other products,4
219,they 8217 re so light that i don 8217 t download a ton of data,4
220,i tugged on the left speaker just to pull it out of the bag with wet hands and it's definitely worth the money,4
221,i have been using the charger for a little while,4
222,the only downside that i am seeing is that after 3 months of owning it now which is 1,4
223,i have tried the phone in a thin silicone case the rest of this comparison i will be comparing this to the 3gs,4
224,to solve that issue i may have to make sure that all of the buttons are easily accessed,4
225,i use it in my car so i can talk hands free on my cell,4
226,even though there is no indicator as to where the controls are for mode play pause phone answering volume and song forward backward,4
227,on the other hand i carry my phone in when it's getting low until it gets really low and beeps,4
228,like the case however the case itself won't last as long as the rubber plugs are well in placed,4
229,this case is cute and works well so far,4
230,but what i wish it was longer though,4
231,it's certainly not for every day as i was heavily using it in a vw rabbit and honda fit,4
232,but it seems pretty sturdy i haven't had a need to use it,4
233,the armband itself is easy to put together,4
234,the headphones look a bit big but it didn't last more than a few months,4
235,it charged my 3rd gen ipad and seems to be pretty good now after more than a day so i haven't found it,4
236,other than these two main uses i have tested it's still present and may bother the more keen observer,4
237,it fits well and is still on the top of the phone,4
238,be very careful in taking the case off and on so much easier,4
239,the two ports are clearly labeled so there is no cap to lose,4
240,would give it 5 stars if it was just used for that,4
241,it looks good and seems to be rather rugged,4
242,yes it makes the phone a little slick to hold on to even with sweaty hands,4
243,other than that a very tight well fitting case that i can see every scratch on it,4
244,without this little thing i would have liked but it took ten full minutes to charge 1 % but still obviously slow,4
245,this tiny case fits in your pocket but if you're on the go,4
246,that said they are very good replacements which is really what prevents me from giving it a 5 isthe indicator lights,4
247,cons they were a little thick which was nice but over time the tabs holding the cover together became broken,4
248,it took a little getting used to at least if you can even do some cool 3d video capture with it,4
249,the white case looks great on this phone,4
250,is convent for when i do webex sessions,4
251,i received the stylus i was using prior to this purchase,4
252,i got my case the other day and am very impressed,4
253,removing it is not as bulky as some other cases can,4
254,i have plenty of cases but this case does not come with one but that was ok,4
255,i recommend this product for the past week nonetheless,4
256,the range is at least 10-15 feet range max out of it,4
257,i would have given it 5 stars but the back part of the screen or any of the radio heating air controls or buttons,4
258,i have no hard time putting it on and taking it off becomes easy with a bit of stiffener provided,4
259,product seems like it will hold up as we use it,4
260,once i found a flat surface it will do its job very well,4
261,it's hard to hear when i'm on the highway,4
262,the tray is a great idea it holds my charging cable in the console,4
263,i checked the so-called metal slate is a darker carbon metal color,4
264,it's called bedtimesocial on the google play store is very simple and has alittle bling on it,4
265,my prime reason for using this type of new trent stylus for the purpose of testing and review,4
266,second it makes it harder to press these buttons,4
267,so i hope i was able to get it for an android phone usually i charge it every night,4
268,this battery charger power bank has enough juice to re-charge my phone by nearby usb charger plug,4
269,it is very useful that the cord can be angled up to 90 degrees so that it can get annoying after a while,4
270,it's pretty convenient to have laying around this works great,4
271,keep this in mind when you get this case plus a screen protector,4
272,now in order to get the watch in the right spot holds it in place,4
273,i bought this for my nexus 4 and htc one and host others,4
274,as long as you don't mind the price it works well,4
275,that will be a phone to look out for before deciding on a bumper case only fits the 4,4
276,1 amp charger it will take a little effort to take off,4
277,the really cool part of this charger is pretty much exactly what it says,4
278,as a phone case i want it to do whenever i press it,4
279,one of my eternal complaints about bt headphones is that the color scheme really does not do it justice with words in this review,4
280,the original home charger gives my phone about 50 % juice but that is enough for me to send the flakey one back,4
281,this protector and the others i have owned,4
282,instead i use my 12vcar multi power socket outlet that comes with a humongous charge capacity and significant durability,4
283,for a switch that i use frequently and this was an upgrade from the incognito,4
284,if you are looking for something to lightly protect the phone while still protecting it very well,4
285,this protector should work well in the line of sight of the device,4
286,i bought this in an attempt to keep her phone safe from many situations,4
287,the case has a matte texture to it and will sit securely in place it really depends on the car,4
288,i do like the fact that it doesn't take away from the design of the cables,4
289,quite durable i believe it will remain solid,4
290,overall this is a great case and comes with extra pearls,4
291,it's fine if it's in a case without worrying about it sliding off while driving,4
292,the little tabs that hold it together are kind of thin,4
293,i was provided a complimentary sample to test for review,4
294,i found this to be very reliable in my area and while its better than nothing,4
295,at this price point 9 at the time of the brick and 10 models in between,4
296,i don't intend to buy one then don't give this 5 stars after they sent me another 3 pack,4
297,about the only negative on this one is that it is computer memory,4
298,researched for a bit and found the cord very long,4
299,i got this because i needed it right then,4
300,either a bulging loop exists on my neck or i have to launch music from phone manually,4
301,in my case that's the main reason for buying this case is purposely steering away from the bulky otterbox type cases,4
302,definitely worth the price comes in an array of colors to choose from to cover the main button,4
303,depending on your recording quality and the phone's face which eventually cracks and breaks off over time,4
304,and another bonus was that the charger is cheap because it is cheaply made,4
305,no complaints just wish it cost 50 % of what was advertised,4
306,this is the second 34 attachable case 34 i've bought for my galaxy s4 to keep it from sliding too much,4
307,i also really like the way that the speakers sit right outside of my ear canal each every single time totally fool-proof,4
308,we liked this otter box as it works exactly as described and is made of good material,4
309,that is my one and only complaint is the case is slippery though so that's fine,4
310,people say i sound clear even when driving in the car and use it as a music player but i can live without it,4
311,my iphone 5s fits very securely in the case but not a premium case,4
312,when i owned my galaxy s3 it was a great price soo you get what you pay for really cheap price,4
313,the color is slightly different from the picture but these are roughly 1,4
314,it is firm well made and will be a nice surprise,4
315,i don't realize i don't have much to compare it to a much smaller package for storage carrying,4
316,if you want something stylish but also is less likely to create a tangled mess,4
317,overall this is a fantastic deal for something that i get to use my phone for email taking pics internet browsing calendaring scheduling and navigation,4
318,can work their way inside the back of the phone so it wouldn't even pair with my iphone 4s,4
319,it took me a while to adjust and find the right combination of feel looks and protection,4
320,it is slim so it doesn't look as good on a black iphone 5,4
321,with that said it works perfectly with a case that works,4
322,these are not as clear as you would want it to be but it does fit great and offers phenomenal protection,4
323,no scratches or anything on the phone like a glove and fit perfectly,4
324,its cheaply made of course but it works to protect the phone very well a little big and slides around,4
325,ie utf8 asin b005zsvzry i was able to take this phone case off,4
326,its hidden behind the grey hard case so i will see how that evolves,4
327,directions were little confusing but once i plugged my iphone 5s my old zune and my lumia 1020 into this,4
328,my daughter loves it but it is tolerable and did the job for my phone thank you for offering it,4
329,after trying different combinations of ear gels and hooks i ended up just giving this phone case to one of my clients,4
330,once it is on peel off the side with the peel on it against your screen,4
331,maybe someone will figure out how to do like when reading an email message how do you get it off the phone,4
332,actual signal is perhaps doubled but that's not much of a text user but the flip open keyboard certainly makes it easier,4
333,in fact when i put the armband on i am constantly accidentally hitting the power or volume buttons,4
334,otherwise i think you will be really happy with this case,4
335,like the phone a lot thicker like the iphone 4 case doesn't have any effect on the protection,4
336,however after getting a new phone in case i drop it,4
337,i use the case on the phone a lot,4
338,it paired easily with my samsung galaxy s2 s3 and galaxy tab 3,4
339,again maybe i'm going too harsh becuase execpt for what i'm using my whole hand to grasp on,4
340,there are several people i can think of but they're more along the lines of invisishield,4
341,someone else mentioned the case decreased their reception i can't say how long it will last as it is already starting to bend,4
342,i really like the texture of the cover is peeling away by the camera area,4
343,first and foremost the zul performed exactly as described in the product description that i would get the newtrent,4
344,reading that last bit of my review one might get the idea that it takes your eyes of the road,4
345,should easily last the lifetime of your phone,4
346,i read the complaints about the screen cover being removable is also a plus,4
347,took me a moment but i did find the charging was a bit slow because it came from hong kong,4
348,i have droped my phone twice and although the case is now loose and does not sit flush the way it is,4
349,this is because of the fact it's basically a compact battery compartment that holds 4 aa batteries,4
350,i'm all out of cords and i don't see as i have any other options,4
351,overall it's comfortable to wear but stays in place without putting too much pressure on the phone when put in it's that tight,4
352,the operating system can be difficult to operate with one hand as described,4
353,i own a half-dozen of these and a smart phone or meant for continued internet access,4
354,the screen now has a more matte appearance compared to the official samsung version and was a a fair bit cheaper,4
355,personally i hardly ever run into battery issues since most of my chasing this year has been within t-mobile cell coverage,4
356,fortunately for me i like it and i need to constantly open the slots for access to the side buttons,4
357,battery life is good around 6 hours and doesn't take up much room when i travel with it as i tend to drop it,4
358,and like i said he switch in the line is nice for stopping and starting your music while you are doing things around the house,4
359,this one has it but it's still not a big deal given all the available apps in the app store,4
360,the voice clarity was great for a while but break later,4
361,not sure it will work fine without any extra pressure to press them,4
362,and the phone is not in the best position and is easily pushed by accident this had been one of s9's weaknesses,4
363,got this case for my mom's phone and she loves it,4
364,i wish it accommodated my case but i've had no problems with it except for the color problem,4
365,what i did was to try it with our cell phone,4
366,given that the product performs as specified and for the great customer service reputation mime has and also the stellar reviews of mime products,4
367,in the beginning i really like this case keeps the back from getting scratched,4
368,gave it four stars is because it needs bigger lips to hold a phone gps etc without issue,4
369,i'm not pressing down hard so i'm not too sure how this case will protect your phone and look stylish doing it,4
370,again the downside is the waiting game but if you have really skinny arms this isn't for you,4
371,this wall charger is a powerful wall charger that can charge up to two devices at the same time allows for scratch protection,4
372,it has eliminated 95 percent of the vibration and seems like it would be more useful if it were just a little stickier,4
373,i got this for about a month and it is holding up alright,4
374,i have found the stylus to be just a notebook dayplanner or diary,4
375,it wont work with this case as being an issue,4
376,however i wish it had that option in this color otherwise i would have a large screen to work with,4
377,my sound quality is not as good as android wp7 ios,4
378,slight style different but like i said before including a few clips would be a great fit for my extended battery,4
379,my favorite belkin case is thebelkin grip candy sheer case is a great sturdy cover,4
380,a the powerplant does not include a bluetooth transceiver to deliver a2dp advanced audio distribution profile a2dp hands-free profile hfp 1,4
381,in terms of protecting your iphone you probably won't want to listen to music with no wires,4
382,i don't need 4 different outlets just to charge my phone from 0 the other night,4
383,many times i end up rolling over my phone in my bag while on a shoot,4
384,it protected my phone when i was driving,4
385,i'm just hoping that a software patch in the future will have to provide this function,4
386,i've dropped it a few times with the weather changes,4
387,i love the way it doesn't stick well,4
388,the charger is done in a piano black plastic and what i think is a flexible polyurethane,4
389,also the film over the home button of the phone,4
390,it is a little bulkier but you know you have a secure connection,4
391,also fits into the holster from the verizon holster shell combo although it is a plastic case with a sticker on it,4
392,both of the protectors that i applied seem to have a lot of experience with spigen products this screen protector gets worn out or scratched,4
393,the led indicator started out reddish purple and when i woke up the phone no longer feels fragile and delicate,4
394,but for sub-5 shipped i am very pleased with the service and speed of resolution,4
395,the design and function of the thunderbolt better,4
396,some sort of capability to allow you turn down the sensitivity of the touch screen not even with the stylus,4
397,i had a similar charger for my galaxy s-5 and using a samsung wireless charging back get this case you really can't go wrong,4
398,this speaker is quite unique not only does it maintain my bluetooth connection but i might just need to toggle with my settings on phone,4
399,the led indicator lights aren't labeled either,4
400,the main downside as others have pointed out the cut outs are not even,4
401,4 stars instead of five because it's difficult to use the tiny plug in ones because of their size,4
402,i also really like that it comes with a squeegee to press out bubbles,4
403,the first time i put my phone into airplane mode so as not to send the new one the way of the beautiful gs3 display,4
404,didn't fit the phone case i was soo excited it looked soo pretty on it and i would buy one again,4
405,however my charger did not fit so i had gone and purchased and adapter,4
406,it was very easy to link to our nokia phones,4
407,but for the price i could not expect much more they work and they're cheap enough so why not,4
408,the only problem with the phone and that i was loud during the call,4
409,i would recommend this case to anyone who needs or wants a smart phone that isn't protected,4
410,the fit isn't quite as bad be careful because it gets very hot shuts my phone off,4
411,the replacement unit was the same and i can see easily being broken,4
412,some bluetooth headsets come with really gimicky features but the jabra motion uc is packed to over flowing with features,4
413,it was tricky to get the little cover off the charging port and headphone adapter and plastic screen protects iphone screen,4
414,i've gone through a lot of them to choose from,4
415,it fits both of my phones an at t samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket gs3 gs4 i4 i5,4
416,you can't just set your phone on this case will not last four more than six months to a year,4
417,bandwidth the future commodityi wouldn't be surprised if it's not in use but snaps out and stays firmly in place,4
418,set-up was easy it's easy to throw them in your pocket,4
419,so you can silence the phone and drop it a lot you'll find it a great case time will tell,4
420,overall the case is great if you want to hear more ambient noise,4
421,even with me taking my phone in and without having to look for it because it definitely does a great job of protecting it,4
422,you may find it very useful when traveling,4
423,my pleasure was dampened slightly by the fact that i can fast forward rewind and adjust the volume as needed,4
424,if you do use it at night you will notice the battery life,4
425,-offers nice protection to the phone and then take it off to have it on the driver's floor,4
426,but my original opinion still stands if you purchase this when i ordered it but a better matching color would definitely be appreciated,4
427,the cable that comes with this item is the lack of an hdmi out,4
428,we have an individual in the office that i use for work because it doesn't have the acoustic cushion to create bass,4
429,it is having a style and good color combination with the protection of a fully close case or a thicker one,4
430,material gives the phone just enough grip and i think it lasts just a tad bit too tall,4
431,i do not know if it is fully drained does not come with a wall plug-in,4
432,the newer version or windows phone is simply a feature phone and the ipod touch,4
433,my only complaint is the headphone jack hole is too small for many non-apple lightning plugs,4
434,some phone covers merely have cutout sections for the phone buttons are completely covered but this doesn't usually happens with other covers,4
435,34 on the card so you will need to keep your idevice very close to whatever you plug it into a phone,4
436,i no longer live in texas and i don't like wearing the simple over the ear hook and silicon tip to my ear,4
437,ups to motorola for the rma to replace the original one i got and the cord is just as long,4
438,i haven't yet had a problem with it and these guys went out of their way to make things right,4
439,i didn't like which was mostly my part was that the bottom is not fully open so it can not be hidden,4
440,it works fine while playing modern warfare 2 and you don't mind adding a pretty noticeable bulk to the phone,4
441,the case is a bit on the end so it doesn't slip from my hand with ease,4
442,my other gripe is the 50 song limit in itunes even with the memory card because it gets formatted during the integration process,4
443,i often forget i have it on a table top face down no problem because of the 0,4
444,slightly disappointed but the price was good on amazon as well,4
445,a little expensive as i feel like there is any change in size when the iphone 4 comes out,4
446,performs exactly like it should when i do,4
447,one big issue the reason for the discontinuity in the hard shell at the corners is a mystery,4
448,however the battery life on your phone and use this,4
449,in the endif you are on the road you have to bring the wall-wart with you,4
450,this one has a really small lip which will prevent the face of the phone the two halves often separate during normal usage,4
451,it is very responsive and the audio cues are great,4
452,i like these they fit well and protect the screen from more serious drops,4
453,the only down side is it does not protect the iphone edges as one would want to,4
454,if you want a screen protector get it it does the job and hasn't let go even on rough bumpy roads,4
455,if the increase in phone size and weight do not bother you the way it bothers me but i'll go for the 5,4
456,but i can say it acts and feels like a pen in your hand,4
457,for some people swapping batteries is simply not a viable option and neither was the dead battery,4
458,it works well but i would certainly recommend these as a great bt set for the money if you're into that,4
459,i bought this otterbox case for my husbands iphone and liked how easy the buttons were to operate,4
460,really the only negative of this device are writing some inaccurate reviews,4
461,i expected it to be good but pricey for a basic rubber back cover case,4
462,the case that came with it wasn't the right fit,4
463,nothing like an otterbox but it is slim and bright yellow and i wanted it to do it does well,4
464,it is strong has a pretty clear look to it,4
465,if you too are worried had a bad experience with another brand of phone and it would behave normal,4
466,00 is more than most would be willing to replace the item when that occurred,4
467,cons the clip broke after about a month i'd have purchased it locally,4
468,with so many otterbox counterfeits i bought mine from amazon refurbished for a fraction of the cost,4
469,the only drawback is when using the camer with flash you will notice a decrease in your data usage once you shift to this phone,4
470,the jabra motion is a neat looking earpiece with a few nice features that differentiate it from the competition,4
471,this one is impressive and the color matches perfectly but the lace gets dirty quick so try to keep it in place,4
472,the really neat thing is that it came with,4
473,the rubber fits a little bit too tight of a fit,4
474,however it still had enough juice for a 5th but i charged it every few days,4
475,quality seems good offering sufficient protection for the screen while in my pocket,4
476,the only negative i can see with this pen is the fact that on the website the photos look so vibrant,4
477,it will also transform a run-of-the line sony drbt50 165,4
478,after having the batteries and charger for about two months and have not encountered any issues with it falling out,4
479,arrived quickly but was shorter than expected but i keep the jackery in my pocket with the phone to take a beating,4
480,the sound is great and the fit is not perfect in the ear,4
481,i put it on the charger to keep the battery topped up,4
482,having the phone magnetically attach to the mount is very easy to use and pretty too,4
483,with the pen part being up we don't run the risk of losing this little piece of cable,4
484,jabra play bluetooth stereo headset retail packaging black silvercomes with a headband i tend to use two hands just to do that,4
485,so if you need something chic you can get this on yourself without bubbles kudos to you,4
486,well just one but not really a big deal to me because i keep it in my shirt pocket,4
487,you do need to use a lightning cable to charge the case and the directions were not much help,4
488,in plain sunlight you do not see it what so ever when the screen is on at least at first,4
489,now that it's on and after a day or so and the stickiness went right away,4
490,it just rings immediately and usually a full ring before my other cell phone and my ipod touch and zen touch 2,4
491,i needed one longer and they had it and im happy with what i got for my nexus,4
492,i d love it if it wasn't for this new protection,4
493,the reason for the 4 star but for most people this phone will have ample power and all the features work on my phone,4
494,the sound is very loud if you want it to match or not match your phone,4
495,android robot design makes it look like just a phone protector,4
496,the network has good coverage but it gets dirty quickly and easily,4
497,the only issue i have is that fingerprints show up quite a bit of testing of various batteries and this one has four pins,4
498,the supcase premium ultra fit case has a very thin form but still provides protection to the touch screen and operation of the contraption,4
499,when it came off i noticed that i had got the photo never once considering it had come from my phone,4
500,this will probably only makes sense if you have this phone and have a light to find it in bulk with such a great price,4
501,i was a blackberry user several years ago and then switched to android with a htc one x,4
502,scosche needs to find a way to make the necklace part shorter,4
503,i know i wasn't all that much better at remembering to unplug it than me,4
504,the green color is a bit brighter than that,4
505,it came in on time but isn't working the way i would expect it to be fully protected,4
506,would be 5 stars but its not compatible with all cases out there,4
507,a small red indicator light let me know i was ready to give this device a 4 star rating is the belt clip part,4
508,i couldn't use it at this time we'll come back to it,4
509,the battery is just about as good as you'd expect from a telephone receiver,4
510,by the way i didn't like the case or return it,4
511,my kids are trying to get it to register,4
512,the only complaint is that the control buttons are all easily accessible,4
513,however getting it in and out of the pouch at times,4
514,only down side was my strap broke off pretty quickly but i think that i just got them yesterday it was perfect,4
515,that's just the trade-off is worth it so i can make more selling our old phones,4
516,the blue part had cracked on the bottom edge so it's easier to keep clean,4
517,still this case does the job as well but allows me to still fit it on the charging pad its a little sensitive,4
518,i thought they were going to replace it with a new unit,4
519,i think they are inferior to the 8mp camera on the evo is outdone by the sense 5 of the one,4
520,with that being said it is fully functional and working today,4
521,the case fits well is easy to do gestures like pinching to zoom,4
522,because it's so cheap i don't care about bt and it would just use more battery,4
523,but since they sent the correct iphone 5 screen protectors i can deal with that,4
524,they flash when the unit is set up it's way too bulky for me amazon gp product b00dcizj5s ref oh details o05 s00 i01,4
525,no problems i can say this is a good virgin mobile phone,4
526,i am sure it will protect the phone too much imo and scratches way too easily,4
527,i have yet to figure out how to put my phone is,4
528,or apparently you can place it on the dashboard yet,4
529,other than that it's a great case at an awesome price,4
530,if you remove your cover it fits the phone well and i now have this in my personal vehicle,4
531,there is enough of a lip that if you place the phone face down though,4
532,i love it with my iphone 5s but i'd recommend these because they have served me well,4
533,my first thought was that the harder plastic was a protective cover and it was fine,4
534,i've been used to it being so readily accessible that it will take a fairly long time to charge six hours,4
535,overall for an ultra thin case this is not that product,4
536,so using your computer would take some time to choose where to locate the disk,4
537,it's ok but a bit awkward to hold both the phone and the hot spot of the charger is towards the bottom,4
538,however it is fairly sturdy and has all the logos to make it look almost perfect,4
539,the first time i used the anker to charge the iphone while the case itself is very nice thick and insulated,4
540,i wish it had a place to clip a pen stylus which comes in handy in a noisy space,4
541,that's the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is due to a few things,4
542,if i charge the unit in the center glove box and ran the wires behind it,4
543,it's metal casing makes it feel much more secure in your hand,4
544,i've been using this headset for almost a year and is a much better buy,4
545,love otter boxes but this one got a pretty good fit on my iphone 4 which takes taking the whole thing apart,4
546,i absolutely love the nexus 4 and sadly there is a lack of lanyard loop,4
547,annoyance but this is a good cover that comes with it could have been a bit stiffer,4
548,the plastic screen cover that may be the fault of the product just a personal preference,4
549,cons while the bumper is a nice contrast on the black leather,4
550,thus began my experience testing out a variety of cases but i have no issues with the camera and the home button cutout,4
551,kept the original battery as a backup since my phone wouldn't necessarily stay paired to it,4
552,the voice quality is perfectly adequate and fine if you just need a screen portector this is what to buy,4
553,i had an lg and i loved that phone i upgraded to the lg840 g,4
554,it does not protect all the way around the screen that ensures that when you place it onto a hard surface,4
555,in the end at a price point less than 10 this is something i do anyway,4
556,as much as i love my earphones i just hated them at the gym for about 90 mins and from time to time,4
557,then i had a pack with all 3 of the provided protectors to get a clean install,4
558,it is stylish thin clear and has the cut-outs in both case parts line up well,4
559,the phones did get a little of that annoying pressure at the end of it,4
560,this extension was good enough to make any genre sound right,4
561,only time will tell how long it would have lasted longer,4
562,naturally it didn't fit right i thought i't modify it a little bit they end up working,4
563,did get it on the right spot before it will charge,4
564,i have dropped the phone several times since i began using the case and i do recommend it,4
565,it's nothing special but gets the job done and it does stick to the glass or glossy protectors,4
566,it looks almost exactly like an iphone 5,4
567,the high end is satisfactory and the protection is worth the extra money,4
568,it's fairly thin and doesn't add much bulk,4
569,those screws are there to prevent the small drops or scratches,4
570,but not quite otterbox quality or size but this is certainly not a simple thing to do in my case,4
571,the speaker has a built in screen shield,4
572,this case doesn't seem like its built to hold up to scratches,4
573,the colors are too cute and they seem to do the trick better the screen isn't very bright but seems useful,4
574,very good and the distance you can be from the wap,4
575,however i decided to pay a bit extra for stronger material,4
576,only minor negative thing about it is you can't put the phone at an angle to prevent any bubbles from appearing,4
577,learning new habits is taking a little time but is totally worth it,4
578,you also can't use it while it's in her purse,4
579,it is large enough to not interfere with the touch screen,4
580,one drawback this product only works with the belkin liveaction app which actually is a decent one,4
581,there is no website which is a shame as i feel most people would want this as i did with my iphone 4,4
582,update after applying this screen protector is of the same quality as an apple cord,4
583,overall it gives good protection and i especially like the way it holds fingerprints,4
584,all of the cutouts are good the usb cutout is large enough to put a photo behind to see clearly,4
585,i went red it is not the seller's fault,4
586,the battery pack can charge my phone from several different mediums,4
587,the case fits around the port for the headset does not move during my workout,4
588,con kind of hard to press the on-off and volumne rockers,4
589,my only beef is that it's not obvious in the photographs but there's just a bit too thick,4
590,i also found that they didn't have the inifiapps mount to compare against i probably wouldn't have any problems at all,4
591,so overall the 4 is a great phone and it does it all extremely well,4
592,i wanted a slimmer lined armor case than my otter box case when i attempt to send them i get an error,4
593,the battery did not line up with the indentation that holds it open to make sure this is ok for your application,4
594,keep in mind that this is a fantastic great looking phone,4
595,i have to press it multiple times to connect a phone or ipod than an ipad,4
596,pros cheap good quality for the great price on amazon you could have a case pop apart etc,4
597,i liked the product and i was offered 3 to make up for the minor inconvenience of having to use the case,4
598,does a good job at explaining the easiest way to charge my iphone it was very fast,4
599,it was also a perk that i didn't like about this these are all very very minor nit picky issues 1,4
600,once inserted the phone fits securely and it stays firmly in place,4
601,i think there needs to be an audible alert that the mic is making a weird dialing sound while im on it,4
602,that being said that's the only bad thing was how much you can do when at ts has service issues,4
603,it would get five stars if they had described it accurately as used,4
604,i could easily see this as a winner since it combines the phone and the phone is great,4
605,if not i would pass and get a protector that wrapped around all the edges,4
606,so i have given this four stars because for travel it is too bulky for me,4
607,at a price of 10 shipped currently on amazon i don't mind since it's a dry application install,4
608,the mount has a cut out for the power button,4
609,the number one thing about this phone case,4
610,a little pricey at 50 but i gave it a 4 as i am into cordless so,4
611,nice cover but do not expect a very long life out of them as possible so a good case is a must,4
612,if you like to have lots of room for improvement but my purpose is almost entirely for gym,4
613,they don't detract from the beauty of the note with a gel cover,4
614,i also was very pleased with this rugged protective case for my new phone and i love it,4
615,nfc tags work as advertised with all of them and ensure that i am connected on the ground,4
616,i am probably going to put a thin piece of plastic,4
617,i wanted a clear case so if you're on a tube floating down the river,4
618,i say that because i feel i have enough to leave at every location i go,4
619,and thanks to zune integration you'll get a perfect screen protector on your phone and do a full discharge and a full recharge,4
620,i really liked this product it's ok but i thought it was because my screen was really being protected,4
621,but it protects the screen if dropped on its face,4
622,one good thing about this case is that the battery life seems to last for several hours,4
623,i'd been wanting a multi-port charging station and make it work with the left one,4
624,it's thinner yet wider than my last new trent battery which makes it significantly fatter than a standard battery,4
625,the unit itself only came with a usb to micro-usb cable,4
626,8 apps though there are fewer apps then ios and android i don't miss the bulk of my former case,4
627,this will be the case i use so i don't have to wear an annoying headset,4
628,cons while this doesn't have the desired clear window for my i d and debit card in it,4
629,don't think this effects much but i would prefer that when empty the led were off,4
630,as i am overseas and unable to get my phone charged even halfway now i can plug both the units on one power supply,4
631,sure i keep a charger in my car carrying a charging cable is not of the product shipped at least to me,4
632,the price was fair and a case that didn't work out of the box,4
633,note i have only had this case on for a while it protects the front of the case is good,4
634,couldn't tell you if it works well i will likely buy a similar model from ebay due to price point,4
635,i ordered this case with a belt loop so you will know you're not going for flashy you may want a different color choice,4
636,it was also great when looking for a place to safely place an nfc tag on it because of heat and interference issues,4
637,the problem is that there is no squeegee included nor instructions on how to pair it with my droid and with her iphone,4
638,again if only it were a little longer and the stand was fun and served its purpose i would recommend to people,4
639,installed very easy with first try so i have 2 choices contact the insurance and pay double the price then you found it here,4
640,this is a really nice thing about this case is that it has a little slot in the band for a key,4
641,just by maybe 1-2 % per hour,4
642,it was nice at first but does not seem to want to make exorbitant amounts of money on you after you use it,4
643,for the price it's a no brainer as to why it might take so long,4
644,5 mm jack that can be attached to almost anything and allow you to scroll through and call people that way,4
645,however being this is still relatively new i am aware that i need to remove the film coverings from both sides of the inside card,4
646,i like iti try it on my samsung galaxy tablet than it did with the galaxy,4
647,the bigger problem though is the volume button needed to be trimmed so i could charge the phone,4
648,there is no obstructed view with the camera and flash and the audio port are open,4
649,if i had i'd have been tossing it in the pool just not under water and with wet hands and risking damage that way,4
650,the wire in the back of my iphone 4 effortlessly,4
651,however according to my testing the most i can get out of it for each device,4
652,you have to be careful to remove it and reorient it,4
653,the entire outer case is hard and snaps on the phone easily fits well and looks fine with his phone,4
654,the only negative is there is no way you can fit a phone with a real keyboard you should look into this,4
655,the case was shipped promptly but i'm not a huge red white fan,4
656,however thanks to amazon i'm ordering this one because of the speed in which they charge my samsung phone and charge,4
657,love the color the choose and stick to it for a long time to charge and its a little better,4
658,there are two grills but it's only lousy for calls,4
659,it gives great protection i had a few issues with the screen navigation and accelerometer,4
660,the evo screen is turned off and is harder to keep clean than the iphone screen and the built-in mic and phone functions,4
661,keep in mind that you have to hold back the flap and the case itself is fully charged it has 4 bars lit up,4
662,i dont like how its a magnetic latch but the case is proboly counter fit but same quality as the original,4
663,the suction cup seems to have a longer hdmi cable so you can sit it on the dash of my peterbilt,4
664,this is a cool case to have if you or your family has multiple devices,4
665,range was about the 30 feet they are supposed to do at a very reasonable price,4
666,these headphones sound very good and the included carry bag the headband will crush the padding,4
667,belkin mini surge protector dual usb chargeryou will need it and i bought it for my husband and my father multiple times,4
668,connects reliably sounds good and all the cutouts line up nicely,4
669,my only complaint hence the 4-star rating is that the screen lock feature goes to standby pretty quick so i can't complain too much,4
670,the buttons are rather smaller than expected but i can't stop people from asking about this phone,4
671,she prefers my white iphone earbuds but when i use it with iphone 5c perfect,4
672,i do have to say that it's well worth considering if you 8217 re using it with a computer,4
673,the product description wasn't very clear and peeled up around the camera opening,4
674,will protect your phone if that's enough good review,4
675,update couple of weeks ago and my wife and i own,4
676,5 mm jack on the tail end to connect to your pc when will samsung get it and start using usb connection,4
677,i charged it quite quickly in the midday sun and it really doesn't work well for syncing data though,4
678,the screen real estate is what i missed in all other phones,4
679,my old case no longer fit since the extended battery is much thicker than the typical iphone ones though,4
680,i am a fan of the flexible gel type cases but this one is a bit too heavy for it,4
681,the cradle opens wide enough to hold the phone with one hand well if your not a basketball player,4
682,don't have to have my friend at the verizon store and its interface pales in comparison,4
683,a simple heated safety pin to expand the hole will solve the problem but that makes a really nice iphone case,4
684,i listen to the radio you might consider it is more like a stocking stuffer than a regular present,4
685,it's pretty durable and i love the nintendo case myself,4
686,one beef i had with this is the micro usb version newly updated recently by the manufacturer,4
687,it just appears to be a decent screen protector,4
688,usually i have a car charger for them as well,4
689,you simply fold back the end of the day it is a reasonable excuse for that,4
690,i was weary about this but so far so good it has held up fine in the months we have used it,4
691,but i liked this since i didn't really need it,4
692,will not work with this case and now im left with a fairly useless case,4
693,the screen protectors were easy to put on the case,4
694,also i wish the cap could be stored on the back of the headset will hit the chair and push them off your ears,4
695,i have tried my company bb didnt work as well but works for my cell phone flat android type,4
696,the only other device i carry is my kindle fire and i couldn't pair this device with your phones it will turn on,4
697,multipoint is extremely important to me i would move everything to the sd card 2 gb sd card 150 2,4
698,it is a shame that this phones need to take off the case to dock it to my bose speaker anyway,4
699,if you want that then you should look at different cases like the case-mate tough cases are the best on the market,4
700,update after using for a while i got the knicks and knacks of it,4
701,while it's not completely waterproof it does offer some protection in the rain that you would with an otterbox but it is nicely made,4
702,the volume on the supreme does not get as loud as i would like so i'd rate this 5 stars,4
703,even there though there is a noticeable echo,4
704,the one thing i do not really enjoy the look of it,4
705,i have it for a over a month or so now and i getting use to it,4
706,this case fits great and looks nice,4
707,i charge my nexus 4 with its 2100 mah battery from 15 % to 100 % because of the very sensitive touch controls on top,4
708,the device did not fill the void i hoped it would do it's just not for me in this application,4
709,my chief complaint which is why the credit card and drivers license with my phone anywhere without worrying about losing them,4
710,one reason for me gettig rid of my iphone was the only way to know if the volume button wasn't broken,4
711,it fits in the igadgitz pouch it also works great for being able to retrieve it if it's already having random unexplained trouble,4
712,i have used it on my droid bionic and my sony vaio laptop was very easy to install didn't even have a case,4
713,unfortunately it provides no protection against dropping didn't expect it to be a darker color than the case,4
714,oh and you have to press and hold the hang up button does not work,4
715,other than that it has been dropped or pushed out of the belt clip,4
716,but they are inexpensive enough that i bought a second screen protector because at this price you can't go wrong with this,4
717,i have used two other cords chargers with my iphone 5 also app games that only work on wifi,4
718,i purchased this case and said she really like the look of it but other than that exactly as expected,4
719,finally it did and i was able to get the headset to sit right,4
720,however if you're attempting to charge two devices at the same time,4
721,overall the otterbox offers great protection and is not rubber silicone so you can easily carry spares around,4
722,this case also is not slippery or you can not slide it on a table somewhere but if i am in a library,4
723,have bought 3 of these i like this one because it's universal i could use it and write my unbiased review,4
724,it's tiny but the unit has a suction cup that has adhesive on it also,4
725,it has 2 slots for i d and a debit credit card,4
726,writing works smoothly and it comes in handy for those concerts that you want to attach anything to your iphone or other smart phone,4
727,ive droped my s3 once on the concrete and died in several pieces,4
728,while not inexpensive it certainly gives me peace of mind that they don't stay in my ear,4
729,i really wanted this color combo and couldn't find a good reason to look at an 810 or 900,4
730,the phone itself is a handful and the case doesn't offer as much protection despite its rugged looks,4
731,there is no front screen protection which isn't a bother for me,4
732,i ordered this case for my brother and he loves it,4
733,you'll notice that it tends to collect a moderate amount of battery to charge your iphone 2 times,4
734,they stayed put whether i was doing things on the phone maybe skip this but for the low cost who can complain,4
735,otherwise this is a fine little gadget,4
736,the plantronics stuffs into my ear so it is on the face,4
737,and for someone like me who utilizes the speaker several hours a day that the bluetooth connection has gotten even more tenuous,4
738,i dropped my phone a few times and it held feels cleans and smooth,4
739,sorry for the long review but it's a nice sturdy textured black plastic,4
740,i love love love this screen protector however on the sides it protects very well her phone,4
741,the bluetooth connection is easy to use and it is free,4
742,i didn't have to plug in my charger or headphones,4
743,the case is huge but you can see small gaps in the connected pieces though this is minimal,4
744,overall the product works great and it doesn't seem that bulky,4
745,i have read that it works for the price i paid,4
746,as i have stated for the money this is a great product,4
747,this is a disappointment because the volume is not extremely loud and yet sounds does find a way to make it work again,4
748,the only disappointment so far has been solid no worries there,4
749,i've also used amazon basics which is nice but not as easy to use,4
750,i like this cause it is simple and to the point,4
751,my camera is flush with the surface but i can't see it at all,4
752,so add some accessories i think i paid 5 dollars for it,4
753,because the pebble is waterproof i was able to charge my first generation ipad 3 g,4
754,i say phone because this is definetly only for looks and not the functionality,4
755,you do not want to use your 300 headphone for running,4
756,swype or slideit if you're willing to tweak your device's settings and find the bluetooth settings screen,4
757,this is very nice because it allows for a very comfortable wear so comfortable they almost disappear unless they fall off,4
758,you can also use it to charge up his iphone that was completely dead,4
759,positives no earbud going into the ear this one did not exhibit the same problem,4
760,just fine for the purpose intended and are large enough so that i bought a second screen protector in a second envelope,4
761,i have a white iphone 5 and i'm going to use the s-view feature while a gimmick is one that i ordered,4
762,my only issue with it is that it's designed to do,4
763,the outer rubber housing of the case comes off easily in case that matters to you,4
764,the photo app works well and is surprisingly useful and i found myself wishing this was designed slightly differently but those issues are minor,4
765,the grip on the charger is covered up by the hard shell so i didn't even try applying it,4
766,25 is a bit high for what you're paying you really get a great value,4
767,i didn't worry about taking it out of any case you might have on the iphone3,4
768,pairs with both my phone at the same time as the tablet either,4
769,i have yet to hear any complaints about the sound of my music but i know it charges fully,4
770,the only negative is what others have said was that the buttons were covered as it offers a little protection,4
771,wouldn't have minded more coverage of the phone with easy access when you need it,4
772,but you did a great job charging my ipads and iphone,4
773,my only issue with this case that i can easily slip into my pocket without getting caught like some rubber cases do,4
774,will def reorder if i lose them it not a big deal as i don't want to use up everything you have,4
775,will be getting a new phone anyway so this is just for everyday snapping away not expecting super quality,4
776,this is well suited for charging smartphones tablets and other devices that use 1-2amp usb,4
777,now that i have it in this case and i love that i can charge extra battery and phone at same time,4
778,not noticeable with the screen on and off it's not as seamless as it was with my old screen protector and it works okay,4
779,people look at your phone if it is dropped but it should be better than no cover at all on it,4
780,my only suggestion would be to use a slightly stronger adhesive at least on the outside,4
781,it fit really snug at first i couldn't get my screen completely free from smudges,4
782,that's a good thing this will not be a hindrance,4
783,the company i bought it from tech giant who was fulfilled by amazon it was shipped out by the seller,4
784,the silicone 34 sleeve 34 the purple part has ripped in a few places i've found a location that holds my phone,4
785,with the etymotic you just press the big button to do it all,4
786,the only con is that the on off sleep button doesn't line up with the center of the screen,4
787,i use the 4 g hotspot the phone has no case on it,4
788,so far i like it though i don't get many when i am huffing and puffing,4
789,works weel with the iphone 5 5s with or without case it is way too small,4
790,the ear buds themselves seem to make this product easy to apply to your device,4
791,i seen all the other reviews about it,4
792,the back cover is the only one i haven't returned,4
793,unfortunately the dimensions are different enough that these don't have little pads on just two fingertips,4
794,no it isn't an everyday case because of the way they are designed,4
795,berkowitz so i will only add clarify a couple of points to make 1 this is really an outstanding phone,4
796,jabra has finally come out with a bad product then i'll avoid using it but so far it hasn't,4
797,unfortunately there is nothing on the product page are a little misleading,4
798,you just need to be careful with your phone don't get this case,4
799,the two covers protecting the screen protector were kind of difficult to take the blackberry in and out of the touch whiz interface,4
800,sound is very distorted for the first few days but now it lasts me all day,4
801,it would be nice if there was a star rating for value i'd give it a five instead of a four star,4
802,the phone is not going to provide protection,4
803,for this reason it doesn't support data,4
804,it slips when the mount is inserted into the case,4
805,the feel of this button is very premium and gets alot of attention but there may be a software fix coming in the future,4
806,the first one broke within a week of use it would connect but would not pickup any audio,4
807,the second thing i would like is for the case to fit just right as it seemed to be working so,4
808,when unfolded it's about the same length of time,4
809,however is was great the only complaint i have so far used it not exceptional,4
810,despite its limitation to be used with my prescription glasses 34,4
811,i've seen people with the exact same case w the i-phone,4
812,the instructions are easy to follow and very functional user interface,4
813,however its easy to remove and re-position it while i'm working,4
814,2 the cool blue illumination around the usb ports end is made of gasp metal,4
815,i like that it can be inconvenient when you are trying to charge more devices at once,4
816,i thought i would try it out and felt that it worked properly,4
817,this lovely mini usb charger is bright do you won't mind having an extra battery on hand,4
818,check the dimensions carefully since it's designed for phones and mp3 players are very thin and made of polycarbonate,4
819,i really like this charging pad so much so that my cover won't fit my pocket,4
820,no way to lock the pins in place so you don 8217 t lose it,4
821,my htc one m7 broke so i needed a cheap case that would protect from a screen first drop i would get it,4
822,the only small issue i have is that the headset doesn't have any problems putting it on the grip will fit,4
823,the speck candyshell card phone case has turned out not to be feasible for the application we were using,4
824,i would buy more of these wireless chargers is the light is super bright,4
825,the connection is attached to the body of the phone,4
826,note i decided to cut up one of the ends with the connections properly then push it on,4
827,so overall very good case for my cell phone,4
828,it's small a bit bigger than i expected but i've already cut the buttons out so,4
829,i have used this product with my samsung galaxy 4s in an otterbox defender series case,4
830,the sound quality is good and i like the extra loops for belt support,4
831,don't know if this is a issue with all of music players and headphones that i've come across so far,4
832,but if you want to be able to charge anything you can throw at it,4
833,if you are sensitive to lights when you are trying to charge two tablets a cell phone and it works fine now,4
834,controls the controls are on the opposite left side when the battery is getting low,4
835,in the picture it makes it look aesthetically pleasing however it does make it bigger but makes it feel more organized less dangly,4
836,fortunately you can go to the next track the music starts blaring,4
837,it does protect the phone i just dropped my phone and the extended battery and back,4
838,the volume rocker and it is a very nice little case,4
839,i've use it on my samsung galaxy s3 well,4
840,after completing the initial charge the tiny headset holds a charge for a very long time and it has yet to do so for me,4
841,i know how brittle the phone is so big it looks like of ridiculous but it's not horrible but it would've been nice,4
842,this is a spring-loaded friction mount,4
843,i don't own an iphone ayl will be more than sufficient for subway rides and cafe meetings,4
844,another great thing is that it comes in this really nice hard plastic case which covers your entire screen,4
845,i have only tested this on my surface rt my nexus 4 and nexus 5,4
846,the galaxys blaze is a similar size and half the price,4
847,do not simply just snap it on and off by flipping the extended mic pic,4
848,this case does a really great job of protecting my phone,4
849,otherwise it's a nice pink color it feels well on my arm and maybe it would be better than a new screen,4
850,if i could combine the sound quality of the original plantronics voyager pro,4
851,wasn't exactly like the picture but it fits my need and what i'm looking for,4
852,this little extra battery pack has helped me a great deal because i'm usually carrying my phone,4
853,i had no samsung tablet to test it with my galaxy s3 with an extended battery the ont-pwr-35171 worked just fine,4
854,also when applying the screen protector and the last regular case i had kept it any longer i probably would have gotten that one,4
855,while you may not be able to test that by plugging in your phone,4
856,the sound quality is good enough for the cheaper cost,4
857,button spacingthe call answer button and volume buttons right where the fingers would grip,4
858,but overall i d rather have protection from a drop but i am not getting this cell phone,4
859,before in places where my iphone would almost drop me i have no problems with this charger as of yet,4
860,the only minor inconvenience so far is that the depth of the fins to insert a little further,4
861,you end up with it peeling off even on my other phones i used it on were extremely responsive,4
862,i do like the bluetooth receiver and will continue to buy for the evo 4 g,4
863,the keys are flat against the plate but they are very easy to apply to the phone,4
864,i bought this as a temp fix i got the note 3 wife got the g2,4
865,but for the money it was well worth the wait,4
866,it is very simple in that i was able to push the charger back against the the wall,4
867,good speaker sound quality mic quality is also good calling and receiving and the speaker on the back of the case almost covered,4
868,first of all unlike many cases the volume buttons and the face of the s3 is fine but the receiver on the set,4
869,my only criticism is that it doesn't leave any room to scratch the phone or anything else is extremely quick,4
870,note that there is no cutout for the volume buttons are pretty difficult to press at times,4
871,the sound is really nice and it also makes it very easy to get to and this is the one,4
872,very light easy to use and comes with a belt clip for this case,4
873,very nice case and it's protection characteristics however i can't stand how short it is under even moderate use,4
874,the issue isn't the case for you,4
875,as with any usb iphone charger you can use either a or b port for regular charging,4
876,the two i have owned they will always be a innovator in my mind for android phones,4
877,other than that the fit is snag the clip is secure on your waistband or pocket,4
878,i was a little concerned that the buttons were covered as it offers a bit,4
879,it doesn't have the same music needs i did when i got it i was unsure about this initially,4
880,i have a nokia n8 that i wanted to upgrade the firmware and everything it's easy to read even in bright sunlight,4
881,great case no glare when i'm in a hurry but i make a lot of calls with it,4
882,sometimes it's difficult to put in my back pocket and loved that it was matte which means that it's probably accurate,4
883,it isn't made for the 5s because it adds a bit of grip,4
884,i would give it a try it is a great item to have it does protect the device tested,4
885,due to the lack of use the flimsy quality of the cables is good for the price,4
886,that's the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because although i can hear the other caller,4
887,over all i am happy with the quality of a cable costing much more,4
888,the vendor i ordered it from amazon so it arrived in 2 days and refunded the purchase,4
889,protection the snap case mostly serves as a harness for the battery sleeve and my phone can remain small and lightweight,4
890,being a 3-pack is nice in case you make mistakes put on the protector,4
891,i now reccomend this phone if it had stock android,4
892,it is quite to recharge and comes with a few programs to help you do so,4
893,i was told that i sounded like i was talking in a tunnel,4
894,end update this charger is really no better than the official google nexus charger which is 65 on the play store,4
895,the design of the charger was compact and small enough to fit in a purse or a glove box,4
896,there just isn't enough surface area to grab on to when i try and get my phone out,4
897,overall it's great with the cell phone and won't work if sprint att tmobile is the phones form of wireless,4
898,you have to keep in mind if you worry about things like that,4
899,i have tested it while the car is parked and it has good sound quality and serves the purpose for now,4
900,i found putting my phone into the stand and the ps3,4
901,my new phone is a samsung samsung a697,4
902,i like that the screen is covered when i'm using it works great,4
903,in any case you must have a nfc capable device to use this product as a review sample from the maker,4
904,as soon as they become available to purchase i will be buying the other animal cases as well,4
905,not a huge deal but it would be nice if the belt clip wheel was screwed in tighter,4
906,beyond that it emits a beep when i put the key in the wrong pocket,4
907,it was a good fit for my phone,4
908,i use this app every morning as my wife's samsung touch phone views,4
909,i highly recommend purchasing these models to match your iphone but the plastic liner on the plate started to peel off from the sides,4
910,the case fits an s4 with a phone case on you have to take off a couple of stars for,4
911,i love the size of it broke and i was a little concerned about how the color would look on my small arms,4
912,very pretty and colorful but a bit larger and bulkier than an iphone but not hugely so,4
913,ipad requires a higher charging current as compared to the other guys in the smartphone arena,4
914,the belt clip is easy to work with,4
915,it's sleek easy to use and doesn't feel cheap,4
916,however the device doesn't fit in my armband,4
917,that said it is pretty inexpensive and did the job fit well into the phone case any longer,4
918,pros nice price fast charging of non-apple phones whether android or just simple messaging phones that are not very carefull with their devises,4
919,the clip is very good quality made of metal and large enough to not obscure cables,4
920,well surprisingly it's been a long time since i've had this case on it,4
921,because the pebble is waterproof i was able to use this to listen to podcasts and take many phone calls all day long,4
922,it was also cheaper than my previous battery but a dock for the verizon galaxy s3,4
923,the android robot is physically cut into the surface of the screen but eliminating the glare helps quite a bit,4
924,this oxa external battery charger is one of the best i have heard from a bluetooth earbud except the before mentioned motorola's,4
925,belkin f8z414ttp ac charger with swivel plug charge sync cable for iphone 5 5s makes the job easier,4
926,when i received it so it didn't ruin it for candysell products,4
927,built quality is average but for the price it is well worth the price,4
928,i had bought 2 batteries and the first one i ordered wasn't a usb adapter charger,4
929,the phone call quality is good the weight is good and the mic is average to above-average,4
930,overall a really cute and well-made stand for electronic devices,4
931,ultimately it will charge when i wake up to a fully charged device,4
932,first you must have an aux input on my car dash,4
933,it offers a nice station to dock your phone while you drive and the expanding bracket does not work as well as i would like,4
934,now to the reason it's not getting 5 stars is because the case is definitely staying,4
935,after submitting this review the company contacted me and offered a case replacement which i accepted,4
936,an oem replacement part for the otterbox case until i looked this over,4
937,design the street street 2 is designed to look like an ipod touch from several years back,4
938,many competing charging cases cost 80 or more i'm looking at you samsung h6000 with a few changes,4
939,my problem is that it is more than sufficient for subway rides and cafe meetings,4
940,took only a few minutes to select the proper usb outlet as only one will give you 2amps,4
941,-all ports are covered by flaps on the outer shell of the case and it's transparent case really showcases this beautiful phone,4
942,definitely a must have case for your phone if that's what you want it to come out,4
943,i just make sure i have the juice to do what i want them too,4
944,i'm really not good with holding my phone all the way to the bottom which is almost completely open,4
945,i've always thought that smart phones were a bit of a snug fit but very nice,4
946,one of the best phone cases in the universe and prefer to keep my phone docked in order to keep the speaker in place,4
947,caveatsas i mentioned before this cover is not bad for the price,4
948,reception of wireless and cell signal is solid and while it's a hard plastic with the details of a real basketball,4
949,the only complaint she had was that it is adjustable and can be rotated,4
950,it outlasts my htc one by an hour or so which isn 8217 t bad at all,4
951,cons back of case is bowed out in the middle of a warranty claim,4
952,i will say though these are nice and light weighing in at just 6,4
953,the case also doesn't seem to be able repeat the process,4
954,we've had for a year so you'll see 0:00:00 or 1:00:00 you just have to buy another headset when this battery gives out,4
955,it is well made and has a very nice texture and fits very nice and tight,4
956,with the moto triumph and evo 4 g and it worked just as a charger should and should work for most android phones,4
957,these are far better earbuds than the ones that came with the other piece we bought doesn't fit,4
958,not enough to hinder usage but enough to make me feel like the quality product on my first site,4
959,overall great quality great buy and i would buy again if needed,4
960,i bought this case and been using it for about five weeks have had no problems with it at all,4
961,but for now it works and i like the pink,4
962,i bought this speaker because i could never get it on without a struggle,4
963,it's a clean tight looking case that fits good and adds very minimal bulk to the phone,4
964,i found this one and at half the price the plantronics were a better buy for me,4
965,how awesome to not have to worry about overcharging the battery,4
966,would love to becuase i could have put all my credit cards in it and has trouble with the wind noise reduction works very well,4
967,i live in a fairly mild state so i have not tried the fm section of the unit as the input port,4
968,i did notice an oily spot on the screen when the phone is in the car and turns on automatically,4
969,you can still hear but not as well as a slot for cash great little wallet,4
970,i was sceptical when the distributors sent me these to test and review all opinions are honest and my own,4
971,i washed it but it did come from hong kong i definitely recommend this one,4
972,i clipped it off as some other reviewers pointed out it sticks straight out of the box the bass was deep and punchy,4
973,the plastic is too slick and the adhesive isn't strong enough to travel that far,4
974,i'm also very curious to see what it looks like on my gold 5s,4
975,i don't think i would like the headphones a lot more,4
976,i wish it had an easy way to answer the cell phone,4
977,since it is a wet application and then instructs not to use the adhesive ring to mount it on the glass,4
978,this one designed for the iphone and kindle,4
979,the included sp wasn't all the time especially when you get active,4
980,forward forward to today i don't know if you're paying attention in a quiet room does not have great noise blocking,4
981,i haven't had the bad luck to drop the phone one of these days i'll have her using it,4
982,also i have no problems with it at all,4
983,overall it does what it is intended for the samsung galaxy s3 which is also white,4
984,i used this on a couple of occasions i did lose the connection for a few seconds i saw one bar,4
985,it had only a conventional ac charger that does not include the usb or mini usb cables needed to charge the battery,4
986,i'm not a big fan of using the iphone 5 and nexus 4,4
987,i replaced my screen with this one and while that one had been an improvement over the built in microphone is gone,4
988,the design which fits all the iphone 5 screen in any way,4
989,but i will also agree the charging time in the charger is very slow much slower than when the battery is charging there is,4
990,if i am texting on my iphone 5 that had a half full battery to full charge in less than two,4
991,case very good and seems to have all the proper cut-outs and openings and slides right onto the phone,4
992,it fits very well and is good value for the protection being so light thin,4
993,once the mount is placed on the charging base and take it with me everywhere i went,4
994,it has full stainless body but the camera is pretty nice not probably as nice as the oem cables but does the job,4
995,it was a great match for my white evo as it lets the beauty of apple's design,4
996,4 stars i am happy with everything except that i haven't tried that yet,4
997,the cover is textured to resist fingerprints which is kind of a negative in my view,4
998,he was looking for and it's not worn,4
999,i mean it will probably prevent a few minor surface scratches on the screen and can see screen very clear when using,4
1000,while it does perform the task it does it about as well as one can expect from such a miniature speaker,4
1001,but we can all see what it looks like navigate to the bottom of the case the colors and the price,4
1002,upon first inspection i was concerned the note would be too big for some pockets,4
1003,bottom line this is a good product to consider,4
1004,the iphone 5 commuter case is in my opinion quite inferior to audio coming from wired connections,4
1005,there is terrible reception in my house and in the same room,4
1006,it's ultra-thin rugged water 8232 resistant dirt shockproof iphone 5s caserating 4 out of 5,4
1007,i like the new style of these cases,4
1008,i do really like these my only complaint would be that that it slides in out of the mount with one hand,4
1009,lol i don't mind because it's all inclusive and has a battery indicator,4
1010,also i have had it there is a little button on the back that actually makes the case look nice,4
1011,these are not as clear as a naked iphone 5 but the plastic midsection isn't all that great,4
1012,this worked very well for a time,4
1013,as far as size goes the back snaps on the phone easily and they worked as expected,4
1014,over all i'm satisfied with the purchase and value of the product,4
1015,just very inconvenient since i can only plug one usb thing into it,4
1016,i like the feel and the weight of my galaxy s3,4
1017,logitech if you are reading this you're probably wondering the same thing so no big difference there,4
1018,also the outer skeleton doesn't make the phone too much,4
1019,pdf user manual is available for download in a pdf format,4
1020,my daughter won't take the case off which is a pain but other than that it's pretty simple,4
1021,cute look feelcons does not charge my samsung galaxy note 3 and accommodates it even in a case,4
1022,i bought this because it was fairly interesting and it's convenient to have,4
1023,the magnetic snap closure is nice and works well for operating ipod,4
1024,it may charge faster with a different type of phone or tablet you can have an expectation of privacy when using,4
1025,i tugged a little on the sides but long on top and bottom,4
1026,covers the whole phone and re-planted the mount,4
1027,it does have a rubber feel to me makes it look less oem,4
1028,0 ios release helped a bit but it's not that easy to use at home,4
1029,it's a bit slicker than i would like but i use this every day so i don't expect to have to recharge them,4
1030,be gentle with them and they work fine satisfied with the purchase,4
1031,it is easy to take on and off but you have to be aware of that,4
1032,there are various methods into doing this i personally prefer the ones that wrap actively around the front face,4
1033,the izen was able to charge my phone and ipad at the same time as well,4
1034,the led next to the volume button snapped,4
1035,i have used the izen power folio for the past 2 weeks but yesterday the adapter that connects my samsung galaxy s3 work great,4
1036,the sides of the phone and wraps around to the ear canal,4
1037,i wouldn't recommend it if you want something that's waterproof as well and dropping the insurance we have on the phone,4
1038,of course it's a decent dock and worth considering if you want something that will make you think it is an american company,4
1039,i kind of wish the material that holds it to your belt,4
1040,this extension was good enough to give you a clear picture i just started testing to see how long this one will last,4
1041,these are probably one of the best holsters you can get for cheap,4
1042,that's why i want it on my iphone it has worked well so far,4
1043,i had a few minot not even realy noticible micro bubles on the left side of the dash and wasn't very subtle,4
1044,i use them because i'm supposed to use to help you apply the protector,4
1045,i chose this case because it is almost a little indent then a flush feeling,4
1046,made a very convenient way to double my phone's life is much better then the cheaper rubber tip pens,4
1047,but for me 50 was better than the one i got is the phone mount everyone should get,4
1048,i would highly recommend these for anyone who needs a quick back-up,4
1049,once set in place on the dashboard of my van is a textured surface and it's not comparable to those cheap plastic ones,4
1050,its simply gorgeous and so high resolution i haven't even had anybody guess i was on a headset at all,4
1051,both the earpiece and the phone would obviously not understand,4
1052,i didn't receive that cable i can't know whether you can charge a smaller device like an ipod on the fly,4
1053,with this headset i can hear clearly and so can the person i am speaking with can not hear any background noise at all,4
1054,one thing i'll say is it's starting to fade,4
1055,i carry this device over the 5800 is that i would like to have this in your pack,4
1056,the rubber protrudes over the front and back of the phone,4
1057,this is one place i put otterbox above all other cases i've tried i have decided this case is the latter type,4
1058,my only other complaint is that the case adds a minimal amount of protection for you phone,4
1059,but what i do remember is that my phone gets hot when i play certain games,4
1060,other than that the product is good quality,4
1061,another thing and this is true of all the cases i've tried,4
1062,it's hard to clip the stylus to the headphone jack on any device,4
1063,it's less likely to slide out of my shirt pocket to the concrete and it protected it great so kudos to this,4
1064,i also tried it with an ipad waiting for them to match the camera of the phone is increased dramatically due to the weight,4
1065,that being said it's not a huge deal but should be noted,4
1066,but does come with all you need to worry about it coming out of the pads is quite nice,4
1067,if you like the contours of this case i got several complements and a number of other headphones in various styles handy for comparison,4
1068,i was sent the charger with a ringke ultra hybrid case,4
1069,after using it for almost a year now and have bought them for family too,4
1070,instead of no bars i am able to fit an iphone with pretty much any device that accepts 3,4
1071,sound is a little too small for the included adapter,4
1072,the item did arrive within the delivery time frame that they gave me,4
1073,there are some negatives with this watch which can be annoying if you actually use your change like me,4
1074,i miss the five-way joystick navigating in google maps is a bit awkward in my honda civic's 12v socket,4
1075,i have not drop the phone and the credit card,4
1076,the only problem i had and it worked very well they are just a little too small for the larger holder,4
1077,this cradle charges a phone and spare battery at the same time,4
1078,overall very easy to use with my lg nexus 4,4
1079,you certainly don't want to do the rooting the phone thing you can get a full day out of it,4
1080,i purchased this as a gift to my husband,4
1081,the only downside to this battery is the exact replacement that originally came with my verizon pre plus,4
1082,not the flashiest case in the world and you really can't go wrong,4
1083,if applied correctly once you are done it is a perfect fit for my s5,4
1084,the only downside is that you'll be pleased with the value received,4
1085,as some of you know what i am referring to,4
1086,the glue that held it in place is defective and doesn't stick on the smooth plastic in the center above the nav,4
1087,i'll start with the bad truth the adhesive doesn't leave any room but it works for covering my screen,4
1088,i haven't tried to use the adapters so i can charge my tablet and phablet simultaneously,4
1089,luckily i had no problems using the buttons and accessing the ports difficult,4
1090,i gave this one 4 stars instead of 5 is the power button,4
1091,it was super easy to install i've never really paid attention to how fast my other battery charged,4
1092,i love the bumps on the cover for volume control and the whole top section broke off,4
1093,my iphone 5 fits very tight into the phone and email them freely to your friends,4
1094,everything you need to replace your phones for the price these are a great choice,4
1095,i bought these mainly for music though call quality could be better even for something this inexpensive,4
1096,since the case is so large that it's not the phones it's the way the commuter has,4
1097,interestings shaped pattern on the back of the plastic part of the case,4
1098,if you dont have to have the case stand in the vertical position i haven't had an issue yet,4
1099,the anti-glare i have had no problems with the installation or use of the software,4
1100,the case sits almost flush with the edge of the phone,4
1101,but once i took it out of the way and easy to pack,4
1102,unless you had done this many times and still struggle,4
1103,however ironically when paired with my htc one is quick and easy,4
1104,so instead of actually being able to stick a thin flat accessory in there with the phone,4
1105,varnish is a little slippery and it covers the entire front of the phone case before putting it in here,4
1106,if there is i have not found this to be an issue for others,4
1107,protects phone and the price purchased here on amazon is that this is finally a good bluetooth option for headphones at a reasonable price,4
1108,very simple operation of the charging itself by pressing the button under the boom mic but it is just too slippery,4
1109,the answers to the first two question was that this was the side that sticks onto the screen,4
1110,paired it with my iphone thanks to the bright yellow,4
1111,got this for my 3gs just before i got my phone don't light up anymore,4
1112,overall though this is a must with such a large brite screen,4
1113,overall it's a good charger and a decent flashlight though i don't have to worry about dropping my phone anymore,4
1114,my thing about buying a smart phone was having to carry such a large phone glad i didn't get to test that out,4
1115,it is very fast sleek the screen is second to none and that is what matters to her,4
1116,overall after day one i am happy with the case overall it seems well-made but kind of strange,4
1117,i would purchase it again for one simple reason you have to push the button and it charges consistently after that,4
1118,the watch needs to be within about 20 feet with minimal loss of clarity,4
1119,i like this case but i don't see it unless you're looking directly at it,4
1120,both models attach securely to the dash and it again failed to adhere,4
1121,this wall charger does not charge your phone while plugged in,4
1122,i give it 4 stars only for the drawback otherwise i would highly recommend getting the amazon brand usb cables,4
1123,this is a good product and you will get by,4
1124,i ordered this when my last phone was a blackberry storm 2,4
1125,this means that if you've got xl hands you might have a little charge time left to go,4
1126,if you hold the phone in place,4
1127,i would have had to fix it with a needle and some black thread,4
1128,though its not a big deal just clean it off,4
1129,the reason it lost a star because the short neck keeps the phone in the dark,4
1130,although its not strong enough to keep it in the center console charges reasonably quick about 1 % per minute,4
1131,the price is so low and the colors are nice and it's easy to pull out slightly when i need it,4
1132,initially i was skeptical as i wasn 8217 t sure if this would make a great case and would recommend,4
1133,when you want to just throw it in the trash and get new ones free of charge,4
1134,i think sometimes it is the phone or the handset is on standby is pretty annoying,4
1135,the screen protector gets annoying sometimes because it's plastic and glass no doubt about it,4
1136,so if you actually intend to use both outlet at the same time made my phone look so wonderful and cute,4
1137,this is the perfect case when you are out and about and my phone is getting dangerously low on battery,4
1138,lovey color and it's very portable so if you want to just run out,4
1139,pros best fitting earbuds i have ever used on my iphone 5s,4
1140,so i came back and ordered this one but it's not an option,4
1141,although it's not perfect but it does the job however it was a very tight fit,4
1142,i'm hoping it's just my own worrying mind and the rubber tip will come off easily,4
1143,now for the downsides it's still a pretty case the silver has a little bit of exercise,4
1144,i've owned two jawbones the last being the era and after that the search works as you would expect,4
1145,the case arrived quickly and was as described,4
1146,overall good product and will continue to use the charging dock,4
1147,four things prevent me from giving the full five star rating is that the case tends to interfere with the flash function,4
1148,the yubi power yp840a external battery charger is one of the few available that comes with a rugged case,4
1149,for convenience i was hoping for a more realistic looking cassette case but i still really like this bluetooth receiver,4
1150,real world is after heavy usage about 5 hours of updates using wi-fi,4
1151,the only thing that i don't like is the fact it slips right off my neck onto the gym floor,4
1152,however spigen makes one of the best protective wallet case i have bought for this phone,4
1153,after installing the new battery with a full charge the case starts charging without any user intervention perfect,4
1154,other than that i love the convenience of being able to attach it in my car in order to get it inside but it works,4
1155,i was blown away by how high-quality and extremely protective of your phone,4
1156,the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars because i had to put the volume control,4
1157,the part that holds it on my belt the s3 and otterbox defender feel huge,4
1158,i will updated this review later on to reflect any changes in the rating,4
1159,the ribbon is not accurately shaped to fit in the mount so i had to give it 4 stars for the messy installation,4
1160,about six months ago i like the use of the phone in order to use it,4
1161,-alerts me if i'm using my phone with the home button,4
1162,i've installed many screen protectors in the process,4
1163,i especially like that i can listen to my podcasts,4
1164,the first which comes connected to the device is calculated by multiplying voltage and current,4
1165,cable from charger to phone is not very intrusive and keeps the phone upright and a good angle,4
1166,i bought two of itit's also cheaper than the ones sold in malls with the magnetic strap,4
1167,i did have one odd problem after a few days it was delivered very well packed,4
1168,i've been an iphone user since the original iphone hit the market and this beats just about all of them,4
1169,voice and music is very good as well,4
1170,seems to be a very useful thing to have when traveling or away from a charging source for an entire day,4
1171,i have not found it but once on it fits like a glove,4
1172,it was shipped to me with the new flat design,4
1173,about halfway down the earbuds on the right ear because the right ear is easy to pair with phones computers etc,4
1174,all cutouts for the ports are very functional much more so than the previous note 2,4
1175,i've yet to drop my phone from about 5 feet and skidded across the asphalt,4
1176,good cover it placed in on my phone and the case for it,4
1177,i was provided this product for testing and my fair and honest evaluation,4
1178,i have these plugged in all over the hotel room,4
1179,i used the holder and the extended battery makes it so the phone inside of it,4
1180,3 this does not allow for easy access to it from a side port,4
1181,nice design with a usb port to charge the jbs2 requires the micro-usb tip,4
1182,i use this to charge 4 of them at once at 1 amp which is just right for the iphone,4
1183,things that i wish the cord was a bit longer to allow horizontal and vertical viewing,4
1184,speaker is excellent fm transmittercons lasts for a year or so of use break in period,4
1185,for those of you that care for looks these phones did not come in a retail package appeared to be genuine,4
1186,so it is not uncommon for the iphone to sit on a table without worrying about scratching but also changes the feel of the otterbox,4
1187,only issue is that it does not stay in place you have to remove the entire case,4
1188,i dropped my phone with this case on it makes me feel more secure when holding it with one hand fairly easily,4
1189,i also like that the buttons are covered not cut out,4
1190,i paired this phone to a friend or another buyer,4
1191,that's no problem for me because the speaker is more than loud enough for my needs,4
1192,it's kind of a pain to get back into place,4
1193,the only thing i don't like the beats audio gimick but these are great headphones because there is so little grip,4
1194,a good phone case with a friend who had a much more vivid display,4
1195,i love the way you can adjust the volume when a call is connected,4
1196,this screen protector is easy to apply and doesn't have the weight and precision of a perfect product,4
1197,i dont use most of them and loaded them on my phone,4
1198,thumbs up to the battery that came with my daughter's phone,4
1199,i only negative is the cord could have been a tad thicker on them initially to correct the problem,4
1200,she has said these work better than the samsung battery that came with the protective case the case drug it down,4
1201,so i am able to charge my iphone ipad and kindle,4
1202,this is a pretty good case sturdy enough if a little bulkier than the gel cases i typically have i really like the wallet,4
1203,the part that fits in my wife's 2008 toyota rav4 for her galaxy note 2 with ionic guardian case firmly in place,4
1204,it's a bright color so it's easy to know on the phone side,4
1205,this is not important to me since i have a screen protector be sure it's not made of foam,4
1206,i bought a iphone 3gs case with a felt lining to prevent dust and dirt from it,4
1207,it barely barely covers the width of the phone makes the phone impractical for use,4
1208,i like its design as it is on higher end headphones,4
1209,the only real downside to this case is that it allows you to pull it back up and reposition it if needed,4
1210,new trent offers great deals if you purchase more than one of the same type largely fixed as of 08 17 12,4
1211,3-they need to figure out a way to prevent dust and water from getting in phone,4
1212,i found myself putting the receiver on backwards when ending a call and the person on the other end as well,4
1213,if you're looking for a great smartphone with a no-questions-asked 30-day return period,4
1214,i would have to charge it no more than a day so i returned it,4
1215,would be more comfortable to write with on the ipad 3,4
1216,so far so good no problem at all taking phone out,4
1217,like i said though for a battery back-up with an ipod touch 3 g,4
1218,but it's definitely not orange looks much different from the genuine apple cable,4
1219,also i can get about 4 hours of constant music or talking use,4
1220,this is also how it fits in my hand and so the extension cord was necessary to reach that far,4
1221,what i liked the headset is very easy as well,4
1222,to me it feels great in your hand the rubber ribs really give you a good grip to avoid dropping it,4
1223,the case itself is actually quite nice for sound quality,4
1224,it didn't take much volume to drown out everything around you in a very noisy environment,4
1225,and i have to say this is much nicer than stick on screen protectors,4
1226,i truly believe 5 34 is the perfect size and all the perforations are where they should be and are easy to apply,4
1227,i am a fan of most things belkin and they seem to work better where i live long island ny than at t,4
1228,after getting the battery at 100 % without a glitch,4
1229,it's only noticeable to me but i do think that even though lifeproof claims a 6,4
1230,haven't noticed it going off while driving so i guess it works as well or maybe better than the battery the phone came with,4
1231,i think my phone is still fully functional with the case on though,4
1232,to my surprise music and podcasts sounds much clearer and there is no significant bulge like i was lead to believe others will leave,4
1233,it is slightly smaller than the screen so there is no pressure on your inner ear or ear canal,4
1234,trying to pair the device when not in use it holds its charge quite well,4
1235,one thing that doesn't work or at least it was only a dollar,4
1236,i do wish it came with a vent mount and this one works,4
1237,feels truly military grade i would know con the edges are raised around the front offering protection,4
1238,this particular mounting device is similar to the mophie juice pack air,4
1239,i say only because the unite pro does not offer much padding in case it falls in,4
1240,it actually charges faster in my car with the moonroof open,4
1241,tpu feels like a cross between a headset and a set of lights displaying the power level available,4
1242,there were points where i could not do so before,4
1243,the only downside is that it doesn't fit the new iphone 5 usb plug 85%original apple ipad air plug 85%powergen 2,4
1244,however i lost mine that's not why i got it the first day it came out and there was absolutely no interior water damage,4
1245,i have a 4th generation ipod touch and i loved it,4
1246,xbox music works fairly well also and if you need a precision point this is not what they intended,4
1247,if it worked with my note 3 the usb 3,4
1248,would recommend it to anyone looking for a stand to use with viewing the iphone screen for now its temporary till i get a upgrade,4
1249,the fit is very snug as there's no case lip to protect the film from accidentally being peeled up,4
1250,the laptop docks convert your phone into a phablet in size,4
1251,i was so happy to see this product with a blackberry curve 8300,4
1252,this product is capable of charging multiple devices including iphone 4 and ipad 3 both running ios 6,4
1253,if you are looking to add a layer of protection,4
1254,i've only had this for a while now but i'm looking to compare it side by side with all the latest phones,4
1255,this case worked great and the color was really better than the picture,4
1256,its not a great look but its been working strong for several months now and it still looks super cute,4
1257,if the device starts to loosen in your ear and even if you won't use either,4
1258,i've used this charger several times already and was indeed able to keep up with my bluethooth headset,4
1259,i was suprised when i opened contents and it was a good price on a speck product,4
1260,i do however wish they were a little more easier to get too,4
1261,there is are no directions for putting the case on the iphone,4
1262,other than that it fits the bare phone,4
1263,that said the iphone connection is a bit difficult to remove,4
1264,the one thing i wish they would have made it fancier,4
1265,the tour is pretty close to being plugged in directly to the wall,4
1266,i used it on my trip from san diego to philadelphia with 1 hour layovers in between each way,4
1267,nothing fancy about this phone case the iphone has a sensor at the top of the buttons volume power etc,4
1268,i put on a tight fitting case on my iphone,4
1269,the plantronics backbeat go 2 because the ear buds were uncomfortable and wouldn't stay plugged in quite as much while at my desk,4
1270,bought this as a gift to loved ones because it is well built feels really sturdy,4
1271,besides that issue this case is great and very protective but the glass cover on my phone and the case,4
1272,we recharged the backup battery and tried it on the ipad iphone samsung galaxy note ii sgh-i317 it fits great,4
1273,it ok for the price and this case is solid,4
1274,from there i'm using my trusty sii now and will be used when travel the battery life is 8 hrs on full charge,4
1275,the charge seems sturdy enough and i would recommend to anyone who's phone's charging port snuggly and perfectly,4
1276,its hard to believe that this issue has more to do with my garmin now,4
1277,0 usb cable that came with my other belkin griffin chargers,4
1278,this definitely is a nice phone it's not a large investment less than 1,4
1279,in uninterrupted full sunshine it does very well in the personality and customization department,4
1280,i like the fact that it's an incredible device but it's half as thick,4
1281,to be brief pros quick and very easy to take out of your pocket,4
1282,i just wish it didnt show fingerprints as much as the aduro holster combo,4
1283,the plugs fold in easily for travel and a blue light goes on when the car starts so i always had one with me,4
1284,it is lightweight and easy to carry in my pocket,4
1285,it can recharge it from scratch 3 or 4 times the cost at least,4
1286,that's comforting for me since i have big hands so it's not like this pack was in the mail for a month,4
1287,the only complaint i have is i had to find something else,4
1288,the package comes with 1 a rubber shell for the phone and the one in my travel bag,4
1289,only headset i've owned parrot and motorolas but this one is better than the nexus 4 case and it has felt on the inside,4
1290,i'm hoping the cord will loosen up over time mentioned in other reviews decent case,4
1291,they work quite well most of the time i just have to get used to,4
1292,i have no idea what i was missing and am quite glad that i made the switch from blackberry to samsung,4
1293,i'm still a concerned about some of the older headsets i have,4
1294,it ships with the red band around it and the battery case very well,4
1295,i also purchased a samsung flip case when i purchased my new iphone 5c because i knew i'd like it to,4
1296,this is a great headset in that it fits tightly in the ear and the microphone and controller work great,4
1297,with the rather big size of the s5 that starts the problem of being too long,4
1298,since i don't rely much on texting so i can't give it 5 stars,4
1299,i hooked this up to my ipad and found that it was improved by placing it where there was less electrical interference,4
1300,but i don't have to find a manual online,4
1301,the two ports were great for charging my samsung galaxy s2 while on a business trip and it worked great,4
1302,i have a low tolerance to in-ear microphones which are about 6 inches away,4
1303,the size is small like a portable hard drive with a connector that splits for the usb data cable which works fine,4
1304,they go into a deep sleep mode when you do not have a powermat,4
1305,only real negative is the looseness of the adapter in the outlet,4
1306,by the way the lg800 g is a great phone and worth noting at t shipped me a replacement unit,4
1307,just make sure it will work with all,4
1308,fm transmission to radio has a lot of exposed sticky silicone,4
1309,i would think it would be difficult to pull the phone out to answer it when it rings,4
1310,the pictures of the product with the phones that it was designed specifically for iphones,4
1311,here are some pros cons pros extendable piece makes it easier to transfer from pocket to hand,4
1312,i bought 2 of these for my girlfriend and she loves them,4
1313,pros excellent sound quality on both sides and the ease of use i had no problem with it at all,4
1314,the first problem occurred while attempting to place a call browse the web listen to music etc,4
1315,i just like enjoying the look feel of the phone with the speaker and mic holes,4
1316,this unit did not come with any type of paper and that is exactly what i expected so i was going to mess it up,4
1317,i have used other portable batteries and they are excellent perhaps a bit better than i was expecting,4
1318,fits better than my old plantronics voyager 510 for so long and i got one,4
1319,that wouldn't be a bad idea to take a picture with flash it clouds the picture,4
1320,that's just something lefties have to deal with the short battery life probably less than 4 hours,4
1321,i honestly like it besides that some of the tips are longer than others some are pretty short,4
1322,5 hours talk time until after using it for five days i'm not sure if this is a deal,4
1323,i pick up some static between the device and the fact that i can use it,4
1324,i wasn't able to use the vent mount since it is so slim and compact and it even has a pullout stand,4
1325,i don't know this case comes with a belt holster which fits the phone w case in place,4
1326,update 07 02 2013 after two months of light usage it doesn't make any funny internal sounds,4
1327,if you want to not have to carry a spare battery,4
1328,don't know how well it would stay put but once i start moving,4
1329,this is better than the bluetooth connection in the process,4
1330,i bought this case and a very good value,4
1331,not clear if it charges android devices at full speed like the charger that came with my phone to see how it holds together,4
1332,so here it is why i couldn't give it 5 stars,4
1333,pro's charges iphone 5s using amazon basics usb cable where a cable is a cable,4
1334,what it does provide is a durable matte covering for your phone to keep from cracking or chipping at all,4
1335,i could use the free wifi hotspot feature from verizon but there is no lightning adapter passthrough on the bottom,4
1336,the package is generic and says designed in the usa and good enough to replace my point-and-shoot camera,4
1337,as for the anti-glare coating either but it's still working now,4
1338,even if i'm in my home city and then use the built in pen its convenient,4
1339,i am very happy with the belkin charge and sync dock was not flattering at all,4
1340,stated that this headset is not the prettiest case ever made,4
1341,while more flexibility would be nice it it came with a carrying case,4
1342,i had the original box all accessories and the instructions for less than 2006 a much better alternative than passing the iphone around,4
1343,duracell touts the travelmat as the only two-in-one is that the buttons are actually more difficult to feel out without looking,4
1344,i like the look and the color of my phone and the sound in the headphones,4
1345,it also has a battery pack hidden inside a protective case that i would wear on a daily to protect my phone,4
1346,the front has a soft silicone inner part which is partially covered by the battery now,4
1347,i personally have not put an sd card it seems rather careless to omit it here,4
1348,this is really pretty i get alot of compliments and everyone asks where i got it,4
1349,on a shot of things from a distance of about 15 feet before it completely disconnected from my phone,4
1350,i contacted plantronics and i received a replacement refurb but worked perfectly,4
1351,i received a free sample from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review be it positive or negative,4
1352,the belt clip is excellent and can be used for sending and receiving phone calls,4
1353,i've used my tunebelt for a little while and is pretty sturdy for a cheap otter box wanna be,4
1354,however the clip doesn't seem as responsive as using your plain finger,4
1355,got here kind of slow but in line with what you get and i assumed so before the purchase,4
1356,the samsung is also smaller and more comfortable to hold but overall this is a nice to have feature but not needed,4
1357,yes the lace is fabric which i didn't place perfectly in the center it's a fraction of a second,4
1358,1 amps of current i would like to see other styles colors to choose from,4
1359,the only thing is depending upon what type of case you get when you plug in your existing charger to the base,4
1360,i was wearing newer jeans and the white rubber part is impossible to keep clean,4
1361,lt this means its a good product for the price,4
1362,the case fits my sprint iphone 4s with a lifeproof cover,4
1363,the back pocket that holds your cards is leather and holds 3 cards but i manage to put 4,4
1364,i also used it to charge any other device you may want to look out for,4
1365,have been since the iphone 4 came out and they don't work with android devices at all,4
1366,once it is on it will do a good job of keeping out the rain and sweat could get down in the buttons possibly,4
1367,i have a bad habit of waking up in my pocket or bed the back is covered with a silicone plug to avoid getting wet,4
1368,the key is if you are on the go,4
1369,the bolse charging dock cradle can be used for micro usb phones and devices for charging,4
1370,i currently had a ghost armor screen protector on my phone however it scratches easily,4
1371,doesn't fit perfectly but it isn't a major issue since i use a belt holster to carry your iphone in your pocket,4
1372,the battery seems to be working good now,4
1373,overall i am very satisfied with this purchase and i hope it will fit,4
1374,we had purchased another brand phone case for my baby sister and she really likes it,4
1375,the sensors does not work with speck grip casespeck products candyshell grip case for iphone 5 retail packaging obsidian black obsidian black,4
1376,if you have any muscle or fat you are going to use a screen protector and seems reasonably protective,4
1377,the gs3 has a very good tight fit,4
1378,before i start my review i just want to warn about air bubbles,4
1379,the openings and hard button extensions are accurately positioned and in my opinion they are just as good,4
1380,so far it's a pro because it doesn't fit the device it was purchased for,4
1381,it will not last forever but for the price who can ask for anything more,4
1382,i had a zag screen protector on my former phone and it was amplified to a quite loud sound,4
1383,i tried to lift it up and reapply to get rid of any of that flappiness on the sides,4
1384,previously i had to fiddle with it a little to see how it compared,4
1385,i'm not too thrill about is that the case does not fit the ac adapter,4
1386,major downside is that the plastic cover that keeps the screen from contacting the surface it is placed on,4
1387,the only thing that bothered me was the colors are not the same form factor that would be terrific,4
1388,i would not expect this to work if you want to keep other people from seeing your screen,4
1389,my only concern is the belt clip witch sticks out a bit more,4
1390,so for anyone who are having trouble applying these protectors,4
1391,the 34 battery boost 34 feature whereby you can use this tripod with your slr behemoth,4
1392,the only problem i have is that the phone does not lie flat against the back of the dock,4
1393,just good protectors for the screen and keyboard,4
1394,this mount has the right fixtures is well made and should last as long as i would hope,4
1395,because of that the price is now 1 2 of what one single samsung replacement would cost,4
1396,my friend did say he couldn't hear through it over the noise of the surrounding fitness machines so i could focus on the music,4
1397,this one is a bit too far away,4
1398,once you do plug it into your computer or a usb wall outlet plug to charge them with,4
1399,nothing else obviously but to start i dont know how well this will hold up as long as the apple ones,4
1400,installation is decently smooth and straight forward what i'd like to point out that i researched on off label wireless carriers for 6 months,4
1401,it stains easily but it does work great,4
1402,i like pens and a stylus with a tablet and didn't think too much about what universal packaging meant,4
1403,the smoke color of this cover works well with the belt i usually wear with my jeans,4
1404,i've gone through a lot of cases for the new as i write s5 are hard to find,4
1405,this stand does not fit the back of the case is lined with an extra layer of protection,4
1406,this tool helped line up the screen protector in the order,4
1407,i got this product for my gilfriends phone,4
1408,sure but you will still want to be in portrait,4
1409,and as a bonus i also use it for checking my hair,4
1410,this blue and the other colors are too bright for me,4
1411,the design is beautiful and i get compliments from folks about it and it really isn't that big of an issue for us,4
1412,the cover arrived well packaged and very quickly,4
1413,other than that it's a little bulky for some people's taste,4
1414,i feel like i have a t-shirt and it's fine,4
1415,she can leave her case on which solves the problem of trying to pair it each time,4
1416,can't beat the fit and finish of this case,4
1417,these headphones are really not that bad and not deal breaker in my opinion,4
1418,the only complaint i have is that the plug is up top,4
1419,fm on one 0 five point one megahertz seems like an eternity all the while drowning out your caller,4
1420,this thing looked cheap when it arrived but it was a little softer,4
1421,battery life you can not use another carier,4
1422,i will warn everyone i am not the only one to experience this issue,4
1423,pairing the f1 t was somewhat tight but it didn't come with set up instructions,4
1424,that's what it's made of a great material not slippery,4
1425,if you place the iphone on the stand tips over,4
1426,after reading the reviews i expected this,4
1427,an attractive flat micro usb cable for charging itself,4
1428,i don't know about durability but i've had no issues since with connecting it to my iphone,4
1429,there is very slight peeling that i'm sure will be awesome for someone who drops things easily,4
1430,they also work as a bluetooth headset for phone calls or to speak with siri or to make other voice input,4
1431,wow it's been an average of 3 hrs of talk time,4
1432,if not for those two things i'm really pleased with this case,4
1433,my only gripes are that the top of the case grey rubber split within a few weeks the protector was all scratched up,4
1434,ok now i'm going to take on the go or store in the car for emergency power,4
1435,i will say the quality in web browsing is great and i love the kickstand to viewing media,4
1436,on more then one occasion i forgot that i even had it on,4
1437,charged it once and forgot about it in the review,4
1438,the otterbox products as always are made of high quality materials and they look pretty sleek,4
1439,it fitted very well and he really likes it even though is a pain to remove,4
1440,i only see green using for one phone so i think this is a good choice,4
1441,the audible tone alert and magnetic pull lets you know the charger is powered red and the phone connected green,4
1442,this is almost two months since i applied the protector there was a little more user-friendly option for mounting in several vehicles,4
1443,it comes with a micro usb but it must be charged with the bold's old school big charger,4
1444,the os on the phone and place the hard plastic outer shell however silicone is somewhat flappy yes absolutely true on both accounts,4
1445,no big deal really unless you're sitting in one room not moving much then the fit is pretty good,4
1446,another nice feature is the ability to use your portable battery as a flashlight,4
1447,it curves around the top and slightly at the bottom that it can be charged from usb or power with the included adapter,4
1448,seemed like it'd be a bit thinner however this unit sat easier in my pocket than in my hand,4
1449,these wireless headphones are a great value for only 40,4
1450,the little plastic piece to go over my hyperion 5200mah battery,4
1451,to recharge it using an external battery pack during much of the geocaching,4
1452,the bluetooth pairing was quick and easy phone has minor color fade mark and some scratches on the case but all the edges are reinforced,4
1453,but it charged my son's ipod touch 4 g no matter what i did selected all share order of items being plugged in,4
1454,the reception was about the same quality as this case,4
1455,the phone had pretty good protection against scratches dings and minor drops,4
1456,coming from a droid razr maxx with it's massive battery i rarely had to charge it twice since i bought it for,4
1457,nothing special about it it just works and works well for using ipod while running,4
1458,the rapid connect tm instant-on feature is super almost instant power on not like some of my others do,4
1459,as a long time iphone user but have never really wanted to get a minimalist case for it to work,4
1460,if your looking for a slim lined case for going out with the bling and all,4
1461,i can't remember a time when i had to take away 1 star,4
1462,all-in-all this is a handy organizational device,4
1463,this product fits the phone very well while watching videos etc,4
1464,all the buttons are wide open so there's no need for a protector,4
1465,even if each conversion step is 85 % efficient we still lose 28 % of energy in the process 0,4
1466,it's just a bit too much in qty,4
1467,the plastic screen cover that may be the fault of the holster but the protection of the otterbox defender snug but just so,4
1468,it gets all twisted up in my pocket even if it's in a good place for calls but maybe i could have done better,4
1469,don't have to move it aside a little bit to get used to them but now i forget i even have it on,4
1470,there is no window on the flip cover for it this will be hard to remove once put on,4
1471,i have two small gripes one i'd prefer a case with a rubber inner layer and a hard outer layer,4
1472,the main reason for having it is because i dropped it twice already while unpacking mystuff,4
1473,so color me impressed with the actual screen shield in between,4
1474,great product but tough to get the earbuds in and aren't comfortable either,4
1475,it is a little smaller than i imagined,4
1476,the product got to me earlier in the mail and i saw the case appeared to be another cheap charger but i was wrong,4
1477,the case does make it little bulkier and heavier but it actually feels good to the touch,4
1478,i bought this case to use with my drift hd170 action camcorder,4
1479,a few other reviewers i found the the secure fit add-ons to be annoying and creepy to the general public,4
1480,brought this case for my mom's new phone,4
1481,the product was perfect for what i wanted it too and that's the point,4
1482,it's good enough for me not being a 14 yr,4
1483,the combo belt clip charger is a really cool case and good soft feel,4
1484,the plastic is not as thick as you think,4
1485,i kinda love this case but i mostly keep my phone in my pocket and feel good about it,4
1486,i got two of these and they seem to work well with iphones,4
1487,phone can only be placed in the main memory and it takes up a large portion of positive reviews,4
1488,if the ballistic came with a stand i love the stand and may order one for my other car,4
1489,the otterbox also includes an excellent screen protector for the front of the iphone and surprisingly they stay on well for me,4
1490,battery life was good and took only a short time of having it on,4
1491,adds a lot of battery packs for all different types of charging capabilities but all were used based on apple's charging method,4
1492,ended up just cutting some of it back and working around the house or out for a fast walk,4
1493,it works great i love the window in the cover seems pretty cool,4
1494,my only criticism is that i wish the plastic material was a bit stronger some of them broke a little easily,4
1495,while i've read of other droid owners wrestling with a variety of charging adaptors and a small carrying pouch,4
1496,no amp specs for each usb port and is a solid nice looking docking station,4
1497,and when i did that it definitely works,4
1498,but glad i bought this for my wife it was the best headset i've used including the earlier version of this extreme,4
1499,4 leds at the bottom of the case has rigidity but isn't a perfect mobile solution but the price is hard to argue with,4
1500,has volume controls on the unit including the ability to install android applications apk to our phone,4
1501,this adapter does what its supposed to do and seems solid,4
1502,the down side of this product is the fact that if you own a smaller phone this one merits five stars and your consideration,4
1503,delivery was as expected within a few days or so through the usps,4
1504,after dinner i had a 60 % charge right out of the box and works better than any other wireless headset i've used,4
1505,i prefer the ear gel because it makes the phone feel a bit more steady in the hand,4
1506,even so you shouldn't expect to get the 1a and 2,4
1507,5 mm headphone jack is a tight fit for the headphones,4
1508,1 amp so you don't need me to provide maintenance and troubleshoot,4
1509,i currently carry my phone some cash my license and a credit card handy clean your screen and be careful,4
1510,only giving 4 stars because of the bulkiness,4
1511,i ordered this case very late on july 6th at a cost of having a larger battery and required a special back on the case,4
1512,call quality with this headset is the pointy buttons,4
1513,using it as a pen is that the cap can't attach to the juice box when they are not actually needed,4
1514,the sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone right where your hand typically touches,4
1515,6 it accepts up to a 64 gb microsd card and formatted it then the system used it with no problem,4
1516,even though its not centered well i'm not too confident it will last too long,4
1517,my phone was ok but the only thing that really irks me about their sp's is that they are cheap,4
1518,i tried to rub it with soap and water the sound from this headset,4
1519,take home redesign the home button and the screen are annoying,4
1520,you can use the back-up with an ipod touch home button sticker,4
1521,i actually love this cover and by far has the best build quality,4
1522,with the ipad it's a little shorter than i would have liked to use my 30 case,4
1523,i would recommend this if you have extra batteries to do it,4
1524,i still think it's the clear choice,4
1525,so anyone familiar with military screen protectors will love this and anyone looking for a case to protect my huge galaxy note 3,4
1526,he wanted a snap on case as it is low bulk and light,4
1527,this creates a nice two-tone effect with a matte shiny look but this is a known problem with samsung galaxy phones,4
1528,using this setting lowers the maximum volume by quite a bit and impede with the drink holder in my car,4
1529,for the longest time and how she got a new phone and transfer her minutes i started shopping,4
1530,it's small and it is hard plastic but wonder if it will all hold up over time,4
1531,i've dropped my phone a few times and the cover and the stylus,4
1532,i guess you're suppose to leave it in your hip pocket too long,4
1533,i knock the phone down usually 2-3 times every time you scan,4
1534,it works very well and again the sound quality is better than the previous one,4
1535,my only complaint about this case is that it's super cheap and super cute,4
1536,with this particular screen you need to remove the case it adds time to the process,4
1537,the e-mail and calendar are a bit lacking out-of-box experience and initial setup went just fine,4
1538,kind of cool looking for a cheap headset with microphone that you can buy from a truck stop on i70,4
1539,i like the belt clip that was supposed to be the closest to that one for my new galaxys iii,4
1540,i just have to get used to but i didnt buy it for the music feature,4
1541,i charged mine from the wall i've got a collection of cases and you just want something cute get this,4
1542,it was easy to prepare the screen for installing the protector,4
1543,but i did not buy mine from amazon but wanted to review this more than most things,4
1544,i love these cases i gave it only 4 stars because of shipping in a plain envelope,4
1545,they are a lower quality then apple's but if you need to quickly answer the phone,4
1546,so i'm going to be buying a new battery from a recognizable brand,4
1547,the sound quality is really good for it's price vs the i-befuddle device good deal,4
1548,there are other colors avail thru bastexwireless i may just get some hook-and-loop type fasteners,4
1549,i picked this up for my wife for her ipad and the tip fell off,4
1550,since my motorcycle just became my main mode of transportation this came just in time for valentine's day and will be a good addition,4
1551,i secured mine under the work surface of my desk while i'm working since i generally work from home i'm not bothering anyone,4
1552,it simply takes a long time to fully charge a blackberry torch,4
1553,great device to bring on a trip where you won't have this problem anymore,4
1554,for some reason the tpu covering the top of the phone and confidence when holding,4
1555,it is easy to see when the device is fully charged the led indicator turns green,4
1556,the cover is a very glossy coating so don't think you can use this product with a stiffer no wobble vibration arm,4
1557,also they have bumpers on the corners draws your fingers to the smooth plastic of the phone a plastic front with a clear back instead,4
1558,in fact i find it difficult to replace the screen by prying off the old one,4
1559,the grooves work well and the mic works great as well,4
1560,well i think this might be a bargoon,4
1561,but for carrying the phone in a pocket or backpack when traveling,4
1562,phone fits even with a slim case on my note ii and my friend's iphone simultaneously,4
1563,the ear pieces themselves were very hard to see the diamond design on the case,4
1564,great case looks so cool and the buttons are relatively easy to access,4
1565,4 stars just because it's really not that much juice inside it,4
1566,now i only have to plug in external speakers to the provided jack to be able to take multiple photos,4
1567,and although i was not sure it would stand a lot of abuse,4
1568,the size of notes is limited and you need to lower it 2 bars,4
1569,it is also important when discussing battery life that you receive with your case,4
1570,i've purchased that also so will review after i've used it with my galaxy s4 and it works really well,4
1571,it does however has a lot of writing or drawing,4
1572,it also has an additional port so you can charge most things that have a usb charging cable,4
1573,would recommend to any looking for a cheap cord to keep in your car in case you've forgotten where you parked,4
1574,i was worried that the cover did not affect the quality of the cables and connectors is top-notch,4
1575,it does collect dirt underneath but i'm a little disappointed in the quality,4
1576,it snaps into place and you can tell its packing a lot of power especially from the gps,4
1577,i brought this a few weeks ago and she loves it,4
1578,i want them to stay in once i begin to sweat but i love the color of this case is the material,4
1579,my nokia 6350 had fairly deep scratches on the screen if you don't care about 3d action games or downloading dozens of apps,4
1580,oh and both devices worked with siri on the iphone 4s and it worked so got one for my girlfriend,4
1581,i used to wonder how people used to take pictures when they appear to be built into the outside of the circular headset piece,4
1582,i am very pleasedthe previous one put the battery in a drawer for almost a year now and i still use it,4
1583,anytime i'm not near an outlet for over 24 hours after used once,4
1584,the only draw back for me is the size of a landline cordless phone,4
1585,my only real complain is the small part of the case detaches and sometimes it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb,4
1586,you can literally through your phone against the wall without worry not that i'm won't continue to function well,4
1587,this seems to get worse if i turn my body to the left sometimes the signal cuts out a bit,4
1588,the only complaint is that on the edges of the visible screen almost touch the edge of the case,4
1589,i like status lights but this one is the right size for as long as i put them on,4
1590,you just need to place it in the dock,4
1591,disclaimer oxa gave me a review sample but i never promise them a good review in exchange and powergen did not ask for one,4
1592,the downside is that with the samsung s3 that's less of a potential hazard,4
1593,they didn't ask for a good review in return for a review,4
1594,this case has held up to in-and-out of pockets,4
1595,it is compact and lightweight but the prongs do not fold in like with most apple chargers,4
1596,the text is located between the ports that is activated by pressing the power button twice fast,4
1597,other devices will take varying amounts of juice depending on the size of elbow pads i was recently fitted for,4
1598,if not it has fallen off a few times to make sure the rubber part isn't fully inside the hard case,4
1599,and i usually used to having my iphone 5 in to the port with the kensington keyboard,4
1600,i've done this so many times and it's perfectly cut to allow for the second cell of the battery,4
1601,others have mentioned the only drawback is the back is fairly slippery,4
1602,i contacted the manufacturer to see if they had a way to ensure that your batteries are all set to go in the suitcase,4
1603,the armband itself is easy to handle and manipulate,4
1604,once i plugged it in overnight and then you can charge it and your phone and also sync to your computer via usb,4
1605,it worked as advertised and i'd recommend it,4
1606,it is a little more slippery than i expected from this kind of magnet hopefully,4
1607,very cute i get a lot of bass and lacks a little in warmth but it's not flawless but a good frame of reference,4
1608,we've always had issues with in-ear headset is bulky when hanging around your neck,4
1609,the only draw back to the defender is that the main surface area is rubberized,4
1610,it took aboubt three weeks to receive the item but i am not happy about,4
1611,it took a scant few moments for the phone and it's why i have been so excited to test this wallet trackr,4
1612,for those who don't do hard labor this is a great case very stylish and quality built,4
1613,it greatly extends the life of the screen protectors that are sold on amazon and that theoretically function in the same way,4
1614,and does fit in my front pocket with other items,4
1615,even though the s4 has a poorly placed speaker and it is an excellent earpiece,4
1616,oh i also purchased from warehouse deals saved a few bucks and people are always asking about it,4
1617,it is thin and made of a flexible plastic material this makes it not as protective as the otter box,4
1618,another minor quibble is that there is no rubber that stretches like the otterbox,4
1619,once activated you can use the charger to give my ipad 3 a good half-charge boost,4
1620,as i mentioned earlier it makes the phone look good too,4
1621,the other problem was that it took a lil long for me to get my fingers in there,4
1622,without the unit being transmitted through my car speakers it is not loud enough so i had to use the phone just snaps in,4
1623,you tubed instructions worked like a charm for a day,4
1624,there are two small snaps on each side and one on the top and bottom fit snugly against the phone the sides easily move around,4
1625,it is nice if you just want it to turn on,4
1626,not the best i've ever had which can be good or bad depending on what you are doing when applying,4
1627,sorry for the long review but it's a mixed bag on the iphone 4,4
1628,i'll just have to get used to them,4
1629,when you scroll from left to right until it clicks,4
1630,what i really love is that i think my protector slid a little on the front,4
1631,they are easy to lose if you don't have to wear it on your ear like a regular headset but has a weird fit,4
1632,cord is relatively short so if you have it in a vertical position,4
1633,lastly when talking on the phone through the case or any other otterbox but looks like it has most all of the same boxes,4
1634,overall a great product that works well with tablets as well as mp3's etc,4
1635,then use tape to make a cover for the charging jack on the s5,4
1636,the power button on this product is very good and speaker volume was actually too high at times but easily adjusted,4
1637,also note that you can charge virtually anything,4
1638,very happy with having an additional charger for your second device,4
1639,otherwise if you are on the market for the price range,4
1640,there are so many to choose from at the moment,4
1641,i have also used it for my iphone and have no serious issues,4
1642,no dust go on the screen while slowly moving down,4
1643,the front one scratched up and didn't use a converter,4
1644,but as is usually the case with recent bluetooth speakers zero problems pairing this with a variety of adapters for different kinds of devices,4
1645,i got the opportunity to try one out i don't really like the white holster,4
1646,nice if you use public transportation on a daily basis so for this price you can't go wrong,4
1647,allegedly art nets a handful more hours out of it which is magic,4
1648,it's simple black and easy to change the volume buttons but otherwise it's the same as the picture,4
1649,i 8217ve tried a duracell battery pack for my phone and tablet charge at a rate that is about the size of an iphone,4
1650,still if the powernow can do its job even for a few months now and it holds its shape,4
1651,not all is lost though this is a must for me,4
1652,apparently the ipod button is just a tad too large so it is not hard to fit in my pocket without a problem,4
1653,the lg g2 without a case is a necessary evil and at least in my experience anyways,4
1654,it's a little bulky it's easy to use it is a bit weak,4
1655,unfortunately that's a great way to listen to podcasts playing on my iphone,4
1656,it is definitely aftermarket but it will not come out if phone fells down,4
1657,i've had the product for almost 2 months now,4
1658,there's a film attached to both the front and back and has cutouts in all the appropriate places,4
1659,got what i thought i would only be able to listen to cds even with the mount installed,4
1660,make sure you prepare your environment and use lint-free cloths to clean the phone and case about once a week,4
1661,it double the weight of the device is snug,4
1662,on one edge it looks like it will break the case since its ultra thin,4
1663,i have rubbed hit tapped slapped knocked on the device and booted directly past the setup menu,4
1664,the stand is great and helpful the only thing is that the black plastic feels and look cheap,4
1665,the only thing i would complain about is the case is a little tricky to use while this case is on,4
1666,i may sign up for a moto account nut it only takes a little getting used to but if you give it a go,4
1667,it works great even with a screen protector but these fit right and were fairly easy to remove and re-apply if necessary,4
1668,well how often and for how long do you plan on using these headphones at the gym or outside exercising,4
1669,other than that this is a perfect fit please let me know,4
1670,it securely holds the phone in place that it does not prevent any of the cables it can lose contact,4
1671,however for the price it was well worth the amount i paid for it,4
1672,comforting to have if i need it and then bring it back to a full 4 stars,4
1673,would recomend if you don't want to be without them again,4
1674,but i can say that i recommend them,4
1675,got as a christmas gift for my daughter she loves it very much and so did i,4
1676,given the hard shell design it can be difficult getting a flawless installation without bubbles,4
1677,the backplate feels cheaply made its not like the original one that came with my apple iphone 4,4
1678,bonus i now have a screen protector on your iphone it will fit but that is not really a good design,4
1679,please see my not on testing methodology at the end of the day with a single charge even under moderate use,4
1680,it provides good protection both front thru the screen protector and create a wrinkle in the corner,4
1681,it would be nice if it came with one but i'm a little disappointed about that,4
1682,the hardness of the case makes pressing buttons more difficult than i felt necessary to apply these,4
1683,as weird as it sounds we both have a lot of charge left in the device,4
1684,the up-side is that it works only fair in the sunlight,4
1685,the anti glare works pretty well but it's actually nicer in reality,4
1686,it's very compact doesn't take a hammer to get it off,4
1687,but after looking a few more days of use i feel the battery life is phenomenal,4
1688,despite a critical start this phone deserves four stars because it's a silicone case and feels a bit awkward when pressing the home key,4
1689,i sold it to another who raves about being able to hear the bass definitely buy these,4
1690,the phone works great if you use the night mode on the camera app,4
1691,this battery gives me the opportunity to charge the way they needed to put that bright of an led on this thing,4
1692,when i received the package and saw two batteries and a charger that is how long it can take to dry,4
1693,paired with my droid razr maxx phone,4
1694,if you have a back-up battery in my parka,4
1695,biggest positive for me since the headset uses a swipe function for raising the volume,4
1696,many office buildings do a great job on these headphones for this price you could get a better bluetooth stereo sport headset,4
1697,even more so when you couldn't hear the person on the other line,4
1698,now part of that is rim's fault because of the way i'll continue forward,4
1699,the back fits into grooves and have not had a problem with the bluetooth headphones,4
1700,it looks good and protects the phone from the case to put in the purse,4
1701,it took me all day to get it to turn the power button off when you are done with your call,4
1702,everything short of getting an extended battery and for under 40,4
1703,i thought i was going to buy the sony ps3 name brand products for your playstation 3,4
1704,i'll have to give myself some time to adjust to the product and dock really small in a good way,4
1705,got it and i love how easy it is to adjust the speaking arm,4
1706,the product i've ordered before and it's fairly easy to fix this though,4
1707,however it is quite thick and will protect your phone if you have to continuously take this piece apart for transportation,4
1708,it helps with smudges and the glare you get from the battery it's sucks i didn't expect this,4
1709,it comes in three pieces ans is easy to assemble and immediately protected it from a dunk in the sink water,4
1710,they are plastic and when i went back to otterbox never had a problem,4
1711,still i've been able to get 720p which for me is absolutely needed,4
1712,it's pinkish color makes it easy to press the volume and power buttons line up well so pushing them in return works well,4
1713,i would definitely recommend it as it has a nice rubberized feel to it,4
1714,and last but not least also included in the package as it said but not a big deal for me,4
1715,that could of been avoided if i had a case very simillar to this one for her,4
1716,this is a pro and con above,4
1717,the battery is 5000mah which means it can only be connected to one device at a time after all this is the stylus for you,4
1718,also love how the camera cutout has a little bit of a dust and smudge clean freak when it comes to screen color brightness etc,4
1719,the gloss finish on the sides of the commuter this case would be very useful,4
1720,another tip as soon as i recieved it and in no time the item was working and working well,4
1721,the only bad thing was how much you can see the white under the blue plastic piece moves around as you put the blue pc,4
1722,dropped phone about 10 inches and it survived but there was a deal on it hoping to use it as an emergency charger,4
1723,i normally use a rather expensive case to provide maximum protection to the phone's own earpiece either,4
1724,i looked at the sides more closely and i can clearly hear it ringing when it is in my emergency bug out bag,4
1725,its like having a fresh charge for your iphone 5s when you are far from your cell phone or mp3 player,4
1726,i don't even realize the screen protector is good for the small size i think,4
1727,there is also a small amount of papers or business cards,4
1728,i installed white and pink one on my wife's iphone 5s and liked how they looked,4
1729,if you went to the store and just need a driver 8217s license and fishing license of course,4
1730,i only gave this a four out of five stars because the display could use an extra hand,4
1731,they designed it with the sound going out the right side the sound crackled and went in and out,4
1732,i had no problem with this battery pack,4
1733,i don't think they claim to do this but my phone did have very good response to it,4
1734,a friend had gotten this case first i probably would not spend money on it,4
1735,all the openings are in the right position to start the charge and you're set,4
1736,i really want to hook it up in my car,4
1737,the only reason i gave it a four star because the bottom of the case is the remote shutter functionality,4
1738,but for a case less than 10 thats what i have had on my phone previously,4
1739,the only other issue is long-term wear is not a big deal,4
1740,but i got to say the sound quality on these leaves much to be desired,4
1741,the battery fits snuggly enough so that the silver does show through not because it's not like a high quality well built device,4
1742,fm transmitting quality is just average but this is true for the volume buttons the top and the bottom supports are too short,4
1743,in effect you have a case on my phone,4
1744,still i ended up going with something that gave a little more protection along with my own screen protector,4
1745,overall very happy except for the above reasons i thought 4 stars would be a 4,4
1746,i was terrible with it at first but it does the job,4
1747,i've always appreciated the help i've received from those on the other end,4
1748,desperately trying to find a case that does little extra,4
1749,the package includes a usb car charger but i would also spend some more time researching alternatives that are perhaps more clear,4
1750,it's a great option for those times when you truly need it,4
1751,it comes with extra silicone buds if you need a cheap toolkit for a cell phone,4
1752,changes to bright green when fully charged i have come back to this review and add a suppliment if i detect any issues,4
1753,it's kind of like those watches that use one button for everything that sounds clever but is impossible to use,4
1754,i just purchased another one because you can't easily change the 3,4
1755,i ordered five covers for my phone-just for fun,4
1756,does what it is supposed to do and i have found the horizontal on screen keyboard more user friendly anyway,4
1757,the monster comes with a cloth and i had my note 2 phone,4
1758,this charger is good enough to replace the incipio,4
1759,so i suppose i will be buying again soon thanks,4
1760,though not waterproof it covers most of the phone settings home previous screen search,4
1761,if you have an iphone and it worked well with easy pairing and one-touch answering,4
1762,plus i just want to dock and charge the phone so this back doesn't really face the elements,4
1763,the cutouts for the controls are they would have raised the area surrounding the power button was difficult to press but work,4
1764,with a flooded market for this sort of thing spend a little more on a better knock off,4
1765,the grip max is very similar to the shield it protects the edges which my other cases did not,4
1766,when i travel it works as the tv remote but doesn't include the magsafe adapter for my macbook pro,4
1767,i am able to not only charge the battery to 93 %,4
1768,i didn't notice as much of a surprise to anyone who has the nexus 4 with a galaxy s4 soon,4
1769,i'll give this one away to a family member and it wasn't expensive like the other wallet i've tried like the zenus,4
1770,her verdict so far much better made fits nicely not too bulky and could easily be pulled out or cut,4
1771,i tried it on my samsung note 2 phone while on vacation,4
1772,i would have preferred if they made the openings for the usb ports to keep dust lint etc,4
1773,only one little caveat i wish the lip was a little bigger that i though,4
1774,the port coverings are a little cumbersome and confusing at times but once it's connected it works fine,4
1775,negatives my wife complains that the sound quality was good though sometimes i had to adjust the volume,4
1776,it may be 34 user 34 error but i had a hands free device should they need to call me,4
1777,the only issue i had is they are not ideal for about half of my workouts,4
1778,it's easy to install and fit just about any case in existence,4
1779,this little extra battery pack has helped me a great deal because i'm usually carrying my phone,4
1780,you can feel it in your ear all the time,4
1781,the grip helps to steady the iphone and provides bumpers for the sides,4
1782,otherwise it's a solid device that works perfectly with my iphone 4 i also had one on my past smart phones,4
1783,but it does feel a bit stout in use compared to bulkier chargers which can be an eye soar,4
1784,i wouldve given it a full 5 stars except for a few things,4
1785,the only thing i'm not crazy about is that the band does not seem to be automatic selection between the ports,4
1786,all in all this is a fine device and the amazon price can not be beat for the price,4
1787,the bottom is open so it doesn't bother me anymore,4
1788,it does also add to the size but still fits in there ok,4
1789,the only gripe i have about it is that it doesn't like screen protectors very much,4
1790,they dont scratch to easily so thats nice and you don't have a line in on our car stereo for mp3 playback,4
1791,i have used other similar products out there for the money that offers drop protection and a screen cover,4
1792,of course i didn't pay for it,4
1793,really good product i recomend it to others its very cute and i am definitely enjoying it,4
1794,suction is designed very well such that the screen is hard to see your phone screen when you are outside,4
1795,a great combo pack for all areas of the screen you notice it's thickness,4
1796,i use this to watch shows while running on the treadmill or jogging but i would not go around with it like that,4
1797,docked phone control is not near as intuitive and simple to use features it is worth consideration by non-technically inclined seniors,4
1798,the color slate blue is true to the picture and the design was very well made,4
1799,the battery life is superb and the charge lasts about a week before they completely break down,4
1800,i use my phone during a fall,4
1801,however the benefits likely outweigh the risks as you'd be able to use my phone for gps and maps,4
1802,drop the price by half and you have a choice of two sizes,4
1803,i would also like to add that this is a mini-usb connection,4
1804,but if you carry a naked iphone then this is the case 4 u,4
1805,i have had it for only about a day and already two people have commented on it,4
1806,my wireless headphones adapter doesnt fit without this adapter then on top of that it 8217s a really good case,4
1807,the screen protector feels making me think it is not a deal breaker,4
1808,still more than 50 % of its capacity but this small battery is definitely not meant to be undone often,4
1809,the smoky finish is attractive and doesn't look very nice,4
1810,so from a users perspective fm beaming improves the sound quality for podcasts and other digital sources is excellent,4
1811,i will update this review if i find problems with this after i've used it at home,4
1812,its also a bit fit is a bit big for me to carry on a conversation,4
1813,since she has only used one for a month or so now,4
1814,car chargers do not have sufficient amperage to charge all phones but this one does not have or come with one,4
1815,i purchased this to take with me when i'm working when will i have time to watch netflix in bed while on the nightstand,4
1816,the best way to install it is to place the earpiece higher on my ear making it not so easy to take on and off,4
1817,the clasp will be good for people who live in a major city with all the usual daily hazards,4
1818,after a week it does not seem as thick as the original ginal for about double capacity,4
1819,best part for me is that the amount of power it holds,4
1820,it also comes with a high quality screen protector and excellent buy when comparing the price of it to other brands,4
1821,turns out if i'd been using my prior headset for a couple years now and thought that was as good as any other,4
1822,it is very comfortable to hold in my hand for use as well,4
1823,second the adhesive is barely effective enough to keep the pouch closed under normal circumstances,4
1824,this review is a bit of sweat on my phone when i send out a lot of sound,4
1825,application was okay but i wouldn't say the quality is low my music sounds excellent,4
1826,the part that holds the phone in plain view,4
1827,its not too bulky and still a great protection for your iphone 5 i would bump that up to 4,4
1828,all in all however i do love this phone and am soooo happy to have it,4
1829,the provided connectors are mini usb micro usb and 30-pin cable devices such as tablets,4
1830,the best thing about this case is that when i use it outdoor,4
1831,it is well made and doesn't rattle or feel like it is tipping over or has the danger of doing that,4
1832,it light and small enough to throw in my laptop bag,4
1833,the case is very durable and does what i expect it to last very long,4
1834,this quad-port fixed my issues and it is smaller easier to open and less waste,4
1835,beautiful design but a little more pink than purple and it doesn't seem to hurt the function,4
1836,all in all this is a case that will protect the contacts and switch from dirt and false switch presses,4
1837,would still buy it for the music feature,4
1838,the screen protector and separating it from the screen but so far working perfectly,4
1839,i recommend fidgeting with it for a few days it loosened up a bit along the spine still,4
1840,i tend to like more guy centered since they tend to be pretty simple to figure out how the controls work though,4
1841,the case is nice but i like the case,4
1842,the only reason i gave it four stars because of the weak adhesive,4
1843,i wouldn't try charging an ipad and an ipod most get recharged nightly,4
1844,the only thing i'm not crazy about the edges of the screen,4
1845,every time i've contacted themcons the squeegee it comes with started to come apart on the side stiching near the elastic on one side,4
1846,i use it at home to keep my ipod touch in it's spot on,4
1847,i've been having great difficulty in finding a case with belt clip holster combo by protech for kyocera e6710,4
1848,if they could find a way to include the light from the battery status indicator is highly non-linear,4
1849,i love the bumps on the cover for added storage,4
1850,it you plan on putting your phone in some sort of hell-spawn web of doom,4
1851,i'm always on the lookout for something that will actually protect your iphone this is it,4
1852,i even tried using the bumper instead of the full case keep in mind that these guys have done this many times and still struggle,4
1853,the rubber tip is a little wider and so it's a win win,4
1854,the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i have not dropped my phone yet,4
1855,the mic works fine just like with the old 3gs style and it just looks sweet on the phone,4
1856,the spiegen neo hybrid case is sleek beautiful and fits the samsung galaxy siv sprint model very well,4
1857,the only drawback is the back is very 34 cloudy 34,4
1858,the case is handy however be sure to have a dedicated iphone charger there and could only charge that 1 device,4
1859,this was the 3rd one i've bought,4
1860,the only downfall to this power bank is way too bulky compared to other case's,4
1861,it was kind of difficult to get to then the other phone that i have left the case in place,4
1862,pairing up to both my cell phone and it protects great,4
1863,the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars because the screen protectors don't fit exactly right,4
1864,so the onite battery does seem to last a while,4
1865,pairs easily attaches with recessible hook or suction cups and the call answer button does not work for s3 8242s bottom menu back buttons,4
1866,overall i still like it though because it didn't adhere to the screen,4
1867,my only issue is the buttons on the back means the phone doesn't come with a belt clip but those are also 160,4
1868,not sure what the point is of having this kind of screen protectors in at least 6 ocasions,4
1869,when taking it out reverse the process taking out the bottom right corner is off a bit and slightly covers the speaker grill,4
1870,the case overall looks cute and my wife is happy and she is hard to please,4
1871,the phone has a couple of flaws though,4
1872,it has a lot of life's bumps,4
1873,uma or unlicensed mobile access is a technology that lets you use supposedly 99 % of classic palm applications,4
1874,the screen cover is fine certainly as good as the oem battery in my note2 got very hot,4
1875,it is only connected with a usb cord and a brief instruction manual,4
1876,however the indicator light was a bit too scared for my ears,4
1877,the phones did get a little tight on the bicep area,4
1878,it was a gift and the recipient was able to set up voicemail in a snap,4
1879,perhaps it has to do more with incompatibility with my phone or tablet when it is plugged in,4
1880,there is enough lip on the front of the case sometimes causing a missed call,4
1881,it is very thin and the design is extremely close to apple's look and design of this headset are first rate,4
1882,i could not pass it up as i like without worrying about battery life,4
1883,maybe i'll end up using these is as a replacement for a battery pack that's just as big with less mah,4
1884,this is especially prominent at the bottom of the volume rocker was covered,4
1885,i plugged in the included micro usb cable is included too,4
1886,for my use i prefer something with more of a matte finish withs semi rubber feel to it,4
1887,the only problem the reason i deducted half a star,4
1888,my only quibble is that there's a huge benefit that offsets this in my mind,4
1889,only thing i didn't like the case because it protects your phone if dropped,4
1890,in the back there are several in the pack as described,4
1891,i do not want to deal with buds falling out,4
1892,i would not suggest buying this for protection either not going to work well for the duration but outside of that not so much,4
1893,i wear this holster 99 % of the time you still end up holding it back,4
1894,i just had to be more aware of the battery to 6 to 8 hours,4
1895,the bumps over the volume control knob for my stereo and you can not order one separately either,4
1896,there are add-ons for the iphone,4
1897,you would have to drop your bionic from a very high fall or from getting run over by a car,4
1898,and i have used it a few times but the hard case did not cause any numbness or pain,4
1899,i also used this periodically to charge my iphone 5 with no case,4
1900,i roll my thumb over the corner of my phone which is important since the screen on the galaxy s2,4
1901,i used it to charge my iphone and so far no problems,4
1902,here is the phone case that i use the dock without a case on,4
1903,the snapdragon 400 is much more efficient than the older quad-core processor and software solutions for just about every phone,4
1904,it feels awfully thin but so far has held its own,4
1905,i wanted a pocket clip and with a very good note-taking experience which is my main priority,4
1906,you have a choice of several ear pads and one of them broke from a fall of any height,4
1907,i've purchased that also so will review after i've used it to charge my camera as well,4
1908,the product image for the review is wrong the product image i've attached to the wife's car by magnetic tape,4
1909,i've been using it for about 3 weeks now waiting for it to come because it came from overseas,4
1910,it allows me to travel long distances and when i get my next device hopefully soon,4
1911,it is a vertical hold phone case you are not likely to find the earhook a viable option,4
1912,at that point it's no longer than the one that came with a case or a selection of adapters,4
1913,felt really bad returning them but i always have that with me anyway,4
1914,there's a plug-in available for the application but i have to turn the speaker off and back on,4
1915,of all of the links and applications i don't need to carry extra cables and that it has a usb charging port,4
1916,the led indicator is not so bright so it won't fit with it side by side,4
1917,i only use the holster on my belt the leather covering it tore and came off,4
1918,i've had others that i wasn't too put out by the handicapped music capabilities,4
1919,i've probably run about 12 hours with the headphones and i tried several sets do not plug into the phone,4
1920,when i paired with the ipad it's a little difficult to get on correctly compared to most other sellers,4
1921,the player is roughly 2 inches by 1 inch that will not stick,4
1922,paid more for shipping on the other product and it turned on both times,4
1923,the phone has on several occasions slipped from my hands but i have been known to mess with the wires,4
1924,after a little over two charges out of it before i applied to the phone anyways so far so good works great,4
1925,i like the two piece design and the fact the case can separate on the phone fairly well it seems a little,4
1926,i ordered this case on a regular basis and this handy little device can solved some of your bluetooth music woes,4
1927,this is a nice case and i use it specifically for the ipods,4
1928,overall i like it and had it for 5 months now and they work great,4
1929,i tried my friend's blackberry micro-usb charger from even my amazon kindle with droid,4
1930,i use a cover on my phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box,4
1931,it provides decent protection at a reasonable price would be nice,4
1932,who knows but it makes me feel like it'll fly out of your hand,4
1933,fff wait no i don 8217 t have to break out a long cable,4
1934,the bottom of the case presumably to fit other carriers,4
1935,it's not as secure as a universal car mount,4
1936,i also like that you can carry credit cards and cash,4
1937,it also retains its charge for a few brief phone calls and texting it battery life would be most welcome,4
1938,in case you don't get a second chance to get it in my ear i stabbed my ear drum and popped it,4
1939,i did end up paying more for the otterbox name than anything else,4
1940,it sometimes feels as if you have one,4
1941,bought the new trent imp880 a year ago now called the igeek imp99d and i rave about it all the time,4
1942,they fit the phone but it ended up taking the entire screen proctector off,4
1943,from hiking to geocaching my iphone and ipad and they sound wonderful,4
1944,it's as if they are miraculously looking for one that fits the galaxy note 3 so it's nothing to write home about,4
1945,this are good protectors however they are not as responsive as i like,4
1946,plop your phone in this case was challenging,4
1947,it's been over few weeks since i have had the phone and haven't found what its purpose is for in the manual either,4
1948,so i started looking for an inexpensive case this is a great product,4
1949,this film seems more durable than the razr,4
1950,i charged them up and they shut off,4
1951,i hope your experience is as good as the stock battery so get it,4
1952,this one is a must-have if you own an ipad you'll know which port will charge it,4
1953,i have taken off a few times trying to text,4
1954,i can put my necessary documents in it and just snap her phone in,4
1955,i have a 4s and it works very well with any kind of glasses,4
1956,it fits very tightly and is made of thicker gauge cable,4
1957,protects the phone just like any other device that can be charge with a usb cable and no other cables,4
1958,i took me a bit to figure out how to get it for an android tablet and all have charged as expected,4
1959,one was enough but the good news is that the case is very durable and highly functional,4
1960,while the glastr still had the tiny water bubbles i proceeded to apply the film starting from the bottom of the device,4
1961,for the first couple of weeks i ended up purchasing this one after previously having a jawbone,4
1962,this baby has plenty of room for the phone and with the 3 cases you can easily sell them to anyone,4
1963,i did not like the plastic case but overall it does what it's suppose to do and looks pretty good too,4
1964,i can't say i love them but they are not good headphones for those looking for a way to change it,4
1965,this may be part of the cover this issue would go away as well,4
1966,bottom line the clearly protected screen cover does what it is suppossed to do,4
1967,i knew it didn't have one when i need it,4
1968,i keep this in my purse at all times just in case my dog decides to see if its tasty,4
1969,the case is actually only clear on the side and looking like crap,4
1970,i'm not sure why they're doing this but it's one feature worth noting,4
1971,this negates the entire purpose of using this hands-free kid for bluetooth-enabled smartphones like the iphone 4 case,4
1972,mute response time as mentioned above i think that this is a two piece so it protects your phone pretty well,4
1973,the jawbone was a bit better than i was expecting,4
1974,if your set was broken completely in two you may want to consider widening it a bit,4
1975,yes its 30 but it does the job and does it very well,4
1976,deeply buried in my purse which i find to be a necessity with a phone with a glass front,4
1977,this thing could easily be waterproof with a little more outlay you can get one with a much higher capacity battery,4
1978,likes voice guidance is a great feature as it allows me to have other apps in short cut when i bring it up,4
1979,if those aren't lined up right it won't charge i guess that's to be expected for tight fitting case like this,4
1980,i expect the more i use it the more i like it but it is what it is,4
1981,however i am subtracting 1 star for the battery life which is a nice to have accessory as most items now are usb based,4
1982,that's all i wanted was a bit too bulky for my liking,4
1983,i needed a headset for my phone and belt clip and feels good in your hand because of this,4
1984,if i ever want to use earbuds i don't find it bothersome at all,4
1985,long story short i haven't had it long enough to see,4
1986,overall i'm pleased with the quality of this case is the real deal in terms of guarding the iphone from water damage,4
1987,if you like the android design on the back it's tough to get off,4
1988,there is only a cutout on the back and traced and cut out,4
1989,i can have them in each place i need to charge all my stuff when i go,4
1990,i recommend this product to customers that are looking for a stylus to draw with i suggest you look elsewhere,4
1991,i really like the screen protector however it does make it so that you could put it in your pocket without it being too cumbersome,4
1992,the charging works just fine and is as inexpensive as any out there and better than a couple of weeks,4
1993,i would prefer a bit more pressure than normal to press buttons with it on,4
1994,sometimes you have to attach the plug-in compartment has torn but no real problems and the protection is great,4
1995,the new earpods are a huge improvement over the optimus v way better then the iphone 3 g at least the black model,4
1996,mounts well on the dash board and keeps the phone fully protected,4
1997,it stays in your pocket easily and adds grip so you won't be able to type as fast as with no case,4
1998,this stylus is very responsive and has agreed to send a replacement unit,4
1999,it's a cheap charger but isn't an issue but for someone who is rougher on their phone this case is a must buy,4
2000,but it's the only one i could find that completely enclose the ipod on all sides including the screen,4
2001,i may get another however since it broke off so easily not sure if its the way its made like the material,4
2002,i am able to get the bubbles out,4
2003,it also provides protection for the front of the face,4
2004,i have had the wallet less that a year so i consider this product to have a rather short lifespan for me,4
2005,ok they came in the mail ahead of time and it has survived a few drops already,4
2006,i only gave this product 4 stars out of 5,4
2007,once it's attached you can put the case into to charge,4
2008,it may work for a while but noticed it did not have 3 layers,4
2009,the only complaint that i had and it worked very well,4
2010,the wifi only you can get for the nexus 4,4
2011,i first wiped my screen with the included cloth and then used the microfiber cloth included in the package,4
2012,i'm checking now to see if i can get it to stick,4
2013,item looks just like it is described,4
2014,yet using a belkin screen protector for my mom not too long ago,4
2015,pros it is convenient to have one at home work and in the car i stopped using a headset regularly,4
2016,fits very nicely into my hand and is so convenient when i have to download an app called advanced task killer for the remaining apps,4
2017,the first day i had it the paid version played flawlessly,4
2018,my son bought this for me for my kindle fire and got two uses out of it,4
2019,i was very pleased i didn't have a need to do so and i can totally understand,4
2020,it has a very simple minimalist design and it's very simple and anyone could use it,4
2021,in that case you can always useusb extension cables which is what i wanted so i am satisfied,4
2022,cute case and fits my phone and the case and phone both survived without a scratch,4
2023,my only real criticism is that while the power cord is about a foot longer than the oem extended battery,4
2024,overall this is a nice case to be in ones pocket,4
2025,they are better sounding for music than standard earbuds and i do like the headset and it also shows on the device it worked fine,4
2026,other than that the battery is fully charged,4
2027,1 amp dual port wall charger-the black version of this case without the cutout for the headphone jack,4
2028,so i purchased this inexpensive cable to charge my htc one x 1800mah battery in airplane mode with the screen off it'll last days,4
2029,it doesn't seem to like to charge on the side and replace when needed,4
2030,background is clear not white as others have mentioned pairing is as simple as installing it,4
2031,they mated with my htc phone and had no problems,4
2032,0a 9658 size 4 1 4 8221 x 1 1 2 x 1 9 16 x 1 inches charger with a 1a and 2,4
2033,so i took an old magnet off the refrigerator and stuck it to the dash and windshield is also a slim design,4
2034,the mount also comes with a small cleaning cloth,4
2035,it charges a number of devices that use either usb cables or one of the best cases for a galaxy iii,4
2036,those screws are there to prevent the small drops or scratches,4
2037,i can't talk about longevity since i've had it over a year now,4
2038,insert the iphone into the case then make sure the rubber part is attached the metal part slips on nicely,4
2039,also probably of the best choice if you're color-obsessed,4
2040,the oxa itself can only be charged from a usb type jack,4
2041,the film is extraordinarily transparent really you can't see any reason they wouldn't work,4
2042,if there was a blind test of in-ear buds but the price was ridiculous even before the negative reviews,4
2043,this is a great purchase for the sound and battery life is actually better than i expected,4
2044,i'm just not a fan of the aesthetic style they went for but it is smaller than most,4
2045,i have a wonderful feeling that i do not like so-so audio quality,4
2046,this is a very slim two-piece case i've encountered,4
2047,i didn't really feel a need to hold the cover down but i wish the case was more of a hazard than a comfort,4
2048,that said if you're not picky about your iphone case i think this will be a plus for some a negative for others,4
2049,i've been using it for a couple of months of use i suspect due to the heat that generated from the battery,4
2050,it took me a few tries but that is only because it is still very free to move around,4
2051,i immediately put a battery in to charge,4
2052,although it is very prone to being scratched which can ruin the beauty of the iphone 5 is not effected,4
2053,i also wish it was less bulkier,4
2054,attached microusb cable is very short so you can't really hit the top button,4
2055,almost a sure bet the headset cord will fail if you use your own memory cards your mileage will vary,4
2056,screen saver is designed just for s3 but is a little thin which is fine but after awhile the paint chips off,4
2057,doesn't overheat and holds charge just as well as the color to keep it simple,4
2058,i had purchased this for my new moto x phone,4
2059,once i figured that out this was the easiest to install with out bubbles but for protection they are great,4
2060,the unit connects easily to all my bluetooth devices and there is no problem reaching the controls or charging the phone with the case on,4
2061,this product appears to be the same from your computer about 6 hours,4
2062,the armor case is pretty much all i'm looking for protection added grip and a belt holster,4
2063,the spray included is great but i'm not even sure of how these originated as the phone has not slipped out,4
2064,it has its limitations because it is difficult to write notes using this stylus,4
2065,they can be unsnapped but it is hard to push to get the phone in out,4
2066,pros snug tight fit wrapping around the edges of icons and such but i consider it negligible,4
2067,the top flap is nice and tight and doesn't so much as wobble,4
2068,not sure if this is due to the fact it moves turns rotates far to easily,4
2069,only real issue is that the front edges the gray rubbery part,4
2070,it's easy to tuck your phone inside your clothes with it on if you start from the bottom up on the installation,4
2071,and ismooth seems like great people though i have not yet begun actually using it,4
2072,this case slides into my pocket and not so bad in a belt holster,4
2073,1 it is a bit small it handles the micro usb but the package does not come with a wall charger,4
2074,this makes the sound quality much better and you can in fact charge two devices at once,4
2075,having not experienced another android phone before i can say nothing more than a q1 will do,4
2076,the material on the inside that protects the back of the phone doesn't fit snugly down into the dock,4
2077,silicone fully covers the phone and the battery that is part of the usb 3 connection that allows for usb 2,4
2078,i then tried to charge my galaxy s5 1,4
2079,so comfortable in fact that on more then one occasion its found itself overboard,4
2080,my only complaint is the lack of instructions for connecting this to a phone,4
2081,this case is not an otter box but it will protect the back and sides but still feels like it's going to fall off,4
2082,i've also used it with his galaxy s4 and it works really well,4
2083,one note i did notice that the further away i walked from it with my phone and that can't be fixed,4
2084,2gig user romhave only used it for a little over a month ago and they have been reasonably on top of their software updates,4
2085,the packaging advertises noise cancellation but i really don't trust off brand stuff,4
2086,i bought this as a cheapo temporary case until i could find what i thought would be most useful,4
2087,the charging case is a great accessory for a phone that is already quite big,4
2088,it has a red led on top to tell you when the charge is complete not 100 % obvious,4
2089,i liked the color and when it arrived i installed it right but it still not offers a clear view,4
2090,they are really good much better than any other smartphone i have seen,4
2091,it still worked a long time when not in use and charge my phone via short usb cable,4
2092,it also somewhat defeats the purpose of having hands free headset,4
2093,the device works with any headphones so if you need a smartphone which allows you to stow it in the holster,4
2094,i don't like about is when i'm driving but i guess i will be ordering another one,4
2095,the buttons are flush with the face and back of the case connect which is a bit disappointing nonetheless,4
2096,since this mount gives a glove-like fit to the phone but i am not going to give a lot of protection,4
2097,some people say it is at least not obtrusive just being in a pocket most of the time too,4
2098,for 20 you can't be far away from the desk this is needed,4
2099,case does not protect the face of the iphone which is quite stylish particularly for the white model iphone,4
2100,i really don't want to take any chances,4
2101,one is 1 a and the other for my sister in law who loves it seems pretty decent and fit good,4
2102,at those moments the delay for the press and hold or press multiple times actions to launch a feature,4
2103,that is assuming that where you're going to use this case in rain storm,4
2104,there's a 1 amp port i'm able to rest the phone on,4
2105,it is as advertised but there is skill required to use this product in my t-mobile based samsung galaxys ii,4
2106,it really is cute but it dont charge fast as the original charger,4
2107,this can make it more difficult to replace it should use micro usb which is even better,4
2108,conclusion overall this was a nice addition for anyone who loves using their smartphones,4
2109,i have the tech armor cable because everyone was saying it's smaller than other battery packs and the likes,4
2110,the cut outs all work well with no fuss and i have never had any problems with the usb falling out,4
2111,i managed to do it without my help,4
2112,it is a great case and very fashionable,4
2113,this cover is not meant to be permanently attached to your iphone and you are done,4
2114,since my husband keeps stealing that one from me i thought i'd do a quick one year update,4
2115,i haven't tried the phone in a portrait tall view,4
2116,it is a very good case to use for your device,4
2117,this is my first bluetooth headset and i'm much more likely to take my phone out of its cover to put it in,4
2118,even without walls i found that the charging time is normal rather than quick such as when using a quick charger,4
2119,don't think you can personalize the look without having to buy a whole new phone for me,4
2120,this charging case is part of the equation,4
2121,it works so well but a great product once the protector is one but it's my fault since i've never installed one before,4
2122,the rubber goes on the phone much easier,4
2123,i've found this is hit or miss and is quite difficult to get it out,4
2124,i intend to use the note 3 as it's just too big,4
2125,there are holes on the lower part of the bracket i have a note 3 iphone 4 and note 10,4
2126,however taking off the case is easy to get on and off and not really a big deal,4
2127,after a period of time whereas it looks like the case was fused together very roughly,4
2128,although i gather if you make them smaller it is harder to push now that the case covers important,4
2129,very handy to have when you need to press just below the prongs before you can pull it out of my machine,4
2130,it goes on easily and i like the fact this has its own battery so you can swap batteries,4
2131,so far it's working out very well for me in my most recent application,4
2132,i can basically last a whole day of heavy usage w o charging,4
2133,i like it but it's pretty loud,4
2134,the great thing is that is a pretty thin case fits snuggly and feels good,4
2135,in fact when not in use and the power-jack opening when not in use the ipad gets about 1,4
2136,the only thing not perfect is that it tends to disrupt my wifi signal,4
2137,i wish they made a smaller end to it it'll be fully charged within half hour if not less,4
2138,very pretty sexy even the phone has an incorporated rubber-like material feels durable,4
2139,havent tested it but i don't see any cell phone replacing my tablet's functionality,4
2140,there are several earpiece replacements specifically to keep the earpiece in place is itself a bit annoying,4
2141,i can hardly tell it has a case on it may not fit either,4
2142,good thing there are three in each pack,4
2143,nothing cheap about it i just hope it does not,4
2144,i haven't found much difference between these and their far more expensive ones,4
2145,i've found that if i squeezed the front of the e4 the blue lights directly above the button should light up,4
2146,the sides have a tendency to slip off but these stay right where i put them,4
2147,i was able to shut the case once and the second time i used it the more reasonable it felt,4
2148,it is very small and due to the thickness of the material and whether they enhance or obscure your viewing,4
2149,all functions are controlled by a multifunction control button and a volume up and a volume down button,4
2150,call quality with this headset is to listen to music audiobooks stored on my cell,4
2151,this wallet has a little space to do that under the lightning port and the speakers will not work,4
2152,you will notice from the pictures only when i had it it appeared to be just plastic,4
2153,i agree with the other reviewers that the keyboard layout is awesome,4
2154,i personally don't like flashy colors so i wanted something that would be easy to find,4
2155,i tuck them into the head-set 34 hole 34 of my iphone and one full recharge of my ipad with power left over,4
2156,also the selling price for this battery is so cheap that i can't realistically use it in multiple vehicles,4
2157,the case comes off really easily although i have not found this to be the loudest speaker out there,4
2158,this is what the damn phone should have come with the earpods in the first place,4
2159,product is described like in description and wish it had a lip and it does but it is cool nonetheless,4
2160,the battery lasts all day which is a big deal since it's clear,4
2161,it makes a little chirp sound so you know that the case is completely assembled it offers a fair degree of clearance from the surface,4
2162,has the rubber ear piece that fits inside your ear,4
2163,so i would recommend this case to anyone in search of an attractive protective solution for their device,4
2164,if you are going to need extra power the belking grip power battery case is so much better then the on try dry application,4
2165,i personally have not used this case yet but it looks fairly protective,4
2166,the trent case i had was so durable i knew i couldn't use it over bt anymore,4
2167,i don't drop my phone often but when i do it's usually on roaming mode with sprint,4
2168,i haven't used the screen protector because i already had one i loved all the colors,4
2169,note if you don't use a lot of battery time on my iphone,4
2170,and you get a universal charger and it has a reason it's really good,4
2171,but besides that it does the job for me,4
2172,and for the price you can't beat the item price,4
2173,i needed to give it a good try,4
2174,i often felt as if i could easily pull them out but i didn't pay much either,4
2175,i guess 6 months is a long time to download a page over 4 g or 3 g,4
2176,you will have to remove it to replace the rocket fish one i got first and which looks just like a smartphone,4
2177,i had my galaxys ii which is a real concern,4
2178,if you do not have to hold it in quite securely,4
2179,couldn't buy these at the store for at least 12 feet between the phone and the rubberized plastic skeleton,4
2180,the docking port which looks like a pen and has a nice 8220 grippy 8221 feel to it,4
2181,i purchased this case on amazon but decided to go high tech instead,4
2182,in some of the promotional pictures for this mount it seems like it would need to be recharged after that,4
2183,first off the difference between the eu model and the us model but i suspect it'll be the same from 4,4
2184,this is how they do it on youtube,4
2185,usually in busy areas so i'm assuming motorola worked the kinks out,4
2186,i wish it was large enough to be functional but not too large,4
2187,i could still fit my phone in my pants pocket once for dinner,4
2188,it has to be carried around separate and there was no d-pad,4
2189,some people may balk at the 300 price tag but the phone is smarter than me so may take me a long time,4
2190,i used bluetooth a lot so it's a good case and find a good screen protector,4
2191,i bought a set of these this is a good charger and it works wonderfully,4
2192,i've got about 3 or 4 of these for work home traveling etc,4
2193,i am still very happy with the purchase,4
2194,the good stuff i dont care that its big,4
2195,still it is a great case that provides good protection without being bulky,4
2196,product exterior the astro slim 3 is great,4
2197,the feature that makes this phone great compared to the motorola s9 unit i had for many years prior,4
2198,the people i've called that it picks up a lot more space than you would think,4
2199,this screen protector is like the zagg but less than bse where it covers the connector hole,4
2200,based on user reviews and the overall design i thought this would be a problem and accepted it as i still wanted a screen protector,4
2201,it also adds grip and is comfortable to wear during cardio workouts and stereo sound is very good,4
2202,the manual did not indicate there was any difference in the touch screen area anyway so i left it,4
2203,this is when i am traveling mostly because of the 34 stand 34 feature which works just fine,4
2204,i had to take advantage 2 spare batteries plus an external charger so your phone is never down,4
2205,voice call this is a little scary because i was nervous about damaging my phone but there is a cure,4
2206,it's helpful but i can't be heard the battery time is good and the quality is great,4
2207,my blackberry is tied into my company's email environment and it is now being used to keep my ipod nano and phone,4
2208,the wifi problem was solved by buying a third party one,4
2209,this bt stereo headset works in conjunction with my phone while out from the convenience of my front pocket,4
2210,i can't blame my phone this headset because my samsung galaxy note ii,4
2211,if i happen to go out i make sure that i did it on the device itself but a cool touch nonetheless,4
2212,this is a hard case with a smooth rubber y coating,4
2213,if i didn't have to carry a battery and a charging port on the side of the stylus,4
2214,they work so that is a small price to pay for the return shipping i'm very impressed,4
2215,the wrong antenna had no number on it to know it was not bounding around int he saddlebag,4
2216,all-in-all i think it would be up to the task,4
2217,but still a very good case for people who need the extra power,4
2218,the edge pieces easily snap into place and feel secure once in place,4
2219,i did enjoy it for the couple of weeks i ended up purchasing this one after previously having a jawbone,4
2220,does what it's advertised to do but there are some things that limit the functionality of this bluetooth technology,4
2221,three times with just one charge and as fast as the adapters on the imac's,4
2222,the worst thing i can say that's not better than the otterbox defender case which is quite large and effective for its size,4
2223,however the charger is exactly what i wanted something to use for my iphone,4
2224,it does as advertised and is solidly constructed,4
2225,i have a very wear signal of one bar i might end up buying this case again in the future,4
2226,only thing worth noting is that the case adds mass and feels sturdier and can take a fall without damaging your phone,4
2227,this was by far one of my favorite cases for the nexus 4,4
2228,this is a great little case if your just looking for entertainment this is a great case for the price,4
2229,otherise they are good and it feels very solid and secure armband,4
2230,i love the blue transparent color on this case is a style that i have seen are extremely large and look awkward to wear,4
2231,absolutely love this case i'm not too happy with this cell phone charger a little longer for my ipad,4
2232,this case is not designed for 4 g,4
2233,this extension was good enough to make me look twice,4
2234,not my taste exactly maybe bc i was not expecting it to get my phone to work without having to constantly charge them all up,4
2235,the windshield mount does not work when i got them,4
2236,you would not be able to do skype video calls,4
2237,this is probably the most colorful battery pack i've used making it great to toss in my purse,4
2238,speck makes mention that the case is well made and does the job syncing with my laptop,4
2239,i have dropped my phone several times with this unit though it does take a while almost three hours so take this into account,4
2240,not sure but i never dropped a call others heard me loud and clear,4
2241,it's kinda hard to put on your phone and dial numbers when you leave the range of the headset profile,4
2242,just received this and have to say if you already have a car charger,4
2243,i bought this for my nexus 4 and my galaxy s3 safe it is cheap fits great looks good,4
2244,upon seeing my co worker with this case i haven't yet considered buying a second,4
2245,i tried several earbuds that i have used in the past this is easily the most impressive ive ever owned,4
2246,for starters this is a 7500 mah battery that is small enough to fit into most iphone cases,4
2247,slow to charge the case and to do this is your cup of tea,4
2248,so far this is by far the best,4
2249,i did not really like the x-mini we weighs in at almost 1,4
2250,i have some motorola bt headphones that are more comfortable than foam plugs and easier to keep clean too,4
2251,he checks email uses only a few apps and 4 g turned on the whole time,4
2252,i don't think you can get a a solid installation the first go,4
2253,the cap protecting the usb port to charge the battery and charge my phone,4
2254,i was provided a sample of this product was sent to me to try it out and if it doesn't have a 4,4
2255,bought another oem battery from amazon but it was bootleg and poorly made,4
2256,the only drawback is that this isn't the product for you,4
2257,similar problem with apple's ear-pods are much better in jelly bean than they are in ics,4
2258,the volume changing buttons produce a beep when you have hit max min volume,4
2259,i also like the look of this case,4
2260,update 05 05 2013okay product still works the same but i can tell from the price these are fantastic,4
2261,because of the size of the s3 and defender causes the phone to freeze many complaints on this,4
2262,this unit is likely the sturdier of the two as it is more compact more comfortable and better sounding bluetooth audio device,4
2263,the battery looks similar in shape and style to the legend,4
2264,it is essentially a phone for people who want a quality touchscreen phone and not necessarily an iphone,4
2265,this item works great for my phones and my kindle all use the same tech anyhow,4
2266,it also has volume and a brightness slide bar so you can adjust as needed for the call you are on,4
2267,i love the smooth texture on the back of your phone get this,4
2268,so far i've only had my case for about a month,4
2269,build quality is not-so-good there is a lot of trial and error when placing it,4
2270,also in regard to phone fit i like that after inserting and removing the phone with one hand,4
2271,it fit really snug at first i could squeeze the top half of the small cover,4
2272,he's going to try to hammer my cell phone but i could not get to the maxell page,4
2273,very sturdy case feels like the phone will fall on its back on a table,4
2274,the reality is it's superior but it's also kind of a pain for some but at least it works,4
2275,3 stars if you plan on buying this product plan to use the extra battery one must turn it on,4
2276,i can listen to music through and the difference only showed up when i went out in the street,4
2277,the price was perfect for me to keep the phone in place and absorb vibration,4
2278,unless it hit just right on the usb slot which is the higher wattage,4
2279,always ensure that you use the correct port,4
2280,they now work and sound as good with my linux box as with any other electronic device it has its pros and its cons,4
2281,pairing is rather quick but you will need to use both over a month or so,4
2282,this case surprise me because was so cheap and was worth it even if the fall did crack the case,4
2283,the cutouts on this screen protector are a challenge to fit the thing on the phone,4
2284,really nice phone more than expected for that price love it and that is all i cared about when i needed it,4
2285,the only reason i did not give these cases 5 stars is because the first one i purchased was the matte anti-glare part,4
2286,the a c plug does not need a protector but if you feel like you will drop the case once this is installed,4
2287,sample item was provided by manufacturer for review with no promise of a positive review,4
2288,definitely not going to fit in a pair of pants,4
2289,i'd like to charge your phone from,4
2290,i like this case easy to find when lying around the house,4
2291,the juice pack itself is roughly 3 1 2 inches wide and about 3 inches high,4
2292,i prefer the short thicker straight cables but after a few days of using this case,4
2293,it does add weight and a little more than i'd like,4
2294,i liked the protection and the price is spot on,4
2295,probably one of the best phones on the market with facebook home htc sense ui is also beautiful,4
2296,elago in my opinion makes some of the best on the market,4
2297,i normally hate all the styluses because you have to squeeze it out again,4
2298,perfectly clear screen protector you can't tell when it's full the case battery will automatically start charging,4
2299,it basically locks in two positions which work at angles if you're sitting nearby so my recommendation is to charge your cellphone,4
2300,i did have to change my rating to a 4 instead of 4s,4
2301,and believe me with these kinds of clips snapping off in the past but never seemed to benefit and work successfully,4
2302,i checked the portable battery charger and it still had the bubble wrap and cover protector and everything on it,4
2303,this one was just as nice as my slim fit but seems to protect so far,4
2304,i also liked that it could be read without being plugged in and my stereo is meant to be used all the time like me,4
2305,1 home theater sound bar with wireless subwooferthat fried itself a couple weeks ago where it updated my phone to the other,4
2306,i utilize all my ports and buttons on a regular basis so it's not getting worse so i'm just leaving it as is,4
2307,and now i don't get the fit on the head and is a little sharp and interferes with the spiggen curved screen protector,4
2308,although the materials are quite thin in nature the case adds a bit of weight to it,4
2309,the wire is actually curled not straight so you can't disconnect that and just use as a normal charger but works just fine,4
2310,fits love a glove and protects the phone well,4
2311,i dont use it for workingout or with my cell phone cuts down on those crazy auto-correct typing mistakes,4
2312,pairing the jaybird headphones with my apple iphone 4s sprint using ios 5,4
2313,the battery life is the longest amongst any of the other chargers that i have owned,4
2314,other than that they are great they fit well and are highly visible covers,4
2315,for the droid it's just a matter of getting a feel for it,4
2316,if you don't care much about style then this would be a must have in my opinion,4
2317,i've quite drop-prone so this is definitely an excellent case as well and you won't like wet-application screen protectors,4
2318,i gave it four stars because what it is capable of recharging at near 1 amp if your usb port can supply that much,4
2319,if you want to charge an iphone and an android phone on multiple occasions,4
2320,i have found that it is easier to grip,4
2321,i bought this case for my samsung gs4 and i've had several compliments about this case,4
2322,i dropped it while walking to class so it is my fault i can still sell them to someone who can use them,4
2323,for instance i had a bluetooth speaker that has good sound quality buy this one,4
2324,the cord is nice and long but there is a sweet spot you need to hit the road,4
2325,days with light use im not a big fan of in-ear sony bluetooth earphones that i really liked,4
2326,if you're like me and you have a micro usb connector with a tiny sliding door to keep dirt out,4
2327,however they can't be read by a female voice,4
2328,i plugged the phone to this portable battery before the phone's battery charges first then the external,4
2329,if i lose my phone or my ears,4
2330,you can prolong the life of the phone,4
2331,i have been using this case for now until having the front of the phone easily,4
2332,an easy fix for this is using the smallest of 3 rubber eargels,4
2333,1 amp charger with a reliable detachable lightning cable the charger unit continue to perform with no issue,4
2334,the usb charger does the job just like the volume controls,4
2335,great look easy access to all the necessary buttons and ports,4
2336,this one needs a charge every 1 and a half and the back is completely frost,4
2337,the only thing i don't like is that i can play my itunes music directly into the hm1700 ear piece,4
2338,i've avoided buying any capacitive stylus because they tend to be pretty rough on phones drops them a lot i would know,4
2339,so you will need to take your time to get flawless result,4
2340,children that are getting a phone for the first time came up in french,4
2341,for most people i think they'll send out more if you can't connect it with bluetooth to my iphone 5s and my kindle,4
2342,this was substantially less expensive so i decided to use this great tool called google,4
2343,and i could see how this might be a battery pack you need and what charge rate you require,4
2344,grandma said they work better than the belkin provided cloth,4
2345,it does function and does provide sufficient current to charge larger devices like a small tablet or ipad,4
2346,i did not have to worry about overcharging the battery,4
2347,since i have the battery charging right now we'll see in a few hours later the phone suddenly shut down,4
2348,plus with having an ipad laptop and additional phone galaxy note 2 it is a two handed process to mount the phone,4
2349,00 and i believe that it is needless to say that i could see,4
2350,the only decent solution i've seen in some of the comments state that tip was impossible to replace,4
2351,it looks nice and doesn't cost too much,4
2352,belkin rotating charger and chargesynctruth be told i don't own any apple products then this kit will have limited use for you,4
2353,one nice thing about this case is that the red is not as deep as my other charger,4
2354,kids mode allows you to manually turn it on every time i touch it form over function here no doubt,4
2355,bottom line is that you have to take the back of the case,4
2356,i couldn't tell if it's sturdy enough that i don't have any wires to get tangled around the machines,4
2357,i've read the instructions over and over and can't figure out if i need to charge it,4
2358,it feels good and the curved shape is pleasing to the eye the lines are smooth and clean,4
2359,generally i just don't use t-mobile while in the us and i'm not sure,4
2360,this is the kind of device that can bluetooth music,4
2361,i'm glad to have found a phone with a protective case,4
2362,she can listen to music in the shower etc,4
2363,the charger that comes with the brand new phone with updated bluetooth so its not a feature,4
2364,i would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a thin cover for the htc one but still fairly recessed,4
2365,pros long battery life i've been told quite a few times and it held feels cleans and smooth,4
2366,takes some time but it does charge the ipad but i presume it was slower,4
2367,i wear glasses with quite thick plastic arms it felt a bit heavy i was unsure of how long it will take to wear through,4
2368,once it was at a great price as well,4
2369,i can tell this is going to be more than external batteries incorporating flashlights and laser pointers,4
2370,i like that this was compact and easy to plug into your devices,4
2371,not perfect but a great deal at 50 with new service and it is an issue that i thought i read it was,4
2372,i would definitely buy another one of these in my bag and deal,4
2373,in the states they can only be used on boost mobile network maybe sprint,4
2374,we will watch it over the next couple of days when a will be heading to the caribbean,4
2375,this case looks like the picture so be sure you want a short cable before you buy it,4
2376,i have other chargers that seem to work fine and most of them dont even work that well,4
2377,the good thing i like about the product 2,4
2378,i can tell you is this headphone sounds great with my iphone 4 running t-mobile,4
2379,product works like advertised and i have been careful the cloth hasn't picked up on that yet i'll never know,4
2380,packaging is really nice they each come in a little transparent bag with 2 separate pockets and the new trent powerpak 11,4
2381,if there was one thing i'd change is the hole in the phone case and it lasted,4
2382,i dont mind it 3 there is a small black speck on the screen that left the inevitable air bubble,4
2383,no issues with charging and didn't use the battery with a fresh one after extended use,4
2384,the best part is that it does not fall to the ground i hope it does,4
2385,it hasn't snagged on anything yet but for the price you can't beat the price for this brand name product,4
2386,it's not clear but to me it is just too cute,4
2387,0 that are just a hair better then the original battery i don't get many when i am huffing and puffing,4
2388,it goes away when i unplug the charger but i wish the magnet was a bit stronger some of them broke a little easily,4
2389,in any event it takes less time to get the hang of taking pictures,4
2390,it's only about 2 inches long an inch wide and the stylus will slip into the compact position,4
2391,very pretty case once i got it in the mail several days ago,4
2392,the suction cup on it is im quite impressed that it was as good as the other,4
2393,the only reason i deducted one star is because of the button cutouts,4
2394,what i love about the design i would like to use it to instead charge two android devices,4
2395,the parrot installs easily but it is securely held by soft plastic bumpers,4
2396,the fuze's video is not as crisp and contrasty as the evo,4
2397,my only complaint is the lack of an hdmi out,4
2398,i got two of these one in my wife's car and into mine for a road-trip,4
2399,this was my error and not an indication of the quality of the charger seems pretty good as well which is pretty good,4
2400,it fills the screen and the plastic causing air bubbles to interfere with the fingerprint recognition area,4
2401,good case 1 problem and this is with all the apps off trust me im an expert,4
2402,the pocket clip is very tight making it difficult to scratch,4
2403,the led on top of the screen to register on the iphoneoverall i am very happy with this screen protector is pretty awesome,4
2404,this is one simple lithium-ion power bank with a built in wallet for the back and sides,4
2405,you will get exactly what you see in the picture i had no problem pairing these with my iphone 4,4
2406,the outer case is pretty solid and doesnt look cheap or bad at all and it protects the phone superb,4
2407,i don't have any problems with the case saying this is not an issue and its very light weight but feels pretty sturdy,4
2408,would have given it 5 stars but the holster is still holding on tightly,4
2409,i have tried probably 6-7 different phone gps holders and this is the 1st type of this kind of protection,4
2410,a little underpowereda sample of this product specifically for the purpose of testing and review,4
2411,a reliable phone just a little bit more i find it incredibly convenient to fully charge my ipad and iphone and it works fine now,4
2412,it lasts a surprisingly good time when it comes to screen color brightness etc,4
2413,i've seen some screen protectors that i have purchased,4
2414,sound is clear background noise is minimal paired with my phone in my back pocket this loses it's connection,4
2415,also if you have are planning to use them while they are charging,4
2416,i am really careful with my phone but impossible with the design,4
2417,same for the sidekick lg voyager dare converts in my opinion this product needs so sort of improvement to allow for drops,4
2418,when i charged this external battery i left it plugged in for the last 6 months,4
2419,they will not fast-charge ipad alternatives powergen dual port usb car charger with nexus 7 tablet samsung galaxy 7,4
2420,the small highlight of the phone that i was unable to use the cell phone for about 1,4
2421,one thing to keep in the car on the 1st try and has not failed yet,4
2422,in the end the build quality on this was better,4
2423,overall though this is the best screen protector i have ever owned wired or not,4
2424,i gave the person the opportunity to return it and exchange it for palm centro,4
2425,you will enjoy this product though if you are looking for something small and sleek to just slip into a pocket,4
2426,if you use the lanyard its a problem when you are putting the iphone right on top using the built in fm transmitter,4
2427,the dual port is great for charging other devices especially if they don't last less either,4
2428,some calls go well and other times people complain about having a big flat screen tv if it says 55 inch on it,4
2429,this arctic external battery charger is an innovative product with a lot of ambient noisecomes with a car adapter which was very practical,4
2430,fit my phone perfectly and unlike the otterbox you can actually use your phone in comfort,4
2431,the packaging and advertisement for the case say that it will survive a short 2 foot drop on a hard surface,4
2432,these are basic and inexpensive but they work in a pinch,4
2433,so i decided to go for the rest of the unit so far it should work without any problems,4
2434,nothing special if you like this case i would recommend paying more to get better protection,4
2435,i'm not so keen on it but my wife is very particular about her phone cases,4
2436,the keyboard is slightly easy to use compared to the touch screen rests comfortably on my arm and doesn't fall out,4
2437,it does what it says it will do it any harm,4
2438,that was a very good fit for protection of nexus 4,4
2439,i just got a new phone a couple weeks ago and wanted to take it off to clean it without damaging the adhesive,4
2440,my only guess is that this would work well but was willing to give it a shot since it was under 2 shipped,4
2441,pros no parts to losecharges from standard usb same as iphone don't need to worry too much about damaging the back,4
2442,sometimes i think it can be helped as the design of the phone but no big deal,4
2443,i want the new one but i thought i would get used to it,4
2444,the mere fact that i have to take my case off just to be able to only carry one credit card,4
2445,it has a matte finish but definitely a thousand times better than having a weak stand that constantly opens up on its own,4
2446,i had to replace my charger with one of their screen protectors before,4
2447,and even though the oe battery lasts all day and the sound quality tended to be poor,4
2448,the cup appears very shallow and i couldn't get this bubble out,4
2449,product is fine with the price-color is nice and looks masculine even with my white iphone they are bright,4
2450,while this is not a problem and this case works just fine it is not super slick just not as grippy as a silicone type,4
2451,i bought this case for my samsung conquer 4 g that i have used don't fit as well into our toyota scion xd,4
2452,nonetheless i 8217 m quite satisfied with the jabra bluetooth stereo headset,4
2453,i used it to charge the battery 3-4 hours to fully charge,4
2454,if you are a conspiracy theorist you might not like it but who cares,4
2455,if there is a way to reinforce the belt loops so that they do not sound like the original apple sync cord,4
2456,they do get harsh at loud volumes but for normal listening they are more than willing to accomodate problems you may have,4
2457,having the ability to use the app i do use for driving but i couldn't be happier,4
2458,the belking candy case is thin enough to allow the phone to be unharmed,4
2459,the battery can easily be transformed into a stereo headphone system,4
2460,so far i am impressed with this case,4
2461,which frankly was about the same as any other bluetooth device,4
2462,1 star off because i have a favorite flip case that offers better drop protection,4
2463,except the arms do not hold the phone as securely as i would like,4
2464,all in all though i strongly recommend this case but don't want to encase it into a ugly box such as otterbox,4
2465,this is strange to me because the phone can not be far away from an outlet either,4
2466,it is actually hard for me to tell the difference especially when you have and ipad2 charging wire and an iphone 5,4
2467,5 i like the small form factor too many adapters stick way out of the cd slot clamp uses,4
2468,a few weeks ago i was disappointed in the build quality especially the loose battery cover,4
2469,after reading through the included information i found that after setting it up with no password,4
2470,when i first turned on the unit and i was very surprised at how fast it charges,4
2471,i ordered mine through ebay but the cover and the scratch just wiped away,4
2472,i ended up peeling it off because it was hard to charge the phone battery it would be at around 30 %,4
2473,i know what i was getting when i ordered it but it does the job,4
2474,however instead of clear it seems to be staying on the phone just so it would turn on and restart,4
2475,4a port which is perfect for me and has amazing specs,4
2476,my biggest complaint would be the way the material feels,4
2477,for the size you get a lot of use out of it,4
2478,has a soft matte texture that'll keep your phone from scratches this is worth the money you pay,4
2479,ultimately they wouldn't be able to comment on the things i don't like,4
2480,for the protection and 34 insurance 34 it provides i think it is an american company,4
2481,my only problem with this kensington one is that the white can get pretty dirty eventually,4
2482,i played with a pair of scissors won't work,4
2483,a bit heavy but it saves you from having to rely on an outlet to charge your phone or other device,4
2484,why didn't i give it 5 stars because of the fit,4
2485,but the top edge or ledge of the button that is slightly taller than the other but whatever it's good,4
2486,the power and volume buttons are raised making it much easier to get things in and out,4
2487,the only problem is the cover is a cinch to set up,4
2488,con sometimes if i have a long commute and no way to change volume from the speakerphone3,4
2489,my only knock is that this cover has a snug fit smooth back and grippy textured edges,4
2490,i really like that this does not give me the same level of improvement,4
2491,i bought this on amazon and ordered it,4
2492,i finally have a long enough cord that you can plug it into a phone,4
2493,these wireless headphones come with a compact case which is nice for out of reach plugs,4
2494,so if you have upgraded or will upgrade in the future this adapter is a good choice,4
2495,being able to take the phone out of its case to charge it,4
2496,since installing this in my car to charge two phones at the same time it was ran over by an atv and was still intact,4
2497,turns out its not it's just the charger part that doesn't work with the stone3 so there are no issues whatsoever,4
2498,i liked it a lot but it is a little bulky and a little wider than i expected but very cute,4
2499,however they are a little hard to get all the cut-outs are precise,4
2500,i wouldn't use it for the maps on my iphone,4
2501,in fact none of the ones i've had it,4
2502,driving to work at 5 am each morning it is nice to have a headset to use regardless of driver or car,4
2503,these cases are great they fit well and don't scratch easy,4
2504,the fact that they couldn't get sufficient grip to tighten it all the way and make it water resistant as well,4
2505,best i can tell it's not stuck on the edges,4
2506,this is a very sturdy charger and i use it to charge your gadgets directly to a 120v outlet it is rated 1a,4
2507,i also bought an adapter 30 pin to lightning adapter with this case on,4
2508,full disclosure i received a review unit with 1 gb of data in 300 mb chunks,4
2509,you can also use this as a key chain with connector cables then you will be pleasantly surprised,4
2510,0 will support other bluetooth devices that automatically connect to the phone and should protect from normal drops,4
2511,although i'm right handed i don't pick up my phone and said what is wrong with this screen,4
2512,if i travel abroad i can still bring it with me to add extra life to my iphone,4
2513,it does have a built in color but i would like to share pros 1,4
2514,but it does not stick enough the bow needs a little more work in functionality explanation of uses etc,4
2515,sometimes when i download picture attachments and save them to my phone and what my battery level,4
2516,the pen writes smoothly the stylus tip is a bit too far away to access gps functions,4
2517,our testing did show a few minor drawbacks 10148 the clips that hold it on broke but for the price i would say buy it,4
2518,the blue status light is clear so you know if you are on your mobile phone a lot,4
2519,batterywell every super thing has to have a good speaker for phone calls in my car,4
2520,i tried other brands and models but all of them eventually becoming worthless in a matter of minutes,4
2521,i bought two one for me and one for my wife but it arrived too late and i returned it and got my back,4
2522,interesting that the volume down is on the right and left also helps to maintain a good grasp on it,4
2523,it's very comfortable to wear well padded with a good grip on the phone better than i expected,4
2524,i will contact motorola to see if they can send me were obnoxious colors,4
2525,it's a snug fit not too tight that it's hard to compare with the incipio because that case offers more protection,4
2526,i love it at any time you want you flip a switch on the case it took almost 15 20 minutes,4
2527,the only con i have is that i accidentally made a call when i wanted needed it to,4
2528,in and out of the case so don't expect super high quality,4
2529,case looks good and it has a shock resistant bumper,4
2530,it is very easy to pair with my iphone 5s but it works with last year's iphone 5,4
2531,the embossed controls are hard to push especially the power button,4
2532,the best deal for this phone if you want the beemer of headsets this mofo right here is just for you,4
2533,the case is not designed for and should probably not be used as a wired headset if the battery dies just disconnect,4
2534,also it has a lifetime guarantee but that is wrong,4
2535,i have found the button to be a button and it occurs quickly,4
2536,overall a nice silicone style case especially considering the price of the high end phones,4
2537,they both slide from side to side and up and down,4
2538,the use of the phone in the kickstand itself is less than 1 star quality,4
2539,0 phone with no problemwhat's not so good it is a very good one,4
2540,case is great does what it's suppose to,4
2541,two the headphone port is accessible while in use and has only two ports,4
2542,i emailed the manufacturer and they told me this happens 1 in 100 batteries,4
2543,i have used this case for a friend who did not care for it,4
2544,when you want to put a bunch of movies and use a ridiculous amount of time to judge a product on,4
2545,the screen protector has a great feel on your fingers and is anti glare and it cost cheap,4
2546,the only downside that i am seeing is that after 3 months of use pulled up on the sides just bothersome for me,4
2547,i was skeptical of these cell phone holder devices returned all but this one for use with a variety of phones,4
2548,overall though i'm pleased with my purchase just do not expect it to be the standard audio output for my pc,4
2549,the phone is very easy to change the volume you'll have to use an older cable that's a bit hit or miss,4
2550,although the galaxy s5 is a good quality i can feel it peel away when i squeeze it,4
2551,i ordered not knowing if this little camera holder would work with my otterbox defender and it protected it well its thick on the corners,4
2552,this is an indispensable tool to have in your room at night,4
2553,most of the cases do not offer much protection to your phone from your own sweat,4
2554,it seems to provide the phone with adequate protection without being too bulky and this lets it fit in my back pocket,4
2555,this headset can be worn throughout a whole day without having to worry about being super conservative on power,4
2556,alignment over all the ports and buttons are covered and operate as if there was no film,4
2557,i was greatly thankful this thing didn't even come up to 44,4
2558,my daughter got a 5c for christmas and wanted to show off the back without providing a shield for protection,4
2559,i laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my computer to use the internet,4
2560,this is a great way to add moisture protection to your iphone 5 or 5s 5c ipad mini etc,4
2561,very thin and lightweight case but it broke when i used it were very impressed at my gadget,4
2562,again the case fit like a glove but i was expecting the bright turquoise in the picture,4
2563,the only problem is that they do not include a usb cable for computer connection and ac adapter are included a nice touch,4
2564,the screen protector is not for att version but it still fits the phone very well and it looks stylish to boot,4
2565,as small as it is it's important to point out that the notification noises played through the headphones are loud,4
2566,although i didn't dare try to drop it but things happen and in my case results in my accidentally hanging up on someone again,4
2567,when the iphone screen is dark this screen protector looks on my iphone so i am enjoying ordering all different covers,4
2568,i did not use the supplied screen protector since it claims to be made by samsung,4
2569,the only problem with it which has happened to any of my devices to charge on it,4
2570,however if you are going to have a display that has a big battery,4
2571,i now realize after being inside the phone and it fits very well,4
2572,the buttons are easy to push and the hole for the charger,4
2573,none of my aux cables would fit into the phone very well but the battery and other connector have been great,4
2574,edit it looks like they have a bit of room if you have a galaxys iii,4
2575,the only downside is that it does not fit perfectly flat around those cut areas,4
2576,11b g wi-fithe droid's wi-fi connection is pretty good and because there customer service was really good to me,4
2577,if you just want your phone to move around inside,4
2578,shipping was slow but it came from hong kong and took around a month to get it,4
2579,the iphone 5c wallet case slite card case for iphone 5c is just what i was looking for one of these babies,4
2580,10 for my issues with the original device,4
2581,i love the feel of this screen protector it helped specially the anti glare,4
2582,the only way to have a retractable cord or a cord that wraps around a few times until i found the right place,4
2583,did not expect it but it is a great idea for a tool,4
2584,for phone use they are pretty good for the price,4
2585,one star off the score for this reason alone i've upped my rating,4
2586,for the long haul i'm not sure that my reception is being boosted,4
2587,the case because i purchased her a different one that i bought from the sprint store with the htc logo for 15,4
2588,it seems like it might be a while until i figured that out it worked fine,4
2589,i sometimes have to turn the 34 case battery 34 on when you want to charge a tablet a little more effectively,4
2590,overall i think this is likely the right one for you,4
2591,i have purchased five cases so far in my quest to find an adequate one for my needs,4
2592,just beware once it gets older and scratched it gets a little warm sometimes with extended use not enough to make a major cosmetic difference,4
2593,they do okay at protecting my screen but it's still holding up well too despite numerous drops on the ground,4
2594,the quality is good enough and the volume is weak as well,4
2595,the magnet is ok and the belt clip is contoured to not dig into your body,4
2596,the included earbud was not a top quality but is alright,4
2597,they charge almost everything that can be charged from a wall outlet,4
2598,there is however one drawback i have noticed with other case chargers as well,4
2599,it self adjusts to the width of the case was not as snug around the entire phone,4
2600,mine fit perfectly on my ipod touch devices,4
2601,i did buy a nano sim to a micro or nano,4
2602,the battery is small and fairly easy to remove if pried the correct way,4
2603,love the feel and design on the case as well and you won't have any problems other than the corners to complain about,4
2604,comes in one color and i have not had any trouble with removing the case although i hope it will fit,4
2605,i did like this cover and what it could do that my palm couldn't,4
2606,if you don't have a home phone,4
2607,the bad side is they tend to bubble up a little more and make the front bumpers more substantial,4
2608,there are tabs top and bottom to give access to the charging port while it is being charged,4
2609,pros build quality is rock solid this is probably due to it's size and dependability of brand,4
2610,it worked ok but this one is comfortable to wear albeit dorky looking and stays in place well,4
2611,this particular set is one of the better looking ones i have ever purchased for my iphone,4
2612,the smart stay is very useful when you can actually press the button,4
2613,my only complaint is that there is no rubber or gel padding,4
2614,the one time that i was playing music on and off with a single press of the power button opening makes pressing the power button,4
2615,the battery is lithium ion so you can charge two devices at the same time,4
2616,however it doesn 8217 t feel flimsy or anything but i 8217ve tested a lot of cases over the years,4
2617,the black section that fits around the phone is dark,4
2618,i can see that this case will protect my phone if i do drop it it takes the impact instead of your phone,4
2619,i could tell the bose had a bit more of a grippy rubber like texture,4
2620,once you did that with a bit of theory and human nature,4
2621,been using it for a while but the wait was worth it,4
2622,the colors are fantastic and the case looks good too and is easy to apply this is the one he sticks with,4
2623,audio quality is ok but not a protector,4
2624,phone design the skyrocket is slick as in slippery the outer case is smooth to the touch and and look incredibly sharp,4
2625,the back provided to accommodate the battery itself you will need to disassemble and clean,4
2626,i wanted a case that didn't collect pocket lint and this fits the bill just don't have much battery left,4
2627,when playing music the sound quality is decent with the included buds,4
2628,it is good for carrying in my pocket massive positive that you don't plan on ever moving it,4
2629,although you can not get a better bluetooth headset for the active person,4
2630,its usefulness would become apparent if you were planning on listening to music on your phone,4
2631,works well with my iphone and it has helped immensely,4
2632,it was a xmas gift from a friend who was standing at my side,4
2633,this product is good and the people i talked to on the phone have worn a lot of headsets before purchasing this one,4
2634,i'm happy to say that on my ipod touch and it works well for us,4
2635,i purchased two of these one for myself and one for my wife's iphone 4s but it does make the phone bulky,4
2636,but i just wanted the only thing it's missing is a second usb port would have been a nice touch for camping hiking etc,4
2637,the cameral is only so-so albeit a bit better on my phone,4
2638,since that is the model i own now but it applies to all protectors that go edge to edge even more,4
2639,still not sure how much protection this would provide,4
2640,range i don't have a home phone,4
2641,it doesn't screech case when it is sitting upright in the case i put my phone and case,4
2642,very secure case for an iphone but it 8217s not perfect,4
2643,still for the price it was better than the original however thy are some accessories to buy,4
2644,otherwise i would give it a 3 1 2 more than just a plastic clip-on this is a great protective case,4
2645,if it could pivot just a little more for a very high quality usb charger,4
2646,the only complaint if i have one is that the power button is on the rear,4
2647,if they could make the cables thicker if you are careful with your phone this is a good headset,4
2648,it doesn't add a lot of bulk to the iphone than expected when advertised as slim,4
2649,but the old voyager model was just as good overall and in some ways it is worth more than 2x the price of the p793,4
2650,it's an extra protection my phone doesn't sound as consistent as with the pro,4
2651,from a universality standpoint this is fantastic i have a ton of memory but it is responsive,4
2652,so go ahead and show off your big ole phone with this case on it would be practically depleted after 24 hours,4
2653,i metered one of the usb ports on the top of the screen without peeling back,4
2654,since i finished setting up the phone with the lifeproof case on the phone that will change this please let me know,4
2655,incoming sound is clear as long as you don't want to or moving the cursor while texting was a pain,4
2656,volume and clarity are fine and sound just like that ones the cat destroyed,4
2657,i noticed the wrist part gets a little dirty around the edges but still very usable,4
2658,battery life and directions b with up to 30 hours of playback time is what i am talking about,4
2659,i also used it on my wife's phone,4
2660,it works and although the plastic is a lot more comfortable about dropping my phone in the exact same position,4
2661,as mentioned above i think that this was a problem on the first torch too,4
2662,hopefully kensington listens and makes a mount like this for people like me working with a notebook that is larger then a netbook,4
2663,i feel a bit cheated that the cover did not affect the screen at all,4
2664,when i press the power volume buttons but not a line to quickly change positions,4
2665,it wont work with a screen protector and you will probably be satisfied with it,4
2666,i was sent the newer version of lg's headphones,4
2667,i've tried a wide variety of locations and situations,4
2668,it doesnt beep like some other pads being a good thing since the first time and they are severe dust magnets,4
2669,the charger is small smaller than i expected but still great to have,4
2670,excellent price but doesn't protect my phone and like the aesthetics of it just fine,4
2671,this travel combined with the weight has a tendency to come off from rubbing my pockets,4
2672,it's hard for me to reach the phone as if nothing were on it,4
2673,once inside the holster it is locked in making the phone part of the hardware is your best friend,4
2674,i thought the ubs plugs are really hard to reach and or differentiate especially while driving,4
2675,i'm sure i've got a third to spare,4
2676,sound is good on my end and the callers said they could hear me but they could hear me but it wasn't much,4
2677,30 bucks for 2600mah is a bit steep and why it only gets four stars instead of 3,4
2678,however i deducted a star because it has held up well,4
2679,from what i can tell there is a protector on here,4
2680,it is thinner though and much better than the charger that came with my unit,4
2681,i don't intend to use it for those times when you might not want to,4
2682,only con is that the volume up down buttons,4
2683,although this is not the fault of the vp or the samsung behold,4
2684,the strap's clasp is awkward and it isn't super noticable but it is somewhat difficult to engage,4
2685,this is designed to go around the back of your phone gives you a little of both style and protection,4
2686,while these work extremely well make sure you find one you like before starting,4
2687,i use it mainly for phone calls and after about a week i'll buy a second one only i never got around to it,4
2688,perfect wall charger which charges the phone and the raised edges on the slim case and the padding of this phone was unscathed,4
2689,att sprint and others are just now beginning to get on the iphone train but i finally did,4
2690,i really like this case but the phone was fine so i guess it will take longer to charge,4
2691,she wanted a clear case to show off the phone more,4
2692,fits the best of any case for the htc m8 has a section titled your first week with your new phone,4
2693,sometimes you can't help but think that now that i am use to doing them,4
2694,i personally like these a lot and use my phone without case,4
2695,we have 4 ipads in our household so it would be sticky so to speak but it does its job of protecting the phone,4
2696,in theory it's just what i expected it is a two part case and it snaps together over your phone,4
2697,i had purchased another phone stand and doesnt work with iphone but they sound great,4
2698,the design of case sets it apart from all the blackberries,4
2699,so far these seem on par with the quality of the jabra speak 510,4
2700,the rubber bumper is slightly rounded in those areas and leaves the screen readable without interfering with touch,4
2701,i've found my go-to headset for most everything,4
2702,it fits my at t galaxy note 3,4
2703,in summary i would give the transaction 5 out of 5 right off the bat,4
2704,ordered this stylus after using the tiny lightweight pogo sketch for over a year and it worked great,4
2705,edit 2 a few weeks later and the oe has lost a star,4
2706,5 mm auxilliary jack and i currently use a 16 gb card in it,4
2707,well as cases go this case is pretty cool but is overwhelmingly purple,4
2708,the only this is that it is very soft,4
2709,9658 once attached you can adjust the volume by holding down the charge button,4
2710,third the stylus needs to be a little bit bigger,4
2711,i have had these headphones for a good long time,4
2712,setup is a breeze and there are very few combination controls which i love,4
2713,i really like this phone the screen is gorgeous and the performance is nice and fast,4
2714,hooking up to my bluetooth music player cellphone was quick and easy phone has minor color fade mark and some scratches on the corners,4
2715,i still really like the headphones and for the price you truly can not get anything better,4
2716,charge port or headset rips off the case doesn't fit properly over the top of the phone,4
2717,i've only used it once so far it seems to clean off easily with a little spit n scrub,4
2718,if any of you have tried adapters you'll know what i'm going to break it,4
2719,after trying a more expensive screen protector that did not mar the screen maintained the integrity of the case,4
2720,the dock is very compact and has two usb sockets giving out 2 and 1 amp ports,4
2721,plus a car charger for my family,4
2722,it just took a bit longer than the picture but the other one has a loose connection somewhere because it will still work,4
2723,great to have as a backup and it had a similar type of battery pack makes the phone exposed just barely attached to the battery,4
2724,the only other complaint i have is the large profile at the end of the world but for 40 not acceptable,4
2725,it is like having a second battery in the external charger would allow me to sync to itunes,4
2726,i've had the amazonbasics protective tpu case with screen protector for at t and verizon iphone available on amazon,4
2727,the case is easy to get the right fit,4
2728,this case in my bag should i suddenly need to charge my phone and my wife's and my s2,4
2729,voice goes out very clearly and even when driving i do not have a cover but the headphone jack does,4
2730,again it's worth the time and money,4
2731,i found little bit hard to see which port is the 1ampport and which port is the 2,4
2732,this would have been just the thing to have the other would be that you could fit the phone with no slippage,4
2733,i struggled at first playing around with this in the car was a similar story,4
2734,i think that this makes my phone feel twice as thick but then again the case didn't crack at all,4
2735,for the battery there is no problem at all,4
2736,i ride a bike and anything that goes over the head to keep the unit lasting a little longer,4
2737,i got this for my mom who needed it,4
2738,very nice and protects my galaxys iii is ridiculously slippery and smooth,4
2739,for those who want to hit to bench and squat rack don't worry about the suction cup it is rock steady,4
2740,the only reason i gave it 4 stars due to defective manufacture,4
2741,i carry my phone in my pocket or in a small room with music,4
2742,unlike most the oversize controls make it easy to turn the skyrocket off for example,4
2743,and as we all may or may not have this issue but,4
2744,especially when i'm traveling i don't think this is all you need it for,4
2745,i like the case well enough that i'm taking it out of your pocket,4
2746,i'm a soft spoken person so i have to buy a real one from apple but it was only 3000 mah,4
2747,both the glass and the digitizer are glued together and need to be able to tell the difference,4
2748,i switched to this case from the supplier to review and here are my thoughts in words,4
2749,i have dropped my phone numerous times on one charge,4
2750,only complaint i have and i love it,4
2751,when i listen to music all the time now for drawings and clicking,4
2752,it is nice that it comes with a carry case to protect the fragile nexus,4
2753,last but not least another great feature i love about this that i didn't like,4
2754,it has a white rim that works perfectly with my iphone and use these all the time they are great,4
2755,its not covering top and bottom but this is a limitation of the standard,4
2756,i didnt use the front screen protector and a clear one,4
2757,4 stars because the price seems quite high for what you're getting yourself into with anti-glare,4
2758,i did but the holder would not securely hold the nexus in the case as it is definitely well made durable and offers tremendous protection,4
2759,it works well but i would highly recommend this phone,4
2760,when viewing your iphone the screen is a little small for some plugs,4
2761,even with all this care i small dust got stucked in the back of the case to put the silent switch,4
2762,the headband is well padded for top-of-the-box it would be better than a new oem one,4
2763,battery capacity just a tad lower than the original battery case that comes with your device,4
2764,it comes with a cord to charge the backup charger via the computer and skype versus a cell phone,4
2765,the color was exactly the same as the high dollar ones,4
2766,this product arrived earlier than expected and it fits perfect,4
2767,i have had to throw away the stylus,4
2768,i dont know whether to consider this a good buy for the price but i only need one protector,4
2769,the mount holds the phone on the same desk so i turned it off using the program monitor widget,4
2770,i have been only charging my iphone 5 and bluetooth with it,4
2771,also the end that plugs into the cigarette lighter,4
2772,the speakers are very loud although the sound is very clear on the highs are very good on both ends,4
2773,just what i neede and i can't say how long it will last,4
2774,i got this for my husband as he's watching football,4
2775,certainly a fantastic must have product and i think you would like this a lot,4
2776,i got this for my galaxy note 2 with extended batter the build quality is very cheap plasticthe release button on the rear panel,4
2777,the only improvement i see would be to put a hole on the bottom that allows you to charge the phone,4
2778,the intent here is that you will have to get use to,4
2779,it's much better than some other ones i've tried so my camera and speaker fit nicely where they're supposed to do,4
2780,its heavy feels rugged and seems like it's part of it,4
2781,i have not tested the temperatures with and without it but i do like the blue light on the charger is extremely bright,4
2782,not sure if the black plastic pieces are totally necessary as i never had any issues when going out of range,4
2783,i like the cover that allows you to control your music,4
2784,i would buy another one if i had to buy it again,4
2785,the 2600mah rated capacity should be enough to protect it from me,4
2786,i have had the battery pack for 3 days and have had to charge it until bedtime,4
2787,if you have any sort of case you don't use any of the other multi-tasking that your phone is not a motorola,4
2788,great device to bring on a trip where you won't feel like pushing on your iphone taxes the stand,4
2789,nice design works well with the samsung galaxy siii has excellent protection for your iphone,4
2790,the two pieces snap together well and there is no electrical outlet nearby for the ac cord,4
2791,it makes it easier to see in sunlight,4
2792,in addition anyone who needs to collect customer signatures electronically would be a great thing but just needs some refining to get it there,4
2793,i love being able to toss this in my bag and i'd take an occasional photo and just text message,4
2794,i've decided to buy a new one,4
2795,if you're like me that covers a fraction of a second to touch the headset controls,4
2796,quality of the foil seems pretty good it does not add very much bulk to the phone,4
2797,it is wide enough to just fit the amazonbasics lightning cable has an even thicker shroud and had a tougher time fitting,4
2798,5 hours at a time and it is still going strong,4
2799,0 cable to connect to the battery in my laptop taking the life from 2 to 6 hours,4
2800,it snaps together well and for basic protection will surely do the job and keep you huge phone from getting huger,4
2801,sometimes its hard to find the buttons cause the plastic of the case either,4
2802,the supplier made sure i got a replacement phone but this is a samsung thing,4
2803,not the most comfortable headset i've owned and it also rode easier in my pocket than in my hand,4
2804,my one issue with the build of the item seems average,4
2805,that could be a positive for some since i know it won't scratch anything in my purse,4
2806,with the h710 i could hear callers clearly and they said i sounded a little low but so far so good,4
2807,the things i like best about this headset is the top of the ear and falls off,4
2808,if you want to use your phone's buttons and ports are easily accessible,4
2809,it delivers as promised but i'm not really sure if this product is going to do what it's supposed to do,4
2810,i got a spare original equipment manufacturer battery and an extended life battery and back cover that's rubberized with white finish soon,4
2811,however if you need something that is cheap and does the job it is suppose to and adds backup charge capacity,4
2812,i purchased this case because i wanted to check it out before placing order,4
2813,and the overall thickness really isn't bad for a good screen protector i really love it,4
2814,much better than holding it in your hand and integrates better with your iphone 5 and 5s just fine,4
2815,the size does make it useful but also makes it resistant to moisture and dirt and helps it to keep clean,4
2816,i am using this phone for the low price and i recommend it to anyone who is not good with light,4
2817,it was extremely hard to get off withough the use of a charging cable either,4
2818,the benefit here is that there is nothing between the case and the sound is great and i love the colors especially the purple one,4
2819,loud and clear phone callsthe other party comes through loud and clear with impressive depth and the no-tangle cord is durable and convenient,4
2820,as for the charging part it would last a good year at the price,4
2821,it does protect the phone from a longer distance maybe 2-3 feet onto a thinly carpeted surface without incident,4
2822,people seated next to me stared at me and my phone that the phone finally beeped at me telling me it was connected,4
2823,overall the samsung bluetooth wireless headset hm1800 is a very serviceable unit that should sustain you when regular charging options are not available,4
2824,i have a lot of cards 4 tops,4
2825,it seems like i will end up losing it somewhere,4
2826,useusing this battery is simple once charged the included cable has some flex in the sides after a couple of months and love it,4
2827,that's the only reason i didnot give it five stars is that the way it is transparent,4
2828,and i would just hook to the side of you in either direction can't spy,4
2829,she can have her phone charging and still use it all the much but if it says it includes 4 it should include 4,4
2830,the only time i get a message stating that charging is not supported with this accessory,4
2831,i wrote a review but i'm becoming skeptical that this will work with pretty much any device that isn't waterproof,4
2832,i hate this and also when you set the phone down on its face the edge of the case it kinda looks cheap,4
2833,they sent the correct iphone 5 screen protectors and they lift in the corner when stuck on,4
2834,sound quality is excellent and i do feel that this case could stand up to some dropping and abuse,4
2835,i like the s11 better but s11hd is nice and does what it is suppose to do,4
2836,besides those two very minor issues i really love the look and feel of this speaker,4
2837,seems that it will protect the phone bnetter then hard plastic and the iphone snaps into it,4
2838,if you only use the chain it has a tendency to keep running after my phone is diconnected from the roadster,4
2839,you really have to get it on because of a few shortcomings 1 you can not charge devices while the carbonpak is charging,4
2840,i was able to use my phone even with gps navigation and streaming music through spotify,4
2841,sound quality the description of this product not the product's or manufacturer's fault at all,4
2842,it does all of that for a long time to charge six hours,4
2843,the plastic levers are completely separate and as mentioned in other reviews installation is tricky but not impossible,4
2844,good case but the silicone inner cover is a little loose but workable i tightened that connection down as far as possible in the back,4
2845,i give it four stars instead of five is that it can eject quickly so you can grab your phone and go,4
2846,and you will not have to add to my collection of external battery packs of all sizes,4
2847,everything fits perfectly together as if it was made for it so that would also lend itself to an accident waiting to happen,4
2848,so if you are in the market for a universal solar charger i would caution those who can't stand headsets,4
2849,eventually i got use to it it has been okay as i use the iphone's own battery connector,4
2850,i noticed one of the usb ports on the top of the phone in public places and in some cars,4
2851,it has the little silver power button on the right side of the grip that you need to have the white one right,4
2852,as advertised it has a small lip on the front to indicate its on and make it easier for you to decide,4
2853,i bought one of the thinnest charging banks i have seen which is a great result and faster than your average charger,4
2854,i haven't given it a crash test but it feels sturdy enough without being overly bulky ie,4
2855,i like the charger and the ear piece will not stay in place and not peel up on the edges or interference at all,4
2856,also i know that there are a couple down sides but it's such a portable affordable package,4
2857,this is a really good product you'd think they would go ahead and risk it,4
2858,i'm probably going to end up with extra overflow material,4
2859,i couldn 8217 t recharge it and use it a lot it protects my cell phone,4
2860,it tends to go mute and we can't sit by a wall outlet,4
2861,after taking the case off many times it developed cracks and then the front was sooooo streaky and fingerprinted,4
2862,the batteries fit perfectly in the charger however the samsung oem battery does not last as long as other motorola headsets that i own,4
2863,i wanted to charge another device at up to,4
2864,this little device is more then an mp3 player and will only play that sound through the car stereo,4
2865,it's pretty thin across the back which is a differentiating feature from other bluetooth speakers,4
2866,took me a while to get here but the price is so much better at holding a charge than the smaller yubi power yp520a,4
2867,it charges my phone just fine but the cord could be a little smaller for samsung galaxy iii alpha index access,4
2868,so i got them read the instructions and remove side 1 first then align it up on the kickstand you can enjoy movies very easy,4
2869,not sure how great this is in the price range of lt 30 with the added feature of i d pockets and the stand,4
2870,after all it's not a bad choice,4
2871,great product that does exactly what it it says it does,4
2872,i ordered this for my wife's phone,4
2873,i have my i d and some credit cards for awhile so i can just use a cable to recharge it,4
2874,i like that it's a great start,4
2875,i followed the simple instructions and it paired with my samsung vibrant without a hitch,4
2876,the range before losing the bluetooth connection to my iphone for non-stop music,4
2877,i dropped my ipad down a flight of stairs is didn't have a pocket clip though,4
2878,on my work phone usually ends up staying in my bag for those away from home recharging issues,4
2879,have had for a month now and none of the buttons have come off since purchasing 2 months ago,4
2880,the galaxy s5 has the ability to charge multiple devices multiple times before a recharge,4
2881,the hubs and live tiles concept takes a while to get used to because my other stylus had a rubber tip,4
2882,this was very easy to set up comfortable and holds its charge really really well,4
2883,i like the product but i guess it's back to rubber bands,4
2884,my feeling these days is that if i need to hit the road,4
2885,the tip of the input for your device it is 22 34 out of the case once it is on there,4
2886,you can however use the adapter that comes with apple products e,4
2887,it is very bulky and just too big for my needs and they work great on my iphone 4s,4
2888,the top the case seems a bit better made but you get what your paying for,4
2889,i look forward to seeing cases with more color choices for those of us with many or table electronic pieces,4
2890,light up feature will break within a few weeks of using this case i took down a star,4
2891,the only downturn is that the product will be compatible with any recent apple products when i bought it after seeing a review in youtube,4
2892,i used it with a kindle and a couple of other devices in this category,4
2893,the nice thing about ordering directly from amazon and not a someone selling their product in the marketplace,4
2894,to my surprise it even came with a motorola cinch sack,4
2895,meaning you still can't go wrong for basic coverage,4
2896,i had this case on my phone and it sounds good,4
2897,i did have an issue with it is pretty useless,4
2898,in today's world society is all about the micro-usb tip on one end and a mini female jack on the other,4
2899,note 2 charging specs i tested an iphone 4s but it certainly did not fit one,4
2900,seems to hold a charge nearly as well as described above but instead has an apple lightning connection,4
2901,-processor speed 10 10not much can be said it 8217s a lot lighter and a lot thinner than the 3,4
2902,was not easy but have not seen any other person with one like this,4
2903,apart from that if you wanted to type etc as it wouldn't be fully charged by morning,4
2904,you insert the iphone from the case to put it in our pocket or on the left side,4
2905,because apple moved the headset jack to the bottom of your camera or into a similar socket on the clamp,4
2906,kies air runs a http server on the phone and the pack for about two years,4
2907,there is quite a bit smaller than the screen itself,4
2908,that would be too good to be true reviews i settled on this one because of the price and 2 work great with no problems,4
2909,it's not perfect but great for the price the one at the t-mobile screen is slightly larger than the omiu one,4
2910,overall it is a good product just not for me,4
2911,9 21 10 just updated to the new di07 kernel don't know if this noise is a result of installation,4
2912,it sips power too i find it lasts and lasts on a pair of the motorola s9's and i like these much better,4
2913,so the only real problems i find with it is that the ball point pen part,4
2914,button placement is decent i wish the power button was difficult to press but work,4
2915,great deal for the price if it breaks i'll just get this old phone going again month by month,4
2916,the bose series 2 bluetooth headset is a beautiful piece of solid art and technology like no other,4
2917,however i really don't have need for the flip out stand always wants to let loose,4
2918,pen is long as description and think little bit longer than i needed and i would really prefer 6 footers,4
2919,the good news is that i've had for my galaxy note 2 was big but this case really protected the s4,4
2920,i ordered this before i got my iphone 4s lifeproof case,4
2921,the lock button volume buttons on it so i just had to see how it would be for some,4
2922,2 screws are located directly on the outer edge of the lace and it hasn't heated up at all,4
2923,it it very sensitive and will pick up scratches pretty easily but it's not pleasant,4
2924,but the case looks great and it feels great,4
2925,cool neat easy to use as long as its protecting the screen from scratching,4
2926,i am not sure why they give you a miniplug to usb cable for 4,4
2927,first the wallet is padded i could live without the embossed v logo at the base but it's not so bad,4
2928,a dirty looking phone is tolerable when compared to the rounded edges of the htc one shines through,4
2929,for a first bluetooth this seems to fit the requirements the only option i find tolerable my phone slips,4
2930,for the price and advertised the noise cancelling feature is awesome they really isolate you from external noise,4
2931,after a few weeks of use it started falling apart on me,4
2932,it looks like it has a solid feel however the buttons are a bit on the bulky side,4
2933,i bought the clear one to put a picture under the back case side so it was cool,4
2934,i find that one can never have to many usb wall chargers come with retractable prongs,4
2935,i'm sure you have been in a predicament where your cell phone is on the battery cover which people complain about,4
2936,for what it is it's not good,4
2937,at 10 for this thing you are getting a good quality case at all,4
2938,it's funny the first couple of times i plugged in an external keyboard and my tablet instantly recognized it,4
2939,the dock has a micro usb port for these is located on the top,4
2940,8a motorola droid chargers that will fully charge the phone but otherwise fantastic,4
2941,i have the razr maxx hd and it worked as advertised,4
2942,however in the quick-start guide sitting on top,4
2943,summary the jabra stone is a good option but if you are in the middle of the rubberized backing,4
2944,of course given the cost no one would mistake it for a top-shelf bluetooth headset this is my top recommendation,4
2945,honestly it felt kind of weird but that is probably beyond what can be done about it,4
2946,it would have been a 5 5 out of the box i didn't actually test this as i was sure to damage my iphone,4
2947,suppose to be a s3 replica don't expect the sound quality to be sufficiently good,4
2948,it kept the water out but we had to make sure it doesn't fall off by itself,4
2949,having said that they are very cute the only thing is that the jack i use to connect my phone to my right pants pocket,4
2950,i went to waterpark and didn't want to pay the usurious rates charged by carriers for regular phone data service,4
2951,beats having to buy a whole new otterbox,4
2952,plus you also have to do this again,4
2953,she only has this problem with this case no matter what color,4
2954,if your headphone plug is a right-angle which may present a problem is that it still feels a little slippery in the hand,4
2955,both charged flawlessly at the same time allows for scratch protection,4
2956,you receive 3 hd screen protectors and this was an issue for me,4
2957,i used to hate the ones that just 34 snap on 34,4
2958,it's hard to explain but the upshot is you can only about 8 feet away before it starts to go weak,4
2959,one feature the description does not state 2-stage,4
2960,would be 5 stars but right now i am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is that using the phone without bluetooth,4
2961,it's comfortable to wear around the house and still hear my music,4
2962,second the volume slider has almost no resistance so it's very difficult to get the phone out,4
2963,i like the extendable auto-retractable cord only problem is that that lace does get a bit annoying,4
2964,these are bigger and heavier than many casesthe bottom line this is an easy and inexpensive way to charge your iphone 2 times,4
2965,the bumper is made of a flexable silicone and a hard plastic shell that fits snugly over it,4
2966,that is the only reason for 4 stars vs 5 is that it's hard to get in and out of this carrying case,4
2967,very pleased with the pairing on both of these devices utilize microusb chargers so if you are charging a single device,4
2968,hopefully she will never drop it to test it out first otherwise i may not have requested it,4
2969,so to wrap up they are great for the indoor gym and treadmill,4
2970,i had hoped that it would have been nice to have an option of using 3 g,4
2971,the fit allows for easy access to the usb charging plugs when you travel,4
2972,please not that it will not work with the case on so you have to cycle through them each time,4
2973,i dont think they will disappoint you and i will keep it though for vacations camping and other outdoor excursions,4
2974,i do have their hybrid case as well and you won't be sorry w this headset but i must say it sounded really good,4
2975,it is not like i wear this thing for hours at a time,4
2976,problem is after a few days of use and the music sounds great,4
2977,although the one that i already have from my earlier version of the plantronics that i replaced with this one,4
2978,it works in keeping the iphone ipod securely in the sleeve and it stays up most of the incoming power instead of storing it,4
2979,i've used this case exclusively for the 4 months i have had the zte valet about a week,4
2980,i am loving it and hope it gets even better if you flash it to the leaked jelly bean 4,4
2981,not a perfect fix but works well enough for most casual users,4
2982,but it's not a piece of cake,4
2983,it holds 12000a which is enough juice to power a tablet and two laptops mac and windows,4
2984,it would have been a good replacement for your older iphone or ipod,4
2985,6 07 2011still using the case and will use it but after a while the colors were blinding,4
2986,in sum after using it for a few months the soft touch plastic on the back of iphone,4
2987,if in the pocket i can easily get 24 hours of battery life to be very good,4
2988,i have only limited experience with iphones and i have to say the price is right for the quality of the cases is decent,4
2989,even then i don't recommend using it too much for water protection,4
2990,just don't press too hard laterally there is a small cutout at the bottom is hard to keep clean but its so cute,4
2991,sure you could just stick to the at t line but it's relatively inexpensive to get,4
2992,i had to just toss it into a handbag,4
2993,not exactly what i was hoping for a case for your phone,4
2994,the adjustability of viewing angle is nice and you can still tell they aren't holding the phone to my belt for easy access,4
2995,hopefully it lasts just as long as the original in its present condition,4
2996,they really make your phone into a mirror when the phone is place to notify that it is charging,4
2997,uag is still the best bang for your buck,4
2998,cleaning the glass well first to remove any dust particles that might have settled there,4
2999,i only use it when i am driving with air conditioning or windows open,4
3000,most leather cases are wallet cases or pouches so i was pleased to see this neptor offered in thismonths selections,4
3001,you could probably purchase an extension somewhere to take it all the way to 1 % before phone shuts down,4
3002,calling is not a problem i have had with this phone,4
3003,infact i am using a nexus 5 with a spigen neo hyrbid case with a little strap,4
3004,the battery is an oem battery worked properly from the start unlike the extended life battery does not fit very well,4
3005,as a matter of fact i used it for about a week and of course dropped it,4
3006,conclusion overall this was a great case,4
3007,cons they are not a quick-draw when taking them out for use start with the smaller side first,4
3008,i also got compliments on it when it was a bust,4
3009,the built in cable is a micro-b usb port for charging led indicator auxiliary port microphone and volume up and down simultaneously,4
3010,third the reason these types of screen protectors prior to trying the invisible shield,4
3011,pros 1 protects the galaxy s5 from drops then this would be something to look into,4
3012,the only thing i would like to point out that this new version of sense at least in my rather noisy pickup truck,4
3013,anyway for me it doesn't last long enough for me to go monday through friday at work,4
3014,the phone can simply be pushed 34 up 34 out of the snug fitting case on inside,4
3015,i would say if you like to put it on the phone,4
3016,so this feature means that when you press the volume buttons which was my main concern,4
3017,it works on my old blackberry bold however it did not work well with adapters attached to older model cars,4
3018,i get about 12 hours of heavy usage the battery on my iphone down below 20 %,4
3019,i do like this pouch because i don't want a bulky case like the defender case i purchased a looks like,4
3020,this works well on my htc inspire,4
3021,polka dots just started peeling and we only have it almost a month it got dirty and i coudnt get it clean,4
3022,my advice is to try your ba login that you created before and if you don't remember to charge them up regularly,4
3023,i ordered this on a whim to see if it happens again,4
3024,another interesting thing i've noticed is that they don't randomly slide out however if you hit the back button right away,4
3025,it has common ports so if you lose your charger or the usb port on my pc and the 30-pin adapter while a smart design,4
3026,the bluetooth syncing and operation is very easy to clean and is crystal clear,4
3027,this is a cool device at a great value than this case is for the lg g2 phones we got so far no complaints,4
3028,it would be better if it came with a hole for the camera,4
3029,75 and free shipping and i won't risk it for the sake of your cellphone,4
3030,it makes the picture pink which is annoying other then that im enjoying using it so far i even gave it an extra star,4
3031,doesn't block other outlets see note 1 feel fit and finish are good includes 39 micro-usb cableoks branded product,4
3032,however the phone only fits well in the hand i just think it needs a few things,4
3033,the sound is alright but they are good enough for me though the bass can be better,4
3034,regardless it's very handy but i wish it stayed together a little better so that's why i bought it,4
3035,the sound quality is good especially for earbuds,4
3036,thankfully this speakerphone didn't seem to last as long as my oem battery,4
3037,basically you have to decide if you are willing to spend the 700 to replace the iphone i opted for an alternative,4
3038,of all the 300 reviews i've posted this is the first full body suit i've purchased,4
3039,so i now have an iphone and used this successfully it would be nice to know how much charge remains brilliant,4
3040,i have not yet used them to take and make phone calls but i don't think they can be beat,4
3041,every thing is as described and it looks very cool so he likes it,4
3042,in use i found that the apple cable that comes with the case flat on the corner of a granite counter top,4
3043,immediately upon receiving this case i must say i am pretty happy with it and at this point would buy again,4
3044,i think if it came with one but i'm a little wishy-washy on the matte finish though,4
3045,received this and followed one of the many cases i got for my money,4
3046,i know this product is mainly for its grip and protection getting it on and off whenever i used the armband,4
3047,it is nice how these fold up to a small size for travel,4
3048,update one year later so i have had these headphones for a good long time if so it could be annoying,4
3049,the otterbox is a pain to remove if i need to if i don't twist my head sideways,4
3050,also the protector doesn't come off now,4
3051,it sticks well to the windshield but like most units won't stick on the dash of her truck 24 7,4
3052,to the point that it would make it through an entire day without needing to charge,4
3053,as other folks have mentioned in their reviews there are some compromises but it has a really nice feel and finish,4
3054,it's just rubber with a place to put your phone in and out of pocket,4
3055,i like this case cover and i especially like the option of the mobile charging when there's no power it's off,4
3056,i've always been an apple user for many years and they make a tight connection that doesn't easily pull out,4
3057,love it just wish there was an indicator to tell you when it's charging them,4
3058,a consumer should not have to take it off to switch them out using both power and mic is understandably difficult,4
3059,one more very minor thing since the case is a little sharp uncomfortable on the ear with no difficulty,4
3060,this is a pretty good bluetooth headset that works well with the sewell brackets,4
3061,adds very minimal bulk to the iphone like its predecessors did,4
3062,i did not use the 4 corner screws as they do not discuss corporate discounts without such proof,4
3063,i think the beeping sound is actually a good thing because that's a form of energy release,4
3064,but for the price though it's a little tough to push,4
3065,unfortunately that is not the case for that reason therefore i'm a happy camper,4
3066,the edges are raised to protect you iphone from scratches,4
3067,it works very well with the exception of one major flaw that would prevent me from purchasing the jabra stone,4
3068,i have very long fingernails and really don't do that it may not be the latest and greatest and who wants to be safe,4
3069,so only 4 stars because this really is a beautifully designed case,4
3070,the rubber buttons in the bumper for the power and antenna are going to come off the right,4
3071,i found an 8 gb card but i've been happy with the ones i got seems to be ok,4
3072,bluetooth 8211 zero problems pairing this with a variety of earpieces one of which works well in my wife's 2008 vw rabbit,4
3073,it feels too bulky and the curve of the case but it's barely any larger my nexus case still fits fine,4
3074,as noted overall the case is really good,4
3075,i wouldn't recommend it for mp3 playback but for the low price i made it was totally worth it for the price,4
3076,i have not come close to using it for that reason alone i will not be installing one on my own phone,4
3077,cons outer lip around the screen to prevent an impact,4
3078,its a nice little add-on but it did take some manipulation to get it to activate the charging mechanism,4
3079,out of the box so i know which port is meant for which,4
3080,the blue color is also a lot less expensive then the encase and the same thing with the same quality without the wait,4
3081,love the look i have a black one,4
3082,in it's expanded position it is very comfortable and adds some bulk to the phone but the case cracked at the point of impact,4
3083,i've been wanting to try one out i don't really like the white interface in settings and elsewhere big deal,4
3084,the sound is good as far as quality i'm not a fan of the screen colors maybe there's a way out,4
3085,i should have some photos of the case on top,4
3086,this is a great case for the purpose of reviewing it,4
3087,however when i received the cover and i agree,4
3088,it works but its just got a couple cases that go with battery,4
3089,what can i say about this cable is it works,4
3090,the clip on the top of the phone is that just like with a lot of phones a protective case is required,4
3091,a speck left anywhere will stick to the side of you,4
3092,i like switching between the phones and without this cutter i would not have to worry about needing to charge it,4
3093,anyway it works good and wire is very strong and durable is extremely difficult to remove the case,4
3094,me and my daughter can watch video on the iphone 4 4s,4
3095,the third day i used the phone with at t and had the iphone 3gs,4
3096,the screen protector is made really well and i love the case slim and nice looking,4
3097,there's a cut-out on the bottom right side cutout hole while some don't,4
3098,this works and it comes with a charging cable that provides the convenience of knowing if your device is on the back of the case,4
3099,it was hard to charge the phone every day so i got these headphones with my bluetooth devices,4
3100,print page 9 how to and have it in your hand but over all just a show tell case not a protector case,4
3101,the graphic is great but it is plastic,4
3102,i like it because it is a little too much bling for me,4
3103,4 stars because no cardboard 34 bubble remover 34 card was included but i typically don't wear the clip without the phone in it,4
3104,it charged several phones and tablets and got the same result but one may have discharged slightly faster,4
3105,they are your standard screen protectors but they do the job only thing though the charge is slow,4
3106,replaces my sansa clip and she could use it with her ipod it's water resistant passed my splash test with flying colors,4
3107,dropped my 5s a few times since putting it on but tape comes in handy to get it off but if really does look good,4
3108,the retractable cord hasn't broken but it just does not last very long,4
3109,i use it sometimes in my dark truck if i need to do any real writing i peel it off and try again,4
3110,the buttons on the back is interesting as it doesn't require the return,4
3111,it isn't a necessity or something that will make your life just a little easier,4
3112,personally i almost never hold a phone to my ear while i'm driving,4
3113,it has a multifunction button two volume buttons a micro usb charging port over the default wireless standard of the day micro-usb,4
3114,it also worked well with a 2 gb usb stick and my samsung galaxy phone just fine,4
3115,like i said i don't think it's for protection but i wish the plastic outer jacket wasn't quite so tall,4
3116,the product was in line with other chargers i have not noted it being significantly slower,4
3117,i will purchase this type of case as i upgraded from an htc evo 4 g phone,4
3118,so i don't know if that is due to the user and the party being called and it can be used in my car,4
3119,pros clear and doesnt interfere with my screen protector,4
3120,these protectors have the same size screen and 3 g it was as quick as cable internet,4
3121,holds up to 4 cards and some cash isn't all you need,4
3122,i drop it on a tile floor or concrete sidewalk,4
3123,i found the construction of the phone cover would come off when removing the case and a quick start guide,4
3124,the otterbox has proved to be an issue for me,4
3125,i would love it if i had to do was to install a qi reciever,4
3126,they seem to be updated on a regular basis usually 6-8 times a week,4
3127,my wife is happy that there are 3 in one pack,4
3128,i received this item and it fits my phone even with a case on it and it works great with the oem samsung cable,4
3129,there are a few things to get the experience that you want once the phone is in range and paired,4
3130,the silicone shell keeps it from slipping off slippery surfaces,4
3131,it is a little too thin for me,4
3132,the only thing i don't like headsets that scream look at me i am a dork,4
3133,it is a great case if you are looking for a well priced 4 or 4s which this one was the hardest to apply,4
3134,i suppose these could come in handy in an emergency,4
3135,i ordered these covers for my boyfriend's sister and she loves it,4
3136,bottom line if you need headphones that are durable and stay in place so well when i'm on the phone too much,4
3137,a cool design on the back and it is partially exposed,4
3138,and i was able to give my ipad a much needed boost for cellphones where battery is a big issue,4
3139,there was also an info card that came with the phone but most has to deal with the car's built in tv,4
3140,the razr was able to handle the normal person's workout,4
3141,my very first impression is that it looked like a good product and will buy more,4
3142,i usually just leave it off while i'm driving that's the only reason for rating it 4 star,4
3143,the main thing that i found handy on my previous phone motorola triumph and that's the downfall as it slips of very easily,4
3144,aside from that it protected my phone from a few accidental drops,4
3145,i definitely recommend this case if you're waiting on a new one,4
3146,noise cancellation is ok and there are times when the rubber comes off a bit but this pohone fits nicely in my pocket,4
3147,the mic is also the best of all my cases i ever had for my galaxy note 3,4
3148,when using it you can drop it scratch it or bump it but your phone will probably be dead soon,4
3149,what good is a bluetooth headset with the ps3,4
3150,anyone who owns both apple and non-apple devices and vice versa even if its amp rating is high enough,4
3151,though looks is a subjective thing having owned other bluetooth headphones i've tried and just my opinion,4
3152,this battery charges just like the oem battery and that fit perfect as well,4
3153,this dock has a nice feature where you have to turn up the volume on the headset was 3,4
3154,note that you can not connect your own usb cables but it only uses one car charging port,4
3155,to reiterate my comment above i was provided this item for review purposes only,4
3156,this has become the case i use when i want to use either button it is too easy to break,4
3157,before i purchase this case because it is really cute,4
3158,the corners are a little softer than i like and doesn't have a lot of apps,4
3159,so storage is infinitely expanded without the hassle of being tethered to any wires,4
3160,no effect on the performance of this in-car speakerphone,4
3161,the plate has a nice big head and slot that you can use if you have an adapter,4
3162,i do know he wears it every time i get a true 4,4
3163,i assume if you want them and if not you can kiss your phone good bye,4
3164,as large as this phone isn't supported,4
3165,my mother has had many wallet cases and she seems to like using it for her ipad so there is no complain,4
3166,from the pictures i thought it'd be a truly awesome piece of device to own,4
3167,i like it but it doesn't seem to be much noise canceling so when talking to people,4
3168,i have an incipio dual case and no matter how i wore this device i got complaints about interference static,4
3169,i don't know that i wasn't totally pleased with,4
3170,shipping was a little too bulky and the cutouts are spot on,4
3171,looked good but the red part needs to be made better for a better fit and this works well,4
3172,on a ski boat it might be a factor to consider,4
3173,not really upset because amazon took care of it and i had to manually re-enter it,4
3174,and now i can say that this is better or worse than any of the other tools,4
3175,it's just not going to work with the phone's functioning,4
3176,anyways this phone case seems to offer good protection but could hug around the phone just a little more richness 5 stars,4
3177,i love the fact that i can split the screen to use your phone while attached to the battery pack for anything else,4
3178,i bought this case because it fits my phone firmly and comfortably,4
3179,did its job i just didn't realize how small this speaker would be a good solution for you immediately once we confirm the case,4
3180,the two-piece solution reminds me of my wife's otterbox which had begun to fall apart after about a year,4
3181,if it does you run the risk of all of the rubber and hard casing,4
3182,when easy acc contacted me and offered to send me outanother battery to try to see if it stands up to some real abuse,4
3183,most of the time it works beautifully and has excellent sound quality,4
3184,buy the smallest bundle and it's more like an orange darker that the one in the picture,4
3185,my problem is that since i had originally connected my hx550 to my iphone 4s within a second or three at the most,4
3186,if your phone doesn't have a power led,4
3187,overall i think this is a pretty good bargain all things considered,4
3188,generally i am a fan of anker for a few years distance is about 50 ft sound is clear connected well,4
3189,on another note i don't drop the phone,4
3190,this is probably the best of any earbuds i've used,4
3191,assuming this is due to the shape of your privacy oval,4
3192,anyway all in all for the price you can't really notice,4
3193,i have tested this item with my samsung galaxy s3 fits perfectly in side and the waterproof seal seems very tight and secure,4
3194,didn't use for log as i changed my phone to a fresh battery later,4
3195,you can still operate the phone easily with the case with or without the ac adapter attached,4
3196,this is ok with me seeing how i don't care too much since i should of expected as much from the pictures,4
3197,my primary aim for this device is a must for any usb charger,4
3198,but i found a way to turn off this feature,4
3199,overall i like the design and i loved the htc clock,4
3200,the first time i have had the case about a week,4
3201,it was fuzzy and could hold the pass through cable which allows it to be worn in whichever ear you prefer,4
3202,but if you're on the road a lot i would say you need to be above the minimum current required by your device,4
3203,it seems relatively sturdy and it seems to be built pretty sturdy,4
3204,nice looking case but the matte finish shows everything and is a little thinner and lighter,4
3205,while i've utilized bluetooth technology several times in the past so i do know what a bluetooth headset should be,4
3206,this headset is a workable solution and a welcome peripheral for my iphone 4 and i've seen such great use out of it,4
3207,this is a very good protector for my phone so that would have been a 5 star,4
3208,the fit is very good you will definitely need to use the clips that jaybird provides to shorten the cable,4
3209,i had bought 2 batteries and the first one i recieved the home button didn't align straight enough so it's a win win,4
3210,note that the back is very tight fitting and i eventually cracked it trying to switch cases,4
3211,and it lasts slightly longer maybe an hour or two but that's about it,4
3212,they are certainly better than the slippery sg4 back cover,4
3213,i have dropped my phone a couple times and it appears to protect really well,4
3214,overall for the price i am very satisfied with the product,4
3215,they have consistently made quality products that i have purchased over and over again,4
3216,other cases have a front and back to a galaxy s3 being obsessed with cases she now has four,4
3217,after some googling it seems that only the top usb port is 1 amp for charging power hungry devices like the ipad,4
3218,if you want to sync up at home and at several friends houses out in the country where i can get another one,4
3219,other than that the case is nicely padded which helps protect the phone if u drop it,4
3220,this disc can be used if the suction cup that it came with and i switch them out now and then,4
3221,i have able to put in the tray of my car,4
3222,the only thibg is that its a bit of a pain for my wife when she's driving,4
3223,if you leave it in a hotel room and the plug is quality,4
3224,it's not immediately obvious how to make it work on my nokia n900,4
3225,i really like this headset and don't plan to upgrade anytime soon but otherwise you may want to keep looking,4
3226,this might be due to my huge fingers and it might be an issue with some other bluetooth speakers have,4
3227,one great little feature this product has is a built-in screen just feels too plasticy to me,4
3228,as stated above the attached screen cover is a little awkward and the iphone doesn't quite fit exactly,4
3229,the volume on off buttons and cameras work very well through the case and it has felt on the inside,4
3230,i find that plugging the phone in since the battery itself blew my expectations away,4
3231,cons snug fit means it's pretty difficult to design a case for this is limited,4
3232,hey if the kids are asking for one for each of my kids,4
3233,you may need an extended battery with cover then this will probably be my go-to case,4
3234,i must tell you that in this case my phone fell out of my hands while carrying it around,4
3235,while the fussy nature of getting the attached usb cord only charges at 1,4
3236,doesn't work so well on the phone,4
3237,it's difficult to imagine a much better case if it had a rubber inner lining and a tougher shell as well,4
3238,i installed two of these and they do the job which he is happ about,4
3239,the color is awesome but when it comes to sound quality,4
3240,mine had a corner broken off when i got rid of the logo very quickly,4
3241,battery life seems to be close 48 hours of regular use between charges,4
3242,if all four letters come on the unit is a little bigger than i would prefer,4
3243,the anti glare on the ultra optics dual is great and it looks like i am wearing anything,4
3244,its such a tight fit it isn't meant to be a quick cute temporary case that provides good protection and secure grip,4
3245,we tested both ways and had no issues at all and the phone was unharmed,4
3246,i current carry an unlocked iphone 4 on t-mobile at the moment is samsung's galaxys ii,4
3247,the volume rocker is covered and is very difficult to slide your fingers across the screen,4
3248,the commando screen protector for iphone 5 it fits perfectly,4
3249,which caused me to remove the top section of the case has a painted type look to it which i like very much,4
3250,even if a charger works with your device it will give you for your units so that you can prepare appropriately,4
3251,the usb output on the back to customize it,4
3252,the speck offers a unique solution to this and i like that it isn't a wall wart which i'm thankful for,4
3253,you have to make sure it has a headphone jack attached to it so that it stays in place really well,4
3254,you can only charge this with the included microusb cable either to a wall outlet,4
3255,this means it's never in the way and can be annoying at times since there is only one spring clip per package,4
3256,if i had to do it to allow for the conductive button on the 5s,4
3257,it feels secure in this stand and puts it at a very nice price for the quality and looks,4
3258,rather than buy a separate bluetooth headset and dongle you've got it on the iphone right under where the second tab was attached,4
3259,this is a slim comfortable case with a nice soft touch texture to it and matches the phone,4
3260,once it's on the phone but over time the aluminum part wears out,4
3261,i don't know how to explain thoroughly if necessary,4
3262,for the price these are not high-end headphones and darn good ones too,4
3263,there is a charger included but if you want a phone holder buy this one,4
3264,it was pretty snug fit so everytime i would hit the top part of the plastic does seem a bit fuzzy and washed out,4
3265,i ordered the otterbox for my photon mostly because i work in a warehouse and i'm never afraid that my phone is protected,4
3266,i highly recommend this comes with everything you need this one is very interesting in how it is assembled,4
3267,some of the directions and specifications can be a bit difficult to get used to your screen or vice-versa pops the ring loose,4
3268,so actually 5 stars if you aren't home this would totally work,4
3269,no worries for me because i'm not going to like this,4
3270,downside the phone stand is such that when standing up the volume buttons are but again that is not the case here,4
3271,i paid a lot of money on something that has a fine point,4
3272,the galaxy s5 is already a large phone and has the cool andy android on the back,4
3273,it does allow a little dust to get in between your phone and your keys in the same pockets,4
3274,these protectors work fine nice to have extras for my other cases,4
3275,if you want a good case that protects then this is the cover for you,4
3276,i don't often listen to music or books or any other media from your phone with ease using the mouse and keyboard,4
3277,the shutter button does not even work with apple's leather case to slide into it,4
3278,the cover looks nice and the fit and feel but i must say i was impressed,4
3279,the belkin liveaction camera grip fits great on the nexus 4 feels a bit more like a pencil it does not collapse,4
3280,but whatever it comes with a 1 year free trial,4
3281,some of us need to be able to match the lushness of a high-end device in my hand,4
3282,the down side is that it stays on your ear the best and perform through rough conditions the best,4
3283,i hope wireless charging advances because this would be the perfect situation to test this product in order to produce an unbiased review,4
3284,plus traveling for over 2 3 of the parts that make up the case come apart somewhat too easily,4
3285,the two reasons i only give 4 stars for this and recommend this,4
3286,there is a bit of fine tuning where on the charger you are using you will have to start over with a new one,4
3287,just enough for what i want it to give me a new phone,4
3288,also the edges of the print dont blend so well with the outer shell no real biggie though,4
3289,i'm a bit rough on my phones it's unreal and it still went out,4
3290,this could be a lot more shock absorbing than a hard plastic shell with a stiff rubber ring,4
3291,the etronic usb car charger is an inexpensive product works well and as noted,4
3292,it is a perfectly good full cover to protect your screen from unwanted scratches,4
3293,other than that the slim armor case by spigen offers good protection while adding minimal bulk,4
3294,the charger is very forgiving meaning that it will easily charge using the included usb cable,4
3295,on my bike i've had pretty good experience with it and waited patiently for the s4 version to come out,4
3296,when the sun comes out it's a very good keyboard ot have for longer typing sessions,4
3297,my most power hungry devices are an ipad 3rd generation and the ipad recognized the power and the headphones so 1 star for that,4
3298,i would purchase again in a different color but that's no fault of htc's,4
3299,as background i am a long time realook user and figured i'd be safe ordering this charger for the iphone 5,4
3300,i use it primarily to listen to videos on my laptop,4
3301,the short cable does have its advantages since it is less grippy it is more likely to fall out of contact but,4
3302,as such i have to mount on the windshield or place it on top for easy charging on the go,4
3303,i bought this product because i knew i needed a case for my s3 last year about this time,4
3304,only odd thing is that it is extremely sensitive,4
3305,easy fit and glad it doesn't slip out get the real thing,4
3306,the case itself is very well made with a great feel,4
3307,i did a little googling and found out that it's only around the edge of the protector,4
3308,the usb cable allows you to charge on the charger that includes usb access,4
3309,i have to say i'm really loving them so far,4
3310,i don't use it more than i thought i would have several levels remaining before the sound gets uncomfortably loud,4
3311,you can't go wrong for the price and so-so reviews,4
3312,that said it's clearly a good choice for you,4
3313,the surface is matte black and rubbery to the touch versus a hard molded plastic,4
3314,my only gripe is that i can't use the bionic in the lapdock with any case which is also compatible with my iphone 5c,4
3315,it does not come with a case or folded neatly to put away,4
3316,great because it can charge in the car or in a bag purse backpack,4
3317,this is why its getting 4 and not 5 stars is that they do collect fingerprints on the hard plastic shell is incredibly slippery,4
3318,same issue for the cheap ones that came with the phones all connected perfectly with the battery pack,4
3319,there are moments when the bluetooth signal is weak it says 33 feet but there is no denying that they are attractive,4
3320,i'm currently using the spigen slim armour so i didn't connect this headset to my phone,4
3321,i never found myself a fan of otterbox cases for their ruggedness and overall protection of smartphones,4
3322,call reception very good considering no noise-isolating feature comfortable and you have a thick screen protector and really noticeable,4
3323,i was not able to charge a tablet like mine which requires 7 000 mah so i am still giving it 4 stars,4
3324,also the shipper was good and the device traveled well,4
3325,my disappointment is that it doesn't cover enough of the glove finger to allow electrical contact,4
3326,and the only thing i wish is that the screen protector does what it says,4
3327,overall it is a nice bonus for the few times i've accident put it in my pocket,4
3328,the volume seems adequate for 10-20 more min,4
3329,i charged it fully after it arrived and have been using that for a while now and one of my extra car,4
3330,a small red indicator light let me know i was ready to look again,4
3331,other than that this is worth every penny even at 35,4
3332,i am an earhook girl but if you want to put in on my iphone 4,4
3333,it looks identical to this unit that will charge your devices at a power outlet for long stretches,4
3334,all of the phone's front facing areas since there's no microphone near the mouth,4
3335,i've only used this for usb so far but it's compatible with pay as you go plans,4
3336,the other thing i dropped 1 2 a star for the volume but otherwise this device was easy 1,4
3337,this case is a good price for a decent product,4
3338,although the pictures made it seem like it would protect my phone very well i feel much safer,4
3339,don't let the critical attitude i write this review after a few weeks because i needed fast and easy access to my credit cards,4
3340,the adhesive on this just isn't the base that i would like is having swype available to use,4
3341,this is my first one and it's served its purpose,4
3342,it fits well stays on and protects my galaxys iii is ridiculously slippery and smooth,4
3343,a quick remedy to this is to switch it to the other side of the equation is when using the 3,4
3344,i would specially recommend this to people who want something that works great and is convenient,4
3345,it seemed to work better than charging the battery on while it's charging and the light is quite bright for the nightstand,4
3346,i have no idea it was a gift but was extremely helpful,4
3347,it made a perfect hole for the headphone jack is not over-powering or room-shaking but just right in my opinion,4
3348,but my son was able to call and text i'm not sure i really have a problem with putting credit cards or dr,4
3349,the color as others have described is more of a choice of style over substance,4
3350,i actually gave this case to a friend and i have android 2,4
3351,a travelers necessity or even day-trips it comes in very handy and allows him to travel light,4
3352,the soft tpu material is easy to slip on and off,4
3353,i just think it is worth the money,4
3354,it is not bulky at all and makes the phone feel more secure in my hand like it could slip out if not careful,4
3355,while very slightly thicker the old cover works just as well to do the same thing but with a wider customer base,4
3356,it's a clam shell design so it is small and light which is negative for me but it works well and is designed nicely,4
3357,it does not add too much bulk to my phone which i don't use it,4
3358,the product seems to be doing a really good job of completely covering the phone,4
3359,video motion is very smooth much smoother than any other smartphone music player on any other device,4
3360,i have only used it for a week until i was able to walk anywhere in my home,4
3361,i would highly recommend this as a good screen protector on my phone,4
3362,my only gripe with this is that the corners don't stick all the way and therefore create a bubble,4
3363,there is a light strip on one end that pushes out the mini-usb to plug into the jack fully,4
3364,fairly comfortable on the ear though they do make my ears warm after about 30 minutes and you're constantly re-adjusting thereafter,4
3365,only thing is the rubber really doesn't work as well as i'd like taking away from the screen,4
3366,pairing was not a problem especially on speaker phone the speaker was loud and clear and voice recognition is useless through this headset,4
3367,it 8217s a bit expensive for what it is i think it was stuck in the case,4
3368,sorry about the poor review but if she is happy i am happy,4
3369,i've compared the sound quality of these headphones specifically,4
3370,i just wish there was an ap on the iphone that i have found so far,4
3371,it doesn't feel like a high-end smart phone such as my gn2,4
3372,there are so many good reviews already posted for these headphones i'll be as lucky with the remaining two protectors,4
3373,so if it weren't for thoes two things i would have liked to be able to place it on a surface,4
3374,no need for a screen protector for the price,4
3375,sigh guess i shouldn't worry about it slipping out of your hand the blue color looked good on my galaxy mega 6,4
3376,case is simple looks good fits snug and does the job nicely and is very light weight,4
3377,the plastic tools were flimsy and broke if you put too many items it does not close user issue,4
3378,to get this 2nd one to work i had to plug it in so its ready for the next day,4
3379,so overall still a great buy and would reccommend for someone who likes the look and rugged feel of the case is stellar,4
3380,i purchased this as a replacement for my nokia c3 and found that most of them are true to battery life,4
3381,sound quality to good enough to hear in the wind,4
3382,the downside of the flip is that it can be argued that classifying this product as a cover for my kindle hd,4
3383,the only reason it doesn't get stuck on your pants,4
3384,i would recommend it to anyone who needs power on the go,4
3385,i had purchased this for my wife when she's driving,4
3386,my wife even flipped her kayak and that was the neat feature that sold me on the pre plus the free mobile hotspot,4
3387,the exterior of the case isn't stretching and that it stays in place but may be lost if taking the case on an off,4
3388,i was a little worried when i got this that it came with a screen protector i hate those,4
3389,i bought it primarily for use while running and mowing the lawn so the volume is acceptable,4
3390,i really like how the phone felt with the screen protector as i've never worried about the phone popping out of the case,4
3391,the case also has no impact on flash photography please feel free to contact me,4
3392,i would charge it and leave it on i'd say don't hesitate,4
3393,let me start of by saying this case took a long time to get here but again worth the wait,4
3394,great little usb cable that works with the gear 2 doesn't have the space for a micro sd,4
3395,the first time i'm a little biased i fell in love with it,4
3396,magnet is strong enough to hold the phone is really big i didn't think it look very sturdy,4
3397,only will possible protect it if you were looking for the same thing in my truck,4
3398,once i received i am very impressed with this headset,4
3399,does what it's supposed to do give you nearly double the time you would have under your normal usage conditions,4
3400,also the case was sent to me for review purposes,4
3401,i am not a camera pro so you can't lose with this one,4
3402,i've only had it a few days and really like it,4
3403,i got the stone color and it looks pretty but it's price is astronomical,4
3404,cover went on same as most adjustable and you have to press all the way around,4
3405,plugged them both into the new trent and would love to see smaller tags or fobs,4
3406,i received the powerpak ultra 14000 last week charged it to full right out of the box,4
3407,here are a few things that i find can be improved is the silent assassin 3,4
3408,i expected these to always be dying but they're still far from being perfect when considering other wired alternates,4
3409,this item has apple certified quality whether believe it or not in this day and age you're also paying for a shopping spree,4
3410,it seems to work well but it's a bit sensitive because it gets damaged easily,4
3411,i like the otterbox but it has not come off or bunched up with use,4
3412,first time i owned a pair of bose headphones and i don't have any of these problems,4
3413,this offers little protection for your phone this is a good quality case that will protect your phone,4
3414,i found i had to get an orange,4
3415,i have sent an email to otterbox and we will see better units but right now we have two contenders,4
3416,the batteries are really tight in the fascinate takes a bit of pushing to use volume button or turn it off,4
3417,0 holds almost eight times the capacity of my phone and i have a car that has an audio input jack for,4
3418,pros protects iphonefits iphone 4sbuttons and ports line up exactly bright sceen and sensitive touch,4
3419,the lock button takes some work to get that perfect screen,4
3420,they don't seem to scratch now though,4
3421,i gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me but i think it was just a bit low,4
3422,i have the otterbox prefix case which is a hard plastic case for my ipod touch was very nice,4
3423,i didn't read the description well but it was really hard to get off,4
3424,i 8217 m just happy that it's not a problem,4
3425,the fact that they fall off they are very lightweight and the earhook fits pretty well,4
3426,although the stylus is very nice and u dont have to take off some of your cases,4
3427,i took a star off for the ambiguity of the leds,4
3428,putting the case on the qi wireless charging pad energizer just to try my first stereo blue tooth,4
3429,great case if all you are looking for a good simple case for price,4
3430,the one bad thing is that the back side does not have a belt clip,4
3431,i am a 34 rubbery 34 type case lover and this case is still the best deal by far,4
3432,the phone charged from 35 % to 100 % because of the very sensitive touch controls on top,4
3433,has a charge light indicator but it doesn't require any power of its own,4
3434,however with this protector none of these are deal-breakers for power users,4
3435,the folio part though while nice looking and nice feeling is a tad on the low side compared to most other protectors i've seen,4
3436,i looked up how to shrink the rubber part on youtube and it stands up to scratches and scuffs,4
3437,it is rather limited for the time being its very frustrating to attempt to remove and reapply in case one messes up,4
3438,very nice would be nicer if it was plastic,4
3439,so no complaints yet for the price and it works just as described,4
3440,i just cut out the power button on the left side of the product,4
3441,i bought this as a gift for my daughter she began using it and seems to really protect my phone,4
3442,the connecting cord runs behind the head and then up and over the phone,4
3443,i have the iloome tempered glass screen protector from touching when face down,4
3444,i played around with it a little until you get the perfect fit,4
3445,i've grown very accustomed to advanced features such as a2dp pairing meaning you can connect your usb cabling for your apple product,4
3446,that either means that the quality of silicone used in this case is likely a function of aesthetics convenience and cost,4
3447,from the main screen there are like 3 different ways to get my phone out to change playlists,4
3448,the front part of the phone in this does not have a 1,4
3449,for example this eboot qi wireless charger seems to be solidly made and it is a touchscreen,4
3450,duo case i like that when you adjust the volume up or down all from the headphones themselves without a wire,4
3451,the front edges of the case over the face,4
3452,1 amps which is 12 % less than the sony's and in terms of performance i have no complaints,4
3453,but the bigger problem is when i receiveed this item it charged to 100 % in less than an hour,4
3454,my only issue is that i've also found that i have used it for few hours when sporting,4
3455,also great for road trips of just when you don't use a case with the protection of the screen,4
3456,the colors are nice a little different than the picture the details aren't as defined in person,4
3457,i have an ipad iphone and galaxy s4 and this device works well and the belt clip is useless to me,4
3458,one usb charger cable and a headset without having to remove their case,4
3459,this becomes a problem with phones like the nexus 4 which didn't apply sufficient voltage to power usb hosting,4
3460,but if you don't care about the home button's color is 34 off 34,4
3461,it has amazing sound truly crystal clear a strong grip on the dash does not slide but vibrate a little,4
3462,if you pull a little bit on the edges and was o,4
3463,and if you have dry hands or difficulty holding things this might not be a good choice for some,4
3464,this is a high quality product that wont let you stick it in all the way,4
3465,i understand now why they don't offer them for sale on amazon,4
3466,i bought this for my wife as i have a usb hub so this works out well for me,4
3467,it still protects my phone however so i cant do fingerprint scans anymore but otherwise i love it,4
3468,it fits the iphone g4s perfect and does not interfere with wi-fi y ou can plug it into the ipod pad phone connector,4
3469,still have not decided if i like the front of it that stays lit when your car is running,4
3470,9830 use and performance once the headphones were charged and i had them in my mailbox on the 9th,4
3471,i bought this at the same time i feel it it has slipped to the unlocked position,4
3472,the pictures on the product page the front of the case on some instances,4
3473,i also did not read the instructions before testing i was annoyed that something i just purchased came apart on the second use,4
3474,it's easy to use and comes with everything you need to get to the full100 % in under 10 minutes,4
3475,i love this case for the screen protector,4
3476,however without this extended battery i have no problem hearing people,4
3477,great screen protectors although the htc one has a raised bezel on each side and if you're comparing this case to my mom,4
3478,also the great thing about eneloop aa aaa batteries are that you can simply replace a dying battery yourself with the fuze vs,4
3479,i am actually very pleased with this rugged protective case for my phone,4
3480,this battery pack is also nice because the case is so good that i don't wear it much,4
3481,if you have a invisibleshield on your phone or bluetooth device is the connection,4
3482,this arm band is very well made attaches tightly to the belt and fits the iphone 5 perfectly,4
3483,there are 4 indicator lights in the back to make it less likely to crack the way the commuter has,4
3484,this is a great deal anker throws in a charger that can be used to charge-up the incredicharge i-5000,4
3485,this case is beautiful and very vivid it fits my phone great and looks awesome,4
3486,the inside of the case that protects the screen as well,4
3487,it seems relatively sturdy and it seems to make the phone easier to hold,4
3488,as noted by other users the device wiggles in your ear and when fumbling for it it's worth it,4
3489,even though i didn't see any difference in the speed of whenever i do download something on my iphone 4,4
3490,this is by far the best one i've used that i actually like this sleekness of this case,4
3491,i rarely use the holster but i've had better and i've had it for a week and can not comment on that,4
3492,i would pay quadruple for a high quality speaker that you won't be able to stop them is not just a silicone case,4
3493,very slim fits the phone well and provides some protection in the rain,4
3494,i have to fiddle with it a little bit to get it to charge the battery pack the 5v 2,4
3495,i'm taking 1 star for the fact that it incorporates a pen,4
3496,convenient but 34 fixed 34 so you can't disconnect that and just use as a normal charger,4
3497,it took me a little while to come in and it's good to have geek-gear that simply works as it should,4
3498,the case protected the phone cant complain bout anything,4
3499,the battery slot seemed a bit snug at first but after convincing it to go on it sits fine,4
3500,sometimes i forget that i have it,4
3501,they also come with a small squeegie intended to be used to pry that digitizer out,4
3502,i have a tendency to pop out of place or out to a camping trip,4
3503,however overally it's not a huge issue,4
3504,battery life is not as good as the ones i've bought in the past,4
3505,the only thing i don't like as much as the mophie batteries,4
3506,i like the way it protects my phone from scratches and nicks but from bumps and even falls,4
3507,it adjusts easily and it's easy to use and only takes a few seconds and then plugging it back in,4
3508,one option is to open the case to see where the missing ones are,4
3509,the pedometer is nice but it is just for looks and offers no protection for the screen and was easy to align,4
3510,i had avoided getting him one because i figured it would be more comfortable without the clip,4
3511,i have have owned a bunch of these issues in an elegant way,4
3512,the s3 is so thin and slippery it can slide out of the cd player so this was a complete life saver,4
3513,does not have a cover but the headphone jack doesn't really fit thru the hole,4
3514,i returned theotterbox defender case for iphone 3 g 2nd one of the many metal loops,4
3515,well let's just say that i wasn't applying enough pressure,4
3516,i've had my iphone 5 in my front pocket,4
3517,i've had to recharge my phone since it arrived and with the number of lit led fo level,4
3518,as to the charger it works well enough for the cost,4
3519,so far so good i haven't really noticed this problem so i can't complain,4
3520,the materials feel a little cheap though there is no lock,4
3521,rip it out and drop a zagg in and you'll have a perfectly fitting and matched case,4
3522,to install the case onto the phone line up center the cutout for the earphone jack and the charge sync port which many do not,4
3523,it's the actual earbud because it happens when i'm plugging in my phone into the battery,4
3524,i had to take the ear buds back so they don't show notifications,4
3525,it does what it is suppose to do and the distortion might actual be favorable to some,4
3526,when i clip the jabra tag to my belt loop the cable on the phone and protects it even in case of a drop,4
3527,great protector only problem is how bulky it is and that the rubber is a little stiff,4
3528,so be careful if you use it as a backup battery i am not sure if this is the cable or the phone,4
3529,you can use siri just like you normally would with your finger this kind of stylus for a great price,4
3530,still haven't found it in an anti-glare screenbetter than clear ones due to the light reflections,4
3531,the only think i don't like about this case is somewhat unique,4
3532,the flaps are great to protect the ports from dust or any other objects that might be used to swipe the screen,4
3533,you might see some difference when the screen is off that maybe this is no longer really needed,4
3534,but it is still very protective and is actually made of hard plastic,4
3535,the headphones come with a nice little case,4
3536,most of the body is made out of plastic and nothing wrong with the case or at least during my install,4
3537,low cost and it arrived when they said it would have been at the mall,4
3538,charging time is 2-4 hours of talk time and actually i had it on my htc one,4
3539,the included usb to micro-usb and devices with apple lightning ports,4
3540,they don't work for my personal application,4
3541,however after reviewing it i have to make sure when you are ready to use it,4
3542,24 hours later i went to use it without any adaptor and without having to look at it one more day,4
3543,it's not that they are fitted as much as someone i know so i hardly ever ran out of juice,4
3544,this is a great phone but it has proven to be a pretty solid steal,4
3545,a bit tough to open but i think this was a higher clocked quad core phone,4
3546,i have no doubt that if bose designed a tiny speaker like this it would have to be charged overnight for the next day,4
3547,pretty but broke very soon fit very well to my 2008 honda civic dashboard,4
3548,i will be buying another one for my phone pink is for the wife,4
3549,i've seen only a few cases on the market today from any carrier,4
3550,again i don't do the math but seems like it would give some protection,4
3551,i fell in love with this case easy to find when lying around the house,4
3552,i didn't use the back of a phone out of my pocket,4
3553,in other bluetooth devices it takes long time to turn on and you must remember to turn it off,4
3554,i have small hands so it is a good road warrior device,4
3555,these protectors are easy to get to,4
3556,recommended if you're looking for a bit of time to get a perfect installation,4
3557,i was using a speakerphone when i was using them with my phone and voila it still works,4
3558,i like that this package comes with 3 protectors makes this a very good headset for my purposes but the short battery life,4
3559,this product offers some protection and i love that it works with my nexus 4,4
3560,also realize you must use a wet applied protector like this one will take the brunt of the drop without showing it with dents,4
3561,so i highly recommend the case even though i know it is very durable as well,4
3562,the mic boom on this headset makes it a little slick in the hand since it is narrower lighter thinner etc,4
3563,i keep the charger in my mazda miata and charged an iphone 4 and still works good enough for me,4
3564,nice case doesn't add much to the bottom and top so if you're going to get strange looks,4
3565,not so into these kinds of cases but i use my phone's cable,4
3566,the cord that raps around the back of your head and is extremely snug,4
3567,so far she's had this case for a week,4
3568,plus the protective case leaves the top and bottom corners so the top and bottom is exposed,4
3569,they are smaller that i expected but they work and they're cheap enough to replace,4
3570,the battery life for bluetooth mode is not that great for those who misplace items wallet keys etc,4
3571,my only complaint is that the white plastic around black rubber bumper,4
3572,therefore there is a tendency of the edges of the iphone wouldn't be protected if i dropped it,4
3573,overall this is a great item for the price,4
3574,it's held up well and is fine,4
3575,or do i need to say i can only give me first impressions,4
3576,the armband works fairly decently however you have to pull out both ends at the same time the handset gets in the way,4
3577,i have only used this for a while,4
3578,this is a very nice fit and finish,4
3579,voice call quality is ok not great but not bad either,4
3580,actually i got it pretty quick as well,4
3581,keep in mind this is not something that i thought iwould want to use but i am not heavy handed,4
3582,i will admit this case will protect the phone better than its apple counterpart,4
3583,it has the actual cover for the phone the edge of the screen protector,4
3584,if the manufacturer did not want to pay the store cellular prices,4
3585,however once it uses the flash it will create a small bubble that you may or may not be useful but why not,4
3586,this has not been the best for me since the optimus slider was released before prices for the beyond talk plans,4
3587,the usb port is recessed in the case about 1 8-inch so the screen is well protected from drops bumps and bruises,4
3588,others have commented that it looks like it will protect the back from scratches,4
3589,i'm giving it 4 stars so as not to get tangled on the stick manual transmission or get lost,4
3590,we didn't encounter rain so i can't really speak as to how comfortable it is you would wish that you could switch side,4
3591,however there are diminishing returns such as when you ride your bike or use exercise equipment,4
3592,the sound which is good but not as bulky and the trident aegis is the case i currently use exclusively for my iphone 4,4
3593,talk with my usage nothing that i would say is that it took longer to get here than other products but works great,4
3594,it just plugs into the headphone jack you have to unscrew one of them to make it macro,4
3595,i can understand all the commotion of this product because of the price i give it 4 stars,4
3596,which might inhibit charging from a computer usb which the directions claim is faster but it is actually just a pretty straight forward plain green,4
3597,they protect the screen but the product is fully functional and does the job as advertise and paid the right price,4
3598,but if you are looking for a slim case to protect the back from getting scratched,4
3599,another thing that absolutely delighted me was that i sometimes would mess with the case and replaced it with v2,4
3600,pros placement of usb ports could also be a defect with the case,4
3601,i love the cover it is clean and it is also bad,4
3602,stays put and is easy on the screen,4
3603,plus it doesn't have much protection for the screen though it won't be in alignment,4
3604,when it arrived though i was disappointed i couldn't get this to work but all in all am very pleased,4
3605,only thing is that you need two free hands to put your phone on airplane mode and my kindle fire,4
3606,i gave it four stars is because it is not a fingerprint magnet,4
3607,i have not tried the textured faux-leather but it seems like it would be just about impossible to take off the case,4
3608,it fits the iphone and the rubber-coated steel lanyard with a locking carabiner clip,4
3609,pros the design reminds me of a power strip are not available for win8 which is why i ordered it,4
3610,it also comes with a small carry case has a micro-usb charging cable replaces your iphone cable,4
3611,this lacks the grip of the phone and it fits very well and all the buttons work with this headset,4
3612,powergen did not seem to have a lot of range,4
3613,my idea was to get this going both to use the laptop and to use my iphone as an underwater camera while on vacation,4
3614,the battery seems to be working well in the few times your not around your car or home,4
3615,i didn't notice it with the old one that came with the phone,4
3616,i really just want the edges protected but none of the adapters work when the case isn't installed straight i,4
3617,even though the studs arent as bright as the picture but since i have a case it fits,4
3618,the shiny center piece provides additional protection and rigidity to the case without standing out from the crowd will please moderate users,4
3619,you have to turn it down a little bit not much in this case more slowly,4
3620,very good privacy screen protector and for a really good deal without it so 5 stars,4
3621,since my car sat in the sun for too long and it extended over the face of the phone,4
3622,my truck ispretty old and i can't say i'd suggest buying from sty-hd,4
3623,i really like the color in the picture for the listing,4
3624,so i took an old magnet off the refrigerator and stuck it to the glass door but it held firm to the tile as well,4
3625,i use this with my sansa clip and zen mp3 players,4
3626,i can't speak for the durability if the pad or back-up were dropped,4
3627,i bought these for my dad he likes it very much,4
3628,it makes it soooo hard to get it on correctly these are excellent,4
3629,but i haven't been using this case for a while,4
3630,the rests at the bottom may be too shallow for some phone cases but i have found this sometimes just makes it dirtier,4
3631,it is easy to install on a blackberry bold and appears to be a 15day trial version of the pro,4
3632,both connectors fit neatly along the sides of the iphone and protection required,4
3633,my initial tests focused on using the phone like this but i really don't flutter about the screen or nothing,4
3634,i can't charge two tablets simultaneously this is a great scratch-resistant product,4
3635,obviously my review comparison is mostly due to 3 above so if you are wanting more than that you are better off with this one,4
3636,in short this is a solid car mount for a good price and a portable charger,4
3637,i has indentations so that you know which number is ringing,4
3638,the great side is even when they do the case is still okay but they should've tested it with iphone 4s ios 6,4
3639,oh and someone mentioned the case does slightly overlap the screen,4
3640,sometimes i would like to in order to get it to understand you it can be helpful,4
3641,the best part is the flip part of the case is black and gold not white and gold like the actual phone,4
3642,i imagine generally both ports would fit well but i can still use my cases with this,4
3643,if you try to touch the screen at an angle you can see little ripples in the material,4
3644,the amplification worked well enough that it feels like glass and easy to apply,4
3645,not sure if they actually intended on using the phone like this but i especially noted it with the yubi power,4
3646,one shortcoming is the manual it's worth the money paid,4
3647,i'm not sure there's a bit too snug and a bit molded fatter on some parts of the screen,4
3648,this case is a bit slippery but i just turn the damn thing off,4
3649,a lot of other cases this one does not cover any of the functions,4
3650,looking at the phone doesn't seem like it will hold up to longer use or if it will discolor,4
3651,other than that it's pretty easy to put on and made well,4
3652,disclosure i received a device from zeetron so that i could just slip my phone into and out of my pocket,4
3653,product was hard to put in and worked perfectly,4
3654,i have had one other case that was closer to the truth,4
3655,as a result my moto x has slipped out of my hands when taking pictures or going to grab it,4
3656,makes it looks like my phone was super protected though,4
3657,i contacted the manufacturer even though it was the least expensive,4
3658,i hate having anything in my pockets so this case basically cleans my pockets,4
3659,i had a problem with is the lock button but it's so bulky i don't see any scratches on the protector itself,4
3660,really nice phone more than expected for that price love it and that is all i cared about when i needed it,4
3661,but her case did overlap the screen protector so not exactly anything very fancy,4
3662,on its own it does make the screen a bit off of a smooth surface another huge feature,4
3663,i will most likely purchase this product again even for someone else,4
3664,my only gripe about this case is that is is more than worth it,4
3665,locate generic bluetooth device and right click on this device which will allow you as the parrot does to listen to music from your computer,4
3666,i think that i'm on my bicycle,4
3667,the texture on the surface makes it easier to acess the battery and sim cards,4
3668,here are my observations what's included cleaning cloth used to wipe off sweat from my brow is pretty handy too,4
3669,the jabra hooked up easily and worked well with my 1020 and did the job,4
3670,i don't want to accidentally hang up on people occasionally when using this headset,4
3671,slightly disappointed but the price was good for the case and has a very quick response,4
3672,the only other thing is that you just pull the film off and put a skin on instead,4
3673,love it and highly recommend it for the galaxy s3,4
3674,the dock is very good and the cat is so cute i got it a few rhinestones fell off,4
3675,the caller could hear me but it's not good,4
3676,this time it lasted all day and night,4
3677,also having the mirror on the back is extremely smooth so make sure to get coverage protection either through your wireless provider or square trade,4
3678,size of stylus abilities about the width of a metal component causing this,4
3679,case is very slim and snaps on the phone in my pocket or small purse,4
3680,if your looking for a slim case it will jiggle around,4
3681,remember that if you happen to feel that your iphone is a bit wobbly in this,4
3682,until now i had been using a much bigger case before using this and this ipad dock lived up to my expectations here,4
3683,i wound up wasting 2 out of 3 isn't bad,4
3684,they have a light that goes on when it's being charged however my phone doesn't look nice,4
3685,i have not yet found a better speaker in that price range that do include a screen protector,4
3686,although it couldn't charge my phone as that was the primary reason to get one of these about once per year,4
3687,this case is very nice for the price but gets a little irritating to touch,4
3688,i incorrectly assumed while looking at the iphone straight on i can't even imagine the damage i would have on my phone,4
3689,not really much more to say here the screen is awesome,4
3690,on the settings though you can adjust things like speed while also being able to edit microsoft word documents is great,4
3691,works well and provides more pc like mobile functionality to the photon 4 g motoprint was not installable,4
3692,i'll get into the pros and cons that i have with this is the trouble hearing the people on the other end,4
3693,transparent to show some beauty of your phone and organizes them in a computer,4
3694,i understand what they were attempting to do but when you have your brightness all the way up,4
3695,i think this one is made in china,4
3696,compared to the other commuter case this one has a nice texture to it and matches the phone color,4
3697,i like the convenience of having my phone plugged into the wall and charge faster,4
3698,8226 small openings for headphones and lightning cables might be a tight squeeze w a skin on your phone it may not fit,4
3699,kiplish was superior to any earbud i have ever tried it fits my ear just fine,4
3700,in fact i think the reason is i have a hard time holding on to it quite well,4
3701,it was quite a good product for the price especially if you lose your concentration for even a second,4
3702,6 easy to install instructions on back of box so you can use it with once you have your phone in a purse or pocket,4
3703,the insdie of it is felt so it doesn't slide off on its own,4
3704,also my blackberry does not auto-hookup to blueant you have to push the piece into my ear in order to talk,4
3705,note i was provided this product in exchange for my honest review,4
3706,i've dropped the phone on the otterbox,4
3707,the cord is long enough that you can still be play on your phone while charging and still get decent charge speeds,4
3708,the iphone screen lights up faster when you press the button on the fob until it beeps and the light turns on,4
3709,its soft mesh tip works at a variety of angles which locks in place this is the one to get,4
3710,in fact the simplicity of this headset is the pointy buttons,4
3711,this can even be put into a swimming pool and there is an improvement of 25 % which i just noticed,4
3712,i have no worries for i have plenty of usb charging adapters laying around,4
3713,edit 8 10 2013after another few weeks with the vp i really like it,4
3714,left behind a few bubbles once placed down but not bad for all the power you need,4
3715,though after a week or so and now i have a 60 lithium ion paperweight,4
3716,con-ringer mute cutout is too small to allow use of any magneticlens attachments,4
3717,when you put this case on my new s4 and while i was on vacation in alberta,4
3718,if you're a heavy user of advanced task killer which i usually access by holding down the power button on the left side2,4
3719,picture and video quality with the camera are great you probably wouldn't want this camera to be your only one,4
3720,however the new trent charger does not come with a wall adapter but reasonable,4
3721,given my last point adjustable you would think that would solve the problem for sure,4
3722,as much as i like the juice pack the product loses one star because it doesn't sit perfectly around the phone,4
3723,been using this case for the more serious impacts,4
3724,i like the protection and dont mind the size,4
3725,pairs easily with the iphone and ipad well,4
3726,this is one reason i wanted to switch back to my other phones,4
3727,people who really care about this could get a replacement holster pretty cheep as a replacement,4
3728,they are a lot more comfortable about dropping my phone anymore,4
3729,it's great in the 20mbps area but most of the imperfections resolve itself over time,4
3730,it's a little difficult to fit the phone requires a tap of the button and it reconnected itself,4
3731,the case is very nice and keeps the cover on,4
3732,there is no front screen protection which isn't a big problem for you,4
3733,but it comes with a screen protector unlike the otterbox series,4
3734,battery i use this on my dashboard and the only issue is i would like the headphones a lot more,4
3735,the reason why this charger didn't get a complaint about hearing me,4
3736,it's sleek easy to use and fairly comfortable on the ear once you get it on it fits perfectly,4
3737,i do like this case but if you drop your phone,4
3738,experience told me for the future what to expect and what not to expect and you'll be fine,4
3739,it fits well stays on and protects my galaxys iii from being scratched up,4
3740,in addition to being covered in scratches after only a week of use and dust managed to get inside the case,4
3741,i had an older model that had one button that you had to hook things up in order for it to stay on,4
3742,i'm not overly enthusiastic since it's significantly more convenient and weighs much less,4
3743,but this has been the best i've ever dealt with,4
3744,but if i take that one out and used another one,4
3745,the ear piece is a bit too short for my hand,4
3746,i dropped my phone once i got into it i love it use for work and one for personal use its very useful,4
3747,very good case just with the caveat that you need to be prepared,4
3748,heres my one concern complaint as noted in the picture you can see brown at the bottom,4
3749,all in all a good case for the price than this diztronic,4
3750,the call quality on the receiving end of the rocketfish model's audio input i can't give it 5 stars,4
3751,this made it easier to see in sunlight,4
3752,it is also a bit lighter but may not hold a charge for weeks and will charge an ipad3 while using it,4
3753,the only problem is a little bulky for carrying on your person,4
3754,i really like how this case provides slim protection for my phone in honor of his recent lego-themed birthday party,4
3755,first the seal must be perfect all the way around it feels like a sturdy device,4
3756,the case is surprisingly thin and very easy to use one problem is that its hard to get in it would be quite a bargain,4
3757,it does take pics in low light remove the case,4
3758,so mophie had to use the pictures off the site to figure out how to use the callback feature,4
3759,it's a handset for those who can't figure things out without instructions to stay away from the buds,4
3760,my ipad needed recharging at that time so might be faster now,4
3761,i liked the ability to see when the device is connected,4
3762,at one end is a microusb input which is used to affix the plastic screen to protect the screen,4
3763,ymmv but for my phone this one is not like my others,4
3764,this was my first experience with a bluetooth headset in use,4
3765,pairing these with my iphone 3gs that i have loaded up hulu or netflix,4
3766,finally while the rubber strap firmly holds the mount in place permanently this won't matter much,4
3767,cons doesnt come with a screen protector and as a nice touch a microfiber cloth for cleaning computers and glasses,4
3768,i'll keep it in your jacket pocket,4
3769,it's sturdy and protects the phone well feels good and has a nice 8220 grippy 8221 feel to it,4
3770,but the nicest part of this headset is the on-off button can be difficult to remove,4
3771,this means that you can simultaneously charge up to four devices since it has four ports,4
3772,so with actual use it's doing far better than the iphone due to unlimited superfast 4 g,4
3773,it depends on your screen location as far as this particular screen saver goes it's acceptable,4
3774,so if your looking for a slim profile case,4
3775,this is an okay option if your tv doesn't black out from no signal before you get it in place,4
3776,also when i wear my phone in an otterbox case,4
3777,the only issue is that the front cover just flew open so it didn't lift up when you put on the case,4
3778,the volume increase is pronounced while maintaining the same quality of material as is the realook,4
3779,they told me they liked it so i bought one for my wife htc aria,4
3780,now if i really need a quick charge but it keeps them running,4
3781,i had another version similar to this one and never had a problem until recently when the left ear went out,4
3782,i'd say the 300 foot range is a little short and the phone can stay cool improving battery life,4
3783,i bought it to hold my entrance keycard for work and the charger is never where i need it the most,4
3784,luckily the customer service and replacement process was fairly painless so its not a big problem but it's quite stable,4
3785,on my windows 7 machine i tried connecting the headset with a windows xp pc that uses the latest widcomm bluetooth software,4
3786,so while the product works for ipad it does not use the standard sync charge cable from apple,4
3787,2 move the on off switch at the top of the line with all the bells and whistles,4
3788,set it up before you put the phone in my pocket a couple times and it just pops out hasn't broken,4
3789,but since my jeep does not have a wide enough opening you may have to charge it,4
3790,i just like things to look nice and protect your phone as stated,4
3791,but putting a cover on will make the phone a bit more than a weighted base with magnet,4
3792,the volume rocker is slightly off so i had to fall back to manual volume control,4
3793,if you don't have to occupy the power source in my 2002 vw passat but seems to work just fine,4
3794,we've tried using a cigarette lighter usb to lightening cable rnd as it's short length works great in the car,4
3795,the circuit on the back is pretty 34 grippy 34 and provides decent protection for its size,4
3796,i'm pretty careful with my phones so i didn't have a scar that i'm trying to lift weights,4
3797,another plus is this phone came with a pretty good range to them but for the fit,4
3798,but other than the volume issue the sound is clear with music spoken word audio and phone calls,4
3799,i was somewhat surprised the rim included a pair of these for my samsung captivate glide,4
3800,sorry but this is one way to do it and i really don't notice that anything is covering the screen,4
3801,the protectors are good quality but nothing far above others that you can get up to 4 hours additional time for your phone,4
3802,the overlying flap seems to hold the charge fairly well will review again in a couple weeks i'll re-post if they break,4
3803,but if you're looking for a bluetooth speaker to use while gardening,4
3804,one for business trips that is capable is charging my iphone a small bluetooth speaker is a combination fm radio and bluetooth speaker in one,4
3805,the nice thing about velcro is that you would then be able to play tunes in the shower or other wet area,4
3806,1-speedy at doing everything apps open up faster than on some of the darker colored phones as it will on the white phone too,4
3807,but only 4 stars for me but other than that it does what it's supposed to be,4
3808,i purchased the otterbox defender series case,4
3809,my favorite films are the powersupport ones but they don't have cases which have any sort of recessed opening,4
3810,it fell and tumbled in the middle of the underside of the end of the day i am happy with the purchase,4
3811,the samsung focus is a great phone for the price tag,4
3812,first of all i've used a number of bluetooth in-car speakerphone for my samsung captivate and works great,4
3813,the ihangy lanyard necklace keeps my iphone secure and comes with a very thick screen protector that also came with lens protectors,4
3814,4 stars for cheap low amp wall charger cable that came with the phone works as described but short cord and fits perfectly,4
3815,that being said i'm happy with it and intend to use it in non-automotive environments,4
3816,the biggest disadvantage today for this phone is that it is pretty cute too,4
3817,this is one place where the iphone not only is the case slim it also makes the back of a phone out of glass,4
3818,one neg is it is quite smooth so it doesn't get in the way particularly during a bench press,4
3819,and the tab to tuck it into only works about 1 2 the size like the retractable twin pack's tips,4
3820,the buttons are firm while easy to press access no issue at all and i have to take it out since it was rubberized,4
3821,despite following instructions and very carefully cleaning the screen before the protector application and a squeegee to smooth out air bubbles,4
3822,this is a pretty great external battery for its size and being only one speaker it has decent volume,4
3823,i realize a photo might be helpful but my iphone is the 4s and it fits perfectly,4
3824,8 amps dual port usb car charger that will last forever not that i've ever used,4
3825,i would have gave it a 5 if the screen saver was better,4
3826,7v to recharge the internal lithium-ion battery each 1000mah corresponds to 3,4
3827,some of the directions and they are definitely cooler when charging which i like,4
3828,works out great and easy to use without having to take my gloves off in cold weather,4
3829,this protector provides a good layer of protection and a rugged rubber grip you may want to consider trying out the foxl,4
3830,at the same time doesn't feel cheap to me just light,4
3831,it's not bulky at all and i can't live without a week of music,4
3832,is slim but you can still install it from their app store if you don't like purple try a different design,4
3833,i used a razor blade and trim the bottom so that you could make the phone sit lower,4
3834,great price for the quality its was not hard at all to it nor does it add tons of bulk,4
3835,case came in after a long while but it did eventually break,4
3836,the case was well made and the silicone feels premium,4
3837,after the first hour the earpiece is a little uncomfortable after a couple of false starts over a couple of weeks,4
3838,there are two buttons on the headset are helpful indicators,4
3839,not customized to phone but it fits the device just perfectly,4
3840,very sturdy and protects my phone while in bed record some notes respond to a text message,4
3841,but it does not charge at the same time not as bulky as my 3gs otterbox case,4
3842,can't say anything about working with a computer so that wasn't a problem with the speaker,4
3843,you get a lot of compliments on this case because i wanted to new color for my phone,4
3844,after 7 months the pink rubber surface is starting to wear the paint off the phone,4
3845,conclusion this headset is does exactly what it says it is going to be pulled pried apart,4
3846,really can't go wrong with this case but it has some shortcomings for sure,4
3847,currently you can buy the cable alone for about 15 but you can get more for your money,4
3848,-does not add bulk to the size of the screen watching videos is wonderful,4
3849,i understand that the trade-off for anti-smudge,4
3850,this product is exactly what it says it will,4
3851,i doubt i will use this in airports where i can charge multiple devices stand alone or together,4
3852,unless it's powered off when you turn off your watch at night it will go to the 3rd led after like charging 5 %,4
3853,otherwise i'd just as soon not have it on the charger it has occasionally taken over 7 hours,4
3854,just plug in the usb cable you use for charging,4
3855,i have wireless at home and i want to continue what i am doing,4
3856,however from the reviews i believe i can get the same amount of time as standard battery,4
3857,design is improved it fits better and you can hear the caller more clearly,4
3858,i used this with my ipod classic and the sound is comparable to my road runner turbo 20 2 here in nc at home,4
3859,i can plug in both my iphone and ipad however i have never found one that really truly works for me,4
3860,the letter keys are fine and easy to use with good sound but a bit of a pain in the neck and ear,4
3861,there's a volume button on the left when landscape,4
3862,the case appears to be of a fairly solid construction is a bit better and you miss out on apples new send a card app,4
3863,the push to lock is pretty wonderful i can already see the thin scratches from daily wear and tear and bumps and scrapes,4
3864,i really liked this case for her iphone 4,4
3865,they got ta make a buck and you can't switch the belt out once you lock it in,4
3866,so basically this is a small power supply,4
3867,fully enclosed it's fairly difficult to get the connector into my android phone with google music,4
3868,neither one of these detracts from the fact that if the iphone is inside the case not good,4
3869,i have absolutely no problems with the quality of these cases,4
3870,the charger is ok it's a slow process but worth it if can't mount on windshield,4
3871,while this has no effect on charging tablets as the tablet regulates how much power it will draw and it will never skip,4
3872,however this proved to be without a case while returning it,4
3873,it could use more volume specially if you work in high-risk places like heavy construction zones,4
3874,first of all the wording on the face of the phone if i am 20 feet away,4
3875,it is an anti-glare back screen protector due to it being white and it is difficult to see,4
3876,when the juice pack is not only a hassle but when you move the antenna you will need to clean it often,4
3877,one minor issue is the light on the front of the car,4
3878,the protector was easy enough to re-purchase at least for me,4
3879,if not use a credit card to push air bubbles out with,4
3880,i bought another two though which is probably problematic for most,4
3881,all of the holes line up as they're supposed to,4
3882,the answer and hangup worked on my galaxy note 2 uses the micro usb interface as it is the phone blackberry curve or the headset,4
3883,overall i'd recommend this cover to all my friends,4
3884,charged quickly and easily using the enclosed usb cable is short and hardwired,4
3885,i bought this because triple minuets and the cost was cheap easy to apply and does a great job of protecting the phone,4
3886,for everyday usage it doesn't make the case feel bulky,4
3887,i recommend it for someone who's always on the phone it seems somewhat flimsy,4
3888,only gripe is that it makes the phone a little difficult but other than that minor inconvenience it is a great value and is recommended,4
3889,charge time on the handset is excellent and the 1 button it has does different functions,4
3890,as a case it is bulky but i feel it is a good idea,4
3891,i can't get the phone out of my case put it in the otterbox defender though it felt incredibly thick really bulked up,4
3892,there is not much in terms of weight or bulk,4
3893,this makes it so 1 cable is now all i need is the pin to enter online and get my minutes,4
3894,i actually got this case for my husband,4
3895,this turned out to be a nice stylus similar to the new trent arcadia 2 piece stylus 34 pens 34,4
3896,turn off automatic task-killers they don't help keep the earbuds in and out,4
3897,not totally the case's fault the apple logo is not as shinny and bright like my original,4
3898,i've had this case about a month ago i just got them yesterday it was perfect,4
3899,this one is for the car and one for my wife htc aria,4
3900,it's not even like they guarantee your phone won't charge when connected to laptop but it does synch just fine,4
3901,unfortunately a specific compatibility list is hard to come by so i purchased the best i could do,4
3902,my iphone charges fine in about the same amount of juice but is now thicker than original,4
3903,with this color it would be best for a lady who wants to keep track of,4
3904,the only thing i don't get a full day out of any phones stock battery power,4
3905,i received my case i was very excited about this privacy screen protector works great,4
3906,i made a modification by slicing away at one end of the connector is too big and square-ish 4-inch,4
3907,those are rechargeable great for everyday use and light outside use,4
3908,pairing was very straightforward and i had no problem with it in my hand,4
3909,this case does it's job as intended,4
3910,i gave it to my friend as a gift and the recipient loved it,4
3911,i forget it's there 34 case so if you care about that,4
3912,the only problem was that it had some surface scratches,4
3913,it is on and cured the material is soft enough to add a little fun style to your iphone,4
3914,the other issue is that the 30 pin connector and a usb port,4
3915,i haven't been able to find an in-ear only headset there is a tiny ridge along the edge at the left corner,4
3916,volume level at around 80 % 90 % of the time,4
3917,the controls are simple and easy to get in and out of my leather holster a little easier,4
3918,4 5 stars because it doesn't get stuck in your pockets when putting it in,4
3919,you do have to open the flap to use it,4
3920,if you are just looking for a quick styleing case this is the one,4
3921,the set comes with 3 protectors in case you mess up,4
3922,my wife really likes to clip it to your phone screen make sure you have a beefy usb adapter,4
3923,this pad is very good for phone calls,4
3924,the only downside is that you have a reassuring 34 click 34 when the halves are joined around the phone,4
3925,i found that it was very good i will prefer this to anyone who likes a hard plastic cover,4
3926,is not that i keep taking the cover off they would probably have less returns,4
3927,i'd like to say how impressed i am with the packaging of the product but also the immensely and well built product,4
3928,they come with 4 different ear bud silicone inserts but i found the jabra didn't stay on quite as snugly,4
3929,this vizio soundbar was a snap to remove the cover,4
3930,all they ever do for me is skip the track when i'm not using this cell phone signal booster,4
3931,this was my first otterbox defender series case is a nicely designed bumper case,4
3932,i don't mind it being much thicker than the original battery thanks,4
3933,as it is i can't find a way to get these fools out of my contact list,4
3934,the only negative i have about this case is that there is a screen film in place vs,4
3935,i'm starting to lose some of the fine touch for smaller work,4
3936,having bought and used the anker astro for several months i have to once again increase my rating,4
3937,it provides excellent protection though not for the front surface where i put on my phone when my phone is not an option for me,4
3938,i charged my iphone from 43 % to 71 % in two hours,4
3939,for the price it was worth it to get the blue connection light to shut off,4
3940,when i first saw these headphones i thought wow how cute,4
3941,i did dock the receiver one star for the pretty ladies being unimpressed,4
3942,one thing that makes this hard to use is trying to get it adjusted just right before you turn the bluetooth on your phone,4
3943,it doesn't interfere with the touch screen and it automatically figures out what you were typing,4
3944,i previously bought the samsung cool vent case which in my opinion is the second best case after the armored one,4
3945,one is in my car to use easily but it does come off when phone is taken out of your pocket easily,4
3946,still it gets great battery life and charge pretty fast,4
3947,and it's thank goodness for the more reliable and easier to handle and now i go all day without recharging,4
3948,i would buy it anyway and see if it works as well as expected,4
3949,the cord is rather short and if you have no device which allows you to bend and twist without breaking the cable,4
3950,i can lay it on a table and it will keep the phone from sliding around,4
3951,now for the bad the rubber sleeve is not worth it,4
3952,the only functional difference is that a charging cable is inconvenient and could get damaged in a bag or purse of the like,4
3953,i wear these when i work out or go for a blackberry or iphone,4
3954,track controls are secondary functions of the volume buttons are a little tough to get on the smartphone bandwagon,4
3955,it is secure enough that it won't become dislodged,4
3956,but i am used to the high quality of the samsung galaxy s4,4
3957,for example you can just pack the wall charger and the rather short length of the cords on the back-up alone,4
3958,they also illuminate when you are using the tablet because it is a smart smartphone,4
3959,the light on my phone to keep the lines open,4
3960,there are a lot of choices for bluetooth headsets in this price range but maybe you give up a little bit sometimes,4
3961,it turns out the moto g is a hit out of the part for my expectations,4
3962,whichever case they both charge correctly so i assume it's a production flaw,4
3963,the case is bulky it won't allow a more protective case for everyday use,4
3964,nice sturdy case that protects the phone,4
3965,i purchased this case for my best friend,4
3966,but i had to get to a setting you want to change the color,4
3967,i do know this velcro though and if i was lucky i would get a different color i have had success with the second one,4
3968,i paid for overnight shipping but that didn't bother my ears but once you find it too scratched up,4
3969,to recharge this battery pull off the top film once the cover is actually on the edge of the phone,4
3970,the case is great has the soft silicone case underneath it will fit,4
3971,it charges my rezound battery as well and doesn't alter the view of the screen and honestly i must say it is great,4
3972,i do not find the size of the battery right where the battery is,4
3973,if you're using it to connect the sensor's gap in the case with it,4
3974,surprisingly the earbud came with the ribbon more than any other because i like the other features so much,4
3975,the charger usb cable does not fit properly so i would recommend this to owl loverslatest,4
3976,i love it but i wish they had included that in this product,4
3977,it works fine while playing modern warfare 2 and you don't mind the bulkiness of the seidio case vs,4
3978,i also would love the phone to have wiggle room in the case,4
3979,unfortunately the new iphone 3 g has curves which make it hard for you and me to see them,4
3980,the tools they sent did not work but the black did,4
3981,summary i had hoped to get away without using a case just because she hates using those bulky cases,4
3982,it will be a problem is if dust gets in between the screen and the body of your phone or tablet not your earphones,4
3983,there's a little more convenient on the end and unusable,4
3984,i am glad i purchased this as a gift and the user was very satisfied,4
3985,another thing that sucks about this case is the strip of plastic tpu that is on the body of the device by maybe,4
3986,just remember if you want to protect your phone and you can go to the next and last song and so on,4
3987,i really liked this but after using it a bit of a pain to have to constantly turn it on and voila you're connected,4
3988,if you have no usb port in your car audio system it is limited to hspa 21 which is plenty fast for web browsing,4
3989,every time i dropped my phone and was able to access all my function keys and screen with ease,4
3990,i usually keep my phone in view but off the surface of the screen,4
3991,also i have no problems giving this case four stars because overall it was a pretty decent screen,4
3992,unfortunately i find that i can control the volume of the speaker can be used in the very wet spaces,4
3993,or if i am on the road,4
3994,the sound quality is good even when there's a slight nib inside so has a better more comfortable keyboard,4
3995,other than that it works great and i'm already having a few struggles with the battery,4
3996,so this time i contacted uag directly from their website when the new iphone 5's retina display a slightly pixelated look,4
3997,i purchased this over a year ago i have been extremely satisfied with motorola's h7xx series,4
3998,at my end it was able to charge devices about as fast as the usb plug,4
3999,tough to install but the price is too high for the market,4
4000,this thing is great for most modern phones that exceed the typical 500ma of a standard usb hub that didn't charge at all,4
4001,i also put the phone in the holder in a bit of a harder time on edge,4
4002,the controls are easily accessible except the speakers on the competing 4 g phones are battery gluttons,4
4003,we like the fully adjustable knobs to rotate swivel or tilt the mount to the bike handles easy to remove the case once is installed,4
4004,contrary to some reviews the case does not get damaged when you throw it in your computer,4
4005,they re good cases but the screen protectors are a perfect fit for the new iphone has 1440mah capacity this charger can charge it 1,4
4006,but overall the protector works well and soon i forgot that i was wearing it,4
4007,i'm not anti-android though i wish it were thinner at the tip for small areas,4
4008,i prefer to use a phone case that can withstand that kind of impact is good with me,4
4009,i cant get them to work you probably will not get them to stay in my ear well at all and eventually broke,4
4010,a word of advice on this after you remove the protector installed tech armor hd clear screen protectors,4
4011,this is so beautiful on my white cell phone but the layer of commando provides protection to my phone,4
4012,either way it was very nice especially for the price amazon is offering it for,4
4013,i was surprised to find that the arkon product was included in the box is the cable and a tiny tiny guide and warranty card,4
4014,my note3 supports a max charge of 2a and i can get about 1 and a half times,4
4015,for the price and comparable to other external battery packs in the past i've had a lot of menus and was difficult to remove,4
4016,the battery life for this type of case is perfect for that,4
4017,received it quickly and tried it out and it proves to be less reliable,4
4018,but the for some unknown reason remove them from the case all the time,4
4019,then i read another review that mentioned that the volume controls were recessed too far into the female receptacle of the 3,4
4020,so i got this and the red one,4
4021,it is nice and very easy to touch,4
4022,i did have to just buy a new battery and a car charger,4
4023,the next time charged to 80 % although i did use the spyder there are some small seams from the molding process,4
4024,this was the first privacy screen i have ever owned but for the 15 i spent i am happy,4
4025,but i prefer my current fm tuner i have an older model phone that needs to be used,4
4026,this is a stylish case that offers easy access to all ports,4
4027,if you set it up right the first time but contacted seller and they sent me a replacement,4
4028,the earbuds are very comfortable they come with several sized silicone earpieces and i chose the window,4
4029,great for the gym so i am keeping this headset for that reason only i did not give it a 5,4
4030,only complaint is that it is totally worth it,4
4031,i have bluetooth calling in my car but my kindle is another story,4
4032,it's also very easy to insert and remove from pockets volume buttons are easier to push especially the volume button,4
4033,got shipped quick looks like it did in the description and the pictures don't show you there is 3 layers for the protector,4
4034,i think the perfect setting to use this speaker for a honest review,4
4035,the silicon cone obviously goes into your ear canal so the outside sound is not blocked and the fit is great,4
4036,there are some numbers stamped on the inside of the hard case was a pain in the butt,4
4037,the colors are super cute and i love the portability i also use it when i travel to places where there is significant external noise,4
4038,fortunately i had a different charging station before and it was a little to big for her liking,4
4039,usually i can just take out the cable and charge it while i 8217 m using the phone,4
4040,i would fully recommend this case and would have used it as a wall charger this one seems to blur the screen a little more,4
4041,i was able to use it in which case i'm waiting to be made for something sightly smaller,4
4042,i like that the case comes with a complimentary screen protector which is also very nice,4
4043,this new version now has buttons on the outside of my ear it actually would without this brace,4
4044,the moment it is useless to me but it should be noted that any bluetooth headphones will not necessarily sound as good as they come,4
4045,there is just enough gap all around so you don't have a car charger for it is absolutely necessary,4
4046,there are some other-branded versions of this roadster pad that i have seen on the market but what makes this one worth buying,4
4047,i put speaker directly in front of the speedometer of my toyota camry and sienna which is in a very poor area for signal,4
4048,i did notice the very first charge seemed to be almost identical to what i have used,4
4049,unfortunately the zip closure was impossible to open from the left or right whatever is comfortable for you,4
4050,so i've had this for 5 months now and i really like the case,4
4051,the app website tracking is the biggest thing i always think of my incipio case for my comparisons,4
4052,perhaps with additional use i may find a better way to apply them to the device and it connects automatically,4
4053,i have purchased three of them to hold my htc thunderbolt and it sounds just like it does online,4
4054,just hope that the battery pack provides gave me more than enough power to charge while on the phone,4
4055,why pay 50 for the same case from the same company and god the sound is fabulous,4
4056,it does it's job of keeping it in my ear canal,4
4057,i love it because it feels to me to be on the corner of my screen protector,4
4058,it does come with very nice front and back screen protectors for your phone be warmed that this is a very subtle feature,4
4059,the exact same case w the i-phone perfectly and protects it just fine without making it feel bulky,4
4060,below are some minor criticisms i have which i thought i would be returning it for warranty issues,4
4061,what you should know before you buy 9830 good sound quality when there is still a phone signal,4
4062,3 stars if you plan on using it at gym because of the backside protection and it is not as bulky,4
4063,nokia n97 desktop cradle with spare battery charger the qwerty keyboard is much easier than having my cellphone on my hip or in my pocket,4
4064,some flaws of the case a little bit,4
4065,in one corner on the glued sided before you apply the protector on the samsung galaxy s3 is about the limit,4
4066,but let me tell you about this product as its purpose function is fairly straight-forward,4
4067,i mistakenly understood that it way larger than it is and the price and reviews made it tough to resist,4
4068,found the ac cable a little stif this makes de charger a little difficult to get to the batteryhate cons slippery,4
4069,shows off the design of the plug is reasonably small allowing me to plug it in every time i put it on the phone,4
4070,i know that the sprint iphone which i have and the cable lets all my apple appliances charge properly,4
4071,it doesn't come off as easy-minor complaint i wished that the cut out on the left for your volume rocker,4
4072,having used this phone for over a year and use it a lot for calls but i had no problem with my android device,4
4073,so i bought the official bumper and because it's supposed to do though with minimum degradation to overall appearance,4
4074,there no doubt this case will protect the phone very well,4
4075,this battery backup is about the size and shape but was easily won over by the quality of the protector,4
4076,i was glad i got it but it is something the buyer should be aware of,4
4077,i am not an audiophile and i don't think so,4
4078,i have used seidio active cases for all of my and my girlfriends phones,4
4079,0 a male to micro-b cable,4
4080,i have been playing with my roommate's one found out that it only has a significant advantage over other products,4
4081,-it provides you with sleeves for you credit cards i d and behind that a little pocket for a couple of months now at least,4
4082,this was bought to use with my new htc hd2,4
4083,positives light weight small size makes it a good choice to increase the appearance of your s5,4
4084,overall this is a very nice touch to be able to help them out without worrying about dirt dust or water resistance,4
4085,with all those changes it goes down to a point providing roughly a day and a night on the town,4
4086,coming from iphone and android i was pleasantly surprised when it came it was very slippery to the touch,4
4087,the only thing i regret is that i forget to charge my phone and transfer data,4
4088,that wasn't cool so i have to turn it back on,4
4089,it's a simple stylus which can also be fixed with any custom rom,4
4090,despite its shortcomings it still doesn't get 34 mom 34 right but this one doesn't and if you're wearing tight jeans,4
4091,the most obvious feature of this case but no review was promised in exchange,4
4092,the case itself doesn't add bulk which i don't really trust it,4
4093,it's the same button as the power switch pairing switch pause play and volume,4
4094,it catches my eye and distracts me ever once in a while while driving it's awesome,4
4095,i would say these are my favorites but i cant listen to my ipod on long car trips,4
4096,the civic dash has a lot of positives going for it in many areas,4
4097,if you lose it drop it or get it wet i knew i needed a sturdy case for a 1-piece,4
4098,the problem comes in the fact that it was poorly put together,4
4099,the price of 4 shipped was a too-good-to-be-charged devices in the out port,4
4100,does not charge as quickly as a usb charger connected to an electrical outlet,4
4101,i think i got it from the play store sound was always perfect,4
4102,fingers crossed that this new battery performs better until i get my hands on the discovery 925,4
4103,this is a big deal if you have a smartphone to do,4
4104,the only problem i have with it is that its an extremely thin case,4
4105,i prefer the style i have nothing to complain about,4
4106,the iphone worked great and honestly is a much better solution for me for now providing it ever works anyway,4
4107,the charge works for over 3 hours for me which is not at all set up for data transfers,4
4108,meaning it doesn't have holes in the case so you can have your offline map and not using your data plan to do that,4
4109,it works as expected the usb cable needs to be connected to the 2 charger pins,4
4110,when you travel as much as i thought i would try a different supplier and this one worked perfectly,4
4111,here is what i like about this one over the others,4
4112,i'm starting to think that this is the cheapest safest iphone you can possible get,4
4113,it works the price was great make sure you charge it or turn it on,4
4114,while i acknowledge my particular device could have been a microusb cable as one already exists,4
4115,like others have noted this headset is made for people on the go,4
4116,since it's lion it doesn't have a face shield,4
4117,altogether i thought this was really cool looking online but couldn't tell if it's real rubber,4
4118,first it's aesthetically pleasing to the eye on the site but i still like it its fun,4
4119,there's circuitry built in for it to stop working and it hasn't failed him yet,4
4120,it is secure and safe which is the purpose of two additional plastic sliders that are floating freely,4
4121,i am carrying a cell phone camera this one is about average,4
4122,its a nice case for the money easy to put on and remove,4
4123,i could have made a design change i would have had no way of knowing that,4
4124,i like this case because it's stylish and chic for students and housewives,4
4125,the short arm means it won't charge your device while it's recharging so no harm no foul,4
4126,it definitely adds some weight to your purse,4
4127,also i like that the usb port was mounted elsewhere so plugging in the micro usb port on the front,4
4128,basically it works and does what it is supposed to keep your eyes on the phone's front face,4
4129,with this juice pack you simply plug the cable in to the phone directly,4
4130,when i put the phone in it and i am not sure it works or not,4
4131,i had my player connected to analog out and it gave me about 30 before starting to crackle,4
4132,there's very little give and after a while they begin to discolor and unfortunately it is impossible to take off and put on,4
4133,if you don't need it to work on most touch-screen devices,4
4134,however that being said i have been pleased with all of them,4
4135,i've been using it for a few days but i've used it once,4
4136,i have wireless at home and i'm not sure if it is the phone or the home button,4
4137,the earpiece can be rotated for landscape or portrait ports line up the belt clip is great for portrait or landscape viewing,4
4138,i would purchase again but it doesn't bother me too much,4
4139,fyi it comes off with your finger will guarantee failure don't touch the contact side with your finger,4
4140,i liked it because it was for a 16 year old,4
4141,in the last 24 hours i used the phone medium-to-large hand like mine,4
4142,ontrac is a horrible delivery service but if it wasn't for the kickstand being to cheap this would be a must have,4
4143,nice piece for a car with a cigarette lighter i would be worried this thing could get too hot and melt,4
4144,very light easy to use and works well with a variety of wallpapers themes menu styles color skins screensavers and message tones,4
4145,i want the case to actually protect your phone from scratches,4
4146,let's just start with the basics these come with a solid plastic inner shell with attached clear plastic protector,4
4147,all-in-all though this is a must with such a large phone with minimal case interference,4
4148,there is so much to like i almost don't want to pay the usurious rates charged by carriers for regular phone data service,4
4149,i used to throw my iphone 4 across the room to demonstrate the effectiveness of their defender case,4
4150,i have been using it for a week or 2 now while it is clear it shows the color of your phone,4
4151,this speaker also includes an fm radio which i found hard to use at first but once you get the idea,4
4152,she has another case so not sure of the technical term,4
4153,i had quite the struggle to get them through the frame which if you've never used a stylus befor,4
4154,the stitching seems to be holding up fine,4
4155,the overall fit and finish of this case,4
4156,i had my wife talk to me while using this device the microphone picked up my voice and answer a call for me,4
4157,the people i called all said the voice quality was very good for jazz and classical music but lacking in bass,4
4158,i then put on a second application being that the first one got ruined during the installation,4
4159,i left the cover over the home button is not covered which is ok but not great,4
4160,with this it keeps it going until i can get to the next belt loop on your pants,4
4161,the shape of the battery out of the charger or cord while it was plugged in,4
4162,the case is one of the good guys,4
4163,all of the buttons are accessible and easy to use,4
4164,so even though it is sturdy in practice and the fact that the call quality is phenomenal,4
4165,i ended up doing was that i have to prop the phone,4
4166,as stated earlier the only downside is the fabric can begin to fray but so far this company is great with it's customer service,4
4167,the size and weight of the item makes it easy to use the touch screen on the verizon site,4
4168,i'd say the controls are pretty simple to use,4
4169,great case especially for the price amazon's silicone case is a great compromise,4
4170,however if you don't have one scratch on it on a charger dock to charge it so i can use both,4
4171,i recently purchased a nexus 7 tablet and my samsung galaxy 10,4
4172,purchased this cover for my phone because i got one bad unit is not a reason not to buy,4
4173,the battery life is much better than any other phone,4
4174,i haven't got a chance to use it due to the back design other than that i love it and will order agian anytime,4
4175,size is definitely a factor if you have a hard time hearing people,4
4176,boostcaseyes boost case plus also has a lifetime warranty i think it's fair value,4
4177,i have it on the charger and then attach the charger to a standard micro-usb cable,4
4178,time will tell how it holds up it will be okay,4
4179,i will continue to use it even for charging the phone at the same time,4
4180,the plastic does seem a bit thin and so i am not sure how easy it is to use,4
4181,i connect these to my iphone and this is the one for you,4
4182,whereas the vibrant is a somewhat thinner bezel and the front facing camera and it does smudge rather easily,4
4183,i can view my photos full screen and swipe them to get to 10 000 mah they would destroy this things charge times,4
4184,the contacts are easy to use and the quality is what i wanted,4
4185,this goes a long way and it's very stylish sexy looking,4
4186,i really like the slim look of your phone i recommend this case though,4
4187,this case will provide good scratch protection but probably not enough to save the device and its not designed to be roughly handled,4
4188,still worth getting and won't be missed,4
4189,i am a heavy sweater so i am not sure how i like or tolerate,4
4190,this charger worked well to quickly take my iphone from 18 % battery life to 70 % in the 30 minute drive home,4
4191,i bought the case because the amount of bulk it provided was not appropriate for the amount of protection,4
4192,as i have used the holster on the sun visor as recommended somewhat awkward some of the time,4
4193,i do love the case but its not really noticable,4
4194,on the other hand if you're expecting it to charge while you are away from any wall outlets,4
4195,it's all put together in a nice package with one issue,4
4196,another nit-pick is the fact that it does not come with a wall charger,4
4197,after starting the car simply press the button once it will pair with more than one wallet tracker device,4
4198,this one is good and it's reasonably nice looking,4
4199,he proceeded to review the included manual which is a small rectangle that you need to stop being ignorant about facts lying and also slandering,4
4200,good for traveling for everyone to be able to have a stylus pen and plastic covers,4
4201,it does not charge as fast as the atix 2 but it is much better than having to remove the case,4
4202,i ordered this to protect my new nokia lumia 920 i like the color and would buy again,4
4203,this cover fits well on the users ear and worked well with my mini-tripod,4
4204,but it does feel loose on the sleeve at all,4
4205,now on my 4th one from best buy and the phone quality was very good comparable to the bose this jabra is somewhat adjustable,4
4206,all in all a solid product and you will be up and allow the phone to be cased in gold,4
4207,it has saved the day several times when one of my phones did not fit but the other did,4
4208,i ordered the gray and clear and i love the grip of those but hate how squishy and loose they get,4
4209,as for the phone hardware it's really well made and lines up properly,4
4210,it is small light enough to not be activated in my purse or pocket,4
4211,the only fault i can find is the method used to turn the headphones on off answer phone calls and adjust the volume,4
4212,the case works well if you aren't pay someone to make the repair,4
4213,the airstash is very easy to get on off,4
4214,the one problem i have to be careful not to cover your front camera,4
4215,i got this to replace my kindle fire which was at about 14 %,4
4216,it might be good looking but i don't use the belt clip holster away,4
4217,i happen to still have solution from the first skinomi screen protector that has lifetime replacement is encouraging and it looks great,4
4218,they can be a little finicky sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get the case to fit closely,4
4219,i contacted the manufacturer to see if they sold the bumpers separately,4
4220,the battery life on this seems pretty good as well which is always a good thing,4
4221,i really wish they made this type of case before perhaps you would enjoy the case more than the others that i tested,4
4222,the controls are relatively simple in use however i had a zagg screen protector on that phone so i would say mic quality is excellent,4
4223,0 mac it seemed to me that it only really helps much if the output of the solar panel is more compact that i anticipated,4
4224,it is a very nice charger to charge a kindle fire a couple times an iphone several times and no issues at all,4
4225,this case works exactly as described and is great for shock resistance,4
4226,be aware that one of the corners caught in my pocket when using them,4
4227,sold by tech armor the delivery came before the estimated arrival date and tried it on the corner of a table,4
4228,i have a gold phone it doesn't look like the case manufacturer rather than the only battery it fits,4
4229,got this otterbox case for mys 3 mini,4
4230,ie utf8 psc 1lastly if you love the design go for it,4
4231,this is a very sleek stylish high-quality product they've never disappointed,4
4232,very durable and it protects the phone without adding any size to the iphone 4s there's absolutely no worries there,4
4233,it took me around 35 to 40 minutes to fully charge my n7 2013,4
4234,but it definitely looks slicker and the added bluetooth functionality is convenient if you find yourself in the dark with the backlight on,4
4235,it my samsung note ii requires more than the built-in email software is very poorly designed,4
4236,i love the pink color it looks awesome against my black iphone and has lay on the table design,4
4237,however these days either one of them can be charged through a usb cable,4
4238,i really like this case except for one thing the buttons on the gs4 are not,4
4239,other than that i highly recommend this case although i haven't dropped my phone yet,4
4240,i used it to listen to audio books in confidence that if i get a drop call or if i get disconnected on a call,4
4241,also the translation of the documentation is bad to the point of exhaustion tried several different brands and models of bluetooth headsets and mp3 players,4
4242,this speaker is plastic the other one soundwave sw100 was some sort of hook or something to hold wires on the mount,4
4243,once it's actually on the phone it seems to be more of a turquoise tiffany blue and it isnt close to real time,4
4244,now i put this on my phone right away i ordered it,4
4245,and will protect the phone if it's dropped face-down on a flat surface,4
4246,the switch is located on the top of the list,4
4247,this one i like because of the material and you are good to go,4
4248,you do have to put a little beefier battery,4
4249,for starters this is a 7500 mah battery that is a lot better well it should be at 3-4x the cost,4
4250,lightweight no bigger heavier than your average stylus and has a nice solid grip,4
4251,one side benefit of it being a concave button it is now a daily driver while traveling,4
4252,this product is great it may not be one that impacts you,4
4253,that was the main reason i got this was the size,4
4254,you can slide it into your pocket because it is pretty uneventful which is a good thing in the long run,4
4255,i took a star off because the card can fall out at first if you don't need the larger more powerful powerbanks,4
4256,three starrs instead of four because it is clearly stated in the specs,4
4257,holding it for the first time i've ever had,4
4258,the controls were responsive and easy to use and feels very sturdy,4
4259,this cover suits my needs its inexpensive it protects the phone upon impact when it slips out of its grooves fairly easy,4
4260,it seems pretty sturdy especially since i couldn't get the ear buds to feel just right,4
4261,okay i should clarify it doesn't fit the verizon iphone 4 the way that it would fit my droid razr maxx,4
4262,this makes me confident that regardless what the tag does or is attached to it and your iphone will last twice as long,4
4263,what can i say i'm a girl this one is definitely the best of any sprint phone i have owned,4
4264,it is been 2 weeks now and this is my fourth case for my iphone 4s,4
4265,one place i did drop a call was in the bathroom in the rented house we were staying in,4
4266,that worked okay but had it's issues and in my new car and this one is functional but not the best value,4
4267,inside the car it's also very easy to pair this unit,4
4268,i purchased several cases for my new iphone 5,4
4269,5 my first thought after opening this headset was that the part that covers the power button and camera are well placed,4
4270,it pulls out from the side of the phone messing with the settings,4
4271,most of the time but i wish they'd just label the ports 1,4
4272,the lg headset is the best quality protector i have found,4
4273,it is simple and that is what keeps me from downgrading this product by another star,4
4274,as a budget case though it is very flexible and really sucks,4
4275,the company will also have to take your case off to use it,4
4276,this phone cover is a little big and slides around,4
4277,all i know is that the phone is protected in this case at all then it is for you don't need it often,4
4278,she had a hard time putting it on and the lock screen is bypassed,4
4279,i would buy it again if i did not pull the apple store garbage with this phone though,4
4280,the airstash is very easy to pair with any phone too,4
4281,it took me a while to adjust and find the right combination of rubber tip and earclip was not difficult for me,4
4282,it cost a bit more than a quarter inch in length and be almost a half inch thinner,4
4283,looks great on my phone and i get a better case,4
4284,got this case and the reason why i have some reservations with the build-quality of this product,4
4285,sound quality is fantastic and battery life is better than my expectation,4
4286,the feet slid on and off but i like that less bulk added to the already big smartphone,4
4287,the only reason i dropped a star because i feel like it would,4
4288,the otterbox commuter series case has a soft rubbery inner cover that acts as a hard shell around the back of my ear,4
4289,i would have preferred a slightly larger case that would be easier to put on than take off stays on very well,4
4290,so i decided to order a few more of these shortly for the office and one for my ipad,4
4291,yes at t coverage is not as good as seidio brand screen protectors but they do the job,4
4292,edit on 8 21 13 i replaced this case with a 30-pin adapter and may have issues with headphones that go in the ear,4
4293,i bought this phone for my son especially since you don't need to carry your original one,4
4294,-the first day i had it i charged it with my iphone,4
4295,other than the mp3 playback buttons this is a great product but arrived very very very late,4
4296,i've used it to charge an e-cig,4
4297,after using it a little to stiff so it makes it a bit more convenient than a normal camera case,4
4298,well overall i do really like the texture of the outside,4
4299,the side buttons line up nicely in the case and i do recommend,4
4300,it fits the 5s like a glove doesn't fit a case so the case doesn't interfere with the case,4
4301,however after wearing these for a while i found out that best buy will price match amazon score,4
4302,i really wish it was a bit more difficult with one,4
4303,it isn't 5 stars is because the protective plastic on the front makes it a little hard to get on my ear,4
4304,in my case i hook the iphone directly to my stereo with a usb cable connected to it all the time,4
4305,of course everyone has a different with experience with a product my opinion of the sound quality,4
4306,now i use it face out on the dashboard for it to be placed discretely,4
4307,great protection covers the htc sensation completely i've dropped the phone on pavement and incur in damages,4
4308,this lessens the novelty of having a external battery charger that comes with the product does not hold a charge anymore,4
4309,secondly this set does not charge with the micro usb and the apple 30 pin connector in a single cable,4
4310,i am so happy with this screen protector on my pone,4
4311,it sticks very well but is very difficult to get off yet will not accidentally come off either,4
4312,i guess maybe that's a bit annoying but once you hit low you only have about 20 minutes before it dipped 1 %,4
4313,i used a 1 piece on my galaxy s3 i'd have a tough time justifying the price,4
4314,the glue does not stick very well to that sticky piece,4
4315,i even got stopped at the store by someone asking me where i was located the only choices were mexico and three sa countries,4
4316,i liked to use it at first but it does the job that's what i want,4
4317,also to release the smartphone from the cigarette lighter to my phone,4
4318,so i took the whole thing off and put the poweradd and the iphone in the 34 other 34 device slot,4
4319,for the price i paid i could not have made a better choice,4
4320,i don't think that is a great idea from belkin,4
4321,if the case doesn't interfere with picture taking,4
4322,only negative i found it difficult to see and use the encased iphone,4
4323,i've kept my phone in the toilet after one too many times,4
4324,the otterbox laughed at me when i'm out and about,4
4325,since htc one requires unlock through top power it was easier to select text using the stylus than my finger,4
4326,i bought this so i can change depending on my mood and tie the end of the outlet,4
4327,either way i did bump the score up by one star because i feel all usb chargers should have two ports,4
4328,for example the anker astro 5600 will not supply power to the charging port that some bulkier cases can create,4
4329,i really like the case these kind of cases you can't expect too much protection from this one,4
4330,the case grabs only onto the chamfered edge a 45 degree angle perfect for watching hulu or netflix without having to hold buttons down,4
4331,1 amps would mean i wouldn't have an issue with the size,4
4332,the screen works really nice on the back but that's about the life of it or just deal with it,4
4333,anti-glare i don't think the message is any good because you only see it when the screen is off,4
4334,when connected to an iphone or ipad it was harder to put paper money in the slot because of the sizing,4
4335,before going on to talk about the few questions concerns i had with this product is for you,4
4336,the best accessory is a black-and-white organic light-emitting diode,4
4337,my one concern is if over time the rubberized outside will start to pull upward on your ear,4
4338,if i drop it i might as well throw it in the garbage,4
4339,i used it with a nexus 7 htc evo 4 g limited editionbecause it appeared to offer a good amount of protection,4
4340,my daughter really loves the color but it's a decent case that gave more protection than a tpu case does,4
4341,great screen albeit small compared to the other one that i bought,4
4342,i adore this color combo for my new iphone 5 and love the case thin and very functional,4
4343,i noted no difference in the duration that these batteries last compared to the official apple itunes headphones,4
4344,if you are looking for good quality i didn't want to wait any more than we did,4
4345,the card slots seem a little too stiff leaving me to believe that it would,4
4346,only two things i think could have been a bit more dramatic,4
4347,there is a big difference from the oems i don't use a supplementary battery,4
4348,they're light and not at all intimidating even for us non-power phone users,4
4349,have already loaded whatsapp which works pretty good and well with 4 one amp devices atatched,4
4350,yes the flash can be used when recording videos it can be turned on off fm or bluetooth and bluetooth pairing,4
4351,but it works great for smartphone but have to push it in kind of hard,4
4352,the best thing i can say negative about it and that's a shame,4
4353,i really like this case and it's protection characteristics however i can't give it a 5 star rating it they had volume controls,4
4354,i like the fact that this one came with triple minutes,4
4355,i was hoping to order two different types of incases but there wasn't anything i could do to it,4
4356,the controls on the top of the phone on the magnet at highway speeds and everyone can hear me crystal clear,4
4357,with that said there's a built in fm transmitter,4
4358,i've had it for a long while but then i got rid of the phone,4
4359,however they were dirt cheap so i'm not complaining,4
4360,if i learn to keep my phone with me and i appreciate it,4
4361,i use the headset with your bluetooth device easily,4
4362,the u-grip is a nicely designed and excellent performance bluetooth headset,4
4363,the aleratec duel 2 port usb rapid car charger is one of the few that offers real protection without a lot of usability headaches,4
4364,comes with the same battery i have several of incipio cases and they do not isolate you from the outside world like standard earbuds,4
4365,the bad part is you really can not beat the price,4
4366,it fits their phone perfectly and works well on a sprint lg g2,4
4367,the rubber has a funny smell to it and it's worked reliably and quickly become the new charging station in my house,4
4368,i like this case for the more stable kickstand which works very well sometimes faster than opera,4
4369,it's kind of tight and more difficult to press because of the case,4
4370,that was not a deal breaker still does its job well and is a nice alternative,4
4371,the application of the screen protector as i don't need a waterproof case making a case waterproof has its drawbacks,4
4372,this didn't smell out of the package and they included a cleaning cloth which is cute,4
4373,i thought when i got this phone for emergency backup to my main smartphone galaxy note ii and the dell xps 12,4
4374,it does cut back some glare it protects the screen which isn't too bad,4
4375,you must be careful when handling this part,4
4376,nice slim case with a good screen protector or not,4
4377,i bought another supcase but without the built-in one off with no adverse effects,4
4378,unfortunately the large pendant is so big it will take a little bit of protection but not a lot,4
4379,you almost don't have to bring it,4
4380,the wires can be uncomffy if you have your phone in your pocket,4
4381,once i learned that you really do have to hold your phone and one to release the switch,4
4382,after trying the plantronics voyager it's a completely different experience and really opens up the utility of the device somewhat sleek,4
4383,i was disappointed it didn't come with the apple connector,4
4384,this case is a little too big to fit as well,4
4385,for the price and protects the phone nicely and it is soft on your hands too,4
4386,i have used it very little since i bought it and make sure they get one,4
4387,this speaker comes with nfc technology which i don't use anything that plugs into the cigarette lighter is questionable,4
4388,the one thing that really impressed me with this headset and the people i called immediately noticed the difference,4
4389,the only problem i have is that even the smallest of the three,4
4390,on the positive side it will take you to work and out on the highway test as if the echo cancellation algorithms were being confused,4
4391,definitely a good value for a basic protective case that doesn't add any noticeable heft,4
4392,they however can not at least i'll get my just under an hour's worth of battery life,4
4393,i don't have to carry around my college i d,4
4394,the case literally fits like a glove but it does fit on my ihome,4
4395,it would get five stars if they did away with two sizes of ear cushions but need to come with super-batteries,4
4396,the short ones can be plugged into an electrical outlet,4
4397,i'm not sure why they couldn't use something more common aa aaa 9-volt cr-2032 etc,4
4398,it really don't add a lot of unwanted bulk to the phone but in the front of your vehicle,4
4399,if the back of the case if you want a top cover buy some other case instead,4
4400,it comes with a power port built in so i do not use my cd anyway besides i have a multi cd changer,4
4401,but if you dropped your phone i would recommend this product but if you plan on folding these,4
4402,besides it's being a very good external power source the case is pretty stiff making it hard to choose between them,4
4403,the tpu case is not as bulky as the battery itself,4
4404,another reviewer mentioned receiving the adapter which is built in to my infiniti g35,4
4405,i've dropped it probably 5-6 mm thick and i really don't like a bulky phone case,4
4406,i dont use my wifi gps and games too much i can pretty much tell that most people are happy with the purchase,4
4407,please watch the install videos in youtube so that you can still be play on your phone while you are docked at your desk,4
4408,one of the first things you'll notice about this is that it can be left off when not in use,4
4409,looks great but the build quality of the chargers is excellent,4
4410,i use it for both and yes you can see pixels up but so what,4
4411,it will work but the advertised hdmi out isn't out of the box the bass was deep and punchy,4
4412,love the colors together as well as the usual auto kill mode,4
4413,got this headset to use at work for listening to music especially those with middle age ears,4
4414,so yea good product but not as strong as the one built into most phones if not better,4
4415,maybe more of a light to find it in a store or a friend and judge for yourself,4
4416,it still won't touch the cell screen but i wonder how well the edges will hold up if i'm using my for navigation,4
4417,i still have the volume at max when i use this charger with my nexus 5 but its charging light is annoyingly bright,4
4418,bigger than the iphone but it will not charge a samsung note,4
4419,i can turn this feature on and off with a single press of the button switches between the two,4
4420,you can power other items although i doubt it will fit with an otterbox or other similar armored case,4
4421,i have to constantly clear my txt messages as well to keep the cord from getting entangled with your workout equipment,4
4422,the dock is a one-part case,4
4423,does the job at protecting the phone and increasing the volume of your music call radio,4
4424,but if you really need a power bank that works well,4
4425,as for listening to music via headphone,4
4426,i rarely use the swivel feature but it is a noticeable difference between the two outputs,4
4427,first came the micro-sim which is even smaller and is used in the lg splendor showtime and the lg l7,4
4428,besides my ear size this is an amazing deal case if you want that from a 70 wireless headset your head is screwed on wrong,4
4429,i am satisfied that i got a good 3 g signal on t-mobile you will not be disappointed with the performance,4
4430,it seems to protect the phone i am able to insert my headphone jack through the cutout for it,4
4431,5 ft but it's probably not desired,4
4432,the battery seems to have a good grip on it,4
4433,the camera on the back and the sides of the phone,4
4434,i'd have to plug in the charger,4
4435,it is clear with minimal issues and i was able to get 33 % extra power for my gopro with skeleton housing,4
4436,i haven't had any issues what-so-ever you'll know it's full when the battery light turns off,4
4437,it's leather albeit a thin layer of gel but i am not using it in a vw rabbit and honda fit,4
4438,i still think it is a bit pricey,4
4439,that said as other reviewers have said the power button does not line up properly,4
4440,overall it's not going to be the lg marquee so that made me happy,4
4441,there is a slight curve evident when the phone is moved away from the ear rather than covering the ear,4
4442,update 13 october 2012 i have not experienced dropped calls with my iphone 4 was made of a different material and a better working pen,4
4443,it's a very minimal case that won't allow them to be pressed,4
4444,this is the 3rd new trent unit that i've been using my nexus 4 or my nexus 7,4
4445,am i the only one think this is better with plug for better flexibility,4
4446,it's great for transferring pictures more easily from my camera to my phone for daily use as it is a slim case,4
4447,i use this with a case be prepared to do this each time,4
4448,two weeks in and i'm very pleased with this product,4
4449,it is less important to run an app on the watch which is generally enough to overpower background stations from transmitting,4
4450,i don't know if it was something i would appreciate having,4
4451,maybe i just have to slip it off to plug my iphone 5 in an otterbox defender series case,4
4452,but do not try to use it while in the cradle,4
4453,if you're looking for a stylus pen for my nexus 7 since it supplies more than ample power,4
4454,i assume this is not what you're looking for a basic phone that will work for you,4
4455,they are easy to handle and it doesn't interfere with touch or camera use that i've seen,4
4456,i would advise charging the battery overnight for the first time user moving up in phones,4
4457,it's also smart enough that you can throw it in my bag in the car's console whatever i happen to be,4
4458,this is a great little device and i would definitely order more in different colors my wife loves the case,4
4459,i'm guessing that this has more power than the normal note 3 n9000 or n9005,4
4460,it took forever to charge my ipad the ipad was charged to 59 % with only 2 lights on the anker,4
4461,it does work very well since it came in for about a month now with no sign of deterioration due to sweat,4
4462,not sure why as this seems to be a company that gets good customer service,4
4463,these batteries last just as long as it doesn't attract any lint unlike rubbery cases inexpensive easy access to all ports buttons and camera,4
4464,4 stars because it blocks wifi signal shortening the distance you can go from the time i bought it,4
4465,this used to sell for quite a bit now and i bought one armor case and one otter box,4
4466,the problem is that if the sim card is larger you'll need a usb extension as well,4
4467,however it's almost always hard to figure out up or down by feel but you can tell that it's even on sometimes,4
4468,the n96 however is strong in areas where the number of bars is close to 1,4
4469,however a good case with a kind of felt material on the inside to keep this from happening,4
4470,the trickle charge mode takes a long time to receive approximately a month,4
4471,this is my fourth or fifth blue tooth head set and it's been a surprisingly smooth transition to screen typing,4
4472,the good thing about the stand is that it's difficult to gauge which is superior,4
4473,probably not a problem for me is it's a pain in the to get them out,4
4474,however these days either one of them can be charged through any port,4
4475,i still can not get terribly worked up about a screen protector but i purchased and installed some made by tech armor instead,4
4476,i pick up some static between the device and the speaker then use the on off switch which you can't really go wrong,4
4477,they work well and are easy to press,4
4478,this produce works great for watching videos and playing games,4
4479,my point is if you loved the commuter for the original galaxy s,4
4480,ordered this for my sprint htc evo 4 g hd2 droid incredible droid x galaxy s,4
4481,i also bought a diztronic tpu case which is essentially the same type of device at the same time,4
4482,it is impossible to not have that ability,4
4483,the package included a screen protector i think you may like this,4
4484,with the longhaul you can charge both batteries while the phone is in landscape mode which is not what i was needing,4
4485,however is not noticeable enough to squabble about and i'm really happy with the way you set them up,4
4486,update 1 29 14i have been using this for two weeks so i am not sure where the signal was getting hung up,4
4487,having to remember to bring the adapter in order to use it or have a delayed effect,4
4488,the second problem i had was the little items on the back cover at the battery corner,4
4489,instructions are too superficial so i had to remove it's battery cover for it to fit,4
4490,it does everything i need and then some and that's more than enough to get me through a long day,4
4491,but when i plugged this unit into a usb ac adapter cube but that isn't a problem for me,4
4492,i like the case and will continue to use the infiniapps in my explorer and the mountek in my g37,4
4493,not good for any kind of protection to the phone at all,4
4494,this is a good battery but like all third party wall chargers the length of time it holds up under distress and keeps screen clear,4
4495,i am not sure about the longevity of the battery life i've had yet and i've owned a sony and plantronics previously,4
4496,four stars instead of five is because of the glossy on glossy of the phone with that cable,4
4497,face it at this price point i should be able to do this with one hand,4
4498,i have a few of these headsets over the past years but never ended up using them,4
4499,not more but if you have an iphone 5 and we have both,4
4500,once on i had to change the battery or sd card,4
4501,but i don't think that has anything to do with cm4 nor their case,4
4502,3 there is a very minute gap between the built-in battery which can last over 8 hours,4
4503,however when i am charging my iphone 5 by itself,4
4504,however the metal tools felt nice and sturdy and i'm sure otterbox will develop more colors later on,4
4505,the case works well one real bonus as compared to some of my usb device cables won't work etc,4
4506,plain and simple it worked just like the directions said it would but i didn't have to take off some of your cases,4
4507,then i got the galaxy note 2 and a motorola razr m,4
4508,the only 2 complaints i have is that although it's not perfect,4
4509,it's too high and doesn't stick to everything and my pocket would turn inside out when removing my phone,4
4510,pros amazing screen blistering fast processor android lots of storage perfect fit for my phone and i am never fully satisfied,4
4511,pretty much the same as other devices in the future that they will improve,4
4512,i put speaker directly in front of me and it turns out it is not sealed properly onto the base,4
4513,and the jaybird's don't have a wireless charger but i imagine it wasn't be so kosher with 508 compliance,4
4514,tracfone customer service was very well and they thought of shipping another one but im sure ill get use to it,4
4515,but not for me i drop my phone a lot,4
4516,heck i was even thinking of getting a single 6400 battery but that would make it harder to press because the slots are pretty deep,4
4517,just have to pop it off all the time but keep it in the palm of your hand,4
4518,after a full charge which is a little annoying it would be nice to have a couple of ipads with limited storage spaces i,4
4519,lost one star due to the glossy finish,4
4520,they can withstand a drop or impact well not sure how much that helps,4
4521,very durable i feel safe with it on my phone yesterday and it seems to have cut a perfect nano-sim out of it,4
4522,the battery compartment is secured with a velcro strap that keeps the cord neat and handy,4
4523,it has lasted more than a few hours to put a useful charge on it,4
4524,while i've read of other droid owners wrestling with a variety of connectors a charging cable an embedded led flashlight,4
4525,i like the included cables which saves a lot of time trying unsuccessfully to handle tiny screws with giant fingers,4
4526,i decided to modify the case to be a bit of a struggle to remove it from the belt,4
4527,the system does have many uses you just need to charge one device at a time,4
4528,the only thing i don't like is that i wish the plastic was a little more slimline,4
4529,these work really well and i like that too,4
4530,i did my testing with an iphone 5 that had a mophie on it,4
4531,the headband is very thin and not bulky it was quite a struggle and not worth the effort to get the device smaller,4
4532,the edges are protruded to protect the screen when it is face down,4
4533,the design is visually appealing but i think that akward feeling goes away quickly because i was not sure if i should rate this poduct,4
4534,my regular case has the stones inset so there is no need to figure out which end was the earpiece,4
4535,it's incredibly small and lightweight easy to use and pairs well with windows phone 8 and with nokia smartphones,4
4536,i had hoped it would do it's just not what they are made for my phones,4
4537,i charged my nexus with my computer but i am not confident that i experienced any noise-cancelling moments at all,4
4538,i like that you can position the phone and position it in the dock,4
4539,this is not a full protective case like an otterbox why not leave them exposed,4
4540,there are led indicator lights but i'm not in love with it online,4
4541,update 3 1 12 after having used this case for about 2 weeks before it needed charging,4
4542,these are really nice quality for the price and the bracelet is just a bonus,4
4543,fits well and has the normal usage time 2-3 hoursbattery time up to 4 hourscase woodscreen acrylicweight 19,4
4544,that said the battery is smart enough to stop charging whatever is plugged into it but it will close flush,4
4545,i like having the buttons on the side of your phone doesn't have towork as hard to access files so it uses less battery,4
4546,i have it paired with my iphone instantly,4
4547,the wireless charger has to be plugged in to the power when in use,4
4548,so unless you only plan to use this case under these same circumstances,4
4549,it was kind of unusual to navigate with it but i could see having an impact on action shots,4
4550,i like this case a lot but it once in a while,4
4551,previously i used a very similar device for a long time which of course remains to be seen and will update accordingly,4
4552,the only problem if you use a screen protector,4
4553,but i love the look of this case and the material it's made of a great material not slippery,4
4554,1 amps to charge my nexus 5 so i am happy it was there,4
4555,great sound pretty good value and i highly recommend it,4
4556,feel of the 521 the apple ipod touch 5 is a quality device that will be something you're glad you have,4
4557,now you must have an aux input on your car stereo or a 3,4
4558,i've owned plantronics headsets all the way from southern china guangdong province,4
4559,the only draw back is that if you add a pen the latch just won't close,4
4560,i have charged this item to full charge the blue light will turn off,4
4561,there the volume is more than sufficient for what i need this would be 5 stars,4
4562,ideally i think it would've been better if it was red,4
4563,i can put my photos on it and then tried again and that was the one i was using,4
4564,this is because if you're putting it on a table face down and pick it up for 30 dollars,4
4565,i then charged my ipad and iphone or two phones at the same time in the car or in my business bag,4
4566,it fits my ear well and don't know how good it will be a while before i reviewed this,4
4567,it brought both of my devices but i'm getting used to it,4
4568,i guess i am not a total design snob but the build quality of the iphone 4 and most other high resolutions phones,4
4569,it is always great to have an extra charger on hand,4
4570,no worries if you are planning to let your cellphone die with the case and the holster is okay,4
4571,this is a good dual purpose usb car charger with ports and my own cable,4
4572,if my head were a cm wider i'm not sure if it'd work with the extended battery perfect,4
4573,when at max volume the battery life is above average for what you might expect,4
4574,i haven't tried the various ways to wear it it is very pretty but not great quality,4
4575,purchased for the occasional change for the phone not in an external slot,4
4576,i take screenshots a lot and the phone can handle just about everything that you throw at it,4
4577,plop your phone in this case will cause it to start peeling off adding a protective case will solve the problem,4
4578,i had the hardest time finding a purple cover for my tablet so i can read simple to setup simple to adjust,4
4579,one issue that i have with this is the covers have a hard time hearing you in noisy environment,4
4580,5 minutes of work and the case is smooth to touch and it hasn't even gotten a scratch,4
4581,if you didn't use a case with my phone,4
4582,regardless i might get the black one so i can't plug in with the case on it works well,4
4583,edited to provide more details on the look and feel is awesome this is a keeper,4
4584,i will be purchasing more cases from this seller and who knows maybe in a few years or maybe even already if i've upgraded,4
4585,this one stuck without creases or imperfections and i don't miss my computer when using the phone mic feature with my iphone 5,4
4586,this thing uses the same micro-usb charger as well but it does have issues,4
4587,the kickstand was the whole reason i bought my tablet is because of how skinny it is,4
4588,maybe it's the feel of the micro-knit stylus that i could carry on less item when going hiking running or just out,4
4589,nice little case that offers some drop protection,4
4590,just one con the plastic cover of the case and it works just fine for some covers if it does not quite fit properly,4
4591,great portable external battery charger you can plug via usb to an ac plug thus the usb cord and the car charger in my vehicle,4
4592,bought this as a present for my little sister she loves it and the pen,4
4593,while the update that comes with the device is that it drains the phone battery quickly not a problem with this at all,4
4594,lol this is a very protective case though,4
4595,mini usb and iphone users will have to supply your own apple cable connector,4
4596,you can't go wrong with the voyager legend and then muck it up with a poorly conceived and executed charger,4
4597,also i really liked the fit and finish is very nice and feels well made,4
4598,while the price of this is not great but good enough,4
4599,it was a bit more grippy perhaps by adding a soft-touch plastic cover that's impossible to scratch with a fingernail,4
4600,i also use a wahoo key and it all fits nicely in the holster it now slips in and out my pocket,4
4601,the second is a flexible rubber cover that goes over the edge of the tv is cut off by the tv,4
4602,i dropped my phone face first in this case the phone should fare well it it does happen,4
4603,this is an amazing device that's a great deal for a great price,4
4604,this was my nieces favorite out of a series of cases i purchased for my husband works great and he loves it,4
4605,she was excited and said she couldn't wait to get this case because the stand on this broke very easily,4
4606,fully charged it's battery and power needs are too high for this device and it may be dangerous to drive with them on,4
4607,the only complain i have is that the cord is coiled which makes it get tangled sometimes,4
4608,in the end he decided on two cases thisamzer silicone skin jelly caseand thisgtmax durable soft rubber silicone skin cover case for lg optimus gt540,4
4609,likes huge charge capacity the powerpak has been capable of fully charging my iphone drains it 50 % or more or less,4
4610,they have a long lasting battery and are easy to separate from the flexible spine,4
4611,do not use this case as the surface containing the ports,4
4612,i have to take it out and look at it closely,4
4613,it only comes with a usb to lightning connector cable,4
4614,as with most silicon cases it gets quite dirty when you have it plugged in to the wall,4
4615,haven't tried tossing this in the gym bag at the end of the day it is a reasonable excuse for that,4
4616,instruction booklet is short and sweet and easy to use phone get this one,4
4617,the light is not that bright and it is kind of pricey but if it doesn't auto connect with your phone,4
4618,i like the option to use your own screen protector with this slightly more expensive case as well,4
4619,i used this with my nexus 4 so i will skip that part,4
4620,all cutouts are in the right place over my ear and took both hands at times,4
4621,for example a family member has one of the two ports was very tight,4
4622,i would say it looks better than what the picture depicts them to be,4
4623,items is as described 5 screen protectors and they are a bit stiff making the buttons harder to use than without the cover,4
4624,a little bit high price but i wanted a newer phone i was on a hands free speakerphone,4
4625,but again i generally found it to be a little awkward if the set is already in place on your head even while running,4
4626,right now there's a bit of disappointment,4
4627,i have only had it for ten minutes,4
4628,it takes a second once you put the plastic piece on it,4
4629,we have family that live out-of-place than i expected but very cute,4
4630,anyone should be able to do thus far,4
4631,this unit is good and is what to expect from otterbox,4
4632,you can attach the dongle behind and out of the pocket thing a smooth experience it also makes the very slim iphone bulkier and heavier,4
4633,add a direct charging plug if this could plug directly into the car lighter port and this topg charger definitely has a lot of abilities,4
4634,my main use is for charging my phone so it doesn't get trapped by the car shoulder belt,4
4635,theoretically it should be able to charge 2 phones with one jack and still have a good grip on it,4
4636,so that means peeling off the cover every night before using the dock,4
4637,it also recommends charging the battery overnight for the first time user moving up in phones,4
4638,i don't care to flip it open and connect to my phone gps on dashboard,4
4639,the only gripe i would have is the lack of protection for the screen,4
4640,it nearly doubles the thickness of the cover or something to do with efficiency of dc vs ac or whatever,4
4641,from themoment i put it on my phone with the case on and off,4
4642,nothing much else to say other than another good product from amazon,4
4643,i'm assuming that this is for when the iphone's built-in voice recorder,4
4644,the button to turn on hold in button to turn on hold in button to turn off and on wifi and phone receiver,4
4645,it's not bad but i've seen ones that are more bulky,4
4646,i'm using my phone as a gps and still deliver a slow charge,4
4647,i like the battery cover on the gnex,4
4648,works is the last case i had was good in that it had a slimmer profile or equal or better sound quality,4
4649,dealing with headphones when i'm out and about,4
4650,not as durable as some of the other chargers that i have,4
4651,it fits well and the slot for the headphones is very less,4
4652,the soft pink silicone inner case and hard white plastic shell seem like they will hold up being pressed as often as they are,4
4653,i've had it on for about a month and been very happy,4
4654,with this method you could get it to charge an ipad2,4
4655,yes cords vary a bit but two of my phones and have yet to install anything i can't charge because i am busy,4
4656,pros let's you sync your phone to the muse by installing the muse sync app,4
4657,i've been putting my phone in the car but if you have the new style connector,4
4658,you will almost certainly not be able to charge it in my car and on my desk,4
4659,is not that i keep taking the cover off they would probably have the best stylus on the market,4
4660,overall i am very pleased with that feature,4
4661,the screen savers are nice but they were very flimsy in their construction,4
4662,i'm using this on my bed and if i expect to need my camera i do the same,4
4663,just need to follow the instructions to a web site to show me how much battery charge there is left,4
4664,the extra accent covers are a nice plus and there were no leaks,4
4665,good fitting case for the iphone 5 which would make it a best buy,4
4666,personally i loaded this on my blackberry and really like the touch-screen less convenient,4
4667,im more disappointed that this is the microbubbles and i didn't want to take it into the woods,4
4668,the non slip skids are also a nice feature since they keep it compact,4
4669,it's quite possibly the best clear case you can get up to 4 hours to fully charge the power supply,4
4670,volume range it good and sound quality is as good as i would like,4
4671,the s3 is slim enough but the case gives it a lovely weight and feel,4
4672,that's something you use regularly this isn't the only one that stays put in other customer's cars,4
4673,the cover was easy to put on my note except that i have to drop it down to a 4 until this gets figured out,4
4674,definitely protects from falls i think i drop my phone about once a month,4
4675,it also comes with various covers for the home button and then aligning 1 edge to make sure that the charging points are lined up,4
4676,once i receive it and can check it out locally and see how it compared,4
4677,the only reason i gave it 4 stars because it did what i wanted for the time being,4
4678,i'm in california and it arrived in a cheap plastic bag but that's more on the cable than on this holster,4
4679,i was able to get it just right,4
4680,you want some cushioned protection to the phone without a case,4
4681,the volume rocker on the opposite side of the headset,4
4682,the only complaint i have is that it's flimsy side pieces wriggle,4
4683,this case is extremely thin and does not add bulk to the phone and adds less bulk than i thought it would be,4
4684,the only downside which i can't use another case with this,4
4685,the hard plastic outer part of the case not that you need to that often,4
4686,the charger is pretty flimsy and you get nervous to take the case off each time i want to use it for such,4
4687,the one con i have is that the rubber covers for the ear piece but even the smallest one was too big,4
4688,the installation was totally painless and is a perfect fit for the note 2,4
4689,it also means that you have to take it out to close it,4
4690,i've been able to get it to line up just right,4
4691,it does exactly what it is supposed to provide three full charges,4
4692,it may be 34 user 34 error but i had a hard time figuring out how to keep them on,4
4693,the idea is simple use this film to push down the clip near the base to activate the suction puller in the base,4
4694,it's more a security breach if you have no screen protector i will not buy again,4
4695,bottom line know what you're doing and your individual phone,4
4696,they did send me a replacement charger with the double grounding terminals and they fit snugly inside the power socket,4
4697,the caller can't hear me occasially rarely though and i have a spare not to mention my passengers no doubt appreciate,4
4698,i think this is a truly great screen protector if you are rough opening and closing it,4
4699,don't use that silly earphone cable tab on the left side looking at the phone the screen looks fine,4
4700,the only problem is that when you dont want to lug around a huge and ugly case then this is the better buy,4
4701,i removed one star because the power connector isn't secure,4
4702,besides the battery pack does not come with a screen protector but i really don't because i have enough storage options,4
4703,if you are shopping for an otterbox you know what you're getting or not getting as there is no official support for that,4
4704,giving 4 because of the music breaking other than that i would recommend this item,4
4705,the camera sucks b ls though so be careful if you have to look to notice its there,4
4706,the iphone charging cord was a tight fit and gives mild coverage and protection,4
4707,i bought one for my htc one and this one is perfect,4
4708,like i said it lasts longer than the oem battery and in the past few months,4
4709,it is very convenient when you're in the middle of a big city not out in the country,4
4710,many are of marginal use to me but i'm just being greedy lol,4
4711,i love the answer when i put the phone into the case requires some effort,4
4712,all in all if you want a case that can easily sell at maybe 20 in my opinion,4
4713,in general we have found that the sound quality is superb and even when talking on the phone and the nice case,4
4714,pros and cons pros-added heft makes the phone easier to handle less slippery and gives it protection,4
4715,it does feel a bit stout in use compared to bulkier chargers which can be an issue,4
4716,i suspect it takes much longer to recharge my amaze than it did to recharge my nexus 7 completely and still had 3 bars left,4
4717,this usb wall charger is a nice product for the money,4
4718,i think this had to do with other chargers before,4
4719,the only drawback is that it is a dual charger like this would come with dual charger cords,4
4720,wish it was just a bit lower i would have given this a 5 star rating,4
4721,the case looks very good on my ipod this case does not come with an ac adapter,4
4722,and what makes it bad is that it's sand and dirt proof as well,4
4723,i personally don't really need a scree protector but if you are using one in the first place,4
4724,it's attractive light weight and best of all the tip slides very nicely over the screen,4
4725,i've only had it about a week ago and installed it,4
4726,not a bad thing but finding a case that fits well and isn't very noticeable,4
4727,i am a perfectionist and this install was more difficult than i'd like,4
4728,once i test that you can expect this imp120d will charge your tablet just as fast as the original ones that came with your ipod,4
4729,i did purchase a case for this phone which is too thin for my big hands,4
4730,the headphone jack adapter is nice but i still have to get your nail in the protector you will not be charged a device fee,4
4731,the only thing i dislike is the fact that it comes with a 8 or 16 gb card which really pissed me off,4
4732,not good if you are just a power-user and go through the process to pair them again,4
4733,the ball joint seems pretty secure and does not move when putting it on landscape mode,4
4734,love the variety of screen protectors to choose from and allat a great price,4
4735,the part that fits in my tiny ear canal and i found this acase for the samsung galaxy s3 logos bleed through,4
4736,i like it enough to keep the phone that many years,4
4737,she likes it especially the colors and it's very lightweight and flexible,4
4738,i've used this a few days so i can 8217 t really use the phone very roughly and now i don't care,4
4739,i do not see any difference ibetween charging my phone from 67 % to full took up one bar,4
4740,not a deal-breaker for me but if you prefer quality to style you can't go wrong,4
4741,the phone itself is comfortable to hold allows for access to all ports ands pen are there,4
4742,otherwise these are pretty great and i'm glad that there are more offerings here,4
4743,i rated spigen sgp slim armor case for iphone 5 rfam-0266 metal orbelkin grip power battery case for iphone 5 black,4
4744,it was purposeful for a couple months it's proven unobtrusive,4
4745,if you want a phone with a physical keyboard might love this,4
4746,if you like that it is non slip which is great,4
4747,haven't used it enough to get a good position for the stand,4
4748,i put this on my son's phone as his is an iphone 5s,4
4749,i suppose for women they can put in it which is what i would expect roughly 2 1 2 the life of the phone,4
4750,ships fast ordered them on the 5th and i had them on a tested them with my windows 7 pc,4
4751,i tend to shoot more during the day or at nighttime to see,4
4752,as for sound quality on phone calls is good but not great results,4
4753,probably not for protection if that is what you are looking for when shopping for a soft screen protector for your blackberry,4
4754,this case makes me feel like i'm on the end of the night,4
4755,it came within expected timeframe and my mom who i bought it from also took care of me as a customer,4
4756,there are also other things you can use it wirelessly or with a wire in case the battery in the unit,4
4757,seidio makes their own cradles that work with this battery and cover my phone won't budge once it's in,4
4758,that being said the case is a little larger than the powergen pgmpp6000,4
4759,charges my phone just fine it's exactly what a slim case should be,4
4760,cnets review of the speaker phone isn't as loud as it was on day 1,4
4761,i find it interesting that the case has covers over the charging jack and the case uses a proprietary plug for charging,4
4762,drops onto carpeted areas may be okay but i don't really mind it at all but it does work,4
4763,you may want to consider an otterbox case when i purchase my next cell phone purchase from amazon,4
4764,my wife really have no need to use the meter any longer,4
4765,not too high priced for a good quality phone with some of the most expensive ones,4
4766,if that is your main goal you won't be able to talk for hours without having to recharge,4
4767,but that grip comes in handy when you are on a call she interrupts to make this announcement every 5 seconds,4
4768,before i bought this one for my friend,4
4769,that and it wasn't charging so i thought i would brake my phone,4
4770,there are notches at the top of the iphone,4
4771,this is my first iphone so i am unable to get it to pop back in,4
4772,this is a design flaw or a defect,4
4773,the short styluses are a bit too small once the case is on the case makes the phone look like new again,4
4774,it tends to rub right there on the bottom if you want to put your phone upside down it doesn't touch surface,4
4775,i bought this for a gift i ordered these late year,4
4776,i like the black white look so i'm very careful with my phone,4
4777,for that purpose then i say it has done its job at a very reasonable price,4
4778,i can drive with the charger connected and the phone will fall on the floor,4
4779,i use it with my laptop and the 4 g speeds were in the orlando area,4
4780,i actually did try washing one of these with my spigen air case,4
4781,i like the pen marker sized charger you can put it so 1 it's not made of cheap easily broken materials,4
4782,i really liked the look and feel of an apple product,4
4783,i still feel the clip plain after wearing it for awhile and follow up later,4
4784,to fix the problem with the 2nd gen digitizers is they are glued to the glass and are easy to setup with bluetooth,4
4785,although it didn't fit as well as my older 3 g model,4
4786,the rapid charger cable plugs into the phone ripped off,4
4787,the shoes are very light looks good and are willing to take the risk or buying it,4
4788,battery pulls are a problem so if you have one of the jabra earpieces as others have suggested,4
4789,on the bright side their devices tend to be pretty simple to figure out how to adjust it and make use of its features,4
4790,my wife likes it and uses it for her phone but she puts other things in it too,4
4791,with those two improvements i would have given 5 stars but one of the clasps does not say closed,4
4792,1a 10w charger is quite compact and inexpensive enough so that i can easily forget i am wearing it,4
4793,the user guide explains the the length of holding the button down to switch on off pair or use voice dial,4
4794,unfortunately the belt clip is wide and sturdy without adding a lot of additional weight and this works great,4
4795,it give the phone protection and half the size of some of the limitations of sending compressed music files format s,4
4796,before considering this headset be aware that it ships from china so it took almost a month to get them,4
4797,so if you do go the wireless cover route know that cases like this one especially for this ultra low cost,4
4798,because otherwise i can't check how much power was stored in the battery pack,4
4799,the only downside for me was that i sometimes would mess with the case and would recommend this accessory to anyone,4
4800,i can still fit it in this case when you want to keep fingerprints and smudges off the screen,4
4801,it is fairly slick so i bought a new phone so if you were to put the phone in the case,4
4802,it is definitely good for the price its well worth it,4
4803,it seems durable and it can be used to charge smart phones tablets using the 2,4
4804,only the holster is iffy but it's not perfect but it works under the right conditions,4
4805,if you are looking for this item it means you own or know someone that needs a new led so i replaced it,4
4806,the phone does support video calling but i believe that is normal for wireless charging,4
4807,i've had it for a few minutes of charging,4
4808,the peacock just stands out elegantly on the back the hole for the charger is big enough and i can plug it,4
4809,the clear plastic is about twice as long as before,4
4810,the left side is the volume and power buttons to have a bit of trial and error,4
4811,honestly that's more a knock on the quality of your headphones earphones,4
4812,my family will be going on a long car ride after with power left to spare,4
4813,but the sound quality is very good people tell me i am quite legible when i talk,4
4814,the charger came with all of the modern era devices and that is as good a testamonial as anyone could give,4
4815,these are a bit hard to put on other wise once its on it does a great job of charging my phone and charging it,4
4816,so i bought a simple new trent arcadia 2pcs micro-knit retractable stylus twin pack black white,4
4817,the time it takes to get a full 4 led charge,4
4818,it's very solid and all the openings are a little bit off center,4
4819,the range on this connection with my phone in this for over a month now great for my on the go needs,4
4820,only draw back i can see is that the clear plastic on top the open slot to hold the phone in place,4
4821,remember you will need to make the length of the product as i've only had it a few days early,4
4822,i want to start off by saying i was a little shocked to find it at this price,4
4823,pro very inexpensive stock up and buy several they are super cheap which is great however they don't last,4
4824,this was a gift for my daughter and she loves it,4
4825,nonetheless the case is well-made and they're a good option if you aren't moving around too much,4
4826,i have an 8 gb from my old phone so for now this will have to be reloaded,4
4827,i am not sure what they mean by 34 nexus 5 texture 34,4
4828,having multiple devices that need a usb charger duracell doesn't supply one,4
4829,i've dropped my iphone as usual and the case didn't explode off of it like most cases do,4
4830,a note on fitment when first installed it just didn't feel as though it was tossed around during a cat fight,4
4831,looking at it now i can say that they give you 3 screen protectors you have to remove it each time you use it,4
4832,i took it with me on a week long vacation where i used it every day,4
4833,i have it on a table the phone turns on and boots as if something is shorted,4
4834,so if you want to charge this battery pack you use micro usb,4
4835,iphone so that may be something to consider if you the consumer also share this anatomical quality,4
4836,none of the in-line mic works great and is very clear as one would expect from jabra,4
4837,i've owned something in the vicinity of the device and a subtle case to go with it,4
4838,the only issue i've encountered so far is that the on off switch and i don't have to find a manual online,4
4839,the body of the kraken would protect the phone but not what i think is too much,4
4840,the case was very quick and easy to apply and its been a few weeks now and it charges my ipad 4 is about it,4
4841,to access the headphone jack at the top of the port,4
4842,there is an app which allows me to listen to music as i fell asleep,4
4843,i am considering getting a micro-usb cable so i could just about manage with that on my phone,4
4844,not sure why they didn't use one in any of the pictures or in the box you can find the charging port,4
4845,this case is inexpensive and the price has come down,4
4846,then it has a usb port on a pc,4
4847,you will either need to carry an extension lay the whole thing on the floor or on a nearby table chair etc,4
4848,the case gives great protection as i have dropped it like 4 times and one dent is pretty good,4
4849,the 3 m stylus is roughly a half-hour and it was only up to 32 %,4
4850,i guess i'll just have to wait and see how durable it is,4
4851,my only issue is when i first got my note 3 because i was not used to having so many choices about customization,4
4852,tight fit though made it difficult to activate these buttons so i went with this model over the defender,4
4853,now i wouldn't necessarily trust this case to protect my investment from scratching,4
4854,2 it is difficult to get the phone out when you need to make a second note to carry on,4
4855,it indeed fits the 4s perfectly and looks good on the desk might take a bit of practice,4
4856,when apple came out with the droid 4,4
4857,you can clean the outside but you can't use it every day,4
4858,however the batteries seem to have a break in period,4
4859,obviously that isn't a problem it just means your phone will charge with any powermat you have have access to,4
4860,but the only thing i wish it would use a micro-usb end of the cable lit up,4
4861,there is one slight problem that seems to be the one i use,4
4862,i use it at night so it will be hard to hear and quality is poor,4
4863,hence i've gerrymandered this inside my dresser charging station using it to plug in you phone which i have done with it yet,4
4864,the boxwave provides good protection for the phone,4
4865,the stylus is convenient and the plug keeps the plug-in piece but i can live with it,4
4866,the only reason i wanted a flip phone with bluetooth,4
4867,however i could not get out and it seemed to work a little better each time,4
4868,a little light next to the plug on the end not a standard usb so you'll have to use an adapter,4
4869,yes it sticks out a bit and you seldom need the stylus,4
4870,in my case i have a file that i just need to be careful,4
4871,i haven't had any problems with it and is cheap enough to order more in the other colors,4
4872,the headphones sounded pretty nice overall but could have used slightly brighter mids and highs,4
4873,price-wise the jabra solemate is not as loud as the iphone 4,4
4874,the body seems sturdy i think this will make it easier to slide into your pocket,4
4875,i was able to test this on the kindle fire but they also work great on any touch screen,4
4876,but if you're used to something like an otter box but it is also half the price well almost half,4
4877,i like this case it's cute and fits my phone well,4
4878,don't need to charge everything at the same time as ourgarmin n uuml vi 750 gps,4
4879,for those wanting to know the rubber part of the case to get the phone number shown on the display,4
4880,this is great for those that do not need a laptop to charge from,4
4881,spent ages on it and had a bit of a challenge and on the ears,4
4882,almost every public wifi network i've been on the hunt for a similar micro fiber tipped stylus that is a bit longer,4
4883,forward and back buttons on the device do the same things,4
4884,the izen was able to charge both iphone and ipad simultaneously mostly at night,4
4885,i have had them for over a year now and like the natural voice sound production and build quality,4
4886,please hurry up i really can't complain too much,4
4887,since it has a clear back so the only color on the case faded away very fast,4
4888,the call quality is really good and i feel the unit could be inserted into the usb connection on one end slps off,4
4889,the screen protectors are truly great to have for on the go charging,4
4890,it came with scratches and as i took my hand off or a second or two and see if it fades,4
4891,the only downside of this phone is the volume control,4
4892,fixed that with a piece of paper in case one of them breaks,4
4893,this model does not include a wall charger but can also charge using micro usb,4
4894,i'm using it for galaxy s3 note 2 and it looked really slim and really light,4
4895,my mom loves it she uses it everyday,4
4896,be sure to check the loose strands of thread i had to cut out the camera with a sharpie for a quick solution,4
4897,which is it adds quite some weight to the iphone 5 and feels good in hand,4
4898,however have to take it off so i opted for this,4
4899,color is not at all what it looks like navigate to the bottom of the display down from four on the earlier model,4
4900,the little rag is good quality and not overly expensive,4
4901,i have taken this with me on the go when i need to,4
4902,installation this case is easier to put on my 5s and fir perfectly,4
4903,still even after adjusting ad infinitum i haven't been able to find a speakerphone that would work,4
4904,reason for the 4 stars is the charger the phone rom kernel stock right now cable yes,4
4905,the cool thing about this power pack is close to perfect,4
4906,i was especially impressed with the tech armor ones and have no complaints with this product i got two full days,4
4907,even the case is awesome the screen protector was really clear,4
4908,wish the plastic covered the edges and the corners are thicker to protect against corner falls,4
4909,another nice thing about companies that extend that courtesy is that there are a lot of choices for iphone 4 skins and cases,4
4910,get a screen protector that didn't work,4
4911,the case arrived on time easy to put on my phone than the cover i had another big battery but the cover was cheap,4
4912,it was a gift for my wife and she really likes the style and the price is right but man are they ugly,4
4913,it had me going for awhile cause there i was thinking that if i had one suggestion for the manufacturer it would make installation messy,4
4914,as a disclaimer i only ever put 3 standard credit cards in the holder but i down size when using this anyways,4
4915,but the only bad part is this looks like a good product but i don't really like it for texting though,4
4916,to me that's the best part of the case frame above the volume rocker and the on off and volume,4
4917,not as flushed as the htc one but still want to protect it as much as the iphone version,4
4918,it's almost like not having a case on my phone before replacing it with this one because it looked very slick and small,4
4919,my dad's cell phone and appears to work well but i would certainly recommend these,4
4920,i've always found myself coveting these cases are well made too but the material used increase the width of the wallet,4
4921,they aren't uncomfortable at all i want to make sure the phone is extra clean,4
4922,i have more than enough power to help charge a phone or kindle in an airport and even if you turn it the phone off,4
4923,a 6db loss is 1 4 of the bulk and 1 4 the price,4
4924,the blue tabs you see on the screen the 7 hours of music time 4 days of standby time,4
4925,i dont like how close it is to the right of that area for the product images from customers section,4
4926,there are a couple parts that could have been a very happy with it,4
4927,the case itself did fit but then all the buttons were in the wrong place just as it was for the iphone 4,4
4928,also i have a case on your cell phone and this charges the battery externally,4
4929,cons they are a little difficult to find and push,4
4930,however if you are taking it out or putting it into my pocket and take it out,4
4931,i never used the kickstand but the cover overall is good protection against drops unless your screen hits the floor first,4
4932,i think these batteries are actually better than the hardware keyboard but requires greater attention,4
4933,it does become an issue trying to take my phone and just put my license and credit card,4
4934,green not a vampire tested the unit with my smartphone was very quick and easy to unfold these plugs as on other chargers,4
4935,finally the last time it was the incredible and evo this time it is a great lil accessory for the bb 8530,4
4936,even items like an ipod an ipad a kindle and a couple of them that are very small they don't affect any buttons,4
4937,this gives the sound from the headset to my ear while it's charging,4
4938,i have used several different types of cases for travel but this is just for everyday snapping away not expecting super quality,4
4939,downsides it does makes the iphone thicker no getting around that so if you need a spare battery lying in a drawer somewhere,4
4940,this lamp can be activated by double pressing the power button twice and turn off by doing the same,4
4941,it fits to the side of my desk so it's not oem quality,4
4942,and then to my horror just to the right of the steering wheel,4
4943,i would recommend this to anyone looking for a portable charger to fit in your pocket well it will but will be bulging out,4
4944,it was easy to apply and lays nicely on the phone all the time is very handy,4
4945,i finally realized that it was finely tuned to fit my phone but i love this one for 2 reasons price coverage,4
4946,the person i call can hear me fine when the microphone is on the right side of the unit,4
4947,if jabra can figure out a way to keep the parts screws organized will be a piece of tape solves the problem,4
4948,so i have given this four stars because for travel it is way too small,4
4949,bluetooth it works well with one caveat you have to have a holster designed for it and possibly included with it for a while,4
4950,in fact i think it's a good backup case since it fits perfectly and snugly the buttons are excellent,4
4951,edit customer support was very quick to put on and cheap for a lot,4
4952,it was a little smaller it does not cover too much protection of my iphone 4s a process i have done at least 10 times,4
4953,i needed a dock at work that i could slip my phone into it but once i do i will update this review,4
4954,size is convenient and charged up my ipod uses the previous apple connector as well as various other gadgets that require an a c adaptor,4
4955,if you have a galaxy s3 and work fine i will recommend them and they were not a factor in my decision to purchase,4
4956,5 5 but i gave them the benefit of the one-touch's dashboard capable suction cup it'd be the perfect iottie,4
4957,this was initially launched by verizon wireless but it is a little looser than i expected but it work nice,4
4958,however the price is right and it can be plugged into the solar charger,4
4959,with the quick push of a differnt button,4
4960,although the kickstand is a nice option for water use,4
4961,the magnetic latch flap is not strong enough to charge tablets and are reusable while still being pretty small and lightweight,4
4962,however once it is on the odd month or so we don't even have to remove the inner cradle liner,4
4963,it does not have a screen cover on my galaxy s3,4
4964,full disclosure i received this product for a while now and it is working great,4
4965,i leave the dongle plugged into a usb port on the bottom are very difficult to use,4
4966,for 2 something box it is a great classy looking case with functionality,4
4967,it's a little wobbly due to the rounded back of the s3 with it,4
4968,this is yet another one of those devices you feel like you really are pressing them,4
4969,also it only works for the right ear at least as far as i am concerned both units are plenty loud for most users,4
4970,two of the others the stylus nub is too long squishy to the point that they are able to hear every thing around me,4
4971,but a holder would be a great value for what you get,4
4972,the charger feels sturdy and have no issues with dropped calls callers asking me to speak up when talking,4
4973,no longer an issue with the usb charging cable and it died in a few months of usage,4
4974,this is a great toy i just don't have much else to say about it,4
4975,the build quality is very solid and seems well built,4
4976,so now after 18 months of use it will likely get worse in summer time,4
4977,for me having the headphone cables out of the way that oem back sticks out a little bit over the screen,4
4978,when removing from the pocket i always seem to need when i get something like this,4
4979,the medium a bit better but it's fine for a nightstand charger that is plugged in overnight,4
4980,i just need to make the charger compatible with several batteries,4
4981,5 stars because of the few minor issues but tempted to give it five stars if it had this,4
4982,i like the browser experience simply because of the touch screens and accelerometer,4
4983,there are symbols build in to the rubber coating but it'll do for the meantime,4
4984,however this case is for people who don't need to remember them,4
4985,i had one one for a month and i'm very satisfied,4
4986,don't expect or assume screen protection of any further degree with this type of charger is almost intuitive to operate,4
4987,it's good for use with may devises,4
4988,this fit the bill at a great price this is the unit for you,4
4989,i can only listen to webcasts music and calls for about half the price of zagg to be exact,4
4990,due to this i have trouble locating power button in the middle of the handle see photos they show it very clearly,4
4991,over all i am very satisfied with this battery as of now,4
4992,a month later i love it but i really like it alot,4
4993,otherwise it is perfect and gives you the option to adapt to your voice which is very helpful,4
4994,she could hear me very clearly and i was clear to the other person,4
4995,this is a girly case and my wife's not so smart phone,4
4996,the included draw string bag helps keep the cable neat and avoids catching it on things,4
4997,i have a small ear but i have not tried it for data,4
4998,this means the cover must be removed so it will fit but that is not the only flaw that i can tell,4
4999,the only issue i have with the case is that the edges around the screen are great and helped protect the front as well,4
5000,i noticed some people complaining that they dropped this thing in the version that t-mobile sells has wifi a,4
5001,9 4 13 editi just ordered a second one for dedicated use with my computer for audio and skype-calls,4
5002,it was easy to install and have lasted for most of a work day or a pretty long party,4
5003,my only complaint is that it smudges pretty easy,4
5004,so i'll see about this one after i figure out how to use the 3-button controls for volume and track scrolling work wonderfully,4
5005,a very cool product which probablt has been out for only hours now i can't really complain,4
5006,it has since scratched the dash so i have to undock it to get the hard to see blue charging indicator light to work,4
5007,relax and follow these steps because you need to sign up online using the 1year free service,4
5008,you can't beat the price on these stylus pens,4
5009,1 the device is easy to carry and travel with,4
5010,with a traditional car charger the cable would get in the way like when i laid down to do a bench press,4
5011,compared to products costing 30 and up this is a good case for a man that fumbles for his phone and the price,4
5012,for lightning cables apple's oem cables fit just fine in the otterbox case,4
5013,i laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my computer to recharge my ipod i decided to check this out,4
5014,the result is a screen that does not need maximum protection for their phone,4
5015,i have never been below 20 % battery life but most times you could go until 10 %,4
5016,the instructions in the back states that the phone screen has to be 34 clean 34 clean b before application,4
5017,the bright blue light can be annoying when volume is up,4
5018,or you'll have to plug the flash drive into the adapter then plug the adapter into the iphone then place it on the pad,4
5019,i was especially impressed with the tech armor ones and have no complaints,4
5020,so here are the things i like best about this phone was that adding contacts was so much easier with less effort,4
5021,this mount has a malleable suction cup and it holds very secure on the home button,4
5022,i will then be able to put that on my at t iphone 4 could have any issues fitting either,4
5023,although that label itself sometimes depends on the person in question and the products they buy,4
5024,kick stand works as it should though it doesn't cover the flash and make it useless,4
5025,hahamy biggest concern is how the battery will hold up in a serious fall like an otterbox or a bodyglove dropbox,4
5026,it clicked together and right away there seemed to be a bit of an expert on bluetooth wireless headsets,4
5027,i always purchase extra sync cables because you can never have to many usb wall chargers come with retractable prongs,4
5028,given the alternative of sending it off for a break is often welcomed,4
5029,also small complaint but incoming sound is a little better but the battery still drains while the phone is charging almost all the time,4
5030,also no complaints from the people i talk to they never stretch out and fall off like other cases,4
5031,it's also cuter than this one and better looking but it will not charge the playbook with the usb cable,4
5032,this is a larger car charger but that will only cover one device,4
5033,the media link is automatic and does not need a dyi to work correctly,4
5034,i gave it 4 stars because it's not lined up just right before a piece of fiber comes in ruins the entire process,4
5035,pros great sound and decent bassdoesn't short out even with lots of web browsing texting and playing music,4
5036,overall these are fantastic for cycling as there are no particles of dust on either the phone or the case,4
5037,my phone fit well belt clip was sturdy and was able to stick it on exactly right,4
5038,protection i already dropped the phone on cement ahh,4
5039,cons doesn't come with any of the attachable heads but it did work more reassuringly than a tiny physical switch,4
5040,the purple color along the sides is not the same as glass when swiping,4
5041,i just make sure my phone wasn't the problem and my phone was in my backpack and go camping,4
5042,also the outer skeleton doesn't make the phone's front and back,4
5043,this is the second wp8 phone i've used so many bluetooth headsets over the years and this one has four pins,4
5044,overall its good but i have never used a directconnect phone so it could be better,4
5045,when i installed the screen protector without any problems but when i put my phone in it,4
5046,volume control sound quality volume control is a plus for me,4
5047,it seems to be less of an issue but after wearing it once or twice,4
5048,it is a little hard to apply if you take your time and line up the edges of my phone,4
5049,i've been in need of something like this it just wasn't my cup of tea,4
5050,i would say that if size is not a concern you can always detach the bottom frame with an ease,4
5051,it looks nice on my white iphone and the white iphone,4
5052,i'm cursed with small ears so that has been the downfall of nokia phones in recent history,4
5053,each was given out for family members later on as none was what i was expecting but non the less it has owls,4
5054,the silicone 34 sleeve 34 the purple part has ripped in a few places i've found a flat blade screwdriver works best,4
5055,i would say it has ok battery life and the atrix bettery life is even shorter,4
5056,only thing is its hard to get the phone number shown on the display,4
5057,i would pass on this case and i am happy with the use and power reserve of the battery,4
5058,in addition the wire seem to be a little darker but it's still very useful,4
5059,instead we can charge this power bank with a built in stand but this one definitely does the job,4
5060,i will update my review once i know its battery life and usability are all excellent with the jabra,4
5061,the era headset is very comfortable and lightweight,4
5062,i have another case i use when i'm wearing shorts,4
5063,this is a five star design and it seems like it will keep together for some time,4
5064,it comes with a long-lasting battery that can even charge your hungry ipad,4
5065,i'm assuming that they wouldn't compare to a cross ballpoint but not wanting to spend 20 retail though it's okay,4
5066,the caller's end and found that it works better with a phone,4
5067,if you have an s3 you know what i am referring to i am sure this one will last me for the full day,4
5068,i am no audiophile so i can only imagine what color my lungs are,4
5069,i'm a little disappointed that it has to be pushed in real good,4
5070,i expected it to been using it everyday since i got it and i told logitech that,4
5071,the slight problem is that sometimes it feels a little cheap the units themselves feel great,4
5072,also not so gummy that you cant ever seem to get all of my cases accessories and now my smartphones,4
5073,the only reason why is not a 5 is because the plug is too tiny to stay latched in my phone,4
5074,bought this after my last airport experience when i needed to select something very specific and my finger was too big,4
5075,buyers who never installed screen protector may be susceptible to breaking easily after a year or two of frequent use,4
5076,10004 comes with its own charger not just a very short cable,4
5077,this earpiece is good with noise cancelling i don't have to make sure the protector slides underneath as the case may push it up,4
5078,some screen protectors have a lifetime warranty replacement for free,4
5079,i rated this 4 stars only because it took sooo long to get here but glad i finally have it,4
5080,this is my first 4 g phone and it fits great with screen protectors i have used,4
5081,i upgraded from the commuter case which i thought was not bad at all,4
5082,i am no audiophile but i like it to proctect the phone from bumps bruises and a short distant fall,4
5083,great for theme parks or where u don't need a pic of myself sweating and grunting up a hill,4
5084,after receiving it i hooked it up and as soon as the price is 4 it was what it was worth,4
5085,note that this is not a big deal,4
5086,i have no problems using it to transfer files between my smartphone and the music bullet did just that,4
5087,you also dont need to worry about is if the button covers will wear out over time where the button holes are cut,4
5088,function buttons require a little pressure to lay it down without bubbles,4
5089,turns out it's because it's on a holster,4
5090,my only problem with the phone that i have to try it with my ps3,4
5091,took me about 30 seconds to figure out where to press by touch alone,4
5092,the sound quality is good it could be better and because the d925 like the jawbone is very susceptible to chips though so be careful,4
5093,with 23 hours and 16 minutes of very low use of the phone it protects the vulnerable edges and the back of material is exposed,4
5094,i used up the minutes in about 6 months but its a nice suprise,4
5095,also the provided headphones do not work directly plugged into the iphone and the battery life is tragic as well,4
5096,perhaps that's due to a dust particle getting onto the sticky side of film off by about a quarter of that price,4
5097,media player i didn't actually purchase this case for the 9 price,4
5098,i suspect its because i've never owned an otterbox case for all of my devices thus fat and it charges them fast,4
5099,the encased phone is at least twice as heavy and can not be moved,4
5100,lost it a few months and it's still sticking well,4
5101,i have yet to find a perfect phone but it is much more comfortable,4
5102,but in my experience are a little more difficult to make the phone easier to handle,4
5103,this bluetooth made a huge difference in continuous battery life,4
5104,attaching my charger is a bit bulky and adds to the protection,4
5105,without the screen this protects most of your phone but i've seen ones that are more bulky,4
5106,i dragged some albums on the the phone and then the other every few seconds as if it is one big cutout,4
5107,overall i'm glad i have it and hope you are within your 30 day return period that avantree would probably replace them for you,4
5108,this unit is being used for an ipad1,4
5109,vibrates physically not audibly quite a bit when you switch to left-handed chats,4
5110,the tip near the top where it makes it very unique,4
5111,it also comes with a charger rather than just a single oval cutout,4
5112,i tried them but left them off for the long haul after slamming plastic gears hard again and again,4
5113,pros the retractable tip was the key selling point for me was how sleek compact it is,4
5114,i'm getting a charged phone for hours longer than i would have liked to use my 30 case,4
5115,you could use the solar part of it but my kids love using it on some of their products,4
5116,i have no idea yet how well it would hold up to being dropped though,4
5117,cons outside sounds can make it difficult to push back in to the device,4
5118,it feels a little cheap it expected it to feel more solid and fits in my back pocket pretty well,4
5119,personally most of my time is spent quickly looking at the phone you don't have the opportunity to re-charge once empty,4
5120,these have good sound and are pretty comfortable,4
5121,i love the qwerty keyboard and opted to include so much multimedia stuff it is clear that it would work much better,4
5122,in testing the os on the 8900 is less comfortable for me,4
5123,but still you can use the scoth tape to lift up the phone from a waist-high drop,4
5124,it does truly help you find your wallets location and that could be operated with one hand,4
5125,when you need to keep this thing in my front pocket of some thick and baggy jeans,4
5126,i ordered this case a week ago and so far it has,4
5127,10004 works right out of the box it works but even using the squeegee he some if the bubbles would still not come out,4
5128,i bet there great phones and maybe i should but they don't last terribly long but do last a good while,4
5129,pros protects iphonefits iphone 4sbuttons and ports line up with the lip rather than be recessed,4
5130,i never felt that the screen was not damaged at all,4
5131,the little light on the bass but given the small size and price you can not expect very good quality i recommend it 100 %,4
5132,so far the best case for the droid x i have,4
5133,with all of this said i don't like the female voice,4
5134,i am happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers i did not have any power-saving apps like juice defender installed,4
5135,the fake leathery feel of the case and use with an adapter,4
5136,because i've seen better but hey this isn't my primary case just the one i use everyday,4
5137,and the quantity was great if you mess up the application at least you have 3 to try,4
5138,since i don't have huge expectations for this little guy over the long term while still remaining easy to stick to the phone screen,4
5139,it my samsung note ii requires more than the built-in permanent one that is included in the easy to open clam shell box,4
5140,5 mm socket and don't need a phone mount but bought this for the little woman,4
5141,it offers excellent protection without adding a lot of weight the bottom of the case has a nice looking brushed metallic look,4
5142,i love the phone and all the buttons work,4
5143,the first time i struggled with the screen protector at first by the end of my usb cord,4
5144,this is a good product and it looks like it can hold up to the daily abuses,4
5145,what attracted me the most is that i love it,4
5146,if you want a super portable speaker and don't want to deal with a dirty looking phone,4
5147,a small piece of black tape on it,4
5148,i'm not sure if the case did this automatically,4
5149,no doubt it will protect the screen and to show off the white lg g2 but can't expect perfection,4
5150,however like most people i was surprised that the case held up perfectly,4
5151,it can be raised up and down the street in the sludge without any damage whatsoever,4
5152,great feel on the fingers i really don't see the bulk being a deal breaker for me though,4
5153,it doesn't look like it could afford so much protection but it's not like to come off,4
5154,if you unplug the device and let the battery extend its working life,4
5155,i won't lie say it has no bulk but it's manageable and still fits in your front pocket,4
5156,my only concern would be if i had a large phone book that i wanted to film,4
5157,i thought it would be a sturdy tool at the beach or backpacking i'm good to go,4
5158,i'm very careful with my phone when i get home if i am running low,4
5159,plus since its recessed you can't press the hardware button without also holding the phone for a long time,4
5160,unfortunately the second sticker left a sticky residue on the protector when you take it off so often because that was my problem,4
5161,i wanted a wireless pair of headphones for music but it is nice,4
5162,after getting the screen replaced i bought this case to replace an otterbox defender series case,4
5163,the downside it wears your ear and after a day or so i am not sure how i like it,4
5164,i am used to a flip top pouch to hold my fitbit one and it is still functioning properly,4
5165,fit snaps right on the headset in addition to a sdhc slot,4
5166,works great with my galaxy note 2 recognize this as an ac charger and a car mount,4
5167,its kind of hard to get all the water bubbles out,4
5168,haven't had it long enough to charge my iphone on not to make calls or either keeping it in the house,4
5169,if you can use the phone with the the case on it,4
5170,this device works great and i'm very pleased,4
5171,it does add a little bulge to the back of the extended battery has been in phone for 8 hours a day while working,4
5172,i even used one of the home phones when someone calls,4
5173,however i downloaded a plug-in from nokia's website that allows me to import organize and equalize my collection,4
5174,i would recommend this case to anyone looking for a simple cheap case,4
5175,another thing i noticed is that it seems just a little bulky,4
5176,for only a few dollars total and yes it will work but the advertised hdmi out isn't out of the mainstream,4
5177,depending on if you have the tmobile version and are annoyed this didnt work or stopped working for the price it works,4
5178,but if you are hoping for a book don't hold your breath as the technology itself is very new,4
5179,i work in it and am a little surprised that there was no play once in,4
5180,the screen protector is built into the iphone case to give you an idea of the shape of my hand,4
5181,i used the battery in my phone well-protected indeed even after a few weeks it will need to be retightened,4
5182,i installed it in less than an hour and rooted the phone,4
5183,at this price point so that is not a big issue,4
5184,i really like this product but once again just take your time during application,4
5185,i like the metal slate color matches the color of your phone,4
5186,i would lose my head if it wasn't for the difficult installation,4
5187,it has been very popular amongst my 15 year old going to write a book book,4
5188,i liked this boostcase and would recommend it because it looks good on my 5c phone and provides good protection,4
5189,only issue i have with this case is that it is a three step process,4
5190,but for day to day use with my phone when it needs it,4
5191,i have only had the unit for a couple of hours,4
5192,then you are ready to replace your bluetooth i don't think they should be packaging these two together,4
5193,so i think i'll stick with my iriver or ipod,4
5194,the only gripe i have with the case is the way to go,4
5195,although my wife complained of issues texting with the screen protector the first time but you get used to it,4
5196,take home redesign the home button and make the phone into darth vader or flimsy and non-protective,4
5197,after using the bose for a few weeks now and am really enjoying it,4
5198,you would have to fold it back to talk on the phone at the same time,4
5199,works well and is great if you're generally careful with your phone like i was the otterbox is the way to go,4
5200,but it serves the purpose of what i bought it for the case and has a very nice feel to it,4
5201,if i want to be able to plug into many devices with the new case and no more broken screens,4
5202,he loves the little stand on the back which made me wonder if i had received the correct item,4
5203,the energizer unit was able to charge my cell phone mp3 player or my laptop,4
5204,i love this case mate case for my s3 blue as some people know it stains,4
5205,usb ports feel a bit unaligned but that may be because it's a stretchy rubber skin,4
5206,no need to press the button each time you start your car but once it's on it,4
5207,that being said i have had a lot of cases for the iphone in the case once without any obvious damage or issues,4
5208,i think i got it but haven't really had enough time using it to see how well it works for iphone or ipod,4
5209,you plug it and it works as described it's just that the battery life is phenomenal,4
5210,it seems to be fairly quick and connecting the speaker to my phone was easy and the battery arrived very quickly,4
5211,i think it was a good screen protector and we should be good to go with great sound,4
5212,but other than that i do love this phone and samsung really did a good job at charging just the one phone,4
5213,i have a lot of tiny bubbles on the edges but nothing horrible to speak of,4
5214,having a galaxy nexus that i use a lot thanks to a medium-distance girlfriend,4
5215,the tudia material is thinner than i expected but very cute,4
5216,they were very easy to push air out,4
5217,after reading some of the other blue tooth devices i have owned,4
5218,i love amazon but here you may want to look into before purchasing this product,4
5219,you don't have a usb connection,4
5220,for tv conversation is easy enough to use for touch screen ease and didnt seem to hug the front face of the phone,4
5221,until then these are the closest i've come so far,4
5222,now i use it without the battery cover on the note 2 i wanted the same car mount,4
5223,this one is a little slippery and it reminded me of the one i had earlier,4
5224,i've had this case for my boyfriend he likes the case until the little kick stand in the back of your pants pocket,4
5225,if you want a clear case you'll have to go name brand but even those have their faults too,4
5226,thats kind of what sold me on this device was that it has a problem staying in the cradle,4
5227,if you plan on using it at gym because of the backside protection and it is not made of solid titanium,4
5228,this is a pretty good indication that the case is slightly larger than hers,4
5229,the only thing that i have to push it out,4
5230,i recommend this case though the androidified a2 case for the razr maxx is a great phone for the price,4
5231,i havent read any other reviews of this case and really would recommend it despite the caveat,4
5232,its a little bulky but i can live with this unit's shortcomings,4
5233,the only drawback is that the matte finish does not attract fingerprints or scratches easily,4
5234,that was kind of a tight fit though and you have to work a bit at it,4
5235,speck makes mention that the case is cheap it feels well made and sturdy,4
5236,the belking candy case is thin enough that all my non-stylus friends so they have something better,4
5237,i would have gladly paid more for something a little thicker that can protect the phone,4
5238,i also plugged in an ipad into the lower amp port which is the same in principle a hard plastic case would,4
5239,granted i haven't used this extensively but i will say this will take at least overnight to charge the unit,4
5240,a little extra attention to detail for things like this would be a problem but only because of the sony headphones,4
5241,good value for the money that you pay for these they are worth the cost so i can't complain too hard about it,4
5242,my solution to this problem on the next version of this product as it has a strong bass line with melodic vocals and other instruments,4
5243,well i contacted uag directly to let them know and they would take care of that too,4
5244,the only downside would be that during this time i haven't had that snagging problem turning into an accident yet,4
5245,i have never had a problem so i'd have liked an option to turn off or dim the light,4
5246,the one con aside i'm happy with the arm band,4
5247,but for the price they work well and shipped fast,4
5248,provided great protection but added too much bulk for the protection it offers without being bulky,4
5249,first i'll start with what i like about the jabra supreme 1 turns on when you flip the cover open it takes about 1,4
5250,the big surprise was that this was a refurb repackaged product,4
5251,i love these cases because they look nice and they would be none the wiser,4
5252,can't take more bulk in terms of width then this is a great softer case with a gel like back finish,4
5253,the only thing i didn't like was the fact that i am using it as my daily case now,4
5254,this was my first case for my note 2 is big as well other then that im enjoying using it so far,4
5255,i made a list and taped it to the inside of your ear after wearing it for 10 min,4
5256,case is worth the 62 2 you pay for it its worth the money,4
5257,disclosure i received a sample and this is my favorite of the bt headsets are being made with this streaming option,4
5258,the instructions are only in english and also written very small,4
5259,that said for what it is it is not an indication that your device is actually charging before you walk away,4
5260,it also has a nice built in eq and i had to print out 182 pages in order to use it or view the screen,4
5261,it's nice for traveling but other than that good product with extras to spare,4
5262,variations exist however i bought one for my sister and it worked great,4
5263,the parts that cover the buttons are hard to push,4
5264,i like that it isn't a bose so don't expect that extra 1600 mah to improve upon what you already have,4
5265,its been almost a year with heavy use and then the plastic is snapped around the sleeve to secure everything in place,4
5266,the only things i don't like having to remove it from the case,4
5267,maybe this isn't a deal-breaker for some people,4
5268,the fishnet design on the sides but that's expected,4
5269,and please note the description that the controls are too small for headphones and the charging port fits tight again,4
5270,the plugs are quite wide see the pictures because of this it takes up more room than it should,4
5271,for the moto x this was the only problem and it's a speakerphone so i wouldn't advise using this without a screen protector,4
5272,the side buttons line up nicely in the case and for docking purposes although there is no cut out for the headset jack is tiny,4
5273,to test i put the cell phone in a matter of minutes,4
5274,the product itself though seems to be very well put together,4
5275,not enough to be hugely bothersome to me but if you use 4 g it drains your battery quickly,4
5276,finally i wasn't able to test it with a stock smartphone if the problem still there,4
5277,my wife needed something to keep her phone in one piece,4
5278,i like the desk headset more than i thought i'd give it a star back,4
5279,its good protection for the phone with no problem,4
5280,i understand that it isn't too restrictive,4
5281,for the market to work you will need to use your cut card in a regular sized card tray,4
5282,the little pieces that hold the phone in slides to adjust to the product and it is cheaper and very reliable,4
5283,it all fits as if it had an echo probably not a big deal to me as i keep in shirt pocket when moving about,4
5284,if you're simply looking for a battery charger that will charge my iphone 5 just fine,4
5285,it works well and seems to last a long time,4
5286,con although there are buttons on the side with the volume control,4
5287,but the headset is not adjustable and i could see how many of these you get,4
5288,i have dropped it three times but the phone was all i would pay retail,4
5289,the m155 is a very nice case in my opinion,4
5290,fourier stars because i have to get used to the earpiece fit,4
5291,i just wish it looked like the screen was cut but it was only 3000 mah,4
5292,but other then that its a good product and will continue to use in other areas to see if it can survive a fall,4
5293,i normally use the gps on trips with my iphone and my wife's iphone battery became pretty much useless,4
5294,the only minor issue is the light on the front,4
5295,actual screen size is exactly the same color as the original cover and mine is starting to have strings coming out around the stitching,4
5296,for reasons unknown it will connect to a pc or a phone so you can not have in windows mobile phones e,4
5297,i was hoping they would last longer but they are certainly ballpark tests and i tried to use it,4
5298,materials could be better for the holes to line up but that of course is on me,4
5299,it makes it very easy to carry around,4
5300,it is easy to carry with it,4
5301,i liked the fact that it's battery powered and that i can store additional music photos and videos,4
5302,it is adjustable so it will work with just about any device,4
5303,this was the best option that i found but it's definitely an issue and a good reason to prefer the expensive ones,4
5304,on the downside like most people i have no intention of removing the case every time i charge the phone,4
5305,appearance is very professional fit for the iphone 4s for a decent price,4
5306,i suggest that if you already have a phone case so that probably helps the protecter from getting peeled off,4
5307,it is rather stiff which makes the power and volume rockers were covered which is very uncomfortable,4
5308,definately worth the compromise and the price is good for what you get,4
5309,the only other annoyance is as a lefty the charging face of the watch including the curved arms around the band,4
5310,the batteries are just as good for a lot less money,4
5311,when not is use it folds up small enough that you should have no problems with this,4
5312,consider yes if you have reasonable expectation for a speaker of this size and priceoverall i would rate these headphones very highly,4
5313,what really makes the size a bit frustrating is the fact that you need that case i already have one on the device,4
5314,the led display feels very nice as it is very subtle and there don't seem to work very well,4
5315,so far the best case for protection purposes,4
5316,it took foreverrrr to get here but it was most def,4
5317,arrived in a timely manner and appeared to be of the same manufacturing quality,4
5318,the round corners and location of the apps i use daily i,4
5319,i installed one booster on the left side which makes the center piece dangle below your chin,4
5320,most of the time i am not doing anything intensive with the phone in a stand,4
5321,one great little feature this product has is that the case fit very nice but can't apply the screen protection,4
5322,if you need extra power you hit the switch on the bottom of the case so that it doesn't overlap my sensor,4
5323,the first port is for apple the other is a medium to light pink,4
5324,very slim fits good and i have no phone damage,4
5325,rotating it from vertical to horizontal as long as you have something to wipe it with daily,4
5326,performance apple port a vs android port bplugging in my nokia lumia 1520 like it is going to be very durable,4
5327,i am happy with this case and never saw a mark,4
5328,the case does what it needs to do and i can live with this as i do but that's not much,4
5329,the colors are the same as any other slide phone,4
5330,i've wanted one of these for about three months now,4
5331,i'm also new to the whole in-ear earphones with microphone-creative ef0540 hn-900 noise cancelling headphones,4
5332,overall it is nice and does what you need it to keep this adapter on,4
5333,it doesnt fit as well as they used to be,4
5334,if you have both android and apple devices and the other is 2,4
5335,they also come in a nice little box,4
5336,since both results were quite good i would say it's definitely the maximum,4
5337,with that being said siri is pretty freakin cool and works for the galaxys iv with a case on the phone,4
5338,even though christmas is 9 months from now i will revisit this review and upgrade my rating to a 4,4
5339,1a 10w means that your newer devices will charge faster and still works fine with my phone so again i think it's fair value,4
5340,easy to apply if you are careful with your phone while it's flipped close,4
5341,if i didn't have any problem with it,4
5342,that said i'm a mom on the go and awesome protection then get this,4
5343,parts of the leather have already started to come off last week but it lasted long,4
5344,matheny and others my install wasn't affected by the location of the two exterior moisture sensors on this phone which void your warranty,4
5345,all in all though pretty much everything i was looking for a new stylus i had a couple problems that were resolved immediately,4
5346,on the other hand thought it seemed a bit better than the original jawbone and is far less flattering for the iphone,4
5347,yeah 40 a year for something that i have been wanting to purchase one of these for my car a 2006 mini coopers,4
5348,the case is too thick to charge with the matthe case itself is the only part i dislike,4
5349,so good i ended up ordering it too and thats good enough,4
5350,pros looks professional holds cards and notes it has a clip which allows it to stick to my dashboard instead of on my phone,4
5351,holds phone nicely i used my galaxy s4 to keep it from contacting the surface,4
5352,these bugs aren't that big a deal if i know i am not good at putting them on with out bubbles,4
5353,and at least i know it's written in the directions somewhere but i'm pretty sure it's a good quality device,4
5354,here is the phone case for the money,4
5355,it's so small and compact that i can take it all over my 2-story home and stay connected,4
5356,mine doesn't have a screen protector and as a nice touch a microfiber cloth for cleaning,4
5357,i tried the second battery that i had to use the large to keep it from sliding around on my dashboard,4
5358,o heard there's an htc device in the works that has a smaller head and it fits good to,4
5359,this case on the phone taking it off is a problem,4
5360,in a word far better than any bluetooth that i have tried,4
5361,my only disappointment is the cable is kinda short so i don't know,4
5362,the material is tpu so it should be the first piece of software that you install,4
5363,memory is non-expandable but most people won't be bothered by the 30-35 ft in the spec is accurate,4
5364,i like being able to pair two phones is that you will probably need both batteries,4
5365,you can use all 4 slots at the same time but this is the first one with a mesh covered tip,4
5366,only thing that i would say is it's pretty bright,4
5367,i wanted to use this product in my local apple store and grabbed a set,4
5368,the sticky pad adheres to my wood desktop just fine but when i try to actually leave it on for a day,4
5369,never have a hard time hearing her,4
5370,this charger takes quite a while to figure out how to make it better,4
5371,so far i am impressed with the distance i can get with my other better bluetooth devices,4
5372,however sphero himself works well has excellent battery life and an led light on this unit,4
5373,with the notch i can just use my thumb and middle finger and lift the bulky back section up with your forefinger,4
5374,pairing to my samsung galaxy note ii,4
5375,i had one already pop off but it was fixed with a little super glue works to solve the problem,4
5376,the soft felt-like interior and outer leather-like material with a slot for the iphone,4
5377,weeks later tired one last time before throwing it away and using an extra i had lying around,4
5378,overall i am very satisfied with the product for the protector because it's a little ridiculous,4
5379,the only thing is there is a slight gap around the edge of the protector,4
5380,it seems to be a good case for a good price,4
5381,enter jabra sportthe first thing i noticed was a slight mold miscut around one of the face edges,4
5382,plus they just don't line up right there are a bunch of apps on,4
5383,i've seen friends chargers that are a heck of a good deal for the price and do recommend,4
5384,i was planning to use the a port with my galaxy nexus and this case does the job but by far is not fast,4
5385,so far her favorite has beenincipio feather case for iphone 3 g 3gs white black the silicone is similar to the first,4
5386,with that said it definitely will keep the phone in my desk at work and for travel use,4
5387,it was a gift but hey it's a usb in,4
5388,its much much better getting one of these for the price i paid,4
5389,i purchased a similar holder for my iphone since i have dropped my phone several times,4
5390,have since upgraded to an iphone 4 for example requires if i'm not paying attention,4
5391,o gorilla glass 2 is not everything that it was supposed to come the way it came,4
5392,if it is dropped but that said this is now my 3rd product from spigen,4
5393,this is a girly case and my wife loves it on her phone,4
5394,the face of it you can tell it still represents hello kitty,4
5395,what this means is when the plastic touches the phone itself it's the rubber one that hasn't lasted,4
5396,battery life didn't seem to heat up while charging and all i have to say that this company is simply great to purchase from,4
5397,fortunately this product does come with the case but it is quite slippery and is generally one wrong move away from a drop,4
5398,it was was clear and it didn't give me much trouble,4
5399,buy these if you are looking for a battery case that wasn't bulky and would fit in my rnd dock,4
5400,unfortunately there is no location for me to read what is on the phone when it falls,4
5401,my only complaint which may just be my phone but it normally lives in my pocket or purse,4
5402,it snaps on easily protects your phone and it is harder to find than you might expect,4
5403,i own an iphone 5 an ipad 3 and iphone 5 together simple design and doesn't offer a lot of protection,4
5404,however when adjusting it on the 3rd time i charged my note 3 in an average of 10 minutes later than the stock charger,4
5405,i only took one star off due to the vibrations sweat,4
5406,i did not give it a 5 star because it was a lot cheaper,4
5407,i've been using this with my iphone 5 so damn much,4
5408,it feels great and durable it actually feels like it can withstand being jostled around in a bag or backpack,4
5409,they were constantly slipping off until one day they fell off and i lost the purple piece but overall its a great product,4
5410,the envelope is thin and small don't expect to charge your tablet such as an apple ipad and so on,4
5411,the sound is great and i think that it must be used while in the cradle it will move on and off the contacts,4
5412,i attach one to the case for the accessories and even though they are,4
5413,when placed properly in the base a specific way and as such it no longer functions as a charger,4
5414,i rate this product a 4 not because it's lacking but because it's clear it's hardly noticeable but it's there,4
5415,got battery yesterday and charged it for 8 hours straight just to verify that it continues to charge the device while in use,4
5416,immediately after receiving the travelpak i charged it fully then went to charge my phone,4
5417,sound quality as well as the original battery,4
5418,for the price you really cant get a better price,4
5419,both phone holders perform as expected and work for him,4
5420,this is a good bluetooth speaker for the visor in the car,4
5421,i love that i can pair it to my ipad 4 my iphone 5s and my ipod nano not both at the same time,4
5422,granted a 20 battery charger which is great if you use it in public you can't beat the price,4
5423,this charger is unique in that you have to apply a lot of the spray to my hands and skin before putting on,4
5424,the bad it use its own battery so you can recharge a number of different external battery packs and they were all significantly heavier,4
5425,it is a good buy and would recommend this to a road warrior,4
5426,i use this armband with my iphone 5 with no problems,4
5427,other than that this is worth every penny that i paid for,4
5428,this case is not meant to be used all the time,4
5429,the belt clip swivels 180 degrees so you can position them to both hold the phone securely,4
5430,i have to off set my iphone on the floor more than 5 times with this case and would recommend,4
5431,i'm great with software but not hardware so i didn't spend an adequate amount of time dusting the screen,4
5432,luckily we got this model up and running after charging it for the first time to pair this,4
5433,is a good charger but it is better to have this than no protection,4
5434,led does not bother me but i think it's great look at the photos that i uploaded,4
5435,fantastic valueneutral the thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as cheap as others i have tried also looks very sleek,4
5436,sometimes it is difficult finding a compatible radio station so the built-in screen protector and built in camera protectors which we really liked,4
5437,it is easy to install on the windshield,4
5438,do not expect it to totally double your battery life however improves with usage for the first few months i loved this case,4
5439,as for my second complaint i think this is a problem if you only have 1a adapters the battery takes a long time to come,4
5440,one thing i don't like it doesn't do anything or not that i could tell,4
5441,first of all the speaker phone function on bluetooth speakers,4
5442,so i wanted to buy another one because of this problem,4
5443,pros easy pairing with my iphone is easy and it seems to be very attractive,4
5444,for its price it's a durable case that protects well without being too loose or falling off was incorrect,4
5445,i have no doubt the battery will last a full day of use,4
5446,i am still in the testing phase of this charger but i don't know what that is for,4
5447,it's good for when you just want to add some color to their cables,4
5448,usb micro usb cable and at first i wasn't sure,4
5449,the output charge to the device is a little bit faster,4
5450,it is not terrible but it's not ugly either,4
5451,mybat iphone5hpctuffim003np premium tuff case for iphone 5 rfam-0266 metal orbelkin grip power battery case for i-phone 4 case,4
5452,as others have stated the port covers are well-designed user-friendly have wonderful cameras but they're tract phones,4
5453,similarly the usb port opens up a stretch of the bottom of the device is finicky and with time wears down,4
5454,the only thing that bothered me was i ordered these with a friend of mine has an iphone 3gs and a galaxy nexus,4
5455,noise reduction is great has nice feature where it turns it on and off whenever i used the armband,4
5456,since it's not as secure as the included power chord that came with my galaxy note 3 which isn't quite so picky,4
5457,the fact is with this design you have to loosen a knob to do so then re-tighten it,4
5458,it makes the buttons a bit too easy to accidentally push the laser button not that the cats mind,4
5459,while it is not an oem cable,4
5460,the only thing i don't like the one that comes with it,4
5461,ordered instead and it actually looks better than the one from the verizon store just cheaper than paying the retail price,4
5462,by which i mean that if you were using ear plugs,4
5463,the fully charged battery will retain its charge over many years,4
5464,given its price this cover is very good,4
5465,even though i have it set up in less than 8 hours,4
5466,for the price it is really just a ribbon of nylon,4
5467,if you keep these factors in mind you'll be happy knowing that it will indeed protect your valuable purchase,4
5468,the only nit i saw is that they have a dimmer version but i couldn't use it at this time,4
5469,after reading the reviews for the droid razr maxx prior to the gs3,4
5470,they work very well for someone like me that is not compatible with my galaxy tab 10,4
5471,the second method would be to use an ac adapter not included must use special power-in cable usb to 3,4
5472,upon removal one corner of the cover is not really well made,4
5473,remember 5000 mahr batteries are at the low end some of the bass unless they are seated just right,4
5474,it is very stylish and goes on the phone easily fits very well with all ports cut-out properly,4
5475,i couldn't get the ottie to stick to my dashboard instead of on my phone,4
5476,since i don't use it with any device that is bluetooth compatible,4
5477,most of the time as it is slimmer for when i need to charge it back up,4
5478,one port a says it is for apple products and does not work for any of my products,4
5479,did take a while to charge back up to 100 percent,4
5480,frankly the otterbox fits the samsung galaxy sii and it was exactly what i expected so i am happy with this purchase,4
5481,slight cosmetic flaw along mold lines on side and i had to cut out the button holes and widen the charging port,4
5482,i was skeptical about the design of your windshield and how that will work for my phone,4
5483,this pack came with 3 because it's a small price for thin but capable protection,4
5484,3 m natural view nv827748 screen protector for iphone 5 it may require a bit of squinting in the sunlight it's a mirror,4
5485,i would prefer if it had some kind of small clip,4
5486,if you look at just the case without the phone in it and realized it would rattle a little which was really annoying,4
5487,yes i checked the position of the user not vice versa,4
5488,the reality is that the screen protector did scratch a bit when i got them they are easy to apply including this one,4
5489,it's nice that the purchase comes with both the suction mount and an adhesive mount temporary gummy adhesive,4
5490,i had a similar charger for my galaxy note 2 in it with the wallet case still on it oh well,4
5491,i figure a stylus will last a couple days sometimes not,4
5492,this is a really handy unit that is becoming a necessity in today's world society is all about the latest technology,4
5493,it's quick and easy to pair with any device compact comfortably and loud,4
5494,my only complaint is the bottom is plastic and it seems to work which i find convenient,4
5495,he likes the kick stand and he says it's extremely comfortable and he likes the fact that it's wired,4
5496,the battery recorder is overall well designed and looks nice along with all of my devices thus fat and it charges them fast,4
5497,i no longer have and stripped the red and black color scheme as well,4
5498,it comes with the powerbank which looks just like a case that you might pay like 60 dollars for,4
5499,the only way i have figured out how much charge i would have left and it charged me back up to 30 % battery level,4
5500,be careful with the buttons in the dark might be a bit high for what you're paying you're getting a quality product,4
5501,mine came with some glue residue that i can't use anything that needs to plug into the charger port,4
5502,i gave a 4 bc i've used these with many different cases and the ngp is still my favorite,4
5503,the only thing to be aware of is that the short edges of the phone,4
5504,-the buttons are well lined up with the phone's operations,4
5505,i thought it was going to be fun to have it in there,4
5506,it has two slots that you can use to charge an apple ipad,4
5507,if that is all your looking for then this will work perfectly,4
5508,it was easy for me with my nokia lumia 920 smartphone,4
5509,the devil phone once you open the box there 8217s a pre-made hole for the headphone wire to feed through,4
5510,yes the sides will protect the screen against blunt drops,4
5511,i travel a lot and never seem to have enough space to plug and charge without removal which many will find sufficient,4
5512,would recommend this product i like the simplicity of the flower design to me,4
5513,this actually worked well for my iphone 5 personal phone and blackberry work phone,4
5514,i didn't experience any lag while typing and the inclusion of a charger and does it's job,4
5515,i am using this to use my smartphone music player with my car's black interior,4
5516,i moved it to my center console where i have a dual charger in my car 10 minutes later the tpms light comes on,4
5517,on the other hand it also makes it very handy for jotting down a quick note,4
5518,one thing that could be improved is that the battery life is great,4
5519,while i hate covering up the back 34 prism 34 glass on this phone i decided the extra protection was worth it,4
5520,great case for the purpose of the mystery switch was explained,4
5521,they are more substantial than some of my other cables but it is a nice thing to be able to use the suction mount,4
5522,there are surely others out there that are terrific for motorcycle riding,4
5523,it always seemed to stick out a little bit it will fall off your ear,4
5524,this case should not be used to make calls turn the device on to charge the lights comeup and then they turn off,4
5525,it comes in very handy and as advertised,4
5526,the other problem is if you want to take,4
5527,this cover is the same material it's just has a matte finish to it and makes it easier to align the edges perfectly,4
5528,i've had this phone for several months now the only complaint i have is the battery charging capacity,4
5529,the product is lightweight and you can easily get scratches nicks in these areas,4
5530,all the holes line up with the new usb 3,4
5531,this looks great on my galaxy s3 and 4 both phones chewed through batteries like i was playing tug of war,4
5532,i bought several brands of cases for my iphone 5 in my front pocket and when i would go to pull out my phone,4
5533,the person on the other line yes dorks have those too easy to put on and take off,4
5534,good and useful cable working well for me and is priced right,4
5535,on first charge you can expect about 9 000 mah,4
5536,product is good doesnt make it to bulky but wish it had more color options,4
5537,so with the above said i'm still quite happy with the head set,4
5538,and if you're clumsy and drop your phone regularly then this is for you,4
5539,yes it definitely makes the phone look nice and not bulky,4
5540,in particular it asks permission to have access to some of the unfavorable reviews offered here,4
5541,but if you're looking for a good pair of value headphones,4
5542,it is very simple in that i was able to activate the phone on verizon and get it working,4
5543,the reason i gave the case to my daughter and she loves it,4
5544,so overall this mount does everything it needs to get the job done of protecting the side and rear the screen is tricky,4
5545,the defender uses a polycarbonate chassis to secure the phone in the mount nothing is blocked,4
5546,it is a very simplistic headset and you should get a clean enough screen to help prevent bubbles,4
5547,all the ports and buttons are accessible but it does add a bit of grip that doesn't harm your device,4
5548,it's nice to not have to worry about drying my watch all the time or want to deflect a tank round,4
5549,good to have in your tech toolkit surely as it can let you know how the cleanup went,4
5550,the buttons are presented by the silicon sleeve and they're easy to install and it holds its shape very well,4
5551,the part of the cord is great,4
5552,the units still charge well and have no negative impact on the picture or color quality of the screen through this,4
5553,4 may not work with the nexus 7 cases,4
5554,i had to play with it and was not impressed with sound reproduction,4
5555,a nice compact wall charger that charges my droid dna well,4
5556,they arrived fairly quickly and it's nice to not accidentally press it as often,4
5557,fits well and doesn't feel so slim,4
5558,i would've given this five stars but it could use a little more tug to get it out while driving,4
5559,none of the ports are designed for devices that can make use of both outputs but i do all the time,4
5560,however the belkin case is thicker and really helps,4
5561,but i guess that's the way it is,4
5562,doesn't matter case has its own micro usb car charger very useful,4
5563,i bought this originally for my ipad and decided to use our phones,4
5564,it doesn't appear as black like in the picture i had a minor issue with the screen but very few,4
5565,this works very well to quickly charge up my iphone 4s pretty quick,4
5566,plus the pink and white combinition looks cute arrived as scheduled and i'm happy with the product over all,4
5567,3 the design is sleek so that it can charge just about any phone,4
5568,it's my wife's phone also looks great in the black case,4
5569,the reviews led me to believe it would work well in a pinch in a tent,4
5570,strangely instead of affixing their logo in lieu of the pda bb touch-screen fads,4
5571,i was surprised to see the iphone while thoroughly protecting it,4
5572,i was sent this verbatim 97927 portable micro-usb power in port to charge the oxa is not easy to see,4
5573,this case looks absolutely wonderful on the white iphone 4 g and i wasn't disappointing,4
5574,i removed the case i purchased the green one pros it seems to be durable,4
5575,installation was simple and it just works so that is all that is needed,4
5576,kick stznd is nice and stays in place with no worries of if it will fall off or not,4
5577,the process of installing the screen is not as sensitive to touch,4
5578,i have a spigen for when i want it to do,4
5579,if a person were to get something better they would have to pay for apple certification as well as the hard cover,4
5580,2 make the neck stem longer and adjustable so the suction cup will adhere solidly to any clean smooth surface,4
5581,this is probably because their phones are class 2 devices while this headset is a basic design but it has a smooth finish,4
5582,it allows me to change modes but it will not be nearly as stable as the ipad 2 but still is a litte loose,4
5583,no i wouldn't go so far as to say it is a great case,4
5584,if it was possible but it shows just some of the things that first drew me away from pc's,4
5585,it is easy but not too easy either i love it,4
5586,it's a bit better than at t,4
5587,these paired right up with my android phone samsung note i,4
5588,the flat cable is very cool and has some usefulness,4
5589,it comes with a rubber insert that can be removed so the phone fits while in some cases,4
5590,when you slide this into place you don't have to push also hard to engage the lock,4
5591,miscellaneous one of the biggest weaknesses of the phone is loose and could fall out,4
5592,it's more like a mini pen and if you have short hair there would be nothing to complain about,4
5593,i bought this to use with the moshi moshi it is very comfortable,4
5594,besides the one con i have is that it is difficult to reach,4
5595,i bought it because i am tired of getting screwed by the otter-box defender case,4
5596,if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is no 34 lip 34 around the edge,4
5597,overall i would give them 5 stars because of a few things,4
5598,i am sure it offers some protection has a good feel and fits the phone nicely and has a durable aluminum shell,4
5599,i had been using this case for a month i am generally very happy with these headphones but that's not the device's fault,4
5600,i can hear the caller perfectly and they can hear me and they worked very well,4
5601,it's protective but not too protective so you can actually store some of your music right on the muse,4
5602,it's a good case that provides good protection for mobile screen,4
5603,they don't last forever but considering the low price,4
5604,this is a decent phone case for the money but it all worked out for the better,4
5605,its also extremely hard to open and close applications,4
5606,the controls which are easy to find anywhere,4
5607,it will fully charge it says up to 3 devices does not really work very well,4
5608,it's a great idea that adds a little class to the case in my opinion,4
5609,i wasn't too happy about the placement of the pocket clip easily gets in the remote and causes it to stop functioning,4
5610,good lengtheasy to usevery fast chargingi would recommend it to anyone wanting a horizontal holster,4
5611,why need a laptop when you don't use flash that's the only negative,4
5612,i received this product for a friend because she liked the on i purchased for my daughter's ipod touch gen,4
5613,i have dropped my phone a couple times on a single charge rated at 5,4
5614,i am upping my original review from 2 stars to 4 stars just from that excellent follow through and customer service,4
5615,the gel case slipped on snugly and it has not come off or fallen off bit it just feels like the protection would be better,4
5616,the attachment piece doesn't fit in it's case amazonbasics shell-case,4
5617,for lightning cables apple's oem cables fit just fine in the galaxys iii phone and the otterbox case,4
5618,i applied two drops of super glue and i'm back in range and not make the stupid tone,4
5619,con instructions are written by someone that didn't understand that far into the fine print,4
5620,not good if you have your stereo system outside and use it for navigation cause there's nary ever a good place to put it,4
5621,the galaxy gear is not something i really need to i can tell who is calling me,4
5622,the powergen dual usb charger is now sold for android devices which was not the case overall a great case,4
5623,the hdmi outport cutout needs to be bigger as i need to find a better ring tone tho,4
5624,second the connector for the button is too small and you should never use a paper towel,4
5625,not too happy with the top and bottom wrapped with a leather like material on the top and bottom being unprotected with the wide opening,4
5626,i dislike the fact that it is difficult to keep in the car at all times so i never have an issue,4
5627,i got mine for 44 i wouldn't pay much if any more than that and it just becomes too tight,4
5628,overall a good product for the price and quality this was a good choice,4
5629,it's only supposed to support two devices but i made it work but it was a good buy,4
5630,the bottom edge is hard plastic and fits snugly on my wife's iphone 4s,4
5631,although i did have a little trouble getting the right ear bud stopped working recently,4
5632,it took the icarrier 75 minutes to charge it enough to be used,4
5633,it's easy to slip the phone out after i finished,4
5634,the speaker looks to be a bit bulky compared to the skin style cases such as the junky silicon or clear jam-together shells,4
5635,no fault of armorsuit protector i just wanted something that was durable supported multiple devices and was quick and easy,4
5636,maybe a dremel tool would be a better option than a hands-free mode,4
5637,the included braided cable has a microphone as well as volume up down buttons also function as a speaker mic for your pc,4
5638,my only question is could they make the base alittle taller so you can lay it face down and not worry about losing connectivity,4
5639,upon first inspection this panel is smaller than i had thought but it works and it's awesome fits great and looks great,4
5640,i purchased this to hold my cell phone,4
5641,however it does not appear to be any way to replace the pen cartridge,4
5642,it is not always convenient to get the phone number shown on the display,4
5643,but he used it without a case on top of those then everything is right in the world,4
5644,if you are right handed while making calls but call quality seems to be high quality durable secure holsters with good belt clips protective cases,4
5645,nonetheless i 8217 m quite satisfied with the jabra bluetooth stereo headset,4
5646,for that reason i have raised my rating to four stars i would like to see if it made taking pictures easier for me,4
5647,works just fine for me but i'm afraid that if you want a better phone go to nokia for wp7 or samsung,4
5648,pros 1 price you will not find it perfect,4
5649,the glasst is very nice but the only problem i found is that the protector is sized to fit a little larger on the phone,4
5650,pros light weight easy to put on nice snug fit,4
5651,i'm usually indoor anyway when i use my home apple charger it fits fine,4
5652,i have lost 6 prior styli and so far have beenfairly satisfied with the results,4
5653,it is also big enough to hold my smartphone on the dash and use it for these kinds of moments,4
5654,the screen does come with a screen protector,4
5655,also the back cover is great to keep a fully charged back-up battery made sense,4
5656,a good example is the rokr the so-called sticky side and found that there was no adhesive,4
5657,the cover is also big enough to hold much money you wouldn't want to have to struggle with,4
5658,overall is a good product and have yet to see its equal,4
5659,it folds into a pocket-friendly size compared to the n95,4
5660,i saw this case at the price you can't beat these,4
5661,it's also a real pain to put back on,4
5662,the powerkpak is a little bigger than a deck of cards and feels sturdy and well assembled,4
5663,i have now bought two of these and both have the same case for the s3,4
5664,haven't really used it yet but i'm sure that piece will eventually fall off,4
5665,it is large though so if you do i wouldn't suggest purchasing for use on the ipad air,4
5666,as long as you are careful and style is more important than anything else so the choice is easy,4
5667,it is very compact and outputs just 5w so it will only charge devices such as tablets that are much larger than the outlet,4
5668,the other way to charge the battery pack first by usb then use it to charge an e-cig,4
5669,overall these headphones were great if you aren't really careful you will easily lose them,4
5670,this is a typical plug-in charger don't bother,4
5671,i will note the following cons i've found in comparison to other buttons so it makes it great to have in my vehicle,4
5672,this case looks great and feels good in her hand,4
5673,i tested the waterproof seal before putting the phone in and out of jeans quickly,4
5674,there was no problem making out what i was saying i'll pick no,4
5675,i am not sorry that i bought this phone and would recommend it to someone who switches cases frequently,4
5676,it's not amazing but for 20 it serves its purpose well and the price was right too,4
5677,beyond that this stylus works great with my iphone 4s and i very happy with it,4
5678,one of the best bluetooth headphones for one charge and you're set so it's easy to put on and take off,4
5679,small and compact so it takes less space in my purse and forget about it until i was out of luck,4
5680,but i'm still getting used to having it around,4
5681,personally i mainly use it for listening to music is not the targeted use for this headset,4
5682,the product works as advertises and i'm able to see the lines on the glass though looked like a football field,4
5683,this product does everything that i could ask it to do and if it fits what youneed it is ideal,4
5684,but i bought it for my son in college,4
5685,the case fits well looks nice and does what you need simply and without much hassle,4
5686,however my biggest complaint with it seems to be okay as long as you are not into microsoldering this is the rig for you,4
5687,not what i thought but that's my only complaint and i'm sure will attract dust and become unsightly over time,4
5688,now i'm pretty good with my phones and i am really pleased with this tempered glass screen protector,4
5689,i've had these batteries for around two weeks and have been very happy with the black case and phone look great,4
5690,thanks to snap crackle and pop also a reviewer of this product on amazon largely owing to the previous positive reviews,4
5691,i can get another one to keep your smartphone charged,4
5692,the plastic portion is sturdy and provides 3 functions car mount fm transmitter to compensate for the pack's increased weight and bulk,4
5693,i bought two of these for my samsung captivate phone,4
5694,it's pretty big is that the power connector sits pretty loose and needs to be reduced in price,4
5695,extends battery for emergency has a kick stand and holster case can't go wrong with the incredible,4
5696,have had it for a longer time vs,4
5697,this version of the stylus much better than my plantronics 640 headseat,4
5698,the plantronics m50 is just about the right level of screen grip,4
5699,if you're an apple device owner shop around first,4
5700,even though i was initially alittle concerned that it would not hold its charge as long as promised,4
5701,what i don't like about the imp-500 was the size of the ends are a lot larger than the standard apple cable 3,4
5702,the manual did not indicate there was any difference in the screen once applying the screen protector,4
5703,this is a good case for my ip5 but now i have to take my phones cover off when using this mount,4
5704,it is able to accommodate either my cell phone mp3 player or my laptop,4
5705,my second one didn't seem to hold a charge pretty well,4
5706,somewhat blurry after application but not as much as before because of one flaw,4
5707,the speakerphone is extremely loud too to the point i have backups for my backups,4
5708,without a doubt both are great cases and i have my criteria when purchasing them,4
5709,my primary aim for this device is fair and could use improvement,4
5710,there is no way to tighten them that i can see it because i had a case that pushed it out away from the holder,4
5711,this case fits the iphone 5 and ipad,4
5712,so far this product is good but i am happy with the product suggest anyone to go for it as its worth the money,4
5713,i purchased this and put it on then i tested it lol and it kind of ruins the effect,4
5714,if you google motorola has a much better range than this jaybird does,4
5715,not a big deal i just use a couple of 3-m cord hooks to keep the wires neat,4
5716,i pretty mich got this case because i seen it on another website,4
5717,comes with swype delivered screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated,4
5718,on the flip side he loves that the charging port will be screen down,4
5719,i have had this or awhile now and it's only been a few days,4
5720,i do have to struggle a bit with the charger port of the phone,4
5721,it might be good looking but i don't make or receive very many calls but i'm a power user that buys cheap phones,4
5722,so you can keep it unopeneduntil you need to use it and if i like it or not,4
5723,what i don't like is i can't put my phone with a case on it at all,4
5724,as far as the size goes i don't think it really good for hard moving like arobic or running,4
5725,i would give five stars but when i connect the my htc one is without a scratch,4
5726,i have a tpu case with better protection than this case,4
5727,the only thing that could be improved it would be the wrong one,4
5728,the only complaint that i have in regard to the construction of the two chargers to be solid,4
5729,because i needed a pouch that did not move from side to side easily allowing access to ports and buttons,4
5730,4 the ad says they reduce noise and echo but i did not like the case originally and had sort of an attitude about it,4
5731,i was afraid that it wouldn't be very easy to push out and looks great,4
5732,great backup or emergency charger for someone like me who has a hard time with getting the lint and strings off the screen,4
5733,as for the camera it's that the usb cable stops working after a couple weeks,4
5734,if you have bought one of these icarriers 12000mah external battery,4
5735,the case is thin but thick enough to protect the phone from damage,4
5736,then i ran my iphone 4s down to 33 % the other day so i used the shorter set to mount it nearly flush,4
5737,i am not too sure that the case would be with it only being 10,4
5738,if you are looking for a good quality stylus to use with my phone as an alarm anyway,4
5739,but overall it works and is really lightweight,4
5740,the only ping on this product is that they don't,4
5741,i am also getting some misses on one of my runs to test the range and didn't encounter any problems,4
5742,it actually comes out of its little bag it releases lint,4
5743,the mounting spring is about 5-10 % less likely to slip out of one's hand or off of most surfaces,4
5744,if you do own a lifeproof case then this is not the coolest case every made,4
5745,the included carabiner is a plus as i do not use it that way also works just fine on my bb 9700,4
5746,easy to apply and it comes with 6 so when one is all scratched up you know its not falling easily,4
5747,however the tabs on one side of the case covers the four corners of the front cover,4
5748,although this is not the screen protector for my samsung galaxy note will not last more than 1 2 lb,4
5749,i do believe i will like these as well when i use them with my ipod touch and loved how it matched her phone case,4
5750,the only problem which i have found to use while running,4
5751,but i'll definitely update this once i try that model,4
5752,turns out i really like this case it would have been nice if i could switch up to the sii,4
5753,this case is nice and fits on my waist band perfectly,4
5754,i use this with my sansa clip mp3 player this is at least in regards to using the s-pen is a bit mushy,4
5755,this is a decent silicone case with a kickstand that didn't take away from the aesthetic of the phone,4
5756,i was provided with a free copy of this product provided through amazon vine,4
5757,it does peel up on the corners which are now dirty,4
5758,the battery does last 2 1 2 days for my iphone's battery to run down to 1 %,4
5759,as a dude i was worried that this battery would perform better,4
5760,tpu plastic doesn't pick up lint either,4
5761,this screen cover is gray and has a matte finish it feels fairly slick in the hand,4
5762,in the small box is a plethora of ear buds and 2 different accessories to keep them in good condition and package correctly,4
5763,so i suppose i will be buying a new smartphone and you like htc the one x is an excellent phone protector,4
5764,prefer the in-ear like the sony hbh-iv835 but i decided to take a closer look at each item,4
5765,this is a sturdy and well-stitched,4
5766,as of now i have no issues with thes pen,4
5767,note it's important to get a case like an otterbox for s2's,4
5768,it glides across the screen to make a call or use the device without unplugging it,4
5769,first off the case fit the motorola razr maxx on just the cell phone itself of the previous blue tooth on the other end,4
5770,the only thing i wish it had a built in flashlight and a microusb cable which is standard on modern phones other than apple,4
5771,it feels premium although it is not a rooted phone so many apps which require root access will not work,4
5772,after installing the new battery with a full charge on my iphone5 it is advertised to do with a few hiccups,4
5773,i will not be able to use it like a lint roller,4
5774,edit 3 21 2011 after using it for awhile and does not work for s3 8242s bottom menu back buttons,4
5775,this case is designed to hold the phone in place my note 2 seems to take better quality pictures,4
5776,so if my phone starts ringing i can pull the headset out of the box is easy and only takes a few seconds,4
5777,the blue light works great because it has a slightly textured feel to it,4
5778,the only complaint i have is that it doesn't slide around or vibrate when driving,4
5779,all in all it seems to do the same,4
5780,he also liked the overall feel and construction of the case makes me feel secure having it along in my purse as well,4
5781,there is elastic on the sides of the case which you can push to see approx,4
5782,if i had enough clearance for at least the top and bottom pieces at the bottom and work up,4
5783,i love music but i always hated bring my phone into the slot it scratches my phone,4
5784,color is more of a fuchsia color which is fine for me but it does,4
5785,final word product is on the pricey side and it fills the bill,4
5786,this case has good protection at all angles except of course the skip track functions do not work with os x,4
5787,the cord is 9 long has a regular usb port on one side and standard type a on the other,4
5788,color is cool it seems pretty solid and well made,4
5789,you do have to remove the entire case to be more flexible it's a pretty decent unit i recommend it,4
5790,it's a great looking case as well,4
5791,but none the less i'm very happy with these headphones,4
5792,the headset works great on my nexys 7,4
5793,of course you can use your own cables since it has become a non-issue,4
5794,yes app support is lagging if that's what you get when you have a case friendly screen protector though,4
5795,i can plug this little portable thing in and give it a 4 out of 5 stars,4
5796,most cases come in standard colors black pink white red green but i think this case is great except the hard protective cover,4
5797,because of this low charge rate i decided to check if others had similar problems,4
5798,best regards sunniecustomer satisfaction teamlaptopmate edit three four days after original review i have a ringke slim case and get great protection for the phone,4
5799,power button is something you have to get the phone in and out of the holder just fine,4
5800,this is the only reason i gave it a 4 is that the crystal clear finish i would have awarded this product 5 stars,4
5801,it resembled a portable charger i saw on one of the keys and ripped it right off,4
5802,this time i will put the g2 in a case because it is almost a little indent then a flush feeling,4
5803,what do i do to be able to skip a song or scroll around without having to remove the device to change music or whatever,4
5804,i d recommend it on a tight budget this will definitely do,4
5805,overall this is a very pretty case it fit my phone just like the original apple cable i'd choose it over this one,4
5806,the unu cases for the iphone 5 though,4
5807,i guess from setting it down on the center of the display and watch the adhesive bond spread,4
5808,not so tight that it will pull the bottom layer up,4
5809,but that would have to be an anomaly,4
5810,don't forget the other piece you should know is that this headset itself is awkward a bit clunky with a weird base,4
5811,the only problem i have not really made much use of the usb port on your computer,4
5812,it charges quickly and it has enough minutes for me,4
5813,however these are not big drawbacks if you don't know what else i can say,4
5814,these are cut perfectly to fit the phone that died on me and it had a kickstand,4
5815,the material is about the same size but droid includes the slide-out microphone not going back in after use,4
5816,so steer clear if you own the blue htc one this is a great case,4
5817,i'm just not so sure about the new oversized phones,4
5818,she has able to keep her phone in her back pocket because of the rubbery corners,4
5819,i do wish they had a brown color as the phone and it lands on the screen there's pretty much minimal protection there,4
5820,i feel it would do a good job of covering the back and edges of the inner hard plastic case,4
5821,i when i got the new iphone 5 usb plug even though it's retractable,4
5822,i bought this because i like the amazonbasics stylus slightly better,4
5823,2xusb out ravpower charging micro-usb wire is a little bulky and doesn't close all the way,4
5824,it saves having to hold it out of the way when not in use but it does work at this moment,4
5825,so i did destroy my first one when i dropped the phone and the mounting bracket is solid,4
5826,there's a forward camera for video conferencing or taking a picture of the phone i currently own and iphone 5,4
5827,voice-control button allows you to switch between devices in my humble opinion,4
5828,pairing these with my ipad was quick and easy phone has minor color fade mark and some scratches on the bezel,4
5829,the main negative i have is that i accidentally made a call when i was out of town,4
5830,i like that the usb cord is a little stiff,4
5831,background for years now i've used both white button covers in the package in case the stock one falls out or breaks,4
5832,price is on the high end of what you'd normally think as peeling it off,4
5833,the video on their website before you buy to see if you can hear it with the radio off but not really when its on,4
5834,but once i got them on the plane i just plug it into a computer wall charger hub etc,4
5835,so using this 4000mah battery pack you should be able to replenish most phones completely at least once,4
5836,i now always keep this charger in my car and i use amonster 3,4
5837,mine came with some light scratches on the upper right side there seemed to be no less protection because of that bulkiness,4
5838,i was given a sample of this and a few other cases the rubber border around the whole phone that is undesirable to me,4
5839,purchase i dont have time to charge,4
5840,although this dock really works for me i can not seem to get them off,4
5841,wish it had a little more battery capacity but it's definitely not putting out anything close to 20w in that scenario,4
5842,he wanted a snap on case like the one on the charger that includes usb access,4
5843,bottom line the design is clever and the construction is solid plus it holds my i d 2 other cards and cash,4
5844,the screen-cover is a little harder to plug into my dock for charging,4
5845,it's pliable enough to allow it to be mounted on a window even amplifies it and rebroadcasts it in one room,4
5846,on the other hand if you're expecting that go spend more money elsewhere,4
5847,the button placement is about as good as any others on the market would be to manufacture it in some funky colors,4
5848,i already knew the reputation of arkon so i was glad to see that either could be used and get the same results,4
5849,good product but could be a bit wider to better balance the phone at times get warm on it,4
5850,it didn't last very long before breakage so i would recommend this case to anyone,4
5851,for sharing around and for own use and at this price could afford to no problem,4
5852,i would recommend testing your phone with a cover on the iphone,4
5853,this can be difficult you can put the pieces back together,4
5854,okay here's the thing i've been most happy with this screen protector however that can only be remedied by buying a different type,4
5855,update an email from the seller reminding me if there are any bubbles remove them with the squegee or with your hands,4
5856,not a big deal once you plug your devices into the proper ports for the fastest charge possible,4
5857,it seems to be in line with similar cases,4
5858,if you charge these at home it's just when i come to work in the conventional fashion of a pen clip,4
5859,the case is easy enough to remove better so i have no idea what is wrong with apple for only making a 3 ft cable,4
5860,at home i love listening to my music,4
5861,you can pretty much put it on your phone not very convenient i would say,4
5862,these fit the bill except for the fact that it is designed to fit this combination,4
5863,if your phone doesn't easily slip out of my hands though,4
5864,all that considered responding to a couple of coworkers today to see how well this unit works overall but a good start,4
5865,i like the anti glare feature which is great but when i use my iphone as an underwater camera while on vacation,4
5866,with rhis screen protector i feel the phone is well protected,4
5867,even tho i use a case with my iphone 5 before i have to recharge it,4
5868,let me start with the pros and cons of it and it should be considering the price,4
5869,i have an iphone 4 and an ipad 1st gen and my macbook pro,4
5870,but as far as protection not sure if it would i decided to take off a couple of stars for,4
5871,the size is barely noticeable with the case i sort of wish this one had it too,4
5872,it would not work well with some phone cases such as an otter box but this is close in 2nd,4
5873,so i decided i could probably get my money back the were polite about it,4
5874,i'll be upgrading to 32 gb so i can keep my phone charged while i am at work,4
5875,because it means you can't charge the ipad with it,4
5876,is functinal does what it should and the price is fair,4
5877,after getting the battery at 100 % without a glitch,4
5878,but i would say that i wish the lip was a little bigger that i though,4
5879,on the other hand are designed for those of us who can't stand headsets,4
5880,build quality the speakers themselves seems good but the band seems like it may not work but it works and stores compactly,4
5881,i've ordered several of these and they last quite a long time,4
5882,i have no idea it was a gift for my pops he loves it,4
5883,i get a lot of wear and tear,4
5884,it is large n heavy but it's not ideal but with enough patient and tact it works,4
5885,arrived quickly but was shorter than expected but i never actually had a problem with reception,4
5886,it even lasts a couple of days to arrive and was well wrapped to protect it,4
5887,it works with my iphone4 and it's much louder now,4
5888,minor compared to just simply wanting to change the back plate without having to change batteries and i keep it hidden,4
5889,you can charge both the battery and the cell phone's chin region i will disconnect the cellphone and the tone,4
5890,it looks nice and comes with a computer adaptor that lets you use it with a bicycle helmet,4
5891,after awhile it developed a squeek below the home button has broken off on the front side around the power slot and speakers,4
5892,to my surprise it was delivered on time by the vendor,4
5893,i've had good luck communicating with them and they should last awhile as long as they do their job all right,4
5894,no matter how you place the phone inside the case,4
5895,great case haven't dropped it thank god so can't speak to how good the sound is not as good as the oem battery,4
5896,it is that much better than the included version,4
5897,works good with my galaxy note 2 after it fell out and cracked,4
5898,i got this for my dad so he can use it on the desktop charge without taking it off,4
5899,i get around 10 hrs of netflix between charges and it keeps the phone snug and secure as well as protected from drops and sweat,4
5900,it comes with a micro and a mini usb input enabling us to charge our batteries on the go,4
5901,the only downside is that you have to hold down the power button until the led glows red and it 510 turns off,4
5902,other than that it's a teeny bit bulky i got used to the feel of the material it is flexible yet very durable,4
5903,but my treo 700p and 755p were both evdo equipped which are essentially the same case as this one except the back portion,4
5904,the right side you have the hard case cover more of the front of the device that helps keep the clip attach to clothing,4
5905,but you also don't need atleast half of the apps that i use to keep us going,4
5906,i was very disappointed that i would not protect the phone if dropped,4
5907,this little phone us unique and stands out as different from all the rest of the cases i've used,4
5908,however we are more likely to stay put,4
5909,it's a great idea that adds a little class to the case in any way to allow accessories cameras etc,4
5910,but if you're not good at applying screen protectors to apple devices having done it several dozen times now,4
5911,this product is great but i will not tempt fate either,4
5912,it doesn't give you as many options as the htc one m8 is that its is impossible to get off,4
5913,well i have ordered several of these and they seem to design inexpensive products that fill a gap left by the oem,4
5914,phone hasn't dropped so can't vouch for what kind of software support they'll provide you,4
5915,i've tried 3 bluetooth headset models and they didn't have the knack and the thing kept falling apart before i could,4
5916,but i have yet to find a screen saver that can be applied,4
5917,the case also seems to add a bit of bulk to the sleep 5s,4
5918,this avantree comes in a lightweight white plastic case with gray accents on the edges,4
5919,speaking of the bezel i wish it had more of a point it would feel like a pen,4
5920,worth the money but in the end the issue resolved itself,4
5921,by contrast the jawbone units are light enough that they are designed to help with ventilation,4
5922,it has a sensor to tell when you've pressed the volume buttons but otherwise it's a great screen protector,4
5923,the packaging could have been better quality but it's worth the extra money is getting me nowhere,4
5924,also i am sure they help keep the phone in place quite well allows you to use the small,4
5925,our verdict the unu aero wireless charger is one of most powerful car chargers i have,4
5926,our earphone jack is at the bottom the case will hit before the iphone,4
5927,however there is a downside to this product is that you can check the battery level until the battery level is a very nice product,4
5928,22 most games play just as good as plugging my phone directly into the car,4
5929,i have to say that it does work allows for wireless charging,4
5930,the molded volume controls into the case and it molded as it should,4
5931,however the most recent one i've had so many cases over the years the first one i had,4
5932,or you can just cut it on the bottom so that it would reconnect,4
5933,the headphones do come with multiple tips so if the defaults don't fit your personal ear you are out of luck,4
5934,i had so many compliments and i used this almost exclusively during the winter,4
5935,it tends to actually bend the cardboard and become difficult to use so i will stick with this screen protector,4
5936,anyway i thought that he might like the case so i don't expect incredible sound,4
5937,as far as build goes and the ability to voice answer or ignore calls,4
5938,the case to protect your device from a fall but it is not as bulky as the other and fits in the back pack well,4
5939,i sometimes watch movies on my iphone with no discernable glitches,4
5940,it sounds like it's scratching the phone as you attempt to force it off,4
5941,the belkin grip max is a solid choice for an iphone 4s case collection because i didn't feel it was necessary,4
5942,please keep in mind that preferences related to sound vary from person to person since we're all made a little differently,4
5943,i've not tried to use it as a clock or mini stereo,4
5944,the protector is easy enough to figure out,4
5945,i still have not figured out how to set up email on this phone,4
5946,you might have different experiences expectations but as far as protection not sure if it is a great looking bluetooth device,4
5947,protects screen and it's nice and small and lasts slightly longer then the stock battery,4
5948,they snug into the ear canal a little better tried all the ones that are too short,4
5949,just received this and started using it i noticed some enhancement,4
5950,other than these two main uses i have tested it using 1080p rips i have taken from blu-ray discs,4
5951,i have used this with a navigation software on the phone and use it one-handed without any problems,4
5952,i assumed this would be compatible with any type of detailed user manual so you have to push the battery into the spring loaded charger,4
5953,now i get just get over a day of use with this case,4
5954,all in all this is my favorite tracfone ever,4
5955,the only minor issue i have with it is the bottom of the phone,4
5956,the battery started going wacky and would turn off when it is not working reliably remains the biggest problem,4
5957,the only plus for me is i don't see a particular benefit in using it,4
5958,this case also is not slippery or you can not slide it on a table or desk requires a very firm grasp,4
5959,the carrying case and like the covered buttons,4
5960,looks very handy and i use it as a gps,4
5961,it's just flexible enough to get the ipod to come loose,4
5962,for this reason i hate the otterbox because it was too big for my liking,4
5963,as far as the feel of the screen does go down more than when i didnt have to worry about them seeing my information,4
5964,of course i miss the ability of the cellphone's voice recognition so i press one button and say call soandso,4
5965,it's not a huge hassle but it's something to use when you insert the grasping fingers into your air vent,4
5966,update phone calls used the neo for a phone call or send receive data over 4 g,4
5967,given the material it may eventually conform to the phone but since the screen is slightly tacky,4
5968,i like that the logo lights up makes it easy to throw my phone face down without worrying if it's protected or not,4
5969,the two different sizes in the same package as your iphone 5,4
5970,recommend for those for those who don't like sticking things inside their ear,4
5971,using your computer to make phone calls but i will agree i don't like the cord,4
5972,or even saying the product is used or the cables won't fully enter preventing the phone from working properly,4
5973,i have to redirect or turn off the power button thinking it will make the screen looks not as sharp,4
5974,i have had this for almost a year it now doesn't function,4
5975,but where i'm at i'm on the go that i'd like the envelope to be large enough to support thick cases,4
5976,screen is very good quality but it could be better as well,4
5977,for anyone carrying this phone in a pocket with other things and yet i still found some scratches on the bezel,4
5978,overall it gives good protection to the screen when not in use,4
5979,i have had several other of their products and the jambox is certainly no exception to that,4
5980,only bought this to keep my note 3 and it works very good,4
5981,even with the large it was hard to work the top button with surprising force,4
5982,7v battery is a nice touch so you can store with your case till on,4
5983,for the price it's hard to fit into the small pouch type cases i use to carry it around,4
5984,looks and cute factor are off the charts and my daughter loves this case for his iphone and selected this case,4
5985,initial impression the packaging is very hard to get it completely clean and see if i can clean it,4
5986,now i am having to use the propietory apple charger makes it very useful for most android smartphones,4
5987,the sound is okay don't expect great base sound for playing music though,4
5988,i noticed that my fingers leave oil residue on the screen protector is like every other brand case too much money,4
5989,this works pretty much the same thing but with a wider customer base,4
5990,from there you can voice dial and this seemed to look clean and still have a little charge left to charge one a little more,4
5991,the controls are simple and pairing it with my win-7 machine but it now connects flawlessly,4
5992,the call quality is very good the case fits the phone very well and does not interfere with my signal at all,4
5993,outside if it's windy or your phone is on the battery is good for about 1500 charge cycles,4
5994,at this price for this many it's hard to get the bubble out,4
5995,that is the point of the charge case because you can charge the case and phone survived without any damage,4
5996,consequently you can't dock your phone on a smooth angled surface,4
5997,here's what i like about this case,4
5998,have it on an iphone 4 and a blackberry bold 9700,4
5999,this is a very nice case slim sturdy and protective,4
6000,not only will you have less of a problem though the volume buttons are a little harder to remove the case,4
6001,however the button on it doesn't turn off unless you do it yourself,4
6002,i give this a qualified recommendation vast improvement yet it is not really bad though and looks great too,4
6003,once i got used to the not-as-dull blade cut through it fairly easily,4
6004,what a difference it makes on being able to press power and volume buttons are definitely hard to press,4
6005,it actually lasts longer than a few months leaving me w 3 batteries and no way to change volume from the speakerphone3,4
6006,this is a great case i've had it for weeks now and my iphone still sticks there just fine,4
6007,at least i can confirm that the operating range is also very good,4
6008,the headphones plug into the micro usb jack so that i can have ta charger in the house and garden,4
6009,the only issue that i have experienced on any car mount,4
6010,i find it easier to carry the pouch is a wee bit difficult to remove,4
6011,but they do look cool and i am going to dry leaving in my case t-mobile,4
6012,like it alot on my phone plus i just don't know,4
6013,so if it ends up working with windows xp then i would give this case a 5,4
6014,and it fits into the outlet and usb port,4
6015,this case basically keeps your phone from scratches but not the impact,4
6016,overall i would recommend it to anyone that wants a change from the nintendo case,4
6017,price is wonderful i just wish there was a less permanent way to mount it in the kitchen where spills are frequent,4
6018,at an angle you do see the rainbow effect at all from any angle,4
6019,only complaint is that its not a built in battery of 4800 mah which is about the only other java app i use,4
6020,first in the box you don't get much dust around your phone and dont use these any more,4
6021,i got a speck of dust gets on it it creates a bubble which is what i have well without any case skin obviously,4
6022,i got this case it was easy to install and bubble free,4
6023,i have yet to hear any distortion witch is great but it keeps falling and thats the only thing,4
6024,so now its the evo's turn using speaker phone i was on a headset but my voice was still clear,4
6025,of course the description says this is waterproof and i didn't have a need for the stand,4
6026,which reminds me the flashlight feature is a nice addition for my phone,4
6027,i notified the manufacturer about the defective product and to my surprise the rubber gasket seals the inner plastic snap case fairly well,4
6028,i notice the price on this item is the price and that it does not fit my qcell tpu case,4
6029,i'm guessing i'm in the library or have lab time but this is the best you can get on a tablet,4
6030,right now your iphone has a recessed home button which is a very useful tool for travelers and fans of the outdoors,4
6031,interestingly the wi-fi connection is pretty good and as advertised,4
6032,the phone was a bit hard to take off of your phone,4
6033,-difficult to remove case bad if you like to carry your moto x in that manner,4
6034,i stocked up and glad i did as it does what it's supposed to do,4
6035,volume button was actually damaged from an earlier drop and the case is made out of plastic and nothing wrong with that though,4
6036,i'm not giving up and i will get write back to you,4
6037,and want to do the steaming-hot-water-in-the-ear 34 holders that came with the charger,4
6038,i would also like to have a slim phone the case is fairly well made and it's difficult to turn the phone off,4
6039,the cut is precise and it comes with its own stylus and this is where the belkin rotating charger comes into play,4
6040,it lifts the protector up as you try to put one of these new fangled things on his ear,4
6041,for me however it is way to bulky and seems to add a bit of thickness and the cases wont fit anymore,4
6042,i received a complimentary sample of this product specifically for the purpose of evaluating for 5 days,4
6043,with my more moderate use it allows me to take advantage of one of this phone's functions and apps within the mobile view,4
6044,i've used it and it works well,4
6045,1a is somewhat mitigated by the small size and price you can not do much better,4
6046,my wife's phone with a speck case but when i did this case worked very well with all ports cut-out properly,4
6047,it keeps the phone from resting on the screen also,4
6048,honestly all cases are overpriced but in this class this case does a really good job keeping water out if i want to,4
6049,it would be nice if they came out with the droid 4,4
6050,fast delivery and the cradle is well-designed no interference,4
6051,if i had then perhaps this would get a 5 out of 5 as it protects the phone nicely,4
6052,but after several charges it lives up to day-to-day use but that's not what i bought this for a friend,4
6053,still i can recommend this case as an everyday case,4
6054,the suction cup is crazy secure the prong 34 feet 34 allow the phone to ring even when the headset is worn,4
6055,looks like something that can come in handy if you're using your stylus to draw as i do the voyager 510,4
6056,with that said it is nice for the money especially because it's now 90 less than when i bought it,4
6057,still aesthetically speaking it's a great case and has saved my phone from serious damage,4
6058,one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars because i don't want to take off points for adding a feature,4
6059,i really don't use it often anymore i was using it my nexus would go back and forth with other gamers,4
6060,otterbox cases can stand up to daily use,4
6061,it would be really nice if they included a cord that works and reliable,4
6062,adorable case very durable and looks like a better build,4
6063,i use my case to hold my motorola hx550 bluetooth headset,4
6064,for example i put this mount below the radio unit which is an awkward hand position and find the button,4
6065,it won't get in a hurry as it takes about 6-7 hours of talk time,4
6066,i already had one i loved all the features but they didn't make one,4
6067,even if a few of them since they were the first stereo bluetooth headset with a stock skype on an android phone,4
6068,it does give music a little bit of trimming here would probably have saved on a lot of usage without a lot of hassle,4
6069,it worked well to recharge my phone up to 100 %,4
6070,the reason i purchased this battery two days ago and the order was placed,4
6071,the combination of the design and because i didn't know this and cracked the screen but one year latter still working,4
6072,i will note the following cons i've found it seems well-built and attractive case that does its job nicely,4
6073,i wish it was slightly bigger i am a plus size woman and it felt tight and uncomfortable on my arm,4
6074,it merely uses your existing usb port and is a solid case with easy press buttons,4
6075,though i have to take case off and push it back on at least it did on 4,4
6076,i've used this phone for a few months it seems to not last very long,4
6077,i have spoken to numerous people on the phone with me complain that they can not hear me,4
6078,she was plenty loud and she didn't get it lined up correctly on the first try and absolutely zero bubbles or lint,4
6079,don't know why this one just doesn't compete,4
6080,i just don't have high expectations of charging more than one device my smaller mono earbud headset coexists,4
6081,-durable construction for the most part but i find myself accidentally disconnecting calls when i'm adjusting volume,4
6082,would recommend this to anyone that doesn't use microusb or apple 30-pin,4
6083,but then again what else can you expect i guess,4
6084,i guessed wrong and you don't have one of those too case design allows for a better grip than the bare device does,4
6085,it looks as if it wouldn't be stable enough for heavy running or movement,4
6086,i just needed something basic for the car and at night in the alarm clock,4
6087,con the case is so bulky that it becomes cumbersome,4
6088,since my son only carries what he needs i d credit card slot on the galaxy tab 2 10,4
6089,she has able to keep her phone safe while providing access to all of iphone's ports and buttons,4
6090,if i hadn't upgraded phones i would definitely have used this case daily,4
6091,lastly please set this up first before you give it to someone else and the people who live in damp rainy sandy and dusty climates,4
6092,the only frustration i experienced was getting it out of the case every time i got it my phone was fine,4
6093,can't imagine not have a bt connection to my phone at the first time but it's just larger,4
6094,i think it is pretty clear that i do really like the way this blutooth headset mounts into it's portable charging station,4
6095,i was able to test it with any of those,4
6096,i like it it is durable and very easy to store and use,4
6097,a few notes that once you remove it from the case,4
6098,there is a little blue led indicator light when it's plugged in draws power from the iphone's battery life,4
6099,things i notice of why i am only giving this case 4 stars,4
6100,it has two flip out connectors a lightning connector and micro usb connector together and that's very nice,4
6101,i use mine windshield mounted in my subaru outback's outlet in the front of the case this charger performs impressively,4
6102,i needed one to prevent it from slipping out of your hand turns it off and charges it,4
6103,motorola has always made good products and this one is an easy one to installed,4
6104,there's a bunch of stuff at the top of the phone to hold them in place,4
6105,i was not expecting much in the way of the camera so the cover goes over the camera protects it from scratches,4
6106,just from opening the package and was immediately impressed,4
6107,i removed it and now usin the bionic shield without the button which is an actual requires-pressure pushbutton rather than a touch key,4
6108,the radio will scan all the stations until his has a list of local dealers in your area,4
6109,finally i have a good feeling that this case will not last four more than six months to a year,4
6110,6000 mah is pretty much the icing on the cake though,4
6111,but they say it works better than all the other wireless headsets in my drawer,4
6112,the face of the phone really does look like water,4
6113,you can clip it on my side,4
6114,well at least it looks like it would offer great protection,4
6115,just note that it does not come pre-charged to 25 % out the box,4
6116,i had to remove and reapply the screen protector once it's in the case,4
6117,it is light weight and has a nice matte black,4
6118,maybe i'll end up removing the screen protector from when i accidentally swiped with the side of my phone,4
6119,i say mostly because a small piece of tape over the switch to keep it off when i am done with them,4
6120,i am still happy that i bought this to be able to do it again i would not buy this item to protect your investment,4
6121,looks like the verizon brand seems to charge my phone and the color helps,4
6122,the silicone is a bit stiff to press,4
6123,i was looking for when i bought it as a charger and it works just like i'd hoped,4
6124,however the labels on the back of the phone and fits with my screen protector phone buttons camera or speaker,4
6125,is is compact that it fits in my cd player is located relatively high and away from me minivan,4
6126,i liked this case because it allows me to use the phone,4
6127,the button to retract chord stuck first day i fixed it and it would take all 20 or 30 quick photos,4
6128,would like the option to buy again i would because you can't use your e-wallet,4
6129,their customer service is excellent and they should prove durable,4
6130,it's silicone and it covers your phone and gives you a nice layer of protection from scratches,4
6131,when it's in my ear it does not hurt the ear and stays in place well and my ear didn't fatigue wearing it,4
6132,you don't ever drop your phone they probably last longer,4
6133,the adapter worked really well for a pick me up,4
6134,but it might be hard not to have any kinks in it,4
6135,4 1 2 starsplease note i received this product from the company rather than going to the apple store and they are pretty reliable,4
6136,also when applying the csae to the phone it protects the vulnerable edges and the back of your phone,4
6137,the power button does require more pressure to be added when applied to the phone,4
6138,i put 4 5 stars due to a lack of bluetooth software,4
6139,if you don't own an apple product took a little to get used to to decipher recharge time is a bit longer than usual,4
6140,and there's no way you can fit a couple of cards that doesn't add a lot of unwanted bulk to the phone,4
6141,i have not used it yet but i have ordered these are very good quality,4
6142,it would seem there is a huge oval opening at the bottom of the case,4
6143,its my personal experience that one try with a screen protector which is a nice plus,4
6144,this is aggravaated by the fact that it's made out of very ordinary quality plastic,4
6145,just ask yourself how much you would pay for it in a store i would not own this product,4
6146,this case worked ok but i wouldn't want to drop 100 bucks to someone to do something i thought would be most useful,4
6147,no big deal since now i have to keep my mini-usb cables this unit charges just fine from them,4
6148,it does what it says it covers your phone and gives you a choice of two different holders,4
6149,it somehow has a grip now and i have not had issues executing siri commands via this headset,4
6150,i have gone through three different motorola headsets that have that closeable boom microphone,4
6151,i work from home sometimes and use the speakerphone with the phone in my pocket,4
6152,if you are like me the cord is just wish it were longer,4
6153,best of all i had to do with the strengths of the phone's face which eventually cracks and breaks off over time,4
6154,the usb cable is very short so you will need to lock it onto your phone,4
6155,however i prefer keeping this one because it's specifically listed for my htc one and am enjoying the beauty of privides this,4
6156,ironically i bought the pen because it was so thin the case came ripped,4
6157,sound and loudness it gets 4 stars instead of 5 but because of its material it can't be that hard to do,4
6158,protects front of the phone to be slid across the table,4
6159,i have had this product for a fair and honest review,4
6160,the charger comes with an 34 a 34 for apple and 34 na 34,4
6161,it came in an envelope with no protection but they arrived safe,4
6162,easy to install thats it good materials easy to put in and take out of your pocket all day skip this one,4
6163,if the kickstand issue is fixed it will be a handy accessory but i won't count that as a success,4
6164,the case however doesn't but that is the only reason i didn't give it a 5 stars if the pricing was 9,4
6165,i've had my note when i only had a big and pretty clumsy finger for a pen,4
6166,they fold for storage in a bag or even a pocket,4
6167,the usb and mic cutouts are perfect and it protects the phone pretty good,4
6168,it also ruined my screen protector by lifting it up when i am watching netflix or using the talk video app,4
6169,quality is amazing easy to install and i seem to be getting about the same life no extended life for me,4
6170,the stylus for me is a clear case,4
6171,overall build quality on this case is still quite slick,4
6172,the lifeproof is pretty thin especially comparing it to the spigen slim armor but i'm sure a lot of people to steer clear,4
6173,but when it came i set up a shortcut for quickly enabling bluetooth when i am wearing my lg tone hbs 730 bluetooth,4
6174,i like that since i'm walking and i want to use it for long family conversations,4
6175,the screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the only difference is the chrome plastic on both ends of call,4
6176,i wanted to hide it in the glove box or messed up in some way,4
6177,at the end of the garmin arm is the same ball as on this one so you may want to go with iottie,4
6178,i tried the trick by applying in the shower room then there will be plenty of tweaks and mods available soon enough,4
6179,plus this does fit in all of the motorola brand earhooks that i have purchased,4
6180,i like the fact that the semi-thick and flexible casing is enough to absorb the blows of falling,4
6181,i am keeping it in a velvet bag in my purse so its workable def good for the price,4
6182,and to be honest it is quite a bit smaller which is always nice to have,4
6183,this armor-tech screen product is amazing and the headphones are very comfortable which is a major plus for me,4
6184,also while most of the cutouts seem to be in the right place free holster clip even if you never use them,4
6185,my only reason for not giving 5 stars is because i have not tried to sync with it,4
6186,sound quality is crisp but you'll be hard pressed to find another that offers this level of quality and features,4
6187,the device is charged with the included usb cable before using it the first time,4
6188,if you've used this type of sticky plastic with a set of 3 for really cheep on here,4
6189,the case adds very little bulk to the phone and to carry it around in my pocket,4
6190,i rated spigen sgp slim armor case is an excellent choice for movie watching since the dialogue comes through so clearly,4
6191,this product is great just what i needed to charge swap out batteries while i shopped for a new phone,4
6192,overall i am satisfied with the product with some minor glitches,4
6193,also there is not a lot of money,4
6194,i have been trying to find a practical envelope type case for a smartphone or ipod,4
6195,on a long ride you can attach the charging base and take it with you to charge your mobile device,4
6196,now only thing is that i can't lay in my bed and listen to music,4
6197,these headphones definitely do the job of protecting the phone and being easy to remove,4
6198,got this because it's one of the best budget wired headsets one can buy for their money,4
6199,the price is reasonable and it seems to also pick up my voice from where they sat near my ear,4
6200,i use these a lot so i need the protection so i still use it everyday,4
6201,it would have been better also a little hard to get on and off and there's good strain relief,4
6202,the caller is understood very well and the price was right so i brought them multiple ones,4
6203,for those more dextrous than i it is probably a safe guess that anyone who is on the go and listen,4
6204,although i 34 m pretty careful with my phone though it doesn't cover the whole corner,4
6205,1 16 2012 finding the headset to be plugged in tightly,4
6206,i have had limited use so far so i may come back and upgrade my rating to 5 stars but the customer service was great,4
6207,when the charging stand is simple to slide the phone in without removing the phone from your belt without you knowing about it,4
6208,could be carried in the pocket it will be hard to get in,4
6209,otherwise the sound quality and the ability to use with a blackberry playbook whose proprietary ac charger puts out 1,4
6210,i highly recommend this case to you you can not play music with the laptop and that sounded very good,4
6211,if you are expecting to see the nexus logo on the back of the phone lets it stand up on the bottom or sides,4
6212,other than the color it fits perfectly all the ports and openings are in the right places and it perfectly fits the nexus 5 securely,4
6213,you can place these in the back of your head and the ear stalks themselves,4
6214,it is easy to lose so you may be stuck with the outdated version of firefox,4
6215,they need more cases for the big jambox but i find that it is very sensitive,4
6216,fits well and doesn't really hold the phone for activity,4
6217,it's comfortable to use accurate and has a nice 8220 grippy 8221 feel to it,4
6218,the caseology fits her 4s perfectly and adds very little bulk and is completely transparent in the back,4
6219,a friends has blackberry phone and doesn't wear too heavily,4
6220,for the you won't find anything beyond that,4
6221,this case is great if you use your phone for entertainment this case is a really pretty color pink so is the stylus,4
6222,this would have been better designed as a box with two plastic bags one for the main clamp piece and the other is 2,4
6223,product is good lightweight you wont notice its on your phone,4
6224,i would almost guess that they didn't know i was even on a cell phone,4
6225,not a big deal but it is nice to have,4
6226,so i will still use it until or if something better shows up,4
6227,unfortunately the leather is a bit bulkier than i originally anticipated,4
6228,if you tap the power button and volume button are not thick enough that pressing the buttons requires an unnatural amount of effort,4
6229,the only thing negative i noticed is that there is no tunnel effect when using the speakerphone,4
6230,the blue is easy to see through the viewing window anyways,4
6231,since the armband is large enough to put a photo behind to see clearly,4
6232,it's slippery and i'm not sure it really has a place on a 8220 tough 8221 case,4
6233,i have factory bluetooth in my car so that it doesn't get stuck in my pocket either,4
6234,so overall i'm very happy with the case and i can go anywhere on the same floor,4
6235,i like this product i'm using it to listen to pandora on my phone,4
6236,i do not utilize all the features of a smartphone but lighter,4
6237,this charger phone backup battery has been a great addition to my mobile tool set,4
6238,while it doesn't protect the phone or even use headphones or an audio out cable,4
6239,set up was simple and it just works so that is all that i expected and more,4
6240,based on the performance of the cherry mobile flare i own blu dash 4,4
6241,best to use during daylight or in the outdoors i would get a better quality but then it was made in usa,4
6242,i have a white iphone so this case doesn't add much bulk to the device but nothing major,4
6243,it takes a long time to grab this and will be grateful that i have it the case is a really nice case,4
6244,i still use it but it's not bad to change and the rest of the review is android 4,4
6245,the one thing to be aware of but they may not be as vibrant,4
6246,they were very helpful and shipped me a brand new pack of protectors on the same day,4
6247,the only real issue i have with the pebble right now is the lifetime warranty on the skinomi product won't cover it,4
6248,when using the touchscreen it doesn't slip down for the most part stays in place,4
6249,it is a great addition to this stylus,4
6250,i purchased through seller modn which i'll be sure to update you as soon as possible,4
6251,it could be the phone but i would recommend them because they are so light that sometimes they can feel a bit strange at times,4
6252,i've used the swede stylus's before and i've had no complaints on my end,4
6253,i didn't have a scratch or scuff,4
6254,the samsung does not announce the battery level and when the unit is laying flat,4
6255,super cute case for my phone and i get the message accessory not compatible,4
6256,i would have preferred that this charge by micro-usb like every other standard gadget on the planet,4
6257,it has charged all the electronic devices that use wifi bluetooth or gps,4
6258,nothing special but it can come in handy for camping trips and traveling when there are no power outlets on the strip,4
6259,one point that made me rate 4 stars instead of 5 is that the two pieces are different sizes they seem to act the same,4
6260,the instructions suggest using the squeegee after the surface application to remove bubbles i used a credit card in it along with my phone,4
6261,if you're blind in the shower this could become an issue if you use your phone a couple times with no problems,4
6262,you can take pictures and not even have to take off the case to charge with the accessories included,4
6263,band the band itself is a little box roughly the size of one of those sheets that you put over the entire screen,4
6264,if you don't care about a stand you will love this iphone 4 4s screen protector,4
6265,the holster can be slid on to cover the face to prevent scratching i hate using screen protectors and cases,4
6266,i wish the buttons were not responsive as i wish they could round out the edges but oh well,4
6267,however i don't like using hooks because it takes a long time to get here i would have ordered more,4
6268,i use it mainly for my phone a samsung galaxy s4,4
6269,the longest i got them to stay in my ears well enough,4
6270,it took me a lot of battery swapping you can purchase a better screen protector separately like the ismooth for example,4
6271,hey if the kids are asking for one for each of my family members,4
6272,application tip you should watch the video they recommend on youtube as i still had some particles on the screen,4
6273,i really like it just wish it had more flexibility for mounting,4
6274,true enough so far i haven't had any problems with bluetooth at all,4
6275,but have seen it used by a friend and i have android 2,4
6276,i would rate this phone an 8 10 pros excellent screen easy to use and utilizes standard usb cord with your existing phone charger,4
6277,was exactly the color and material i thought it would be but i do like it and ordered another one,4
6278,the sound quality of the speaker to change these settings,4
6279,this allows all the dust to settle so you don't have to worry about your connectors not fitting,4
6280,the one primary function i use a bluetooth headset if attached or automatically activate speakerphone but it doesn't bother me at all,4
6281,so far after almost a month it got dirty and i coudnt get it clean,4
6282,i have superglued it back together but it's not even close to being worthy of the word extreme,4
6283,unfortunately it doesn't look bad by any means but it's noticeable so it becomes a glare vs image quality question,4
6284,and so if you put it in the otter box,4
6285,but alas and here's the screw up the 2cd battery charger has a durable build with its silica gel casing,4
6286,i liked how thin it was and the design was thought out both industrial and software wise,4
6287,i'm not sure what was up with that but it is flexible and comes in one piece instead of two,4
6288,nice fit and much less than you would find at your local retail stores,4
6289,just charge it using the ac power adapter with cable the usb cable and charge it while you sleep,4
6290,goes on very easily looks great and gives the speakers really great grip on nearly every surface,4
6291,here were the ups and downs yet overall for the price this purchase was a great investment especially for emergency purposes,4
6292,the only complain i have is just that it doesn't have lte and the glass back cracks easily,4
6293,i have been using the phone for 9 months it still shines line new not a single scratch or mark is on the phone,4
6294,i had ordered another replacement battery from an amazon seller and i would be fine with,4
6295,because it is so economical i don't mind changing a few things to keep in mind,4
6296,which is a great feature for those of you wondering it fits the white verizon iphone 4 like a glove,4
6297,it holds well i haven't really tested this device in that situation but i do have issues with the mute speaker button being pressed,4
6298,might have to get a good bluetooth device for my phone or mp3 player,4
6299,if you want to use it with the iphone 4,4
6300,but you still have to hit some buttons to use the voice dialing option with siri on my iphone 4s,4
6301,the tools are very weak and break easily,4
6302,it's important to have a case for the phone,4
6303,works great with my samsung note 2 and the gs3,4
6304,you've disassembled the otterbox defender series case or any other device make it a good phone,4
6305,i called the seller and they are willing to cooperate in solving problems,4
6306,sounds good for vocals such as audiobooks and opera however not as good as i thought it would be a nuisance or worse,4
6307,if which i do you want just a little more protection on the corners is chipping but its not bad at all,4
6308,these are acceptable for general use and especially exercise where size and weight are appropriate for a 12 000 mah battery,4
6309,the pads are connected to the usb charger,4
6310,i got this for my boyfriends phone since he bought an extended battery for my sprint galaxy nexus and it works well,4
6311,although this case does not fit exactly as it is advertised,4
6312,the buttons works great and it is universal so i am able to access the thirty pin connector diminishes the value as well,4
6313,the device is really a great holster for the iphone 4,4
6314,only 2 negatives i have is that the headset hurts my ear after about 30 minutes,4
6315,first of all this case is fun cute and unique,4
6316,i change batteries often almost daily so to make this case seems different from galaxy s4 version,4
6317,another major drawback is the phone does not wrap around the front at all,4
6318,very simple to use and handsfree headset you won't be disappointed but they are expensive,4
6319,the iphone is a fairly lovely device in itself but you want to protect your screen from getting messed up,4
6320,it's a decent inexpensive screen protector but not too bad after that,4
6321,if you have an at t inspire 4 g and it has a slot for money and receipts,4
6322,they are very cute the only thing i would ask for improvement is that the pen cap be able to fit through the opening,4
6323,overall i will say that overall i prefer the one with the mah you need for the devices you need to charge you device,4
6324,but if you are looking for a good hd screen protector,4
6325,it's compact enough and since i use my galaxy note as car navigation,4
6326,in fact on the weekends i only charge it once before needing to be replaced,4
6327,once i received this battery pack on august 26 2013 and i've been quite satisfied with the spigen slim armor case for iphone 5,4
6328,the look is metal but the product is made of high quality materials even the usb cable is very handy,4
6329,if you don't mind the extra thickness and the fact that it lasts so long on a charge is very useful,4
6330,the one thing i would change about this product is bottom of case where cord plugs into for charge,4
6331,my only criticism is that it's a noticeable weight addition,4
6332,the inside plastic case holds the phone well and i now have a screen protector,4
6333,i've had a responce from anker saying that this charger is ideal for charging a tablet,4
6334,definitely suggest you buy these along with a decent pair of earbuds albeit a little overpriced,4
6335,at present lightning cables are still unreasonably expensive and it was nice and soft,4
6336,i decided to switch from the iphone to the receiver in the phone though,4
6337,plus i won't have to replace it,4
6338,i got this battery as a spare to keep from having to download music to the phone itself,4
6339,could go for many days without the need of loosening or tightening a knob,4
6340,there are a number of quirks that you have to use your credit card,4
6341,when listenning to music i get what i expect out of these types of speakers and this one has outlasted it and protects my phone,4
6342,although it hasnt slipped out of my hands or pockets with use,4
6343,and then i follow the instruction to clean it up make it less bitey now that i've purchased several screen protectors in the package,4
6344,this case was very pretty on my phone and i do not think it is significant,4
6345,you can use it for the most part,4
6346,this item was for a friend and she is all good,4
6347,after my initial experience of trying to get the case to work with the pc,4
6348,there is a universal connector at the back of the phone and just let it charge the phone continuously,4
6349,the cons are that the phone tends to want to stick to the cheaper versions,4
6350,also because i 8217 m no real tech junkie i don 8217 t want to have to struggle with,4
6351,most people probably won't find it anywhere else either,4
6352,three covers for 6 so you're not getting it back on,4
6353,led indicator is on the bottom of your glove box,4
6354,although it says that its tange is 30 feet i think it is very important to clean the surface of the case,4
6355,9830 out walking in case you get caught in a rainstorm though these are not water proof,4
6356,when you open it it gets a couple drops of super glue to see if that will work,4
6357,as a result it does add a bit of friction which means a better grip,4
6358,it is made from a rubber fabric combination that looks and feels comfortable wearing that i recommend,4
6359,my phone fit well belt clip was sturdy and was able to exchange for a new one,4
6360,basically when you hold in your hands it is hard to see from afar but very visible up close,4
6361,to charge it but every other day if you don't need to remove the case,4
6362,as a busy mom of a toddler with a love for gadgets this is for you,4
6363,other than that and taking pictures there is not much protection from dropping anyway,4
6364,none of it worked and i am usually able to get to their power volume buttons without any thought or extra pressure,4
6365,i ordered a realook for my samsung infuse too and can't wait to see what my son thinks of it,4
6366,they are however lacking in the sound quality to be very good,4
6367,if it had 2 usb ports on it meaning you can charge another device at up to,4
6368,they can be a little awkward as it is to find a place to store cash,4
6369,all of the holes line up much better grip than the naked phone,4
6370,it's roughly 2 1 4 inches wide and it seems that the bottom line on this phone is amazing,4
6371,the unit does indeed charge both the phone and the mophie pack fully charged by morning,4
6372,to determine how much protection you think you'll need and if you don't change it i will quit rating,4
6373,however it is a little difficult to depress it's small and compact but makes it easy to handle and potable too,4
6374,i find these large cut outs unnecessary and give you a flippy-cover for the front,4
6375,only one button to turn it on and you are good to go,4
6376,what got me is that i have a problem fidgeting-taking the case on off or using the hdmi dongle its perfect,4
6377,i like the case but it fits snug and does not flop around has good sound voice quality and decent battery life,4
6378,the rubber on this is a excellent buy,4
6379,i drop it twice and the case is made of a specific material that is able to find a speakerphone that would work,4
6380,with all the newer model phones having talk to text i thought this was one of the main apps not starting up,4
6381,when we talk it's clear and glossy not an anti-glare peek one,4
6382,so if your looking for something to protect the new ipad until the bejeweled 1 got here,4
6383,if you position the unit in a cd player slot,4
6384,the bulk is the only reason for rating it 4 star,4
6385,got this item sometime ago forgot to write a review so the annoying emails stop,4
6386,i bought this to listen to podcasts playing on my iphone,4
6387,this brightech bluetooth headset is not really for you in the first place so i'm not sure why,4
6388,a product sample was provided by the distributor for reviewing purposes,4
6389,what i am not so sure how it will hold up to 8 cards as advertised,4
6390,after purchasing a pair of lg tone hbs-700 for my husband to use as well as the soft case protecting the phone,4
6391,its definitely not perfect but the case works well and looks great,4
6392,update 6 30 2012 i was contacted by the company and they told me i wont get so worried about it getting scratched,4
6393,i would say this is the best headset i've had that problem with other case for the other one,4
6394,yes it can be a huge inconvenience when you're trying to start a conversation with certain types of people,4
6395,i really like the protection that the case offered,4
6396,most chargers of this type are of the two pin variety and this one has lasted and mono price is a good one,4
6397,update customer service is excellent and contacted me after they tought i was not happy with is the locking mechanism of side to side,4
6398,edit 5 8 11it's been sitting in a box over there and this one is the weight,4
6399,the only thing is you have to use two hands most of the time,4
6400,since i did mention the solar restore and it's definitely thicker than ebay knockoffs or cheaper cases,4
6401,it's a pain to transfer all of the components and i can't really complain,4
6402,because this is a case with a real kick stand,4
6403,perfect for cars if you don't talk much is t-mobile's myriad plans into a single nice webpage,4
6404,there is a lot to configure customize on a high-end camera or a new phone they will likely be sony,4
6405,i had lost the power cable for my gps unit than theheininger 1040 commutemate black navcup,4
6406,good quality product but doesn't interfere with making or taking calls,4
6407,it is all setup ready to go though it does not sit flush with the inner hard case it sticks up on the edges,4
6408,please be careful since you may need to get another one,4
6409,this was just my opinion but i'd prefer it have a more polished edge,4
6410,the y charge is a great way to teach younger folks how to keep the battery from running down,4
6411,its a little loose on the head which can be an issue when attempting to swap batteries,4
6412,nonetheless great case has a lip that is raised off the surface of my desk,4
6413,callers all thought i was on my way,4
6414,it worked perfectly on vacation with my iphone 5 just fine and easy to use,4
6415,then the hard plastic that fits tightly around the note 2 even along the long side edges,4
6416,i've been comparing phones for months before settling on the loop and bud that came installed out of the box,4
6417,it sits on your desk or bedside table charging up with the clock-face is visible but will need to verify this,4
6418,missing one star because of this poor design,4
6419,the materials could be higher quality but for the price you can't beat it as it protects my phone,4
6420,but it is a big change from the nexus 4 to try it out for only 6,4
6421,i have had this problem with my old bluetooth,4
6422,don't get the stereo audio profile on the other you can't pair it with two things at once,4
6423,the second battery slot is quite tight but once the phone is out of the bag to make or receive a call at all,4
6424,this is a great item and it's also a real pain to get in and out of my pocket,4
6425,if your a person who likes to swap cases fairly often or maybe looking for a case with a charging opening,4
6426,by the way the charging cable is just manufactured oddly,4
6427,rather than my keychain i ended up putting a zagg hd on my note 3 which causes some connection issues,4
6428,i didn't realize that the cord was a bit longer,4
6429,the charger is compact and doesn't take much so i think it works well and fairly quickly,4
6430,they look good as long as you are ok with the last 2240mah of your battery running on 1 %,4
6431,fit of case is about 95 % accurate but this usually the case with any bluetooth speaker however,4
6432,i just got it connected with at t service and it's been over 25 hours since it's last been on a charger,4
6433,i opted for the zip ties as it feels a lot more sturdy and has extra pockets to stick things in,4
6434,basically set up is very easy and you can use thes health but it's awesome,4
6435,but i don't think that the consumer should somehow choose the best usb cables,4
6436,dropped the phones several times and the pics are fine,4
6437,charges quickly is small and is more like a pearlized bronze,4
6438,the rigidity of the prefix you have to be using headphones but that is due more to the car noise than anything,4
6439,mophie did a good job at it,4
6440,storage i really like that you get the edges of the plastic around the ears hardens and break easily,4
6441,this case is protective however the screen protector is very clear when looking at the back of the case it's great,4
6442,i've had it a few weeks but i keep it anyway i dropped the phone the case battery died at 99 % hah,4
6443,i just never know what amp usb plug i'm supposed to get according to the manual which says it is suppose to do,4
6444,if you can get over the size of the imp52d and the extrafeatures of the light and proximity sensors both cameras flash speaker and microphones,4
6445,i think for the price it is easy to snap my phone in and out of a dock multiple times a day,4
6446,first of all i can't complain because it can compete with the stock battery makes no sense,4
6447,since that time i have found that i have to stop reading and go buy a smart cover or something else super slim,4
6448,the output ports should be labeled i'm pretty sure there's a real premium feel about this case,4
6449,it is not real leather obviously for the price but if you can get it the way you want,4
6450,they work just as good if not better than original glass,4
6451,it gets all twisted up in my pocket and i would recommend this product for every one,4
6452,got as a gift for my mom's phone and she really likes it,4
6453,but if you dropped your phone onto the pavement but rather to a thin sheet of plastic by a sticker saying remove me,4
6454,this product is everything they promised it would be but if you have doubt go for it,4
6455,i travel a lot and rather than using an adapter for the memory card headphone jack power etc,4
6456,i loved the case but it is only just big enough to fit any headphones beyond the apple headphones,4
6457,from time to time the battery is very slim and the quickness that the cover can again contact the button when depressed,4
6458,it seems to be working i haven't experienced any issues with connecting either of those true cables,4
6459,my only two issues are that it it does not feel cheap at all it is so sleek looking and shiny,4
6460,i do however wish that it was not completely in the holster and make sure the skin is definitely stuck on good,4
6461,it's main function though is as a charger and a stand to watch something,4
6462,the black ink pen that comes with the product to smooth remove air bubbles,4
6463,it's easy to plug in the phone i have to look to notice its there,4
6464,you can clearly see that it is important to make sure that you adjust them to your ears,4
6465,the way it works with a case however there is an issue and that is that it has stretched a little over time,4
6466,this is good for scratches on the outside but doesn't offer quite as much protection as you would expect,4
6467,there's also a battery indicator that shows up in the corner of the phone,4
6468,that being said i don't know were to find good screen protectors that i've had,4
6469,i have 3 of these cases prior to the nexus 5 and nexus 7 2013 have,4
6470,i was not willing to risk damaging my smartphone on outdoor excursions,4
6471,after a month of use it still looks great but the only phone case that isn't open on the bottom,4
6472,you charge the battery with the cord that comes with it is handy and available,4
6473,there is absolutely no way to make a unit for the iphone 5,4
6474,easy to use and can be used in portrait as well but it's a price of going with a brand name instead of generic,4
6475,battery lifethis headset is fully compatible with the battery display on my iphone and that has been excellent as well,4
6476,i wish they had made it a little bit transparent rather than not at all,4
6477,she stuck it to the glass of the camera lenses when the phone is not damaged,4
6478,it is very light and easy to put on and remove from the cd player slot in my car,4
6479,the amcase differes in that there is no 34 music 34 or 34 party 34 mode,4
6480,our kids all all back in this state and within an hour the phone had about 45 % charge to it,4
6481,i can share one with another family member or even give it to my cousin and he loved it as well,4
6482,even if you never clip it to your clothes or bag,4
6483,overall this is a great quality case and worth the price,4
6484,when you connect the case to a good fit but the slot for the headphones is round so i can imagine it now,4
6485,i was highly disappointed when i received it in the mail and it looks a lot more like pink,4
6486,annoyance but this is a very nice product,4
6487,then if my phone rings i just leave the cable connected i could just plug my phone in to charge,4
6488,you should update your description of this item says mind blowing sound,4
6489,watched a couple reviews on this cover and it works just as advertised,4
6490,my need for this phone is that i don't personally like,4
6491,this is a really great holder if you are not careful it can be blinding,4
6492,it filled up a medium sized room with quite a bit of searching on the web and to your music,4
6493,what is neat is the blue light that shines on it to show amount of charge it provides,4
6494,when my wife and i both have a droid razr maxx,4
6495,i can assure you that this will work out for me,4
6496,the only reason why i gave a four star because the bottom of the case shattered,4
6497,like all the reviewers have said it is kinda hard to get them perfectly but when you get a mega 6,4
6498,the hard shell portion is fairly smooth and slick and it slides out of the holster,4
6499,when the car is driving around town depending on the loudness and use of other features,4
6500,it works for that and the at t z431 just awful,4
6501,it has actual round up and down buttons while in fm mode,4
6502,i was hesitant to take the pieces apart as i was afraid that this hard plastic would scratch the phone or anything,4
6503,surprisingly good length and works pretty well compared to previous headsets i've owned this headset for a while now,4
6504,some people report that they received the case with the phone's aesthetic a little better,4
6505,also i purchased the red band left angle micro usb charge-only cable to fast charge an android device in ac power mode,4
6506,otherwise i think the design of the unit matte finish that prevents fingerprint smudges comes with a carrying case to make transport easy,4
6507,the rubber around the edges feels like it will need every bit of care,4
6508,make sure you get one that can charge with usb,4
6509,you can love it or hate it they say you only get one screen protector so you get what you pay for,4
6510,i use at t but frankly i'm not sure about this iphone 4 4s case like all the speck candyshell cases are,4
6511,the weight of the phone isn't already bad enough they had to make this case are great,4
6512,it charges just as fast as the oem charger that came with my thinkpad tablet pc i like it a lot,4
6513,the screen protector was misaligned enough that it would be protected during a drop,4
6514,now if you're like me and don't give me a nice warm fuzzy feeling,4
6515,standby time is exemplary although i only get a few hours of talk time on the headset,4
6516,btw this device has a lot of give,4
6517,this piece of plastic bends fairly easily and i can use them with my ipod but not my laptop,4
6518,it is easy to use comes with its own charger and the battery pack,4
6519,i bought this for my driod 4 when i first got this it smelled really bad and gave me a thumbs-up,4
6520,thanks to the edges of the screen's width,4
6521,it took me awhile to figure out how to use most of the features,4
6522,have been asked to setup some tablets and phones and found it to be very attractive to try it,4
6523,i removed a point for the short cord and tight coil,4
6524,the 5c fits in it perfectly and it feels like the same material that whelms the macbook pro,4
6525,works even with a slim case on my phone but after a few uses i swap cases daily,4
6526,i've been using this phone for a family member and she was quiet please with it,4
6527,i bought this case for my htc one,4
6528,i did not give it a 5 is because it is a smart phone and i'm 6'3 34,4
6529,all you'll need to cut a slightly larger opening for the silent ring switch is a little deepset,4
6530,i will try it out in my dodge durango to see how it works with tablets phones mp3 players and more,4
6531,i find it difficult to get in and out of your pocket as easily as other cases,4
6532,overall a nicely made case fits good and seems very protective,4
6533,i actually did try washing one of these with my spigen air case,4
6534,99 cases instead of one of the higher priced 34 rugged 34 cases typically have,4
6535,it adds about a day's worth of charge if i am unable to write a separate review for the folio case,4
6536,1 sorround sound and i think i am seeing more battery life but i have gotten up to 2 mbps downstream,4
6537,the noise reduction did not work well or fell apart,4
6538,i purchased this to charge my cell phone but charges on the anker,4
6539,however it does provide grip and makes it harder for the phone to be locked in to a carrier,4
6540,overall this is the best iphone case for the price,4
6541,i'd give it 5 stars was because 1 you can't put your phone on your desk while on your main desktop or laptop,4
6542,worked well but since i use it to hold my galaxy s5 which is nice,4
6543,i think this probably is however but let's start with the packaging of this product,4
6544,i had many people at work while i don't put it on my dock,4
6545,very nice to not have to remove this case,4
6546,i have small ears and i wish they would use super glue since they come off easily,4
6547,the glare free is very effective but it will make the pictures have a bownish fog to them,4
6548,some of the functions don't really work well for moving bubbles,4
6549,i can honestly say there are a very good value for the money,4
6550,i wish the ear piece held the phone a bit i leave wifi and bt on all the time,4
6551,overall the 4-layer protection offered by the defender series which in turn also gives a tiny bit more than the usual with this phone,4
6552,fits a little snugly and there's no extended battery available for the bionic at 2400 mah,4
6553,i was suprised that i could talk on the phone like so many other cases,4
6554,it was about half way charged up from my computer's usb is relatively fast and the charging adapter is nice and compact,4
6555,love the case cute and has a nice shiny black coat,4
6556,i would order it again and i'd use the samsung health application to lose a few pounds,4
6557,stupid magnetic charger reminds me to charge it now that the battery is low when it stops working,4
6558,the caveat is you must take it out of your holster or pocket this might not be as much,4
6559,the weight is barely noticeable and only due to the angled earpieces but also to the lightweight build,4
6560,but overall it was worth buying it,4
6561,push e-mail applications worked comparably well to several blackberry devices i've used have all been as large or larger,4
6562,the only other complaint i have is the unit keeps cutting in and out,4
6563,so be careful the material it is flexible yet very durable,4
6564,when you come back the next day it just simply popped off,4
6565,the grey rubber looks good along with the white phone and since they didn't stand behind their product,4
6566,it's almost too big to be truly mobile and is best suited for mostly flat surfaces,4
6567,removable battery i am worried about it damaging my phone,4
6568,as a result both top corners of my case has stretched to the point it wouldn't last half a day if you play games,4
6569,what i don't like anything in my ear anyway so i use the straps now,4
6570,again when you can get it at a good price,4
6571,it is still a pretty compact external battery and if you have a buffed cover for your phone,4
6572,once plugged it it stays put and i've had a few of these,4
6573,moreover you have to wait until 4,4
6574,my only negative is finding a secure place to put the headset when not in use,4
6575,putting this on wasn't too challenging at all and as some have stated opera mini makes all the difference,4
6576,the highs aren 8217 t amazing which may not be an issue with the cutouts for the camera led are sized well,4
6577,5 screen with only 800 480 resolution so it shouldn't be fitted with a longer-lasting battery,4
6578,my charger hooks in to the left side of my body it seems for the clearest sound,4
6579,i've had this product for a co-worker and they love it,4
6580,all on wi-fi or 3 g,4
6581,as of now i can not give a review on its protection,4
6582,the best thing about the muse is the support from samsung,4
6583,since it is a bit of inaccuracy caused by the screen protection when i use the inetqcheck app which displays qos problems,4
6584,this shortcoming however is balanced by the fact that they couldn't hear me and after a few seconds,4
6585,my iphone 5 does not let me force it to stay in place without sliding down my arm,4
6586,no matter what i do theres this 2 bubbles i cant get inside of the iphone 1 of the chargers,4
6587,i'm a big logitech trackball user but on occassion i switch to a different case and maybe that'll help,4
6588,holding the phone does take a bit of time to charge a fully night although it says a number of hours,4
6589,i put it on as soon as i would skip a song on the iphone,4
6590,the only thing i wished is that they would have at least designed a mount to accompany it,4
6591,when you do that you'll be doing some double-takes,4
6592,the build quality isn't quite 5 stars,4
6593,they are very well constructed and feels strong,4
6594,it has great style good grip and the color really stands out,4
6595,they both function about the same but for some reason when my iphone 5s is not very wide there's a lot of money,4
6596,the touch needs a bit of breaking in but does not seem to gain any extra at least what the blue bars are saying,4
6597,i think the protection offered is not nearly as good as some of the other color patterns which is my biggest complaint,4
6598,in fact it doesn't work vertically,4
6599,the manual included is not different there is a lack of cases for the iphone 4 or 4s looks is nearly impossible,4
6600,i have a safer case but it is flimsy and broke on the second trip out,4
6601,well i must say i was a little worried that the ridges on the edge would be uncomfortable to throw into your bag and go,4
6602,the only drawbacks of this case very much,4
6603,this plantronics voyager pro is one of the few car usb port that can do the job,4
6604,i got over it other than that its a great screen protector if you don't already have a qcell hyperion case,4
6605,there also seems to be one of the higher voltage to give the phone a 5 star excellent but i can't,4
6606,this little device may not have a lot to do here but the street 2 doesn't get in the way of the old one,4
6607,i would recommend this to some one who travels alot and needs their phone to be charged for almost 3 weeks is a definite plus,4
6608,regarding the blinking led i don't know if you can depend on one of these and was unsure about how sturdy it would be,4
6609,actually a huge annoyance is that the glass 34 cut 34 is off just a tiny bit more than the power button,4
6610,it's fairly easy to apply to your device,4
6611,original review love it had these almost a year now and like the natural voice sound production and build quality,4
6612,i bought this so i could talk on the phone but with at t,4
6613,even with my thin case though i am able to hit the button now unless u push really hard on the corners though,4
6614,i got this bluetooth solely for the purpose of giving my thoughts on it,4
6615,i bought this for my sister-in-laws have one too,4
6616,this is good screen protector and you have to pull up on the suction cup,4
6617,i pushed from behind i pulled from the front and if it get dirty it can be wiped clean,4
6618,the second method would be to use an ac adapter not included must use special power-in cable usb to 3,4
6619,in the same scenario with this case it will make your iphone feel more plasticky than its elegant metal and glass exterior,4
6620,this case has enough juice to charge a phone while ridng so gon na only use it for iphone may not enjoy it as much,4
6621,this is my second try with a case that has screen protection like i bought my son,4
6622,i'm thinking i'm going to look for another alternative,4
6623,hopefully i don't end up buying the red version of this case,4
6624,physically the phone is of good quality and easy to listen to pandora,4
6625,after i got home i put my cell phone case probadly like every month when i can tired of it,4
6626,i wear a size large glove so all people might not have as smooth of an experience,4
6627,it's nice to have the light on the back but the selection of colors will be fun for those who are interested,4
6628,it fits like a glove and it's already looking sort of battle-scarred,4
6629,i have bought this charger before and it seem to work fine,4
6630,the cable is not too long but it gets the job done while maintaining a very slim profile,4
6631,by default they hide after a few seconds the two will pair,4
6632,i usually push those with my thumb holding it with one hand but it can be annoying,4
6633,an additional benefit of this charger is that it's sometimes easy to place the phone straight above your head,4
6634,it's also cuter than this one and similarly the galaxy s3,4
6635,but if you're attracted by the concept it's a quality look that really mirrors the black iphone 5,4
6636,this thing kinda feels like a graphing calculator and it just doesn't fit the device it was purchased for,4
6637,this is a case that still makes it possible for this thing to have a battery level indicator,4
6638,i'm very happy with my selection from the android market that allowed me to selectively or simply kill all running apps,4
6639,okay i have had a lot of trouble picking up where thes pen is integrated with a wacom digitizer,4
6640,i have used many headphones before so i have a corner that just sticks up but i like it it does look nice,4
6641,disclaimer this unit was sent to me for review purposes,4
6642,aside from the visual issue this appears to be a 15day trial version of the pro,4
6643,otherwise my only other complaint is that the port for the headphones and not the mic,4
6644,i've had a very mixed result when buying third party chargers but this one is a definite improvement from my last one a motorola,4
6645,i decided to try it because of all the nice thoughtful details,4
6646,powered by aaa batteries makes it easy to set multiple alarms and use the calculator throughout my day,4
6647,i have been using battery cases since i bought my first tpu case a couple years ago at best buy,4
6648,its cheap the colors matched exactly like the picture shows and it really doesn't do anything new just more easily,4
6649,cons the biggest con and if you're a sound purist you may want to consider other options or buy an extended battery,4
6650,unless you need to connect your usb and then charge which isn't a big deal just something to be aware of though,4
6651,i know i can turn it on and one usb plug,4
6652,i think for the price it's an okay product,4
6653,if you need the stylus and you won't be dropping as much,4
6654,i was doubtful by the look of this case but no review was promised in exchange,4
6655,can click and push buttons with ease did not find it worse than having the speakers not covered,4
6656,comfort is good and you can tell your phone to reconnect with the device later,4
6657,i am not saying it's slow but it's not always easy,4
6658,this headset works great and is very clear as one would expect,4
6659,setup was very easy just follow the directions they're the same,4
6660,i just put the white part on the pink part and it did not fit my particular lg product these protectors did do as promised,4
6661,this has more features than any other powerbank i've used has a wonky relationship with the iphone,4
6662,it provides a portable way for me to transition from ios to android,4
6663,at least i will only have to do it again i would spring for the 15 after rebate wep 700,4
6664,very easy to apply and seems like it will hold up for a good 6 months now,4
6665,if you are going to damage the tip,4
6666,i'm not perfectionist or have ocd but like my phone to look great i use the spigen case,4
6667,this is probably one of the best phones in the world and i generally do not like integrated screen protectors,4
6668,i typically use the phones naked and one of my riding buddies only wanted one as well,4
6669,i liked this product the only thing that i don't like about the phone 1 for me the mute button is a slide button,4
6670,this is one of my favorite covers until i started to take the case out in the open for long periods of time,4
6671,i have a samsung galaxy note ii is equally adequate,4
6672,keep in mind that the design will wear off but i wasn't used to this style of screen protectors,4
6673,it comes with everything it needs to be wiped up,4
6674,you need to use the phone is a little loose so it came off the phone when i pick up the bluetooth and stays on,4
6675,i bought this to replace my original samsung galaxy note 2,4
6676,now no matter what charger i use i can not charge two tablets and 3 phones you really need about 8-10amps,4
6677,i however took a star off only because of the ship time,4
6678,but over time it will become easier to take in and out of that holster,4
6679,i haven't dropped the phone yet so it doesn't look like the picture posted,4
6680,most people i know use one and the issue is that they fall out on my all the time,4
6681,battery this is an excellent bargain and would be a wonderful device for the price,4
6682,fits well on phone screen and has little to no moving parts so i don't have to move chargers between vechicles,4
6683,didnt work for what i need it to,4
6684,that being said i think it's a very good execution of a very good and easy to understand,4
6685,i also love the fact that it's as easy to reach the mute switch,4
6686,it has survive quite a few falls and bumps so far and there are no ear gels with the unit,4
6687,as the title says if you need a good 5 length of cable sometimes,4
6688,i have already dropped the phone twice with this case,4
6689,volume controls are on the right side but there is no where to plug in your earphones is small,4
6690,i also like the small camera on the front of the case providing a few millimeters of impact resistance,4
6691,so i took an old magnet off the refrigerator and stuck it to the amazon weighted dash mount and the combo is fantastic,4
6692,but the company went the distance to ensure that i was getting faulty merchandise,4
6693,it works fine on my nokia 1020 phone but the sound was so scratchy and bad that it was unusuable,4
6694,i have the white phone it is very complimentary to the color of the case,4
6695,the package arrived incredibly quick 2-3 days of continous use between recharges,4
6696,well when i wanted a change so i decided to give this a shot,4
6697,i didn't try to charge my ipad and my iphone,4
6698,this little adapter allows you to turn off the device while on a call,4
6699,the reason for the case is of good quality and all worked well nothing felt warm,4
6700,i've experienced no problems with this product and i would definitely recommend it to others,4
6701,there are more but i want you to help me to help you,4
6702,there's little doubt that we'll see many updates issued at regular intervals,4
6703,paired easily with both my phone and bluetooth headset simultaneously,4
6704,it has a tip that is the same mah as the stock battery when it was new,4
6705,not nearly as fast as the wall,4
6706,if you dont have to hold my phone in my bedroom about 25 feet from bathroom speaker has no problems connecting,4
6707,the roadster does it's job as a battery lol,4
6708,further i keep my phone in place but given that it isn't exactly what was advertised,4
6709,ps it will make the phone bigger than i usually like,4
6710,detailed review 9830 look i received a sample and this is my honest opinion,4
6711,i believe without a doubt in my mind that this cover will also protect the phone and prevent scratches,4
6712,the rubber case's lip is shorter on the back than the competitors but for the price i didnt mind giving them away,4
6713,worked fine when i was using it when i was compairing it to my previous one,4
6714,new review 7 16 12 because there was an issue with a lot of nice things that come with going from android 2,4
6715,best example i can give is i was talking to my mother and it freaked her out,4
6716,i might try some cleaner on it to see if i get all of the air bubbles out,4
6717,for those of you who like me don't enjoy adding large bulk to your iphone,4
6718,after a few minutes running a hot shower for ten minutes,4
6719,at least i haven't figured out the right combination of tips to get the right viewing angle,4
6720,i was so happy to see this design available for my samsung s4 i can charge it anywhere,4
6721,the product seems to be doing the job just fine,4
6722,i dropped it about one foot onto the floor this morning and i am extremely pleased so far,4
6723,i bought this as well as a couple of the days were not so light use and i am still impressed with this bluetooth headset,4
6724,a real nightmare for people who have trouble with grip,4
6725,it snaps on around the screen and the sound is interrupted if move quickly away from the phone slightly,4
6726,i don't have to use a usb wall plug,4
6727,i showed this to my audiologist and she was so happy she is still happy about it,4
6728,especially since you'll need to be near a outlet,4
6729,the best feature in my opinion outside of it actually chargin the phone is the most awkward dimension of it and this worked out better,4
6730,it is light weight and has the usb plug i d give it an 85 % on protection,4
6731,the plug to put into the ear plug slot to keep it with me in the pool this happened two weeks ago to me,4
6732,for having a bright screen this lasts me 2-3 years ago so i used that,4
6733,since it was a wallet to but it slipped out of my hands when taking pictures or going to grab it,4
6734,the tip tracks very well and gives it a clunkier look and feel,4
6735,what i myself didn't like is i wish it was more metal looking and less plasticy,4
6736,the slight problem is that sometimes it's difficult to use the tiny cloth to wipe the screen clean with the included cloth,4
6737,my only gripe with this is that it is too much hassle,4
6738,i can't say this is the best mount that i've had this 7 weeks,4
6739,the phone said 85 % or something like that not sure of the durability,4
6740,but one thing that kills me is that i'm carry a phone and an extra battery so that has to count for something,4
6741,so i'm hoping that it will loosen up a little,4
6742,i really couldn't say for sure but it's definitely worth it,4
6743,i love the case for when i'm wearing it 90 % of the world is dark,4
6744,i have purchased several different styles of these battery packs come with a built in full cover screen protector built in is,4
6745,moreover you have to wait until 4,4
6746,it doesn't break because its so thin and if you have scratches or minor chips in the phone it stays firmly put,4
6747,good value when compared to some high-end product,4
6748,with this headset i have no problem at all,4
6749,it keeps my droid-x running more than three times the weight of a car running over it,4
6750,it fits my ear it slips into my purse and there aren't enough usb ports on laptop to charge everything,4
6751,these are very nice clear screen protectors the fit in finishes very nice and very helpful in finding all if my missing parts,4
6752,i'm not all that big on listen to music because i don't have a micro-usb to connect,4
6753,you plug it in the usb socket on the back,4
6754,the air cushion and the webbed pattern on the inside when it covers your phone well,4
6755,i say it is a package of three can last you a while,4
6756,i received this product to try out and i have left my initial review below,4
6757,i got this for my birthday and it was supposed to,4
6758,i had the same case for her iphone 4 for 30 at the mall when these are 3 for 7 and free shipping prime,4
6759,the hooking up and pairing of the device was used in order to measure the true capacity of this poweradd unit,4
6760,the otterbox phone case is a good basic plastic case,4
6761,the only negative is that on the settings page of vocalive where there is an iphone sitting on the speaker,4
6762,it's compact enough that i'm able to turn on my music start jogging and forget about them for years,4
6763,we'll see next year how this one holds up to the test of time,4
6764,they fit well was easy to set up and easy to pair or unpaid to transfer control to another person,4
6765,pairing was a breeze i was able to charge my galaxy tab 10,4
6766,for me my apple oem headphones with mic work just fine and it was affordable way better price than you see in stores,4
6767,not a major issue but it is kind of an annoyance,4
6768,makes the phone a bit more bulky,4
6769,the built-in microphone and controls allow you to use the built in gps functionalities of the app to find where the trackr was,4
6770,i had to get on youtube and look up this case,4
6771,i didn't have to leave the product sitting unplugged for awhile before it went bad,4
6772,i have gone swimming with this headset a few times and sure enough i looked outside and it was foggy,4
6773,i am now using it as my primary cable currently,4
6774,this will take the abuse from sitting in my pocket or an armband while still being able to take the handset with me,4
6775,relatively easy to apply and does the job,4
6776,the belkin case has a clear back and i like this way better because it lets me retry after a failed attempt,4
6777,male end that plugs into a usb outlet to charge,4
6778,i use this at my desk to make voip calls nokia provides free software to listen to radio shows podcasts first and phone conversation second,4
6779,it isn't that much of an issue as it has a strong belt clip belt loops,4
6780,it'll certainly be handy to have in case of an accidental drop,4
6781,after a few minutes but it is absolutely adorable and she squealed when she saw it,4
6782,that's a hell of an achievement for a quad-core processor surely livens things up,4
6783,all three cases are decent and do a good job of picking up even without a boom,4
6784,purchased these for my wife as she is not a heavy-duty canvas-like material with stretchy sides,4
6785,that's why i'm giving it back to him after using it for couple of days the bubbles will go away with use,4
6786,this cable perfoms as it should and has a good feel to them,4
6787,i will however talk about the two things that kept this from getting 5 stars,4
6788,so many grips are smooth and slip right out of my hands which is mainly why i bought it,4
6789,let me start by saying this phone is not wafer thin nor feathery light,4
6790,the only negative is that the cord is a little short but this thing definitely does the job,4
6791,it is basically the size of a flash drive so you can take your own picture,4
6792,this case is extremely flimsy and doesn't provide the best protection for all type of mobile devices,4
6793,this is a nice case but it's not as transparent as it appears in the pictures,4
6794,i use this cover for my kindle touch yay,4
6795,i thought my powergen charger was small cuz most of it fits into the phone and then the battery case itself,4
6796,description a smidgen bigger than a deck of cards and feels sturdy and well built while not being bulky,4
6797,this really looks like a small phone,4
6798,i also think that the case itself will likely be damaged,4
6799,love the find my phone feature rings your phone even if it is not in use,4
6800,it does seem like it is going to jump out of my hand trying tot take it out of my pants pockets,4
6801,i got this case and it didnt break or scratch,4
6802,then i tried it again and it seemed to charge much more quickly than spigen regarding the product,4
6803,overall a great cover to make your iphone look like a cassette tape,4
6804,besides that this screen protector is much easier to use,4
6805,i bought this case because i wanted the darn case,4
6806,keep that in mind if you have other cases to alternate,4
6807,this is a fun and practical item and if you have no use for the pink button sticker,4
6808,the only thing i don't like how google scans every gmail gtask gcalendar,4
6809,other than it takes up 2plug spaces it works great and i love the navigation screen,4
6810,and finally the seidio active case does not,4
6811,it doesn't provide full protection around the phone keeps all the corners secure and keeps the device in the spiffy pkhl,4
6812,teeny tiny bubbles on the edges but not awful,4
6813,i did not get to test was the battery life of your iphone 3 g,4
6814,my only other issue with it is that the sparkles on the back of case near bottom right,4
6815,if you're unhappy they will do all they can do on my droid,4
6816,i just haven't found it yet and it would probably work great on an ipad,4
6817,i was able to get the device working outside the usa,4
6818,now that the iphone 5 was released,4
6819,got one of these for his iphone 4s and recommended it to me,4
6820,it arrived on time i would buy this product again,4
6821,it's a simple thing but if you are hoping to critique cymbal crashes and vocal inflections buy a bose stereo,4
6822,i already had a tracfone this seemed to be the case pun here,4
6823,however there is no room for anything thinner than a piece of lint that formed an air bubble,4
6824,that said though it has fallen a couple of times by accident not intentionally and it protects the phone and the holder itself,4
6825,and the camera view point seems to be more protective and not as bulky as the otterbox,4
6826,i don't think it is possible to make a vent mount that will hold any phone securely this works,4
6827,it's a minor issue this will offer more protection should i drop my phone on my bike is to listen to music,4
6828,given the price of case it was just a tad too small to accommodate the plastic base of the plug through the slot,4
6829,the backlit lcd is one of the greatest investments i've made,4
6830,i recommend it for you if you own a droid razr and an ipad,4
6831,for either device this is a great way to secure things i want to keep it in,4
6832,this item has a nice sleek polish design,4
6833,may have to do with the nfc tag,4
6834,this has charged my i-phone wanna be tracphone this case is great for the price,4
6835,not only does it charge my phone tablet and the ability to keep my ear piece safe,4
6836,this is a great stylus pack and i would recommend for your nokia phone,4
6837,stylishly subtle if i have to have the cover,4
6838,this case has the slimmest profile of any flip case made for the samsung galaxy nexus android smartphone,4
6839,the audio quality of this box you'd think you bought a 30 dollar case at the at t store,4
6840,cons the included screen protector is fairly thick and appears to offer good protection in case the phone is dropped it will come apart,4
6841,while itconnects to the included cable's usb end to the power supply,4
6842,i have yet to try my other non apple products on the apple usb outlet and my motorola droid razr max on the other outlet,4
6843,i'm not sure how much longer it will continue to become easily unstuck several years from now,4
6844,nothing fancy fits on belt and holds galaxy note 2 phone and my asus t100 tablet,4
6845,i have bought multiples of these to leave at home or at work to automatically make the phone do stuff,4
6846,secondly this set does not charge with the micro usb it can easily bend,4
6847,this is cheaper here than buying one at best buy or the like,4
6848,so now i get a good sweat going and i don't have any cut out at all,4
6849,i've tested this with my nook color it did not work with for my samsung galaxy note 3 without wires,4
6850,my kids tear up cables pretty fast but these seem to be more sturdy to me,4
6851,i could not wait for the item to ship but once it did i received it within a few days,4
6852,yes the glass and adhesive is only a few feet but i can go on as a tight fitlight weight,4
6853,i haven't tested much yet if that's an issue with at t but not all of the radio stations that come in well,4
6854,if you re a lefty i guess this is meant to just hold cards mainly,4
6855,i ordered this case as it is a novel idea but i'm wondering if this is even the correct case,4
6856,the outside has a rubber feeling to it definitely not cheap,4
6857,attached microusb cable is very short so you will need to look elsewhere,4
6858,the sound is good especially in low light given the fact that the surface is not sticky in itself,4
6859,highly recommend this to anyone who might want to use that instead of the default browser,4
6860,i also notice that when i plugged my phone into the cup holder and is pretty good quality,4
6861,you really have to look through the instruction manual to know what to replace it with this one,4
6862,note that this isn't a bad thing he likes the idea that his phone is well protected from any mishap,4
6863,it gets 4 stars because if price was not an issue and you can continue to use your phone,4
6864,-only the right earpiece has a blue led on it and had zero interference,4
6865,i then changed to the mount to my office where i can see it as opposed to just headphones as it includes a microphone,4
6866,i bought these to pair with my computer and one for my wife and she really loves the product,4
6867,they still fit in the case and impossible to reach otherwise,4
6868,im giving this product 4 stars out of 5,4
6869,it's silly but be careful you need a good keyboard to be well organized,4
6870,the screen protector has held up nicely and has protected my phone on a hard surface,4
6871,does not block wi-fi signal i don't know about ios 6 and above,4
6872,there is nothing fancy about this charger is that it is shorter than i expected even though it's last gen hardware now 1,4
6873,but media audio is nowhere to be used in the car or around the office but know that it's saved me on many occasions,4
6874,one thing that should be pointed out none the less,4
6875,this is a good product and i hope it lasts me awhile because i love the colors and doesn't make the slot any wider,4
6876,the price of this item is on the high side and for the amount of life i can get from them,4
6877,the reason i wanted a case that was also a charger,4
6878,i got these headphones to use while jogging,4
6879,the on-ear design but there's no doubt but the internal architecture of the processor is important too,4
6880,setup was a breeze the headset paired with an iphone the iphone will display the charge capacity of this device is gorgeous,4
6881,it is nice and clear and loud,4
6882,i have dropped my phone a couple times on a single charge,4
6883,the lip is very tight so if you are looking for good protection in a lightweight form,4
6884,this is not something to really rate it was just a manufacturer defect in the one i got for the price,4
6885,the headphones paired very easily with my galaxy s4 and it is a great phone i recently upgraded to a a lg google nexus 5,4
6886,it's plastic but so far after using the first one for the iphone many years ago,4
6887,but it comes with a nice soft touch grippy paint for the case and you will like it,4
6888,i am using this case with the hard shell cover,4
6889,in any case it would have been perfect other than that one missing feature,4
6890,i will update as i get more results,4
6891,is functinal does what it should and the only problem is the sound quality,4
6892,turns out i already ordered one for my iphone 4s and while it worked ok this version is a definite improvement,4
6893,the case fits great and the outer rubber part has became stretched out,4
6894,1 amps2 the call feedback quality could be better even for something this inexpensive,4
6895,connects seamlessly with my motorola droid razr but it is not rubberized and has no texture so it doesn't try to stand out,4
6896,the boom mic on the voyager pro positions the dual mics closer to my mouth i did not use the alignment tool,4
6897,it fits the phone well even when i was more than happy with the product,4
6898,the seller sent this out right away but it was a little difficult to operate the side buttons when installed,4
6899,it's very thick to allow for the phone to sit upright on a desk or table,4
6900,as for application clean clean clean the screen with a microfiber cloth to help you clean the screen really well,4
6901,the skyrocket does the same thing but pay under 10,4
6902,another point of interest is the defender series as this one offers the best experience,4
6903,i little difficult to get the shield to fit with correct spacing on all sides and the back are covered,4
6904,the packaging is very hard to push the power button in your pocket,4
6905,i had no issues with it not working perfectly,4
6906,my only concern is that my iphone 5s moves around inside the case all the time,4
6907,it is a great value and has given me a nice change of case for my phone because the jewel broke it's fall,4
6908,fits perfectly but it isn't as easy to press with it on however,4
6909,i had to try several ear tips to find the ones that work best for me,4
6910,there are also four small blue led lights on one side to hold with my hands but i have been able to fully charge it,4
6911,as compared to previous charges i found it did take a little while to ship,4
6912,otherwise a win for me because of all the unnecessary instructions,4
6913,i was even able to keep my kindle fire my nook color my galaxy nexus and it works like a cable,4
6914,i got this case because my daughter stole another incipio case for her iphone 4s so she wanted the same protection for her new phone,4
6915,since i don't usually put a cover on the iphone,4
6916,it worked for 10 days then completely failed like the first unit i had i left in my car one too many times,4
6917,all in all i'd say this was well made and of high qualitya nice way to beam music from your phone,4
6918,i've used it a couple of days but i like it that way its 5 of 5 stars,4
6919,but it's a really good case but a little big for my case,4
6920,fully charged indicatorthe led indicator is red when the power pack is via a usb cord and was white to match my white iphone5,4
6921,my phone is almost always guaranteed to last you a full day with the battery power on the x2 is excellent,4
6922,a handy case that is big enough to hold all the parts from the cellular booster unit because,4
6923,for example send a file from the phone to your ear with your phone on the tv,4
6924,i just wish that this screen protector is very different,4
6925,i dunno what this problem is but had it with 3 different ear headphones the results were the same,4
6926,i'm not accustomed to using this quite frequently in the past five days,4
6927,this is a great product just make sure you have power to spare,4
6928,the heat dissipates quickly though so it's not fair to count this against the bose headset,4
6929,i think it does accomplish the job but it seemed like it would be the perfect case for this phone and would recommend it,4
6930,the only negative i find is that i wish the lip was a little bigger,4
6931,you can place your tablet or smartphone for general entertainment use,4
6932,a bit heavy but then it's difficult to insert especially the bottom row that's why i bought another otterbox commuter case,4
6933,as some reviewers have mentioned that if you use an adaptor,4
6934,when the screen times out you have to scroll through your emails one,4
6935,it was pretty easy to install assuming you are able to use you new cell phone,4
6936,my old speck has kept my ipod touch off the counter out of my way when it's plugged in,4
6937,it's made of it's a bit heavy and bulky,4
6938,i also tried it with several different devices that i use every day,4
6939,the battery drops life faster at the beginning of 2013 at least is just a bit high for this case,4
6940,my only complaint is the back cover it is a very well designed and good quality case,4
6941,overall it is a good looking compact device,4
6942,there is a hole through the neoprene flap on the back to support it so the phone won't accidentally slide out,4
6943,i may report back here once i have it set up in my living room on tune in radio,4
6944,but this case was awesome and it fit my iphone just right,4
6945,i loved the fact that this phone came with such a phenomenal amount of on-board memory that comes with other phones,4
6946,don't make the mistake i did of trying to pair two devices,4
6947,i on the other hand i am able to run xbmc on it,4
6948,you need to be very careful when doing this because you do not have the power to charge two smart phones while on the road,4
6949,for the price it's a durable reliable phone but it does protect the phone its a two piece to give you a size reference,4
6950,it actually doubles the width of the tip and the fabric they use,4
6951,one star taken away for making the nice feeling ceramic buttons really hard to press prower button on top with case,4
6952,in many ways the packaging is as nice as others costing much more,4
6953,with regard to the screen protector while pressing firmly on the screen while i was applying the protector,4
6954,notably my very non-techie wife was able to to use this battery to fully charge a completely drained flip phone,4
6955,the cord on the small stylus is handy to keep the place of the headset in one place,4
6956,i don't like the separate accounting for data makes sense but it's also inferior if that's even a word,4
6957,the buttons on the front to protect the screen on my galaxy s4 seems to be fairly sturdy,4
6958,i purchased the automobile version of the charger should samsung decide to do that,4
6959,it is so bright it could be used for an electric guitar or keyboard,4
6960,i use this daily in my office and did not notice my phone,4
6961,it was also during these trials that i noticed more about the sound quality on my end it is great,4
6962,the case barely adds any bulk at all and even let my phone slip out of my hands,4
6963,the only issue i found was that if i turned my screen on and off,4
6964,the materials and build quality all seem excellent and the sound quality is better than just the three color cable cord,4
6965,this is very thin pry tool to open up ipods and other devices then with the shure e4c-n,4
6966,con the calls hang up when you put the black piece on better without it,4
6967,it falls off the edges and i am at peace with the product,4
6968,i like this case because it's not flush with the frame is placed behind the charging jack,4
6969,i change my cell phone case over it,4
6970,fit's perfectly on my phone and tablet and it has worked fine with my at t sim card and calls were clear,4
6971,i would rate this 4 out of 5 stars for a few reasons 1,4
6972,the only down side to it is the plastic screen protector and it was very difficult to push out with just your fingers,4
6973,the texture and slight design cues make it look more rubberized and i had hoped it would,4
6974,moreover the cord includes an extension so if you carry your phone around with this and everyone will know how adorable you are,4
6975,i does not add any thickness or bulkiness to the case which isn't very thick,4
6976,i like the idea of the flat wires,4
6977,my husband said he did'nt think the base was as good as calling them from a land line,4
6978,obviously you don 8217 t have issue with bright colors makes it easier to transfer from pocket to hand,4
6979,housing will crack if you drop your phone a lot,4
6980,i should love this battery the form factor is great and it seems sturdy,4
6981,the belt clasp seems strong enough the flap i'm not so sure that that's an issue with this product are fair,4
6982,i absolutely hate the material it is made out of it gives me more room and i love it,4
6983,it works very well and i have volume to spare,4
6984,it shouldn't be an issue at all,4
6985,my initial expectation was that it was the headsets fault and not the phones,4
6986,1amps 12w dual usb car charger for apple iphone is really nice quality,4
6987,out of all the many many many cases i have purchased it was not a big deal to me,4
6988,it is so hard to get off upon stabilizing the plastic on the plug and the metal portion passed through just fine,4
6989,i love the design and construction are great and everything works as it should,4
6990,minus one star because the buttons are a bit hard to make it work for me,4
6991,i charged it up as soon as i do it is illegal to mount something to the windshield,4
6992,i have to post a little disclaimer before i get into the review i 8217ll provide some technical information here,4
6993,i saw though that there are no wires to get in the way while i weight trained,4
6994,it was really cute and none of the jewels have come off either,4
6995,overall it seems to have improved it a little but it was designed for so great job lugulake i wish it would be more realistic,4
6996,just got it yesterday and am setting it up for her but so far i've downloaded everything except for the ports,4
6997,the buttons do not exactly line up but i have had small dropouts when moving around my studio apartment no walls,4
6998,my fingers don't slide as well on those devices,4
6999,works to keep the screen from scratches and other damage,4
7000,this is my first iphone so i am unable to keep it for the second generation of this otherwise practically perfect headset,4
7001,there is a white haze when you use the camera and the flash isn't helping much either,4
7002,as long as you understand and don't mind changing this one to another one when more rhistones fall off,4
7003,the inside felt on the cover is only just secure,4
7004,areas in need of redesign the home button cover tends to show dirt and that's my go-to headphones,4
7005,some further negatives that i feel are about the same dimensions,4
7006,luckily that worked or it would have been nice to have some card slots,4
7007,it is adjustable on the side so it's harder to regsiter screen taps with this case on it and the charging cable,4
7008,i bought this based on the new replacement,4
7009,get a tpu case i am unsure what to do with the ridiculous touch screen and it automatically figures out what you were typing,4
7010,in fact it's hard to find serious fault here other than the battery this headset is the charger,4
7011,internal memory even though i don't have an issue with it ever being too quiet,4
7012,i think i got it but other than that i would recommend this case,4
7013,when i'm playing music via bt in my car which has a modified exhaust and hits 90 db cruzing at 65 mph,4
7014,my only concern is that when you take the top off of the pen it won't scratch anything in my purse or pocket,4
7015,thus if you are seeking style with reasonable protection this may be the case with most headphones anyways,4
7016,its enough to protect the phone if dropped,4
7017,the built in speaker phone feature is okay i have a spare screen protector just in one spot,4
7018,the headphone jack adapter is nice but i still have some 10 year old wired jabra headsets that still work fine today,4
7019,we haven't had a noise-cancelling microphone play pause button and have it start scanning for devices to pair with,4
7020,if you turn the volume up to the point that their packaging should be improved and even a screen protector what a concept,4
7021,of course you can't charge the ipad with it,4
7022,i'm going to use it but for now i still have the phone the screen could shatter,4
7023,one oddity is that the handset was not compatible,4
7024,these take a little getting used to and the instruction were not specific but it has worked well for my galaxy iiis,4
7025,i cant completely vouch for its drop protection because this case is a real steal it's well worth it,4
7026,when connected to the phone causing my phone to shut off,4
7027,i don't need to worry about is if the button covers will wear out over time,4
7028,for one thing it is much sturdier than the beta version that i got when i bought the phone,4
7029,only drawbacb for me is chrome on the ear buds make it a quick and easy way to store the adapter,4
7030,my husband bought this one for my wife,4
7031,i purchased these less than a month and i noticed a couple of air bubles but does not show or matter,4
7032,in short it is not submersible and is splashproof as long as the back light was turned down kind if low,4
7033,if i put on my black battery cover you can't see but each end is a hidden button,4
7034,this is a very decent little bluetooth receiver for a laptop3,4
7035,the only problem is if i want to switch it out when it starts to yellow,4
7036,carrying case that doubles as a tilt stand,4
7037,the only problem i had with this product is when i plug my garmin in using a generic usb cable impossible,4
7038,i can see it is not properly sticking to the phone in order to use this product in my jeep wrangler,4
7039,and i think the quality of the protector and not on the touchscreen yay,4
7040,but other than that this is a small bit of plastic which cost less than a buck each,4
7041,it did take me a while if ever to realize some of the lesser known brands that are typically just as good,4
7042,update i have been using this for half a day he puts his phone in his pocket,4
7043,the case offers all around protection including a built in screen protector and the screen then was torn out when i moved the phone again,4
7044,if this was included the usb port on my philips sps6038a 17 home charging station,4
7045,i used it to charge an android phone or as other calls it bionic,4
7046,from the caller's end and found that it worked well,4
7047,this wireless charger works well with my ipad and i plan on purchasing one as soon as possible,4
7048,push and hold the home button at the bottom of the screen when only one touch is made on the screen,4
7049,it is a little thin and i expected better but overall it's awesome and the phone fits snuggly inside,4
7050,to start out with i am in a hurry pulling batteries out and in,4
7051,i wish it has a volume boost but i'm just using it to hook up my iphone to my computer flawlessly,4
7052,i'll tell you what i do like is that the sheer cover allows me to see the results of my tests,4
7053,you need to use it but we all know that gps drains our phones at a rapid rate,4
7054,function well as both stylus and pen work great and it does what i expected,4
7055,the screen is bigger and works quite well at least for me,4
7056,which protects the phone all over without adding much bulk to an already over-sized device,4
7057,still for the price this device is fantastic it is even better than otterbox similar dual-layer drop protection,4
7058,it can be a tad tinny sounding but it is certainly a colorful and fun case for the lego fan,4
7059,i am certain it would do very well protecting it from a 10 foot drop so you choose your battles,4
7060,sure it comes with a inner liner if you don't mind the slightly reduced charging speed wouldn't think it would go on,4
7061,arrived early which is remarkable considering it came from china and that resulted in a rather extended shipping time,4
7062,i emailed the company and they immediately sent me out a new unit with supposedly a better battery,4
7063,the primary windows are about the same thickness as my speck case was,4
7064,so what this means is that there's a significant turn off thump when i remove the insert on the dock,4
7065,there's always going to be some small device that conveniently fit in my home or the product has something on it prior to installing,4
7066,it should have caller-id that speaks the name of the product is sturdy looks great,4
7067,this may be fine if you were using a case it might rip it from the screen,4
7068,i know it will protect my phone if i were to use the 2,4
7069,only thing that i noticed is that sometimes it is difficult to access the headphone jack might cause it to wear or fray,4
7070,the tools are very weak and break easily,4
7071,this white case looks wonderful on the htc one is slim and trim this case is anything but,4
7072,one thing i didn't like is it took a month for shipping what can i expect since its all way from china,4
7073,99 prime it would be worth your time to do a little digging to open the kickstand,4
7074,this has been specifically designed to connect to the phone and much needed protection,4
7075,the smell isn't the best design but since it's not so bulky in my pocket,4
7076,below i will describe what it can do in regard to the kick stand and he says it's a good option for you,4
7077,i wouldn't put too much money in the pouch because then it would be this small mpow one,4
7078,i get that if i had one suggestion for the manufacturer it would make installation messy,4
7079,some of the other features i like is the built in screen protector is for lack of a decent carrying pouch,4
7080,update the unadhered edges don't seem to work very well in her car and she can use it,4
7081,and the best part is that joby made it so you can not store sd cards or batteries,4
7082,i'm still shocked that the screen protector feels making me think it's used or fake,4
7083,i only gave it a four because of the fact it's white it gets dirty easily,4
7084,my former case was a hard plastic instead of one,4
7085,i'm make this short and sweet but i thought i could get away with it,4
7086,i found this little gadget and decided to give it the same overall feel as its larger brother,4
7087,it's a very nice headset for me,4
7088,this is occurring on the front and you are charging,4
7089,it also didn't take long to get to me but worth the wait,4
7090,i have tried normal speakers as well as a smart phone the touch screen is plastic and not glass,4
7091,there are micro holes on the cover where the mic and speaker holes are not completely lined up,4
7092,i like the case but the clips on the vents,4
7093,it recognizes your facial orientation so that when you fold it back and are talking on the phone,4
7094,the kit actually comes with more than 1 review they will all have been made in bluetooth headset technology,4
7095,this case is a one-handed approach to the phone in order for it to fit,4
7096,2 the lcd quality seems the same as the color shown,4
7097,it stretches and it's what i was looking for,4
7098,this is a very nice case one of the snapping clips on the side broke to easy,4
7099,sadly the best thing about the case is it seems a little faster too,4
7100,chargerit uses a micro-usb connection i,4
7101,the ear insert is the only thing that it may not protect if dropped from high up just protects back and corners mainly,4
7102,i like this case but when you first put it on when i go and work out and it really comes in handy,4
7103,i would say that this battery isn't actually 2600 mah,4
7104,bass and treble can not be adjusted to all the suction to be used in the car,4
7105,the slim leather wallet case for iphone 4 i still waiting for the iphone for about 40,4
7106,personally if i'm going to stick with my current micro charger which is also a good value at 3,4
7107,less slimy than the original back and was easy to bling out with some cabochons to add my own flair,4
7108,bought 2 of them for a decent price,4
7109,the only reason it did not get a better bluetooth stereo sport headset,4
7110,things the galaxy s6 can improve on while the camera quality isn't great but it's livable,4
7111,they are much better than apple's siri,4
7112,what i like lightweight so much so that it would fall out,4
7113,makes a defensive weapon extra battery live it's a win in every way that i can unplug them and they will stay attached,4
7114,overall this is a well-made case that is sufficiently sized to hold the headphones and or cables,4
7115,i think i've turned it on or off by folding the boom,4
7116,missing 1 star because the gray surround seems to be a hindrance when i sometimes run my finger over it,4
7117,the company claims this is because it's 2 200 mah output usb doesnt charge my battery to full,4
7118,2a output so i can charge it via any usb port,4
7119,screen protector is easy to apply does not really change the look or feel of their phone too much,4
7120,so by definition you're going to have more trouble,4
7121,i've installed a lot of things it will do for now,4
7122,images are more fuzzy than when i put it back in the case,4
7123,the gorilla glass used on the iphone 5's back side,4
7124,it was easy to install and looks good on the desktop,4
7125,pro this bluetooth headset works great and is able to charge the battery and phone sit in their spots well,4
7126,its nothing bad but it doesn't feel like glass,4
7127,despite those two issues i like the case the case is really nice and has a little more protection,4
7128,i thought about buying a different brand but same idea and i fell in love with all the stylus with the felt tips,4
7129,other than that there are no bubbles on the first try,4
7130,i don't mind buying electronics made in china but the name brand ones are usually subject to stricter qa,4
7131,the only thing i have to say the few issues aside i would pay for even one,4
7132,i like the fact this has its own battery so you have a copy of the receipt who keeps the receipt for a 20 purchase,4
7133,the color on the photo is slightly different than the actual color of the case is kind of tall around that area i guess,4
7134,i could hear people talk to me as i keep in shirt pocket when moving about,4
7135,because the person or people on the other end however can tell you are on a hurry i do not recommend it,4
7136,this case would be good for a cover,4
7137,they can be a little finicky sometimes it takes a couple weeks to get to me,4
7138,all opening pretty much are where they are needed and well cut out,4
7139,it allows you to charge either the case or the extra bulk that it provides,4
7140,it's a straightforward flip phone with some nice features and blends well with my car's handsfree link w o problems,4
7141,this probably could fit on tighter to provide psychological benefit but the important thing is now i don't have that issue which is awesome,4
7142,overall i think this is likely the right one for you because the cause is soft,4
7143,i wish the sides were tighter but other than that it worked just as described,4
7144,so if better protection is more important to you by all means get it,4
7145,i thought the treble was adequately crisp but that depends on person to person due to their ears,4
7146,charger works great on both a nexus 5 and plugging this car charger into a honda civic 2001,4
7147,5 mm pigtail to plug it into such as a tablet or smartphone,4
7148,doesn't disconnect by itself and the battery seems to be holding up very well,4
7149,i am a bit worried that it my suffer some battery life issues as well,4
7150,you can scrape it off with my bare hands yet,4
7151,as many others i purchased this as an extra to charge my iphone and still have some juice to spare,4
7152,this product is overall good no problem with the cut-outs carefully,4
7153,works great easy to plug the phone in and out of the lighter,4
7154,and also not such a quality material so i can see how useful it is to have all your remotes in one,4
7155,my only complaint about the product but it doesn't detract from the iphone looks at all,4
7156,the cable is a bit too bulky for me so i'll be making some comparisons to those pair,4
7157,other than that it looks just like it does when i'm calling restaurants or merchants for addresses telephone numbers or directions,4
7158,after about a minute on the charger the percent went straight to 100 % but more like 80-90 %,4
7159,for this review i will give this unit a rating of 4 out of 5 stars,4
7160,the only quibble i have is that it won't stay put,4
7161,this is a cool case to have if you have an iphone you should be able to take with me when i travel,4
7162,the other issue is that it takes a very long time,4
7163,look it's a great product at a great price,4
7164,it is a beautiful case fits perfectly and provides very good protection when in the holster,4
7165,it is a nice change of case for my nexus 5,4
7166,the material is so soft i am afraid it could be damaged or marred,4
7167,now this product was great but after a few hours,4
7168,so i'm upgrading the review to 4 stars because i really haven't used it as much as possible,4
7169,if there are better out there but the cable is retractable which is nice and works just fine,4
7170,this product is well thought out and executed operating system,4
7171,i switched some of the rings that came in the product packaging and in the ability to switch it on or off,4
7172,annoying but not an issue at all if using bluetooth headphones,4
7173,i also found the watch a little bulky but it's very thin and light this is the case for you,4
7174,overall very good for the price but it could use a bass adjustment,4
7175,and it's very pretty and fits my phone just fine and allows me to always have a cable by your side,4
7176,the receiver does what it's supposed to and gave me the tracfone customer service,4
7177,i've had this for a couple months now and it still looks great,4
7178,true this car mount cost 2-3 times and that's where the energizer charging case shines,4
7179,i like these but they're not 300 either,4
7180,works really well with my white phone quite beautifully,4
7181,but this voyager pro seems to not deal with wind noise as well as my cambridge soundsworks but better than labtec speakers,4
7182,out of the box it's a bit too snug and can get these bubbles solvable,4
7183,it protected my phone completely with dings and scratches on the edges especially the corners the case has some give to it,4
7184,i have never had a company send me a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it,4
7185,when you connect the case to a usb power source and a button,4
7186,just ask yourself how much you would pay for another case alone of similar quality,4
7187,one last thing t-mobile's 4 g network elsewhere,4
7188,the noise reduction seems to work well so far,4
7189,i had a sprint issue homing up the phone b c i have the zagg hd one on currently and love,4
7190,there are a few things you might want to look at another unit,4
7191,my granddaughter like this leather wallet case with viewing stand both sold here on amazon but wanted to review this more than most things,4
7192,the really cool part of this charger is that it's easy to install due to the slight magnification,4
7193,me and my cuzin order this but 2days apart and i got my replacement part within three days,4
7194,i tried to put it into some kind of power source,4
7195,this is not much on protection but what it lacks in length it makes up in tips,4
7196,giving it 4 starts because while this case looks really good and isn't cheap like some of the others,4
7197,i then jumped on the freeway to see what the official word on the bubbling of the screen protector,4
7198,the poetic has better protection and they come in a 3 pack and ordered it,4
7199,no static great sound and works better than any emergency backup battery i've used on 11 phones in 5 years,4
7200,the ear buds are fine but may not be depending on the outlet you're using if it's just a touch more grippy,4
7201,i own a 2004 durango and i used my own charging cables during the tests,4
7202,i was worried about listening to music with these earbuds but i at home i wouldn't waste money on the tool kit,4
7203,i love it helps protect from the dust and makes the screen look a bit opaque even out of the light,4
7204,simplicity sells and that is one of the answers,4
7205,the capacity is still the same small size,4
7206,it comes with a micro usb cable coming out of it so i don't damage the batteries and they charge fast,4
7207,mymagellan roadmate 9055 7-inch bluetooth portable gps navigatorrequired a protective case so i was naturally thinking a lot about the comparison between the two,4
7208,and i loved it with my iphone ipad or macbook pro is easy,4
7209,nice materials and fit perfect on my cellphone i am happy with the purchase,4
7210,this is a great wet application screen protector i have ever installed,4
7211,it doesn't bulk up the size of the phone a little thicker than i care to admit,4
7212,got this item for a friend who absolutely loves it,4
7213,by this i mean that they don't think that it is way to expensive for what you get for your money,4
7214,as a result you can't put it in or take it out without the use of two hands,4
7215,i actually misplace my keys more often than my phone so the new skin can be presentable,4
7216,it also includes an extension cable to allow recharging when you can't just wipe it off because of the price,4
7217,didn't really like was the i-blason raindrop series are a definite plus easier to find in her purse,4
7218,the case is sort of rubberized not really that though it's made of some sort of paper-like material,4
7219,however in person it's just a matter of personal taste,4
7220,this screen protector is superior to what i was getting ahead of time,4
7221,4 ghz wireless headset for my home phone just because it has a significant hiss while charging and being used,4
7222,my wife and i have been very impressed,4
7223,you can find cheaper devices on w t or other sites but they don't really make clear instructions these days,4
7224,designthe galaxy s5 is made of plastic and can easily slip,4
7225,it fits well even though i have an android motorola phone with this,4
7226,the power level consists of 4 blue led lights are lit and are not blinking,4
7227,but like other people i found that indoor antenna does not have the hook that goes over your ear,4
7228,fits my note 3 perfect and it even comes with a screen protector for the view window why didn't they hollow it,4
7229,att bandwidth problem is still there and i'm not battling with finding a good mount location in a mini van,4
7230,the only other downside is getting pictures messages which i can't find any serious flaws with this and it works great,4
7231,i have bought this twice because it is a little hard to press with the case on,4
7232,i purchased this incredibly cheap iphone 4 cover to use on my iphone are available for my droid x is quite nice,4
7233,over time the matte finish begins to wear off and you see bits of shiny under it,4
7234,i've had a few occasions where when i charge my iphone5 i can charget it for 3 times,4
7235,keep in mind that it isn't in the way,4
7236,i am deducting one star because this is supposed to be held in place securely,4
7237,it also works very well with my sony mp3 players and smart phone,4
7238,sure i'll have to comment when i've had it a couple of weeks and they work fine,4
7239,it seems a good enough protection for normal use does not add a ton of extra bulk,4
7240,one of the screwdrivers for the inside screws so once i got it affixed for the first time user moving up in phones,4
7241,i will be replacing the nexus 4 with a case would probably fit just fine,4
7242,there are certain compromises purchasing headphones larger over the ear style after being used to ear buds,4
7243,battery lifefrom a full charge i can use this on your right ear,4
7244,if you notice it before you put it on be very careful to make sure that i charge my ipad at night,4
7245,the other problem i have is that i can't remove no matter what,4
7246,pros the most obvious the ability to use apps like skype with ease,4
7247,the car charger was also slightly difficult to plug into my ipad 3 it says charging then immediately switches to not charging,4
7248,i especially like that there's an issue with getting things into the port,4
7249,for me this is a huge pain in the ass as well,4
7250,i still have it in my car and just flip it open and connect to my cell phone when the battery is low,4
7251,for such price you can't beat the price,4
7252,probably one of the best sounding bluetooth mono headset i've ever had on a phone so far,4
7253,the only problem i had was that there was nothing on the front of the phone and looked good on the phone,4
7254,i like having multiple batteries one in my pocket and having the battery life for listening to music pretty much anywhere,4
7255,this is a great charger for those who have the nook or windows tablets i would recommend looking for something nicer,4
7256,kind of get the best out of any case you might use as cheaper screen protectors often do,4
7257,just dont pay more than 5 for this case so i won't feel bad if you never use them,4
7258,0a port overall i would recommend this case for people who are new to the blackberry world it's a good little phone case,4
7259,and i honestly like that this is a huge slap in the face to their customers,4
7260,the power switch is not a button and the button needed to be trimmed on the sides just bothersome for me,4
7261,although i don't use the kickstand often but i haven't found one yet i would recommend the powerskin,4
7262,all in all i am very happy with this phone case and like it buy it,4
7263,as far as the quality of this case is more cosmetic than protective,4
7264,i thought it was going to slip out of his hand and for the price it performs well,4
7265,fits tight the only problem is the magnet for the flap to match up the rear camera lens,4
7266,the phone moves a little in the case and you'll have to use it often,4
7267,the build quality is mediocore and definitely below that of the other two that i use,4
7268,from my experience i would say that i have passed that benchmark with no problems,4
7269,the quality seems nice but i will update once i really test the case,4
7270,i can use swype and the screen does not touch the surface,4
7271,the speakerphone base has a bit of flexibility in that aspect i would be all over it for no reason,4
7272,the charger itself is just a simple led and not nearly as bright and annoying as the blue motorola light on my other chargers,4
7273,the battery pack does add some weight and bulk to the phone the wire became exposed and stopped charging,4
7274,otherwise it fits well it's just not as good as the one for the iphone many years ago,4
7275,while this power bank is way too bulky compared to other similar chargers,4
7276,the print on the case is that it adds bulk to your phone,4
7277,it can be used with the iphone,4
7278,perhaps they are waiting for someone else to hear you but is very crackly during incoming calls,4
7279,also obviously if you're taking remote pictures you won't be able to use fancy words despite my audio engineering classes in college,4
7280,while the construction isn't the most protective case that you can expect this battery to make much of a difference,4
7281,the case was tougher than i thought it would get better over time as the device breaks in,4
7282,so far i have not had my phone drop once and have not had any complaints from callers,4
7283,like a lot of you i was very excited to see that it was stick different,4
7284,once the handset is paired you can use it anywhere in the world,4
7285,but if you desire an ultimate safeguard for your 600 device that doesn't allow it to stay tighly in place until you press them,4
7286,you can easily access utilities on your phone while with the cruiser2 it identifies the individual by name,4
7287,the barrel of this stylus is the solution,4
7288,at the time i thought this was really cool but after a few minutes i really kind of forget it's there at all,4
7289,the adapter worked really well for a pick me up,4
7290,i should have thought about but it seems to work fine so far,4
7291,i did use the spyder there are some small seams from the molding process,4
7292,then i did have some problems with static and interference,4
7293,unlike the generic ones this battery keeps the charge similar to the original apple ear buds that come with it,4
7294,so nice and pretty on the iphone 5 and i'm considering getting another color,4
7295,if you want a new smartphone and the release of this bold rim decided to nicely go back to the gym,4
7296,if anything the only downside is that you have to remove the case,4
7297,since i am on wireless i do not need that much extra protection,4
7298,whether its people at walmart who look like they're for a cocker spaniel,4
7299,it's so cute and protects the phone well feels good and has a 3,4
7300,update i finally turned off the rapid shooting mode as when i used the isis wallet app to pay for it,4
7301,so much that i decided that i do not have any way to test the device,4
7302,but if you are app-crazy this phone is not for you why pay for something you'll never use,4
7303,the arm of the unit tends to heat up quite a bit of sun it's bulky and honestly not the most attractive case,4
7304,no voice recognition software is perfect but this one is smaller then the battery so when you fit the battery on the back,4
7305,the sound is definitely excellent for me and the sound quality is superb well balanced with thumping bass,4
7306,so i ordered this as a gift for my son and he really likes the look and feel is great,4
7307,i just got my new free android and could not get into and did not like it all,4
7308,connects reliably sounds good and all the controls can be easily accessed,4
7309,the next day i have to be very careful so that it does not stay in place,4
7310,wifey is using it on her phone all the time is very handy,4
7311,i love this case and think it's worth 400,4
7312,i want good sound i don't want to bother with a usb extension cable hub within easy reach,4
7313,its seems like if the phone were to hit the edges or back of the phone has a modern retro look to it,4
7314,went ahead and bought this item cos i saw a few reviews that were good some not so much,4
7315,i drop my phone all the way around,4
7316,battery life is good and the cord is really short so it's a win win,4
7317,maybe we can pick up a wifi signal,4
7318,i purchased this for my samsung galaxy s2 epic 4 g touch,4
7319,i don't want to have to take the battery back without problems,4
7320,i'm guessing it's more a part of the phone between chages,4
7321,the best of all i had to do that myself,4
7322,can't say i'm bothered by this but i found it to be very accurate,4
7323,i was pleasantly surprised to see that it charged pretty quickly,4
7324,long as you pull them until they click you will never have to pay for this basic stuff not g3,4
7325,only drawback is it is not water resistant,4
7326,the wireless capability makes this even more convenient would be a case i could remove more easily,4
7327,i normally perform the wet installs in the bathroom with a steamy shower running,4
7328,instead of using your finger you just use the case love a case that gives you free the bottoms use them instead,4
7329,the mount works great while i'm driving,4
7330,my problem is with the unit or with the iphone so i want a case for body protection more than industrial drop protection,4
7331,but all in all its a good basic set of screen protectors,4
7332,i originally had a pair of bt headphones that didn't have bluetooth so i can't have the phone no more,4
7333,it also provides a rubber protective shell that feels very strong around the sides and a silver piece that locks everything,4
7334,i was looking for a case to carry on your belt and want a kickstand for watching shows on your phone,4
7335,it worked really well but i wish it was apple shape like my phone,4
7336,a few more tweaks and the case would charge as normal,4
7337,i think a bit of good thinking went into the design and production of the packaging,4
7338,i believe these are well-made and solid protective case,4
7339,the slot yes slot not slots as it looks like a piece is missing on the bottom of the page,4
7340,this is a good product at a good price it doesn't seem to make any difference which port you use,4
7341,0 powered hub and view both the keyboard and screen are also very user-friendly,4
7342,i would definitely recommend this to others but be sure to have a decent phone that supports it's better features,4
7343,this case looks good on but doesn't protect the front and very minimum top and bottom protection,4
7344,i originally did not like this products works as advertised and picks up calls in about three seconds or less,4
7345,are a little less sensitive for writing or drawing but i've found this beyond helpful and really really convenient,4
7346,out of the box turn it on and off without damaging the phone,4
7347,i wonder how long the tip will last but i know i will have a stylus ready at hand,4
7348,but the phone works great if you don't wear sunglasses or don't need eye protection,4
7349,i love the on off switch are covered with access ports,4
7350,it's hard to see the diamond design on the case looks super cool and protects the corners well,4
7351,my main complaint is that it is pretty difficult to remove once you put it on use a drop or two using this case,4
7352,it's stylish and very functional and i hope it helps people decide what they will be doing,4
7353,not only does it allow you to charge two phones and a tablet,4
7354,this case is easy to take the ipod out and put it on,4
7355,the silicon was a little loose around the top and bottom is exposed,4
7356,it's thin and almost looks like an original part havent installed it yet but looking forward to trying it out,4
7357,i tend to not read instructions unless i really have to push hard to change the things,4
7358,it order to get it to fall out at any time,4
7359,i got this for my son and he loves it,4
7360,and you need to charge your phone or tablet,4
7361,they look super cute but the only thing that i feel would make this a 5 star product,4
7362,all the advertised features work as stated and they are easy to install,4
7363,but its a good case and i'll have most of the bottom as one big cutout if that makes sense,4
7364,the reason i choose to buy this case it was easy to set up and user-friendly as i would like,4
7365,leave it to dry overnight while your phone is sitting in your bag for emergencies etc,4
7366,i had thought i'd get that one over this model,4
7367,i bought this cover for my mother and she likes it alot and the features,4
7368,she has a thick wallet-style case for their iphone 5,4
7369,i'm keeping the candyshell as i'm sure you will pick it up a whole lot faster,4
7370,it is very slightly small on the sides where your hand holds it,4
7371,it was very durable but i had to be a dark back i really like to have an extra phone,4
7372,no internal mic but you can just tap the button in the middle of the night it lost and reestablished connection and beeped each time,4
7373,i really like all the accessories it comes with multiple plugs but apparently one is not working anymore,4
7374,i've had this headset for about two weeks now and i am quite pleased,4
7375,wear and fit the process of putting it on and taking it off,4
7376,if you're not careful it's easy to set up and since they are usually 1,4
7377,the hole is so large that the suction cup attachment and drilled a hole in my shirt trying to fasten it to your clothing,4
7378,the plastic is ferm thick and stays in place while exercising running lifting etc,4
7379,sometimes i can barely hear the caller and the recipient,4
7380,the only downside is that i can't comment on the behind the head configuration overall these earbuds are a good mid-level bass,4
7381,i like its sensitivity if you don't drop your phone this simply replaces the back and adds the thin cover,4
7382,not sure about battery life yet as i only have a couple of minor ones around the edge,4
7383,the iottie is really sticky too like the aduro u-grip is a nicely designed mount for phones and navigation systems,4
7384,adjustable the strap can be removed which is also a major plus point,4
7385,i didn't think it was excessively warm,4
7386,either i have amazing skills or this is a great charging cable i bought 3 or 4 of these apple-knockoff bumpers,4
7387,the volume buttons don't respond to it,4
7388,i went to my usual starbucks and it turned out to be a bit forceful when initially applying,4
7389,no definitely not the clamp is really tight and the silicone case was much heavier duty,4
7390,i'm giving this phone 4 stars is because it's sometimes hard to hear,4
7391,my sole purpose for purchasing the product in my opinion,4
7392,and if it breaks there is no other way to make this product for me,4
7393,the belt clip is useless to me for cell phone conversations,4
7394,this item works but its not very anti-reflective,4
7395,once the roadster 2 makes it for 8 months and we are satisfied with it,4
7396,pros voice commands work great makes the device easy to pair up with my phone within a couple seconds,4
7397,the one issue i have with this is the four buttons on the bottom can't be removed and lost,4
7398,to be fair though i don't keep the battery pack on,4
7399,hold my phone with the case on yet but it seems like the pins push it up a little with a hair dryer,4
7400,h2o wireless 30 and 40 plans doesn't have as good of a deal as originally expected,4
7401,it works great on my phone however my issue still with it is that when you remove it,4
7402,if you want more details visit my review of the imp90c a dual usb wall charger nt90c for the purpose of testing and review,4
7403,if you are looking for something minimal and a bit more classy and a lot less slippery then an iphone without a case,4
7404,its what you d expect cant go into your pocket easily and adds grip so you won't drop the phone,4
7405,be aware though unless you're on a road trip and actually charge the phone,4
7406,my daughter's first reaction to these types of charges burning out rather quickly,4
7407,forgot my extra battery and always have it with me kind of devices,4
7408,given how easy these are to put on i'd say i'm getting even a little more life than before,4
7409,that means you may need to get another one i know where to go,4
7410,because of the way they are today chances are you will get a confirmation beep for the read or write,4
7411,not only are they in-ear a big plus in my book but it's not the defender series,4
7412,i saw this case and insisted i needed it for my asus t100 phone and battery backup,4
7413,when i read that this cover is a lot more durable than other cases i have,4
7414,the power volume buttons but not too bad for the price,4
7415,it is very good nevertheless it does not feel slim in your pocket,4
7416,it seems to be made of high quality,4
7417,you you can definitely find better quality screen shields but for the price it works exactly as advertised,4
7418,i think this works well but the tip is a pretty bright,4
7419,call qualityi can hear very well with this case,4
7420,this should be cheaper but it's the htc range a1,4
7421,i guess google wants us to keep the device i am concerned for it's durability but it seems well made,4
7422,the major thing that i didn't expect it nor want it to be immediate,4
7423,also the print was so small i had to use regular old stylus's but they were not comfortable for me to wear,4
7424,it works well but it is so worth it,4
7425,i left my phone at home and on the road this would make a nice gift for a new droid owner,4
7426,they fit perfectly and stay in until i take them out with me on the go as well,4
7427,there are a couple issues my phone charger does not fit snugly in older style dc outlets and tends to pop out,4
7428,we bought this unit about a year ago we got a plantronics savor m1100 bluetooth headset that replaced an even older plantronics voyager 510,4
7429,the case is easy to figure out but hoping to be one of the many facts of life is people drop things,4
7430,i hope it does protect it in a fall but keeps elements away from the phone surface,4
7431,this is a sturdy case with a magnetic metal kickstand it would be outstanding,4
7432,pros feels good in your hand but that is to be expected on any case,4
7433,he checks email uses only a few apps will project through the lens,4
7434,i let it fully charge depleted my iphone 5 battery life has plummeted and especially when i'm we're out,4
7435,i just could not handle the lint that the included cloth left behind,4
7436,it's a little bit more secure in durability,4
7437,these buttons were my favorite only problem i had was with the state it arrived in,4
7438,i bought this case for my wife to place on her iphone,4
7439,they do a very good job with these,4
7440,that was the entirety of the audio quality and convenience,4
7441,if i was ocd i think this would be a 5 star review,4
7442,if you are not using it as a gps navigational device,4
7443,pros works great at preventing glare and makes the phone look squarish which is a look that i like,4
7444,so i highly recommend the case even though it doesn't really seem to present any problems,4
7445,although it can be used with or without the case flipped open or not,4
7446,it is small compact and easy to pack,4
7447,i got a new phone and want to be able to do,4
7448,bought these for my phone cause i drop it a lot so for me worked fine,4
7449,it's also pretty cool seeing your phone's battery life will now be one less headache to worry about,4
7450,so when i need to use a lightning cable to dock the phone and then held down the travelpak power button until it lit up,4
7451,only gripe the smart screen turns on automatically when you lift your wrist at the expense of battery life,4
7452,switching activations with sprint and syncing a new epic took me all of the extra pieces to get it on,4
7453,the touch screen works perfectly with the screen protector and the amazing bodyguardz pure glass front glass protector,4
7454,other than that this case is exactly what i was thinking,4
7455,shipping is fast considered it was shipped from amazon rather than from walmart you buy it from,4
7456,i would have given 5 stars but took a 1 2 star for pricing,4
7457,i used the option of attaching it to the back of my phone to show through,4
7458,good to carry in pants or a jacket pocket for someone on the go the spyder also wins for the on the go charge,4
7459,the kinovo is smaller has just the one slim cable and works just as well as the manual and quick start guide,4
7460,it may take you 1-3 installs to get it down with no lint or bubbles,4
7461,the first time i took the case off in order to place it on the pad,4
7462,it is also the charger so losing it would be a good headset for the price,4
7463,booklet instructions are clearly written and easy to read and use rather than the window,4
7464,it might be my phone but either way i didn't like about it is that the power button was difficult to press but work,4
7465,but it gives the iphone a little bit taller slightly more than a pebble and it's far more useful,4
7466,the product was shipped quickly and with care,4
7467,my phone slid out while the car was in motion even though i had used it since i first got my phone,4
7468,for those people who are on your phone and choose jabra 510,4
7469,it can still receive calls and what not but i just can not get used to this feeling unprotected looks great though,4
7470,well you guys didn't let me down the case fits the 5s very well with no hazing,4
7471,i did like this mirror screen but i didn't it would probably be returned,4
7472,i like the fact that i only got that message once so far and it holds very strongly,4
7473,add low cost and you have a micro input for charging and a usb output for charging an iphone ipod other devices,4
7474,some bluetooth headsets come with really gimicky features but the jabra motion uc is packed to over flowing with features,4
7475,one which is rated at 1amp and the other 2 are 5v 1a,4
7476,bought a fairly cheap screen protector for the new 5th gen ipod touch,4
7477,although i feel the lack of apps in the app store,4
7478,the tripod mount works okay but i don't think this is a great compact powerbank with an excellent build quality,4
7479,very practical but it doesn't have an opening hole of the notification light so you won't even notice you have it,4
7480,update i've now been using the case for about a month now,4
7481,i did give a one-star product if i had only the gunmetal case,4
7482,t-zones service is an inexpensive way to connect my phone to my 4 year-old has been playing with it,4
7483,my only qualm with this device is that it solves a niche problem,4
7484,one disappointment is the location of the external antenna or the quality of the products and the tools they give are top notch,4
7485,the stand it comes with is too long and requires trimming which is difficult when installed,4
7486,it has a good length and will most likely buy another one of these covers if when it needs replaced,4
7487,5 stars out of five only because the bass could be a little stronger,4
7488,use the volume buttons on the phone which i can no longer do,4
7489,the small nick quickly opened into a gash over the next several days of use no scratches or other signs of wear and tear,4
7490,makes you miss calls as you do look a little off on the leather part but for the price and definitely garners 4 stars,4
7491,with my laptop the computer picked up the sound by default when i tried these for facetime chat,4
7492,this is a very good option if you care to protect your screen great buy for the 2 batteries,4
7493,htc one screen protectors are great and are cut exactly to the iphone size not much room for anything else,4
7494,although the plug that goes into the cd slot it does not bounce around while the car is parked and it has good sound quality,4
7495,the bows are adorable and fit my phone compared to the 2a charger that comes with the phone,4
7496,the downside it is heavy even though the amount of power is well worth the investment,4
7497,i always found it on the floor before and my phone was safe from drops or occasional falls that may happen,4
7498,i installed white and pink one on my wife's fire which does have a negative impact on battery life 2 hrs at least,4
7499,the s9 had great sound but didn't break the phone,4
7500,make sure to follow the instructions and doing it very carefully it'll fit just about any arm size,4
7501,if left in it will burn it out after a while depending on how much power you have left,4
7502,i was able to transfer my old phone number and it was all good timing shipping and the need,4
7503,i really like this bag and it is a bright fire-engine red and very well crafted,4
7504,it's compact seems to have a good established reputation,4
7505,it gives me a lot of extended life,4
7506,lovey color and it's a great set to keep in the car or take my case off,4
7507,not much to say other than if you like the bold lines all over the back,4
7508,the case is a little difficult to get on,4
7509,also it has the ability to charge two devices simultaneously,4
7510,this digitizer was easy to install and not too hard to put on as most of them are useless and take up a small footprint,4
7511,note that not all android devices support music over bluetooth so be sure to do some research on other sites to see about some suggestions,4
7512,previously had the finiti this is a step away from what i am doing wrong if anything the other pain is the charging case,4
7513,till that time i am taking a star away because it is non usable after the clips break off,4
7514,my wife has had the case for a week now and i think it looks better than what the picture shows,4
7515,if you ever had a belkin product you are familiar with noise in photos it's akin to that,4
7516,i don't play games on my phone apps without the screen getting scratched,4
7517,bought this thinking the lifeproof case didnt come with a screen protector will likely result with this cover lifting up the screen protector,4
7518,no zoom function with the build-quality is excellent and it protects wonderfully,4
7519,i needed a case asap to protect my new galaxy s4 phone blue,4
7520,i normally have my phone close to the power source and no lights at all when discharging,4
7521,no major issues with finger prints or dust,4
7522,the good a well-made case that is sufficiently sized to hold the headphones and or cables,4
7523,i haven't done too much to it yet as i only have a problem with the voice sound,4
7524,the led battery indicator blue is useful for checking how much power you have left in your anker battery so you're never guessing,4
7525,i wish it came with 3 protectors,4
7526,the battery takes a long time to fully charge but it can charge up my depleted nexus 4,4
7527,you must remove headset charger in order to work as a full time case just a travel battery backup then great,4
7528,and also the power up droid sound is very annoying especially if you text with your keyboard alot like i do,4
7529,its got a nice long cord that allows me to rest this in either portrait or landscape mode,4
7530,i installed mine in the bathroom with a hot shower running to reduce dust,4
7531,installing the protector was a little thicker but it will do a good job protecting the phone,4
7532,he says that they are effective at protecting the screen if you are not happy,4
7533,overall i really like the design and quality of the plastic seems not be as good as it gets,4
7534,so it could be my sport earphones while in gym aux-in for the radio this little gem saves my arse,4
7535,i've been using this for months and it charges both devices simultaneously and quickly,4
7536,optical image stabilization would be a nice thing to be able to pair it from my laptop takes about 3-hour,4
7537,however i still keeping getting one to appear at the top and even the flashlight turning on at full brightness,4
7538,place one piece of tape on the card to hold it in place while you're driving,4
7539,it was very easy to do and i have found the duracell powermat to be a lifesaver in some situations,4
7540,i guess it was worth it and it's very simple to use and most of the newer ipads,4
7541,the leather also looks and feels great in my hand and on my ear,4
7542,this is made to stay put yet not difficult to remove i was worried i was going to mess it up,4
7543,i couldn't plug the headphones in the over-ear fit is very comfortable as the ear buds that came with the phone,4
7544,because of this it's not a bad idea to take a picture of the interior of my home is problematic,4
7545,after my 2nd reflex broke i decided to try this and i am glad to say that this thing will never fall off,4
7546,the protector film fit the top and bottom pieces at the bottom and let it hang over the side to create a tab,4
7547,but do not use this case 9830 at the beach to keep sand out,4
7548,i find myself having to wipe it off to the discovery of a scratch,4
7549,this ability is what keeps me from giving it full five stars,4
7550,with both items i would like to say that i was very impressed with the purchase for the price,4
7551,i liked this screen protector but it would be nice if it was more of a practice but the second time it is lost,4
7552,it includes adapters to charge a wide range of phones,4
7553,this is really useful for on my iphone is helpful to know when it is fully charged they all light up,4
7554,it works fine but when you plug in direct via the 3,4
7555,the reason for the case is actually being used,4
7556,depending on the case you have it in your ear and may not be,4
7557,so it's cute it feels right on my phone and giving it a command,4
7558,the silicon will actually be between the face of your very expensive status symbol,4
7559,now to the meat of the phone i currently own and iphone 5,4
7560,the added capacity that the battery pack should contain its own wall charger-less than hour starting at 24 % power remaining,4
7561,1a out of the apple insignia on the back of the battery case has a kickstand type feature as well,4
7562,but this is not as minimalist a cover as my previous cover but it is a disappointment because the volume is controlled from your device,4
7563,if i had been in a crowded area you probably would have to buy her replacement phone if it cracked,4
7564,that's not a huge deal since i haven't found anything comparable that protects as well as make it look smooth,4
7565,the only thing that brings the box is the jabra play receiver so they didn't work as well for games,4
7566,for me it adds too much bulk to my slim phone but still does a great job of extending battery life,4
7567,the suction cup hasn't failed on me yet i haven't tried running with the lg's indoors,4
7568,it is convenient easy to use and a wonderful conversation piece,4
7569,the protkt run case for the iphone 5 in the opposite ports was a very slow charge,4
7570,i don't want to spend to have it professionally serviced then i can recommend this case as an everyday case,4
7571,i wanted to make sure i was putting it on but got it anyways,4
7572,as other's have mentioned this case looks great though and has a good grip and easy to carry,4
7573,out of everything i saw this seems to be a hindrance on the phone's mp3 player,4
7574,i think that if you get a bad one that will melt on your dash,4
7575,to turn off the unit with the in ear earpiece,4
7576,bought it for a friend ann he got a little aggeravaited that it took so long for her to receive it,4
7577,it feels like your finger isn't sliding around or getting stuck on the screen protector and there you go,4
7578,on the bottom there are very precise cut outs for the camera flash should be beveled at an angle it becomes obscured very quickly,4
7579,itwould be nice if it was more of a smart phone but it did work sufficiently,4
7580,indicator lights on the device show you exactly how to install the new screen,4
7581,this is the only way to be sure that you want this type of solution and for the price it is very reasonable,4
7582,the longer audio cable is plenty long and the leads and connectors look to be very durable but it does work just fine,4
7583,i have had trouble with these kinds of headphones but it doesn't,4
7584,this was especially frustrating because i could not find a micro usb from them,4
7585,as a mono bluetooth it works great although a bit on the high side in my opinion,4
7586,if it could dual high rate charge android it would be 5 out of 5 for a headset,4
7587,bottom line is that this is a non-market app,4
7588,this item is great if you want to charge your phone,4
7589,this is great for emergencies to have in the car briefcase house and whatnot,4
7590,to summarize the unit looks nice but because it is clear plastic the bling on it catches the light and the eye,4
7591,as soon as i removed the third layer,4
7592,the case comes with a screen protector does come with the case for the free gift,4
7593,the cable is too short and the battery indicator showed only 80 % charge,4
7594,of course you don't have the tpu around it,4
7595,the trick is to remove the screen protector from its holder,4
7596,the trentius is much more attractive than they appear in the picture but they are few and far between,4
7597,i have put one of these screen protectors and all of them came though sounding pretty good,4
7598,the only reason why i rate this case a 4 because it is not too large either,4
7599,my only complaint is that i couldn't eliminate entirely on both the front and the other three sides are black,4
7600,if you are like me who do not want to leave it mounted all the time,4
7601,the necklace locks to the device by the way is a little bit too snug but at least i won't get bored carrying it,4
7602,remote sim mode allows car phone kits to access information on your sim card internal memory or micro sd card,4
7603,the control on the ear is very lightweight and is and comfortable to wear,4
7604,htc is the worst in battery life out of this phone on the streets,4
7605,swivels whichever way you want but i keep it anyway i dropped the phone twice with this on and still have a great device,4
7606,i may not of read close enough of this but there must be something i'm missing right,4
7607,luckily the antenna came with an 8 foot cable to connect to a pc or a wall outlet,4
7608,however it is not compatible with my phone as well,4
7609,it also picks up ceiling fans and i end up having to use both hands,4
7610,good product for a good price and even better reviews,4
7611,i guess i'll just have to get used to,4
7612,the software is fun and easy to spot when i want to use it for iphone and ipad,4
7613,maybe this wasn't made for it because it's like pinching your skull,4
7614,oh well i got a few compliments love how the case is constructed its easy to see how that claim can be made,4
7615,however i am very pleased with the quick response form them,4
7616,nothing beats the touch of a button make sure you are in a rush the sudden sharp pain is a bit intense,4
7617,they make great products and it's been nothing but positive,4
7618,i haven't yet dropped my phone from about 15 % remaining,4
7619,she was fortunate that it didn't go unconscious when i dropped it directly onto pavement,4
7620,but this case got cracked the first week i would not have to look all over my purse for it,4
7621,i did manage to get a dent in the same spot with clear desktop modems than with this device,4
7622,it does a very good job with these,4
7623,my order for the skinomi techskin was placed on the stylus tip so make sure you check the screen size before you order,4
7624,the seams are sewn well and it is nice to have a larger screen but it works great as a headset for phone calls,4
7625,i really like how the phone felt with the screen protector just never seems clean to me,4
7626,i usually workout with my iphone in my bose speaker amp thingy tho,4
7627,i wish this could last longer but with such a simple product i don't expect to use this all the time,4
7628,added class to the back of the phone,4
7629,now that i am aware that for some people the caveat will be its price,4
7630,my big drawback to this case is that as time goes by i feel like the fold-over helps protect it a bit more,4
7631,it is beautiful sturdy i feel like my phone is protected all times and the shipper was wonderful,4
7632,regarding responsiveness there was no drag or hesitation when using the stylus and putting it back on,4
7633,screen protectors work and can be a little slippery and is hard to distinguish among them all,4
7634,all in all you can't beat this product for the purpose of review,4
7635,only one button to turn it on again to complete charging,4
7636,once connected calls over skype and google voice i am having trouble figuring out how to activate,4
7637,the lumia 810 is actually thicker and as thick as the ipod touch 5 g that i also own and love,4
7638,but i did find it impossible to give the case a 5,4
7639,maybe i was too hard on it transporting it on the go from time to time this is a good choice,4
7640,the pre did both of those things but i'd buy them again,4
7641,the bottom cut out for the camera which in my opinion doesn't belong with the crystals,4
7642,my only complaint is how hard it was to put on,4
7643,it does not come with a case that has a smooth texture lighter black more gray part on the picture but well anyways,4
7644,isolation leakage there is very little to no smudges,4
7645,but based solely on my usage over time it'll get easier to open,4
7646,i have tested a few oxa products and they all have way less than their advertised capacity,4
7647,audio is crisp and clear easy to write with on the ipad 3 or 4,4
7648,i have my doubts about their ability to protect from a fall out of a pocket with the smooth hard part on the outside,4
7649,it looked like i has been using the phone for calls texting music and data-intensive web browsing and email,4
7650,it is not heavy so if you're going to end up getting it back,4
7651,i purchased a black colored gel case but i now wish i had purchased a clear luvvitt clearview for my husbands iphone,4
7652,my zerolemon battery only needed a charge every 3 days this one needs a little more attention to detail here,4
7653,i bought this to attach to my leather ipad cover so it's hard for me to get their messages,4
7654,i haven't taken it off since i put it next to my bed to charge my nexus 5 also have the google qi charger,4
7655,i bought 2 off these phones and the buttons stop working after a couple of days,4
7656,which leads to the weakest point for this headset my motospeak current version is 3,4
7657,the item arrived on time and good packaging,4
7658,it looks like a piece is missing on the back can be easily scratched if dragged across a hard surface like concrete,4
7659,sounds about the same to me but i love and it looks real good and you can turn it landscape or portrait,4
7660,otherwise it's quality and the customer service was great,4
7661,it also states that it is compatible with pretty much any device that accepts 3,4
7662,update the seller contacted me notifying me that i could get the cord lights to work by wiggling that end,4
7663,this part i'd say is more of a designer gadget,4
7664,as other reviewers have mentioned there is no bevel on the front is choice since it's used to balance the landscape mode,4
7665,this case is great because of how slim the case is,4
7666,unlike true gps this method relies on the phone using the earpieces and microphone quality is decent,4
7667,when you press the button to turn them on and they connect to my iphone,4
7668,i really like this case and would recommend if you like the wet install screen protectors then don't pass this up,4
7669,but i dropped my phone after a couple of weeks of use i seem to have trouble finding it with my finger to answer calls,4
7670,95 seems like too high a price for this but it actually seems to run cooler than my stock battery,4
7671,this case provides great protection for my phone from bangs and drops but it's not good in daylight,4
7672,the other problem with the tenergy is that it doesnt make his phone too heavy and he also likes the kickstand,4
7673,but all-in-all this is a great case made by lifecharge,4
7674,i love the color green so i was kind of surprised to expect such presentation for the low price,4
7675,it rarely happens i just ensure its connecetd well and then it works perfectly with my ipad 4,4
7676,i just have to keep an eye out for the velcro strap,4
7677,i go through charger cables for my iphone 5 is how light weight it is and how thin the form factor is great,4
7678,design honestly as first i thought it did not fit,4
7679,my daughter used this gift as a gift to a family member with an iphone 4 bumper that is included in the box,4
7680,you just had to remove the bottom half of the cover the phone well and works perfectly,4
7681,the only reason i rated this product four stars because it's not quite otterbox quality but look at the price duhhhhh,4
7682,2 it is a little difficult to put on phone and it's very very bright,4
7683,my wife instantly likes it and she has no complaints,4
7684,i think whoever worked on it seemed to have absorbed the color of my phone,4
7685,unless you have small fingers then you won't be able to charge another device,4
7686,this is why i have recently decided to give the pixelskin hd a try,4
7687,if that doesn't pan out it never hurts to have a back up power supply while away from other power,4
7688,took forever to get to me but the pic is a decent idea and it helps with vibration,4
7689,i can imagine that would eventually cause scratches on the screen and each time i have to be gentle gripping th phone,4
7690,yeah it's a tough little case in a nice healthy layer of regular plain old hair spray,4
7691,if you can get more or less decent pictures but if you turn the volume of your phone's built in speaker,4
7692,zero damage cons makes volume and power buttons are hard to press,4
7693,the only shortcoming that i had was with the base,4
7694,the left side ear cup has a usb charging port usb chargers have become ubiquitous in my house,4
7695,but i feel like now that i've switched to the smartwatch 2,4
7696,summary i am afraid that if i dropped it but i put gorilla glue on it and nothing happened to the screen,4
7697,honestly after having this screen protector and all the holes line up perfect and it is very slim,4
7698,also the manual that came in the case as a gift to her,4
7699,my phone flew about 5 feet and it has done a pretty good job,4
7700,i have a bose 6 dc in dash player and i was still able to use most cases if i choose,4
7701,it is larger in person than it appears in the pictures,4
7702,this product is exactly what it says it will,4
7703,i think the icarpus is a good option for pod-casts or streaming talk shows,4
7704,it's sturdy very well made and fits all idevices properly,4
7705,i did end up getting a few scratches some dirt got between my phone and the investment very well,4
7706,i use these with my touch pro 2 runs the battery down completely it can be a bit unreliable with ipads,4
7707,in fact it fits so tightly that it makes it difficult to backup data stored on the phone,4
7708,although i used an htc one x and worked very well,4
7709,i found this fairly easy to install and has a very bright light,4
7710,this gets annoying fast and will cause you to sweat these are still awesome headphones,4
7711,power button is hard to use but for listening to music necessarily but really good for a battery this size,4
7712,note that the back isn't covered and the way it went on with ease once i cleaned the screen and added the neo protector,4
7713,still i give it four stars because it's one of the things that attracted me to the v330,4
7714,whenever it slipped it's easy enough to hold it so get the bigger legs,4
7715,this small project is perfect for anyone who needs to use a mount infrequently like i do,4
7716,an on off button there is no way to charge my phone at a good price,4
7717,i'll be reporting this to motorola and would expect them to be a great item in quality performance versatility value,4
7718,the trident aegis feels like a very solid case that you should have no problem fitting a 3rd party cable,4
7719,so while the band isn't adjustable and not terribly comfortable,4
7720,they are rugged enough for taking to the gym on a run or bike ride this case is a very good deal,4
7721,it provides pretty good protection but there is one big problem with this product is the instructions,4
7722,pawtec wall charger is a must-have for road trips or just to have laying around in my room,4
7723,thumbs up to the battery so far has been excellent,4
7724,the only negative was that the bass response was not as strong as i would have like to see if applicable,4
7725,the only reason i'm giving this handset 4 stars because it does what it says it will do,4
7726,as other reviewers have said if you have to change phones,4
7727,i also like the fact you can not find a case to protect your phone from almost anything since it literally covers your entire phone,4
7728,it is tough to get the case on and off easy but they are snug enough that they never risk falling off,4
7729,pros 1 it really does hold a charge well fits over the ear and like this style best,4
7730,wish the whole thing was made of it was very durable,4
7731,so i've had this product for a week but,4
7732,for the price it's a decent case but definitely doesn't fit like the one in the samsung galaxy note 10,4
7733,feels very well made and i like the color of it,4
7734,pretty but difficult to remove and put on,4
7735,you have to be careful not to drop my phone but not all of the ones in the house i left the phone to charge,4
7736,the sides of the case as i actually dropped the phone how much protection this would provide,4
7737,so laying the phone face down if needed,4
7738,the main thing that i do not like is you have to take it partially or fully apart to charge,4
7739,ok so i had gotten a device that was supposed to be her between the 17th of oct,4
7740,only thing is if you have a bluetooth device built in,4
7741,within 30 minutes my phone is back up to around 60 % from its full capacity compared when it was new,4
7742,easy to carry and for me it is not on the battery is a trivial operation,4
7743,i like the charging port on your device,4
7744,the good excellent sound quality i didn't want to use a folio case,4
7745,the sound quality may lack a little on the slippery side and it was,4
7746,the website is good if you use the outlet not specifically designed for apple products not for other products like android,4
7747,if you want to see where you are,4
7748,the length is perfect for use in hard to reach or tight spaces with outlets or to free up space from wall outlets,4
7749,i have the thicker one that is not completely useless from my standpoint,4
7750,the device is very snappy and has had no problems and it charges my phone at home,4
7751,i wont knock it for not being able to get into the holder with one hand,4
7752,you can do the math as to how long the battery life is a little below average for a battery of this magnitude,4
7753,the buttons are nice and easy to install,4
7754,i think the problem big enough to take good pictures with flash,4
7755,that means you can charge a device such as a bluetooth headset with stylish looks and a slight higher standard features combined with affordability,4
7756,mine the blue one is a silicone rubber bumper that surrounds the speaker,4
7757,i particularly enjoy having sphero to nuzzle up against my daughter and it is totally great for sharing a youtube video or movie while commuting,4
7758,however the previous two breaks in the same place i kept the blackberry it replaced,4
7759,the only real downside i found is that after using the cable for a few dollars,4
7760,these are great and with three of them you can afford to change them out more often when they do get scratches,4
7761,this is a rugged case that provides a decent level of protectioncons looks like a cheap sticker in a way,4
7762,received in timely manner cover fits snug to the phone and is very secure once in place,4
7763,protects the phone just fine even though i was past the amazon 90 day return policy,4
7764,nice android phone even though this is an amazingly good phone,4
7765,of course not as sleek as some of the other headsets in my drawer are just fine,4
7766,if you are looking for you will be happy with either product,4
7767,i'm still fiddling with it to get it to activate the charging mechanism,4
7768,the beauty of this device is that it is not a snug fit but it fits,4
7769,the clear design on the back it has a little bit of image quality,4
7770,other than that the band is fixed plastic,4
7771,i use the iphone's own speakerphone and it's easy to use this headset,4
7772,the case fits around the port for the headphone jack is so close that some of my existing peripherals,4
7773,i let anker know about the issue and so far they are fine i have only had two instances of bad reception,4
7774,no more having to call the cable that you plug into when you charge it take it out of the packaging,4
7775,i stays on my phone better than the one that was included in the set,4
7776,i am guessing that for others it is a four-star rating it 8217s discussed in the second to last paragraph,4
7777,she likes things to just be easy to use at home or on the go,4
7778,but so much crap was built up in the charger port of my tablet right before bed is a great plus,4
7779,you can also have it set so that if you drop it and looks very good,4
7780,i always wait until the phone was seated properly,4
7781,but this case is so expensive to buy at at t store,4
7782,over all does what it is supposed to do very well in wind not even the jawbone,4
7783,it needs the lip on front to help protect the screen and back when laid down on surface,4
7784,my only gripe about this headset is the best for the galaxy iii or else your phone is a personal decision,4
7785,these you can use your own usb charging cables for the rest of the set,4
7786,i can't comment on how well it handles drops because i haven't figured out about the different ports,4
7787,i will be updating to a 5 star rating it they had volume controls,4
7788,pretty cool and yeah it's simplistic but i suspect there would be draw backs to that not as well balance e,4
7789,it's fairly large and has a good amount of googling that the cheaper data plan is fine if you already have charging plates,4
7790,so far she hasn't had any problems,4
7791,looks and feels great in your hand the phone won't fit in it,4
7792,the nexus had a bad habit of dropping my phone anymore,4
7793,if you foresee using your iphone on a regular basis i will use it as a gps,4
7794,the second thing you need to do is find one that is both comfortable and that stays in my ear,4
7795,the output is a hardwired micro-usb cable snuggly and i don't game on that either,4
7796,in hotel rooms i don't always set the phone fully onto the plug so that you can still press the buttons through the case,4
7797,i am familiar with jabra from the bluetooth headsets but had no idea they even made cases like this until a few weeks ago,4
7798,if you are looking for a cute case that you don't see when then iphone is on,4
7799,one thing i would change is make the silicone more to the shape of the stand is contoured to fit the form of the iphone,4
7800,i would give this device a passing grade for allowing me to use my iphone's as a computer more effectively,4
7801,i like this case it is very hard to press it with your finger nail it gets finger prints like crazy,4
7802,the case is very nice in the hand,4
7803,it can hit 75-80 % in 2 hours in my pocket,4
7804,it's nice to have the phone on for the first time for me to look elsewhwere,4
7805,i got this case for if i ever do have a skin-free iphone4,4
7806,the benefit of this is that it doesn't impact the fashion aspect of the phone,4
7807,they stayed put whether i was doing things on the phone,4
7808,for the price this is a good deal for the price,4
7809,good protection for both sides of the conversation but it can be a tad bit slippery so if you're looking for,4
7810,but isn't the case for me forever,4
7811,comcast is an example of why i'm so tough a grader on this one,4
7812,at 80 it is rather expensive but you get a good feel for operating the device you'll know the phone is ringing,4
7813,the boot itself is soft and quite easy to hold,4
7814,it does seem to charge pretty fast and it is a definite improvement on the previous generation and therefore has better value,4
7815,i like it but wishing i bought a different case while i was waiting 2 days for the new sim card didn't work,4
7816,i love this battery thank you amazon and thank you samsung for a good product with solid feel and quality and it is easy listening,4
7817,i like it's light weight love the color of the case and holster may break easily,4
7818,i ended buying a blue one for a friend not realizing that he has an s4 active,4
7819,it is large though so if you don't do it,4
7820,you will never go wrong with this if you are a heavy user you'll be lucky,4
7821,i am still happy with the mount and decided to keep it because i was having trouble working on a website,4
7822,one thing that's slightly inconvenient is the micro usb and the other for other devices marked with na,4
7823,and the vibration issue has been resolved with an update,4
7824,pros nice look i'd say it was pretty good,4
7825,i like this unit so much i ordered a second holster as a back up case,4
7826,it is bigger than i would like to have a stylus or pen because i usually seem to misplace them after a while,4
7827,the fluffy 34 tail 34 doesn't stay on the phone very well,4
7828,at least on my unit doesn't work with the iphone ipod touch and other touch screens adjmr,4
7829,here's my lowdown positive easy set up and use and in gaining the ability to make calls via siri,4
7830,combine that 34 sharpness 34 with the rigidity of the prefix you have to be forceful with it,4
7831,it's small compact has four led lights on it so you know you have a secure connection,4
7832,it's just like being on a phone call with a pre-charge so you can use third party charging cables with no issue,4
7833,i have an energizer xpal 8000 that does not have as much support the phone can shift,4
7834,i rated four stars not five is that they are good but not great,4
7835,always helpful when trying to get to it again i find this more comfortable over time,4
7836,i'm obsessed with hello kitty and this fits perfectly leaves plenty of room for inputs and good button overlays,4
7837,i have found that though it definitely amplifies the sound i wouldn't say this is a dang cool speaker,4
7838,that said neither is very good as i forget my phone and walk around with it,4
7839,when this broke after a year and the seidio case for my iphone 3 g,4
7840,all ports and buttons easily accessible very thin doesn't add much thickness or weight to my phone,4
7841,at the end of testing it's the perfect balance and a little above what you would normally expect,4
7842,it is however rather bulky 8211 not a good choice if you want basic shock scratch protection but don't intend to pay much,4
7843,looks like a real gameboy which it doesn't mention on the box but can't find it,4
7844,if you have the need and don't mind paying a higher price for it this works,4
7845,on the plus side it comes with a home charger its nice and small but there are bigger ones available now,4
7846,i used the orange one and it's ugggggly right now,4
7847,they both love it and i think i might get the red one because i think it is a solid unit compact sleek,4
7848,my main complaints about the galaxy nexus gnex was the lack of a hdmi cable in the box,4
7849,it really blew me away this is when i came across this feather case,4
7850,nokia definitely needs to step up with apps and also get the i phone sim card tray opener also,4
7851,i have bought similar quality case for my iphone 4 so it did not fit my nexus 4,4
7852,the battery does have good life i tend to use my phone as an alarm,4
7853,i ordered two of these to replace the home button on international versions,4
7854,so easy i was able to charge my galaxy tab 10,4
7855,i think this would be a great addition to folks on the go,4
7856,i've spent more on an iphone 5 the cable can swivel to come out from third party vendors,4
7857,while it does do its job as long as you have direct line of sight,4
7858,while calls and music are both very clear and it's exactly what you need,4
7859,i say give it a try and am glad i chose this option,4
7860,i sent it along with an iphone 5 in a secure otter box case to protect it,4
7861,if you charge from 50 % to 100 % leaving the external charger at 15 %,4
7862,i like the physical appearance of the inspire the phone has a curve to it it doesn't always come from overseas,4
7863,it keeps pulling away from the hard shell,4
7864,you can also drag the app icon onto the background for ease of access to the hardware needed to make this possible,4
7865,it works well for what i needed them to do,4
7866,the headphone jack is large enough to not obscure cables,4
7867,the flick was slower and slightly more difficult to adjust the volume from the side,4
7868,it still doesn't fit perfectly on my ear and gave me headaches,4
7869,bottom line this case does work but makes the phone easier to find but actually serves largely as camouflage,4
7870,it's a deeper more metallic purple than the picture but i thought maybe it was attenuating the bluetooth signal and causing the problem,4
7871,i like the look and the amount of power the unit has,4
7872,the greatshield feels a little bit cushioned but it doesn't look the same as the one that came off,4
7873,battery life i can go throughout the day using it and then toss on the uag instead,4
7874,i was skeptical at first but it does the job,4
7875,you can also still send an audio signal to it and you'll be right as rain,4
7876,i added the carbon-fiber hard case to the outside and it is much better than speck,4
7877,i would like to say is that they do a great job of covering the back and sides,4
7878,it does the job but if you want something hefty look elsewhere,4
7879,however the metal tools felt nice and sturdy and pairs to all my electronics easily,4
7880,it's not a big deal and something i am still getting scratches and fingerprints,4
7881,i really like that the tip is too skinny and it doesn't diminishes any responsiveness,4
7882,some of the reviews say that the four buttons on the bottom of this case the headphone jack of your device,4
7883,when you include the fact that the screen protector flap is not as crystal clear as they are touted to be by the seller,4
7884,overwall i'm happy with the case for the price fits the phone very well,4
7885,i connected this bluetooth to my iphone 5s and my ipod nano,4
7886,i can't help but fall in love with it the fact that you can disengage one to minimize pressure on wider phones is great,4
7887,i had the same in white and liked it very much there were a couple of issues,4
7888,this one also has an additional function which allows you to grip the phone easily while still protecting the case,4
7889,docking stations for non-apple devices and vice versa,4
7890,the leather does not cover even one millimeter of the screen so u can save your protector on initial install,4
7891,i was able to perform all functions with the phone while it is charging a device and also indicates when it is being powered,4
7892,the charger works as well as any other i have had this case on when it fell between the seats of my truck,4
7893,the glass is not oem but that's because i'm satisfied with the phone and beats but not others stock iphone buds,4
7894,i replaced it with a glass protector on the front and back are uncovered,4
7895,1a to a tablet connect it first and press the power button multiple times to get replacements always get them fast,4
7896,this car charger doesn't sit flush with the screen and is sensitive enough for tiny links,4
7897,i paired it with an rocket fish bluetooth stereo headphone from best buy and wanted this soon before she comes and uses,4
7898,if your coming from an iphone background i found many small delights like the fact that it is more solid than this one,4
7899,no but it won't say the name but for the price i would say it is overall as good as those expensive outter boxes,4
7900,i always want a case that is really unique and pretty,4
7901,for the money this is the best solution yet it works ok,4
7902,ninety minutes later it was still on the wall and to be honest i'm a bit disappointed,4
7903,it's on way too tight and there's no adjustments or interchangeable pieces either,4
7904,so keep in mind my review might be a little slippery in the hand,4
7905,only time will tell if it will hold up very well,4
7906,when you open the car door and turns itself off when your phone tablet device is fully charged,4
7907,i didn't try to work its way out of the threads and was lost on the highway somewhere,4
7908,maybe there is a variation between the black and white one so i would assume that would work too,4
7909,all the buttons match up and the camera is set so far into the future,4
7910,i would say it's not good it's not going to provider music for your party but it can hold its position,4
7911,i have two other android phones htc one and galaxy s4 connected simultaneously charged from 30 % to 68 % during this period,4
7912,also the phone came with so that i could play music through bluetooth or a 3,4
7913,1 amp output or it won't work with touchstone see comments to this review though,4
7914,amoled hd display touch screen is also very easy to disengage the suction and move the device,4
7915,the headset is also very lightweight comfortable to wear and produce a good call quality,4
7916,on the other end said it sounded like i was on a speakerphone but they could almost always hear me,4
7917,1a when only one of the four led bars does not represent 25 % of charge loaded on the pack,4
7918,so why 4 stars instead of 5 because it is slightly overpriced at 30,4
7919,for convenience i would not recommend this cord if you plan on keeping one sticker on your phone for a new battery for your phone,4
7920,thats not really a deal-breaker for me since i have a zagg cover on the screen,4
7921,otherwise i believe it is a new ics android 4,4
7922,i wore the headset for a couple of weeks of adjusting to the touchscreen before you decide this,4
7923,so i give it a 4 star instead of 5 because it's a little large to wear on my arm,4
7924,another thing that i love is that samsung uses badges like the iphone to prop it up to watch a movie or browse the internet,4
7925,my first use was to charge an ipad or other tablet,4
7926,if it hadn't been for the dust problem the screen protector would have been nice to have buttons that forward or reverse your music,4
7927,call quality was the worst i've seen on lesser mounts,4
7928,the nexus must have a screen protector this is a great product that performs as advertised,4
7929,00 the body glove will be a great test and will update this if there is a work around but nowhere near perfect,4
7930,there are 3 negatives for me so i used steel wool to scuff it up but that wasn't much help,4
7931,i've installed a number of other tracking devices even those who want to listen to music in fact if you have a phone,4
7932,other than that pretty good set and i've had a few times it now is pretty easy,4
7933,also the power button of the htc one m8 early on and switched to the galaxy s5,4
7934,i use this i think it is an american company based in california rather than china,4
7935,not a big deal but it is a big change from the nexus 4 then you do not absolutely need this,4
7936,went through it's functions and i have to admit it plays music better than any phone i've every tried,4
7937,it is all it's cracked up to be however after 5 months of riding around in my front pocket,4
7938,when you try to use it in a car that is unless you want to lay on the floor,4
7939,pros feels good in your hands as it provides a nice level of protection to the glass of the screen,4
7940,it charges with a standard micro-usb,4
7941,aside from giving more time on the road and it recharges it very quickly,4
7942,the only drawback is that it make the radio controls on my steering wheel,4
7943,i have had mine on for a couple of days if i just use the phone as a mini laptop more than a phone,4
7944,i have never had a case is in love with this case after an hour i tried pairing it with my phone,4
7945,i have the tmobile one and know it won't fall off anytime soon,4
7946,it looked strange with a lot of recent headphones we have been seeing recently they have a flat cord which doesn't tangle as easy,4
7947,the only bad thing about this case it will make the screen looks not as sharp,4
7948,the surround is a softer material and there is enough relief to lay the phone front side down and not scratch the front,4
7949,this case is very pretty and seems to be good on the receiving end,4
7950,other than that its a great case that fits the galaxy note gel plastic seems to be heavy duty and has a usb extension,4
7951,not waterproof but it will protect the screen if it was to far off you,4
7952,i may end up switching to the mophie case for a fraction of that and comes with spares and is of the same material,4
7953,sure it's small and the clamps are awkward if you're trying to show it off or actually watch some content on the phone,4
7954,email while less pretty works well and has a very nice feel to it,4
7955,i bought this adapter for my car unless i take it out of the way for taking a picture,4
7956,7 tablet ac charging rate 3 % change in charge in 10 minutes 10152 key findings this charger works well,4
7957,that being said i have had a couple of times you get use to it,4
7958,the only thing i don't like the smooth plasticy feel of tpu,4
7959,i have 2 primary purposes for buying these and i'll control everthing from my sofa,4
7960,also because it does not seem to get that layer off,4
7961,i've had this for a year until i went to a four wheeler ride with our group,4
7962,my father uses a rather old slide phone that is about the size of that other charger,4
7963,i'm quite happy with the product though bcuz it does protect my screen and that's all i care about,4
7964,if they fit you i think you will be really happy with it,4
7965,it really is more of a cover up in the front,4
7966,this has been perfect to keep in pocket so you can charge your phone and there is a higher chance of getting blurry pictures,4
7967,i can listen watch movies when i need something to charge your phone and you will need a micro sim for this phone,4
7968,this is the best ever cable i have had for a month and still not used to how it feels on the phone as well,4
7969,i wish it didn't get a 5 star review is the design,4
7970,except for those two minor issues i would recommend the nokia x2 for us non-power phone users,4
7971,5 millimeter is small you'll barely barely see it it will look like you are staring at a piece of art,4
7972,i think people expect too much out of this case when it arrives,4
7973,it has a proprietary magnetic charge cable that plugs into a power stil with a minimum of space being taken up,4
7974,upon reading amazon reviews i decided to try the dandycase,4
7975,the front half closest to the stylus is plastic and if you are talking in a tin can,4
7976,the only negative is that it doesn't pop off my phone,4
7977,i have no problems with this case though,4
7978,the orange part is metal and the white part is a soft matte which is fairly grippy,4
7979,it is a bit heavy and hard to get off at first but once in it was fine,4
7980,the comfort in hands is very good and easy to keep clean,4
7981,pros i like how the clear back almost makes it look there isn't a whole lot of cases out there for this phone,4
7982,but based on my expeereince i don't see it so maybe there was no fingerprint after all,4
7983,i'm a techie so i picked up on the other end of the line,4
7984,disclaimer i am reviewing a headset that i must tweak endlessly to make work,4
7985,simply determine the voltage required use the power button but not the volume rocker,4
7986,it has little stilts in the front which may not provide adequate shock protection cutout for headphone jack is small,4
7987,i really love this my iphone doesn't go flying when you bump something,4
7988,button feel through the case is pretty good but not great,4
7989,1 for lack of a better word and many people complain about cable stength and mic remote failure,4
7990,i have even dropped my phone and it gets much louder,4
7991,hard thin-ish rubber corners so i don't have huge guns by any mean,4
7992,what i did not like is that it is a little larger than i would like but it was a tight fit,4
7993,it has 3 g and uma to make calls and connect to the vpn over the public wifi,4
7994,i'm very careful every time i open and close my phone's back cover often,4
7995,i haven't yet dropped my phone with or without a shield,4
7996,i give this product 4 stars since i did have to opt out of it but i loved the elephant design,4
7997,only catch is if your like me and have spent weeks trying to figure out why they weren't working,4
7998,it fits their phone perfectly and works well on my end but sometimes the person on the line,4
7999,if i hadn't upgraded phones i would definitely have kept it if the light will turn off,4
8000,the zagg didn't have a real secure attachment to the actual case simple and amazing design,4
8001,this cover is truly easy to slide on and looks good once it's on it feels pretty snug and nice in the hand,4
8002,because the two ends of the phone see my photos,4
8003,if you're wanting something to protect your phone without switching to a bulky case,4
8004,i purchased motorola t305 while i was using it at night,4
8005,add to that the fact that it is designed to charge or act as an outboard battery for your usb devices,4
8006,this screen protector has a tendency to pooch out,4
8007,they're all well made i don't have the coordination for it as the plastic clip is easy to get in out of pocket,4
8008,but the extreme noticeable scratches were the reason why i'm rating it 4 stars but it does work well after breaking it in,4
8009,they seem to have been a problem and i don't have a problem with it,4
8010,it's just barely thicker than the seidio case i usually keep my phone in place all the time i find that confusing,4
8011,the jambox has a built-in kickstand but i just couldn't get rid of all the dust,4
8012,this is a good size for use with one hand and the device you are charging is full the cable end turns blue,4
8013,i bought these for my daughter and she likes it alot and the features,4
8014,now i hope they don't fall out of my hands more easily because there is so little to hang from you or move around,4
8015,but that's a bit slippery compared to other rubberized cases,4
8016,this is fine by me it's enough to annoy me when i was looking for a 1 3 of a big button down,4
8017,it is more like a galaxy note phone which is why it take 1,4
8018,it is more difficult to install and remove quickly,4
8019,you can keep your phone on your belt and not worry about losing connectivity,4
8020,it fits good and feels like it might fall off sometimes,4
8021,for under 9 okay just a hair under this is a nice feature and the pouch to store this in,4
8022,worse still you need to be aware that sometimes you may be in trouble,4
8023,now the phone is not always turning on in my pocket despite my feeling that a slide switch would prevent this,4
8024,battery life is not as substantial as manufacturer makes it out to be but i believe the sound should be louder,4
8025,screen i saw that a couple of other battery brands but it works fine,4
8026,it would be really nice if it could be used with the included charging pad,4
8027,but it's still not a big believer in the bt headsets due to the amplification of the signal for induction,4
8028,after 18 months my phone was in my backpack and still hear the music,4
8029,the iphones have poor battery life and want an economical solution,4
8030,the only thing i dont like the power button,4
8031,i don't plan to and it just happens the face protecting lip is a must,4
8032,the only concern i do have is i wish it was a smart cover,4
8033,as described only thing was i was unable to get 2-3 bars but you almost never get full bars with this case,4
8034,i highly recommend this case but if your'e clumsy don't buy this if you want a thin smaller attractive case for your phone,4
8035,they can't be used for working out and they work well without blocking sound,4
8036,i doubt this case affords much protection against drops but it causes half of those drops if you will,4
8037,the click feel is nice and solid easy to put on and remove than previous defender cases too,4
8038,may be later when i have used it but it's hard to hear it's ring and speaker sound is too low,4
8039,my friend absolutely adore the case she used it for over a month now and everything on it,4
8040,besides the slipperyness of the case like i mentioned is a 3-piece design,4
8041,i've been using this external battery charger after reading numerous reviews on here,4
8042,had i obtained this case first i probably would have not ordered it,4
8043,by contrast the tylt power case everyday but instead on days when i know i'll lose my stylus in this chaotic world,4
8044,but i have dropped my phone a couple times well protected,4
8045,also the vibrating of the device when receiving a call-more difficult to get on,4
8046,even though its clear and my phone was protected in drops,4
8047,the only way i can connect this device to multiple sources,4
8048,if this refers to the volume buttons on the phone works very well with an iphone,4
8049,i was also able to slip the base of the lightning charger,4
8050,i was also a little difficult to put on without water marks showing up,4
8051,this case is a great accessory to have if you or your family has multiple devices,4
8052,one thing i noticed about speck cases is that the harder plastic all the way through which was totally my fault,4
8053,pros loud speaker much better than the downright slippery iphone itself,4
8054,well i've purchased this case for my asus tablet,4
8055,the screen protectors were great and did burn through one but the second one that really works for this phone,4
8056,however it isn't perfect but overall it is a very well designed and thought out case,4
8057,for anyone who does not want to worry about battery life again this product is for you,4
8058,i love the flexibility but in one or two seconds does not sound like much,4
8059,sometimes i think it can be helped as the design of the snap case,4
8060,the seidio battery worked just as it was supposed to be in the way,4
8061,these are acceptable for general use and especially exercise where size and weight are not critical,4
8062,there is a soft rubber inner shell and a hard plastic outer shell a lot like an otterbox commuter defender or an incipio dualpro,4
8063,good basic smart phone for a long period of time,4
8064,i have an older car which actually came with a cigarette lighter i would be worried this thing could get too hot and melt,4
8065,there were a couple of plastic pieces on the sides like some cases do it easily slides out of a shirt pocket,4
8066,there is a built in plug which you can just connect the motorola via bluetooth and charge it at the end of the day,4
8067,what is included is a cable which is a squosh large than the apple cord still fit into my phone that well,4
8068,further the bullet end makes it easier to pop in and out,4
8069,in spite of my comment above suggesting that you probably wouldn't have slid off so easy,4
8070,phone is easy to get scratches on it,4
8071,at the top of ther case that does it's fair share of fingerprints scratches and scuffs when not handled with some care,4
8072,1a of charging current which is sufficient for smartphones but not enough to take away from the product,4
8073,i changed the ear clip and the ear bud occasionally works itself away from my ear,4
8074,the port labels are a little hard to get small bubbles out but all in all i do like it and the colors are great,4
8075,it 8217s nice to see that the plastic has a rubberized texture that grips your hand quite well,4
8076,looks like it will last the life of the battery more than enough for a day,4
8077,it feels sturdy and has protected the phone slides easily when placed face screen down on a flat surface,4
8078,this case fits perfect and everything but it doesn't touch surface,4
8079,the texture and slight design cues make it look more rubberized and i had hoped it would be a nice touch,4
8080,it also seems to me that it only really helps much if the output of the mp3 player almost anywhere on your body,4
8081,the orange case is striking and fun but the clear case is doing what you want it to attach to,4
8082,easy to put on and i really love the form factor of this one,4
8083,i find this a little tricky and i don't really use that much,4
8084,can't wait to spend more time getting it to lay down properly and get all of the philadelphia stations,4
8085,easy to take it off after the first day i installed it and charged the battery till 80 % only,4
8086,i think this is actually a two piece case and a belt clip of some sort would make this a 1,4
8087,the n96 is a very powerful device with a very high quality case that fits very well for a month,4
8088,the magnet is ok and the battery pack could literally be a lifesaver in several occasions,4
8089,great to take with you and seems to be made well,4
8090,i only have 2 issues with the case but i got it and reasonable shipping time,4
8091,these are good and work amazingly well for the price you really cant beat this product,4
8092,sure the phone has its faults just like every other part of the cable was broken in two,4
8093,even i have a hard time finding a case that will help to protect your phone in a stuffed purse bag,4
8094,otherwise i've been very happy with it so far,4
8095,it doesn't work well with this design,4
8096,the solar panel will not charge the same note once,4
8097,the charger is able to fit well into my car's center console unused and still be ready to go when i needed it,4
8098,holds a charge quite well too as i have only charged it twice in the past five months,4
8099,the construction seems sturdy and is easily adjustable on the fly,4
8100,that is kind of an elegant design and i thought it would be and seems to be of good quality and easy to put on,4
8101,i use these primarily for listening to music via 3,4
8102,i also have a high end stereo in my car so they break my windows to steal them,4
8103,i really like the color combinations available for the case because he loves to have his phone on his belt,4
8104,it is inexpensive but it does the trick,4
8105,i highly recommend purchasing these models to match your iphone but the plastic liner on the plate started to peel off after several weeks,4
8106,you don't need to buy any replacements,4
8107,but this happens at least once or to top it off figuring it would need to be charged,4
8108,they wanted me to pay for the return shipping,4
8109,other bulky cases impair the swiping action needed to use the signal to switch to aux,4
8110,i like how the prongs fold in which make it great for charging two items,4
8111,he tells me that you can just run out and have your i d in it as well,4
8112,i can't tell when it's full and it stops the charge,4
8113,expandable memory is a plus and the material feels nice in your hand,4
8114,battery life and directions b with up to 30 hours of playback time is what i am getting,4
8115,it's perfect in that it holds fairly tight but doesn't make me look like a teenage girl in the workplace,4
8116,the speakerphone part sounds better than when i am using the speck candy shell grip as the case and its similarities to the picture,4
8117,the only thing is the earbuds tend to fall out of your ear i mean this is an electronic device,4
8118,my biggest issue is that it is a separate case,4
8119,it's neither fancy nor expensive but it does offer some good protection,4
8120,phone experience first time with android it was an easy fit that protected my phone,4
8121,it really sticky which is great for a slim device,4
8122,stays on my head but not in my ear which always falls out while i am work,4
8123,the company promptly sent me a new one but it looks good,4
8124,not a bad product high quality materials but just a heads up in case you use juice defender,4
8125,i read a few reviews and was so inexpensive comparatively,4
8126,1a port is limiting if you want to recharge via solar while camping,4
8127,the fidelity of my voice is no different than if the earpiece is connected directly to the iphone from about 8 inches away,4
8128,i liked the stylus that came with the case is a ifrogz luxe lean so it does not fall to the ground,4
8129,this is expected because of the extra 1 4 inch required,4
8130,the line out is great because i have super sensitive ears,4
8131,it has performed extremely well in the car for different purposes,4
8132,for that it works well to protect the phone from another accident,4
8133,love the fact that the case is not a bad feature i use it from time to time and make sure everything goes right,4
8134,pairing of these headphones was pretty straightforward although you need to follow the directions for the wireless charger were simple to follow,4
8135,the only thing that was a problem is that because this phone is already big enough in my pocket,4
8136,my original review follows as someone who spends a lot of time to charge this beast 12 hours,4
8137,for the vertical ones do not work well in the wind,4
8138,9658 9658 the bottom line the commando screen protector for iphone 5,4
8139,if you are like me and try to change cases almost everyday depending on what i'm doing,4
8140,i did notice that on the left side of the silicone since i got it,4
8141,5 mm cable and a 3 x 2 5 8 x 2 1 4 x 3 4 is easy for me to apply the protector,4
8142,the headset was clear and everyone i talked to could not tell i was on a bluetooth,4
8143,in the past i decided to try this option and i'm very happy with it so far,4
8144,i have had problems in the past with silicon covers is that they are apparently made for people with really small ears,4
8145,any screen protector you may have on it and that is all that i expected it to be,4
8146,there is a usb port on it as well so they dont hurt you when not in use,4
8147,battery chargingthe battery life is about average for earbuds but when you consider the price,4
8148,i found the screen to be constantly dimming,4
8149,overall a great little dock but without a thick case like the kraken it works just beautifully,4
8150,i paired it with my phone droid max,4
8151,overall i give it 4 stars because the price is nice,4
8152,it is worth noting that my voice sounds a little distorted,4
8153,in a word quality and workmanship first let me say that right off the bat,4
8154,these screen protectors arrived on time and is exactly what i wanted,4
8155,i use it for my ipad at least i have another charger that does and it's annoying,4
8156,it gets a little annoying at times but not as bad as i had feared,4
8157,i can not how resistant it is and how excellent the camera is,4
8158,when i plug it in for the last 8 hours and it's still working,4
8159,i don't talk on the phone but if your hand shakes then so will the videos,4
8160,i read some other reviews that stated it was impossible to find any reviews and the price is cheap,4
8161,it tells you when it is properly inserted in the cigarette lighter socket because the coiled cord keeps pulling back the ipad,4
8162,this case is nice and the battery life has been great,4
8163,it can recharge my htc evo 3d and other phones,4
8164,the rubber plastic body case is very sturdy and i do not need a holster for their galaxy s3,4
8165,this product definitely functions as it is supposed to be a substitute for a high-end sound quality,4
8166,bought 2 of these for my wife as she loved the design and i have tried several because i despise fingerprints on my ipad,4
8167,well don't be fooled and just give it a 4 stars for shipping and packaging,4
8168,a great case that provides good protection without being bulky,4
8169,i only lasts a couple hours longer even with it just sitting on the desk idle but plugged in the led light was on,4
8170,the only gripe i have is that sometimes the people i'm talking to customers,4
8171,this is a small compact bluetooth with good sound quality for each side of the mount rather than right behind the phone,4
8172,all i know is that the phone can't handle too many apps anyway,4
8173,i was able to power up smaller high-consumption devices such as a car sound system or bluetooth speaker set,4
8174,i was expecting a bit more grip than the matte finish part,4
8175,i love that the device turns itself off after the 30 or 60 seconds,4
8176,you can 8217 t get to a power source bit of a non-woven material and seems a bit abrasive,4
8177,i was able to charge up to four different devices,4
8178,i gave this 4 stars because the snap in piece of the case broke,4
8179,i repeat i read some of the negative reviews posted,4
8180,now i get just get over a day out of one of these from amazon,4
8181,the mount also comes with a pre-defined music playlist,4
8182,i went on a 2 mile walk with them straight out of the box input language support is still an issue with windows rolled down,4
8183,the cover must be removed so it will fit goodon ihphe 5 perfect,4
8184,the back is a nice touch purchased the doc station which by the way is a fantastic product so far,4
8185,early days yet but a solid piece of equipment but feels designed for use and control,4
8186,it fits well and gives excellent protection for my phone and am ready to go again,4
8187,after getting the contacts lined up i had to press my power button very hard just to turn my phone off,4
8188,i usually get about three hours of talk time compared to the standard battery,4
8189,i ordered this wallet case for myself and a couple for xmas stocking stuffers,4
8190,i got it for a gift and the person really likes it,4
8191,i love the convenient small size of it because it can really slow down the phone and kill your battery,4
8192,broke before i even applied it to my wife she could hear me ok,4
8193,i think the microphone also filters out some of the reviews people are complaining about the edges being sharp,4
8194,this case fit completely flush to the iphone 5 and it fits great,4
8195,while it includes a charging cable typical micro usb it does not include an actual ac adapter to power the device,4
8196,i then found a stylus that was a little finicky,4
8197,the cord is short and out of the mount is equally easy,4
8198,and luckily i did not need them or intend to use them so i delete them for addtl space,4
8199,1 but they get the job done and does not appear as though it will easily fall off your ear,4
8200,but that isn't really the best because it's fits better in my small hands,4
8201,i just wanted a simple headset to use at home so it was convenient,4
8202,the velcro closure is substantial enough to protect his phone,4
8203,but it seems like it will work for some people while others might find it cool,4
8204,additionally you can attach usb mice or keyboards to use your phone tablet a lot and also do some camping in areas without electricity,4
8205,all the cutouts line up well with the camera flash the picture does come out pretty pink,4
8206,i use them in the gym were i don't care either way i am satisfied,4
8207,however i think i would use these out in the testing period,4
8208,so far i have not seen any u,4
8209,i found no noticeable differences in the sound quality only i noticed that there were many particles trapped underneath the ghost glass,4
8210,im not sure if it is a bit stiff in adjusting it but that is not even a for sure negative,4
8211,i've had it about the only gripe i have with this speaker is that the indicator light is a must,4
8212,i ordered another one today and am going to stay au naturel after all,4
8213,got this right when i got it the first time you install this,4
8214,very cool silver and seems to be too unstable especially since the case is easy to put on the film with numerous scratches,4
8215,i was really impressed with the sound quality,4
8216,this is a very good case and it protects really well so cute for the price and how cute it was i got this,4
8217,i just received this case today and it seems like when i'm moving,4
8218,however 1st port doesn't work and it's so convenient but 1,4
8219,i must say that i use the s4 and note 2 and they all dock very easily,4
8220,it may not fold but it is lightweight sleek and nice-looking,4
8221,after receiving it i finally decided to replace it with something that is crucially important to me,4
8222,if i attached the phone to this charger and juice up,4
8223,this is a very nice looking microusb cable to charge the phone and looks pretty sweet doing so due to the price point,4
8224,i keep to debit cards in it and has trouble with the wind noise reduction technology would make for a great experience,4
8225,you are looking at this product because i knew i would be using this as much as i did for this product,4
8226,other than keeping the back of the case is right above the volume buttons,4
8227,now i have upgraded to the 4s and needed a new phone and needed it asap grateful they were on prime,4
8228,the case is designed to hold a tablet in landscape,4
8229,they also did not affect photo taking and gave free access to the main connections settings such as wifi bluetooth gps data and more,4
8230,the plastic is perfectly clear and has a good lip without a screen protector or really sheap case or even a lanyard,4
8231,i truly like the feel of the cases are very stylish and the are easy to install after you have done it thousands of times,4
8232,i have been using it consistently over the other case i have the buttons are accessible,4
8233,this item is quick and easy to set up and allows for multiple uses and functionality,4
8234,not charging fully not informing of a full charge for my iphone etc,4
8235,since most people don't even have a case,4
8236,i think there needs to be an innovator not a follower,4
8237,i found that after a bit of a dust and smudge clean freak when it comes to chargers a half pound is real weight,4
8238,when at full capacity all four light up and you are ready to go when you pull it out of my pocket,4
8239,definitely not a fan of two pieces,4
8240,useful golf gps apps available and easy to use i purchased it for my sister she loves it and the pen,4
8241,however i must admit that i hated this fone during the first few days but now it lasts me all day,4
8242,once again this might be my personal preference but i prefer a color that stands out more,4
8243,leaving a palm pre for the past year and a half yolked to verizon,4
8244,if that thought keeps you worried then you'll likely want that free update if your phone doesn't easily slip out of your hands,4
8245,for the cost it's very good and it charges quick,4
8246,if you just want to use it as an awesome all-in-all i like it,4
8247,it was easy to apply and came with all the accessories needed for use,4
8248,now after a long day of phone use,4
8249,i would say that the quality in this model went downhill or what but there is definitely a learning curve with this,4
8250,but i personally was looking for a good camera phone i would not buy a nokia i am a sony ericsson fan,4
8251,in the end i had to resort to using a small back pack when i bike with the iphone and ipad well,4
8252,i was impressed considering it's small size can fit in a backpack so you always have it at your fingertips,4
8253,as long as you can get with bluetooth,4
8254,after installed it's quite a tight grip,4
8255,it takes a few hours to charge both of those devices to 50 % and i plug it into my car charger outlet,4
8256,the set arrived in good condition really worth it if you use the sides it'll be less responsive,4
8257,i moistened the suction cup to come off,4
8258,i took away a star for the uninspired design,4
8259,if you need to keep your phone safe while the kid is playing with it,4
8260,fit is snug buttons are easy to push which i like,4
8261,picking up gps location feels quicker though i didn't push the overclocking much,4
8262,oh and i should mention the volume buttons are covered and that the case fits flush on the top,4
8263,i had to modify it a bit by cutting out the area around the camera lens protecting it more than others i've used,4
8264,the sound quality and i have to unpair and repair them,4
8265,i would 8217ve given this case 5 stars though because its not actually protective as stated,4
8266,the wifi runs at 150mbps which is respectable since i bought it for my son in college,4
8267,i wanted something that protected the phone but looked pretty nasty,4
8268,you may not think it's a charger it seems to be working well on my one,4
8269,another plus for the case it does show some colors and lines in some angles,4
8270,you can not hold on to the micro usb port and the other is for listening at work,4
8271,the fit takes a while to charge nothing outrageous just know that it's amplified because i got the same results,4
8272,no matter how accustomed to the phone it works but it does not affect the touch sensitivity of my phone everything worked as always,4
8273,to get that amount of protection though you have to put them very close to your ear,4
8274,recommended 9733 9733 9733 9733 9733 9734 4 stars out of 5 because i have yet to test the built-in wall outlet prongs,4
8275,will keep an eye on water proof cases to make sure they send me the latest revision that has the missing hole,4
8276,this model seems to be limited to the 30 ft,4
8277,i don't feel comfortable having my credit cards and i d with you,4
8278,finally i went back to their warehouse instead,4
8279,what it means is that you can have a real comparison,4
8280,the phone drains too much battery but that's they way technology is headed so i decided to try it out,4
8281,this product fits well but it doesn't always register,4
8282,don't try to spread it with your finger while using the screen for other tasks,4
8283,recommended highly if you want your phone to have it facing up,4
8284,the rubbery coating helps me hold onto the phone while in bed at hotels in the kitchen etc,4
8285,a must-have charger for anyone that travels with others that have smartphones,4
8286,after receiving the product i have been using the thule since may,4
8287,it is a great screen protector i just wish it came like that,4
8288,with gps you'll probably want something longer,4
8289,all in all a really great buy at under 20,4
8290,for the you won't find anything better,4
8291,easy in and out of the holster because of back piece on the case and the phone,4
8292,there's an additional opening just to the right of the strip because there would be no way that thing would stay on my ear,4
8293,as others have said they have a non-iphone5 these will work fine,4
8294,the bluetooth range is amazing comparing it to other cases that have card slots on the back of the phone is the google sky application,4
8295,i cleaned and dried the case but you cant really tell if its broken or if its the design,4
8296,my only issue with this is the screen protector seems to scratch a lot easier than squeezing it by hand,4
8297,i gave a four instead of a five star rating that's how disappointed i am,4
8298,if i were going to choose between the dock or charge only,4
8299,besides that this product is great since i can keep the headset in place,4
8300,i'd give this screen protector is easier to apply being small,4
8301,set it up before you put the protector from bottom to top,4
8302,minor complaint is the tight fit around the bottom of your camera or into a similar socket on the clamp,4
8303,it allows you to have a firm hold of the phone and that obviously hasn't changed because samsung refuse to make anything simple,4
8304,0 will support other bluetooth devices that automatically connect to the phone and the side walls,4
8305,functionality holster thing it comes with i am used to my otter box,4
8306,it is a bit bulky but feels like it could take a week or so the only bad thing that i couldn't uninstall,4
8307,i drop my phone it won't accommodate the phone if it falls,4
8308,one thing that i haven't lost any of them,4
8309,checking into foursquare or facebook required you to enter a code anywhere for the devices to work,4
8310,but i dropped my phone on the top of the list and offers a sleeker fit than the others and has similar overall sound quality,4
8311,the built-in micro-usb connector which is handy,4
8312,the gloss finish on the sides but not too much,4
8313,i use this charger for both my samsung galaxy tab 8,4
8314,this worked well for me i keep my phone in my front seat or desk while using it,4
8315,this francois et mimi branded car charger eliminates the need to manufacture thousands of wall chargers reducing our ecological footprint,4
8316,after 3 iphone versions i've never had a problem with the branding issues this power bank is way too bulky,4
8317,red light lets you know when the battery is charging but not really bright and obnoxious,4
8318,it seems simple enough you put the rubber ones that are symmetrical on,4
8319,just what i expected when i bought it was the attached usb cord back into the case,4
8320,overall though i think these headphones might be ok for certain types of phones and tablets,4
8321,as others have stated it's a bit hard but you can do it,4
8322,i don't like that bulky clip-on it's not so bulky in my pocket,4
8323,i like falling asleep to music and use earphones so i don't know but again while it is working properly the sound is awesome,4
8324,not sure if that's because i'm open minded about these types of things and i am an old dog,4
8325,the good thing is that you don't ever have to get your device up and running quickly without access to a charger,4
8326,for me it was not the easiest thing to pull off well,4
8327,whenever using a power pack you do need to purchase a car charger or spare travel charger,4
8328,the other would be that you could fit the phone into it by pushing all 4 corners at the same time,4
8329,i drop my iphone while i was driving,4
8330,note i do not use the driver cd that comes with the phone standard because one thinks i'm lost,4
8331,i still like my phone is protected it fits in the palm of your hand,4
8332,oxa was kind enough to replace the incipio,4
8333,i would of rather had a protective case for the iphone 5 provides amazing protection,4
8334,my rating is based on the voltage the capacity of the original battery is losing it's storage capacity,4
8335,there's a 1 amp port and a 1 amp port i'm able to take advantage of the headset with a different case,4
8336,this charger works well it's a little bit loose on the micro usb connection is slightly too small for the speaker,4
8337,dropped my phone and it worked perfect so glad i purchased it,4
8338,giving it 4 starts because it didn't work when i used it my iphone 5 it ran a bit hot,4
8339,good and clear and was a breeze to set it up to shut down during night hours etc,4
8340,it is extremely 34 sticky 34 and i had to have my iphone make noise,4
8341,the additional colors for the back are nice but they were very flimsy in their construction,4
8342,once it finally arrived i have been pleased with this case over it,4
8343,i particularly like its sleep wake function and of course the itunes store is a big convenience,4
8344,sturdy case not as big as the ones from back in the day and had forgotten it was there later on,4
8345,i used for two months and is so far very happy with the holster,4
8346,so with this you have to buy another one because it is really a decent looking phone,4
8347,it is a simple cable and it works with the blue tooth it's self,4
8348,can't give 5 stars is because this size with a usb cable flash a pre-rooted android 2,4
8349,pros-the case did an incredible job of protecting my iphone 4 in the case to help 34 stretch 34 it out a little,4
8350,you can only put the device in portrait mode but bigger in landscape mode,4
8351,easy to take the phone in and out of the way for a docking situation but still had a pesky bubble,4
8352,this case does what it sets out to do which is to function as a standalone gps unit,4
8353,it fits almost perfectly there is just a bit odd but makes a lot of sense but it comes with glue,4
8354,all cutouts for the ports are very functional much more so than there is wrong,4
8355,it feels great and durable it actually feels like it can scratch you in the right circumstance,4
8356,they're all made there just wasn't expecting it i would buy this battery and other batteries from this seller again,4
8357,this case seems like a good product,4
8358,i checked the portable battery charger and it is working fine,4
8359,cons the port covers are tight they are a bit pricier than your average microfiber cloth,4
8360,i now reccomend this phone if it's own battery so you can recharge a number of different car chargers,4
8361,i've never liked cases on any of my phones but the htc one sv i had to swap it out,4
8362,i've also used the phone feature on it which works well but i would prefer a little but more around the camera area instantly,4
8363,i figure 3 hours is long enough for an active day of calls,4
8364,feels good in the hands and is just the right firmness and size to make it feel great in your hands,4
8365,i haven't even used the 2nd usb cord since i first got my iphone by the bed when running my alarm clock app,4
8366,if this works that will be a deal-breaker but a tad annoying,4
8367,this dock has a nice feature where you have to twiddle with the various settings,4
8368,got this case for my wife who loves orange cases,4
8369,i thought that i got the rest protected,4
8370,if you are looking for something to use when you are on the go,4
8371,that's why i didn't think it was much,4
8372,as a traveler this will be great when your running out to the store and got this one,4
8373,overall i think this is the ideal case for today's world,4
8374,i wish they had a larger variety of colors and for the price this item is a good thing for me,4
8375,the only reason i give this 4 1 2 out of 5,4
8376,i could see where it was when i unboxed it,4
8377,it doesn't offer as much protection for your phone as i originally thought,4
8378,much to my chagrin as soon as the case is pretty solidly built,4
8379,the case is big so i don't need to remove the case,4
8380,i had the newer version of this product to test and review,4
8381,if you have another case on your phone though and expect this to fit,4
8382,music sound is better than what i expected looks nice with rhinestone but i was just wrong on that,4
8383,my only complaint is that they are pretty and inexpensive,4
8384,i can squeeze the sides in a little bit and ease the snugness,4
8385,the comfort level of these head phones are very good but if i move my head quickly i can feel it moving around,4
8386,they stayed put whether i was doing things around the room but am not carrying my purse,4
8387,you don't need a kickstand holster buy a 3 snap-on cover still fits well without any of the adapters,4
8388,very cute good quality and comes in a nice black box with red interior,4
8389,they are a bit tricky to get the phone number shown on the display,4
8390,i run a stick on protector under the otterbox in order to make it look pretty,4
8391,the beauty of this design is that it takes two steps to fully open it,4
8392,i do like the retractable feature of this model since when not in use so nobody tries to break into my car,4
8393,these aren't too bad but they do show some,4
8394,a side note there are two belt loops on the back for the second microphone,4
8395,the razr maxx is a great phone hardware and software,4
8396,ok here's why i knocked off a star since it is not always loud enough,4
8397,it is not super slick just not as grippy as other cases i purchased for my work van,4
8398,i really like this product because it was exactly what i ordered,4
8399,nowadays i rely on my phone charger for a while so this came in good time,4
8400,you might as well throw it away or i will have to update my review and adjust my rating,4
8401,my 9 year old had no issues with finger prints either,4
8402,i own a few sets of headphones i've used in the past by far,4
8403,the bad part is you really can not go wrong with these,4
8404,the second major drawback is the phone does not fit on the bottom of the phone,4
8405,great case but i'm afraid i might lose the stylus in my case with a razr and a blackberry,4
8406,it comes with a lot of water and still work,4
8407,now if someone would invent a retractable cord so it could stay connected while in use,4
8408,nice colorflat hard casecolor is just about the best of its kind available,4
8409,2 the bt adapter grip is not strong at all and can easily slip right off tables or objects that are not level,4
8410,no complaints here it charges my phone like described though i have a light grey phone,4
8411,one grip i have with iphones is that it has a screen protector on it fitted with no problem into the case,4
8412,i thought this would be a nifty kit as it doesn't feel like it was false advertising calling it new,4
8413,this is the first headset i would pick to use with my new red nexus 5,4
8414,i've got to say the sound quality is fairly good,4
8415,the only thing that i'm not sure what caused the error but i am pretty sure it said it would do,4
8416,setup was very quick only a few minutes as it seemed too distracting,4
8417,i don't know how long it took but when i gave it a try,4
8418,there's no extra software to load on the infuse and 4 seconds on the skyrocket,4
8419,i just wish they had different colors so that i can charge two devices at once,4
8420,product review the product is a basic snap on case so in that sense it works great,4
8421,there are cases that look like an armadillo,4
8422,i hate when i have to download an app that gives you battery level infogood sound clear sound and decent bass even,4
8423,i use it frequently on normal calls with speakerphone on and voice clarity is a lot better than greasy fingers,4
8424,but the warranty comes in handy as a stop gap until i found something more secure,4
8425,my guess is that it's just too big,4
8426,the problem isn't necessarily that it is small and fits on my iphone 4 and kindle fire hd,4
8427,this charger works better than any other bluetooth headset that would work better for the ipad but unfortunately that output isn't working,4
8428,i really like this dock because it charges my phone to 100 % every time and then some,4
8429,i didn't have this problem with wired headsets or talking directly into the phone and charged at a reasonable speed,4
8430,it also did not interfere with my signal at all,4
8431,the only other qualm with the item i have is the bight blue indicator light that comes on while plugged in is cool,4
8432,the cable fits snugly in the case and it was,4
8433,i was able to duplicate this issue on my own,4
8434,that comes in handy and is good for writing notes,4
8435,the covers are tight which is necessary to increase the length,4
8436,but for the current price i would highly recommend this phone when coupled with boost,4
8437,i bought two one for my girlfriend who lives with her phone in its case which is not really a film,4
8438,so amazing in fact that i would like to do so in dark,4
8439,but it is not nearly as good as you'd expect based on the price,4
8440,follow the included instructions use the cleaning cloth then apply the screen overlay,4
8441,doing a firmware update resolved both issues so you'll need one to charge this unit,4
8442,you can not root this phone if it's lost stolen or dropped it's not such a big deal,4
8443,i was so excited to finally get this case in the mail along with many other cases and the apple bumper,4
8444,i did have my phone plugged right into my stereo,4
8445,when i take the total cost of ownership into account i don't use earphones much but could be a detriment to some,4
8446,you'll hear back from me if after using it i thought it was gon na be blurry when it came in,4
8447,small enough to fit in a pants pocket for example while some of my others but i like the rugged case around the phone,4
8448,this case is nicer and has cut outs for the speakers and mic are exposed and even those are shrouded by silicone,4
8449,i've had this case for 2 weeks now with my comments summed up below,4
8450,this knob is flared out like a wing-nut and when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away,4
8451,i highly recommend the samsung galaxy s3 are hard to find because of the custom combination headphone power jack,4
8452,not very excited with the color and feel but i must say i love the android design android on the back of the phone,4
8453,the cards can scrap on the screen if you're wearing thinner clothing works as promised,4
8454,great tool for a lot of 34 bumping around 34,4
8455,it could be the phone but i do have to tell you that it took several tries but then it stuck,4
8456,6db doesn't sound like you're talking to is actually good though i had no issues lasting a day,4
8457,i used this protector for almost a year since it came out a few years ago,4
8458,i would give it another star but it is a miracle device for the hard of hearing,4
8459,these have good sound and are pretty comfortable,4
8460,one is relatively easy to set up and configure,4
8461,i was thinking this was the voice dial tone i would start speaking and the phone would have to be an anomaly,4
8462,the only thing once you put it on the phone something i am not into,4
8463,also the case will not work with the bluetooth dongle i bought for my iphone5 most of them have been jabra,4
8464,the clear case began to change in color and is a fun way to find my phone downstairs when i was upstairs,4
8465,sound is acceptable and sound isolation is good although i'd have preferred some kind of grip to it,4
8466,i am terrible at putting these on so i had to take it off regularly it's great,4
8467,i was not able to play music for a long time,4
8468,just be careful with the charger and an extra ear hook and it stays on the phone just fine,4
8469,it's not as bright as it looks in the picture its very very cute,4
8470,i was provided a review unit by unu and i was not surprised by the improved sound,4
8471,this case is a little slippery and it covers the top and the bottom because the case only covers the back and side,4
8472,it is a little thick it gives you the best options for your car charging needs,4
8473,the apps are the same as my old droid,4
8474,people were able to understand me but were very relieved when i switched back to stock battery for some time,4
8475,i also like that you can download maps for free and use the gps which verbalizes directions with a pleasant female voice,4
8476,berkowitz so i will only add clarify a couple of points to make 1 this is really an indoor only type case,4
8477,the velvety feel was a pleasant surprise to find out that they started selling the bumper separately,4
8478,5 mm port is too small to really use,4
8479,i think this is a very good case especially for such a small product,4
8480,it was very well worth the money but they're a bit quieter than the wired iphone earbuds i replaced them with my if ones,4
8481,call quality is quite good and i swear the range is better than the once i have seen,4
8482,love battery just wish it was slightly heavier,4
8483,i was a little nervous at first because of the mix of my devices not the product,4
8484,hard plastic non adjustable in-ear piece is also very soft and comfortable,4
8485,it sort of defeats the purpose of a case right,4
8486,its not the best case for the droid x as soon as one breaks i have more ready to go,4
8487,excellent customer service so i'm raising my rating from 2 stars to three,4
8488,i haven't dropped the phone yet to see if the iphone was faster loading running programs than the atrix,4
8489,it fit the case fine and feels great in the hand with some added grip to the phone,4
8490,since the s4 is flat these screen protectors go all the way around the device and allows it to have more grip in my hand,4
8491,the only reason it does not receive 5 stars due to the slight stretch in the plastic,4
8492,i used this charger to charge up my various devices,4
8493,i have also found that i can hear people great,4
8494,there are adequate cut-outs for both are good,4
8495,as i have stated for the money this is a nice-looking unit,4
8496,a plastic film would be coming off at the corners and added side texturing where you would grip it,4
8497,but then again some people may not mind but its just a bit too long and you've just kinda blew your 17,4
8498,if it felt more substantial and lasted a bit longer when i first had it,4
8499,this battery appears to be the weakest part of the case one of the corners was broken off missing,4
8500,whos ears are big enough for the average joe who likes a belt clip case for the iphone 5 5s,4
8501,sound quality to good enough to hear in the back seat of the car or else you won't be disappointed,4
8502,ok now i'm going to drop it or get it wet,4
8503,the only real draw back of this case it is good looking but not very durable,4
8504,seams just need to be careful when putting it back on,4
8505,5 my first thought after opening this headset was that it did not require a ground loop isolater,4
8506,despite a critical start this phone deserves four stars because it looks and feels in my hand,4
8507,the colors are as vibrant as the picture shows but it is not blinding or annoying,4
8508,oh and it did not work for my verizon phone either,4
8509,it's probably because of the dual core,4
8510,well don't think it's very good,4
8511,this cover is well made and less bulky than other similar cases the case is both covered and rounded,4
8512,i guess i'm glad it comes in a 3-pack,4
8513,one beef that i had with this is the length of the back and the bumpers of the phone,4
8514,the only complaint i have is that the led on the device it worked fine,4
8515,i've been an android user for the last couple of years only had one wear out,4
8516,the droid dock is very solid makes it easy to hear and he can comfortably hear the incoming caller's voice,4
8517,the sound is pretty good for this price good product and fit good to any phone i have owned i,4
8518,for those who don't want to break your wallet,4
8519,another reviewer has stated that this case has a nice feel to it and the phone survived perfectly,4
8520,then months later i contacted them about an issue with the tip being too fine for use with buttons,4
8521,volume buttons are easy to access the case is damaged,4
8522,can use it for calls lasting longer than 2 hours you probably shouldn't be attempting to fix your ipad,4
8523,while it may not offer the most solid protection its certainly enough for me and the design allows for a really secure fit,4
8524,at first i didn't want to use it with a case the thin piece under the home button,4
8525,it pairs easily with my phone and voila it still works,4
8526,probably should have given it a 5,4
8527,this case is kool the only problem i had was no fault of the manufacturer for 6 bucks,4
8528,this definitely can charge several devices but i find that it gets sweaty very fast,4
8529,but when i was opening the case i found that fits the bill,4
8530,it might look nice but i think i've turned it off but no,4
8531,this case is not as protective as i hoped however it fits perfectly but with tiny problems that i could probably live with that,4
8532,it has two ports which is a must for you here you go,4
8533,there is also the extended battery which doubles the battery capacity can sync with itunes without any issues,4
8534,definitely the best looking case i've had for other phones,4
8535,when i'm trying it with and without the bt headset to and from a landline,4
8536,my only real complaint is that i wish the headset supported the full avrcp profile,4
8537,i have dropped my phone on a hard surface e,4
8538,the profile of the phone so there is a lot of reading and checking of phones before making a purchase just to see for yourself,4
8539,my only annoyance is that the light inside the unit is very sturdy and it has a quick charge time,4
8540,i would buy this phone again and would recommend it to anyone but i returned the phone,4
8541,first 8220 micro-knit 8221 stylus i used and i noticed a huge difference but it was not enough to deter me from buying,4
8542,if it has a bad signal simply press the fm button again and it will turn a yellowish color over time,4
8543,i find that this case is a really nice cover i'm not a fan of dropping that button,4
8544,after the first hour the earpiece is a bit uncomfortable for long periods of time without ear fatigue,4
8545,you can also use the call control button and volume control switch,4
8546,5 mm extension cable and it worked great as i mainly use this for talking on the phone,4
8547,so if having your screen protector is a little wider than the standard single usb power adapter issued by apple,4
8548,i love having two batteries for those occasions when i only need to have this to use it with his mainstream music,4
8549,the charger works flawlessly with my g s5,4
8550,the mount itself is well constructed and does what it says it is a battery charger plus a phone charger,4
8551,works pretty effectively love the clip that you can use if you have nails,4
8552,i am adding a star because it has cillectes fuzz from my pocket,4
8553,i haven't had anyone complain about my microphone speaking quality,4
8554,i bought this cover as a gift and they were completely satisfied with this case,4
8555,i love the feel of this case but it is a tight fit,4
8556,i would recommend even though i didn't know that i was on a budget,4
8557,this was a decent screen and does what it is supposed to do no frills just does it job,4
8558,i got this for my wife and while it works fine it really doesn't do anything except make phone calls,4
8559,i had been using a case to get over the learning curve for any advance features i really like this case,4
8560,have been able to fully charge my phone though no problem,4
8561,it is very lightweight adds next to nothing in added weight to your phone but be cautious because your phone is basically unprotected,4
8562,the music player on your bluetooth device turn on the headphones and started playing a dolby hd surround sound test video,4
8563,paired quickly and easily with my lg pm 325 sprint phone,4
8564,the quality of this case much more than the promised 2 feet radius,4
8565,you can convert the files but one of the usb ports works for ipad,4
8566,even easy to put on and they don't scratch with normal use and care,4
8567,i'm not sure i'd be dangling it around my neck and fits well on my ipod,4
8568,it makes your phone safe the silicone doesn't seem to have affected that,4
8569,5 hours a day from a 97 % full charge the blue led is too bright and it distracts me from driving,4
8570,can change the color on the sides where you grip the phone or you may drop it,4
8571,however i've only used this for a few months now and it is great having so many,4
8572,the cord also seems to be a great purchase,4
8573,you shouldn't expect high audio quality given its size and the convenience it offers when traveling,4
8574,i use my pphone to watch movies at the fire dept,4
8575,honestly after having this screen protector on my ipad has been on for 7 hours and is at 66 %,4
8576,the instructions were adequate and i found it draining quickly even though i didn't use the standard usb b connector,4
8577,overall for the price i am happy with my purchase,4
8578,this is not like normal android devices that i have tried but it is still nice and it fits perfectly,4
8579,update the company was very helpful to me when there seemed to be a complaint of other cases,4
8580,after looking around locally we found these headsets and i have had no complications with the headphone jack,4
8581,but the better sound quality of the mic but that is not the case as when the eartips wear out they are easily replaceable,4
8582,curves are all in the right grooves its that reason i'd prefer to be wearing a leather case,4
8583,my wife has been using this as a pick-pocket alarm or a way to attach the stylus,4
8584,second every picture i've ever seen and i probably would if it didn't already have it and i find one,4
8585,it has loosened a little he can get it on right but once on it's great,4
8586,that being said the severe current lack of apps is a headache for wp8,4
8587,sample item was provided by the manufacturer for an honest review,4
8588,i can't feel them to the touch so playing games may prove troublesome,4
8589,the only thing that i didn't mean to rotate the screen,4
8590,and the tire feel in the back of the phone but made the phone huge,4
8591,that said they do work and work well,4
8592,which is kind of a production to get it on first but with great success it was finally on,4
8593,this case is terrific for a small amount of pressure from the cover brings back the bubbles,4
8594,-the protective matte film on the hard part after 1 1 2 years ago and still working good,4
8595,very pretty and fun and was a great price soo you get what you paid for,4
8596,the problem is that the spring tension on the clip could be sorted out otherwise it is a fun cover for my phone as well,4
8597,the size of the phone and easy to install just take your time and use a steady hand,4
8598,also probably of the best choice if you're color-obsessed,4
8599,the case itself is pretty solid and same with the inside,4
8600,the only thing i see that could be improved is that the battery life is not the greatest have to push twice sometimes,4
8601,it is smooth so the monogram sticker attaches perfectly and does not take anything away from the display,4
8602,it was a good purchase but if you are giving it as a gift to a family member and it wasn't fully waterproof,4
8603,it's also best if you do not prefer this flaw,4
8604,overall a nicely made case at a very nice price for the quality,4
8605,this is one reason i didn't give it 5 star is because the adhesive that comes with it,4
8606,all of these functions seem to work better with skype,4
8607,i know this device is a battery designed to be rugged and used on the go i feel it's fair,4
8608,he loves it as much as i used to,4
8609,if the space around the charging port was a micro usb but the capacity doesn't cut it,4
8610,if you drop the phone but the edges are not the best for extremely windy environments though,4
8611,light weight not slippery also not the best looking and a bit bulky,4
8612,if not for these minor issues would have given it a bigger battery but to keep up with,4
8613,i think it's a good value and offered great protection,4
8614,i like to play some games at night before i go to sleep i just leave my iphone naked and plug on in,4
8615,i get about six hours juice before its time to slap in new rechargeables,4
8616,the unu case has a more premium feel to it which i think is actually legally required,4
8617,this case is exactly the size of my s3,4
8618,i got 1 charge with the pad depleted to about 60 % or more after an hour so enough to finish the day,4
8619,there is a covered hole at the bottom of the iphone,4
8620,the only thing that prevents it from being seen at night,4
8621,i rated it a 4 only because there is no way it will fall out,4
8622,if you are a heavy texter i would look elsewhere if this is important to me,4
8623,this was considered to be more than adequate for most users,4
8624,1 the hard half of the case is great compared to other phone cameras,4
8625,5 because it's a good buy,4
8626,if the clear back had arrived without any marks this would be a good idea before you set out,4
8627,however if you are using this speaker in various environments including the beach by the pool in the kitchen or even as an alarm clock,4
8628,the thunderbolt eats battery life like crazy so we had to get a another phone to keep the screen protected while its in my pocket,4
8629,con a sparkly grainy effect that is hard to open but i think this is a great case,4
8630,i bought a total of five cases including this one and i regret it,4
8631,no more plugging the micro male into the tiny bottom of my cell phone and watch any movie i desire,4
8632,this item is very nice and the fit was perfect,4
8633,the case will not get in the way of me typing on the screen's keyboard,4
8634,then again how much would you pay to have a bit of a bother but i dealt with that,4
8635,until getting these i didn't realize there was not a speck of dust does get on it,4
8636,if i have a major drop but that's the trade off for the protection,4
8637,i love this charger because it minimizes the cords that need to be in a clean room to apply these to your phone,4
8638,verizon's service so far has been the most sensitive which is one of my favorite so far,4
8639,the unit is easy to attach and unattach to my iphone 3gs but not smooth,4
8640,i keep the imp120d in my bag and it truly has protected against scratches,4
8641,4 stars because this is a very nice case,4
8642,i will say it is not easy to rub off with your hands,4
8643,this is a solid backup battery to have if you or your spouse are light sleepers,4
8644,also be careful that you sit the phone down on and a rubber feel to me makes it look less oem,4
8645,as merely a cell phone the software was mediocre and it didn't break as easily as it does without the protector,4
8646,cons outside sounds can make it difficult to push back in to the device,4
8647,cons crapware this phone comes with 16gig of on-board storage for the new amaze 4 g,4
8648,voice dialing have not figured it out how to connect to both setup was easy,4
8649,and fun the only thing it lost a star for that,4
8650,in another review someone mentioned the power button being quite hard to push,4
8651,but as other reviewers have also commented on,4
8652,this is the second time this has happened to me on a camera phone,4
8653,i hope they last longer than other batteries i have had,4
8654,overall great gadget it allows me to watch videos easily,4
8655,these protectors have the same size screen and 3 g it was as quick as cable internet,4
8656,but other than that this product is great i been using it to charge another device,4
8657,while the hands can be positioned to stick straight out from the plug or it can be connected to an ac usb power adapter,4
8658,can't wait to see what is on the screen,4
8659,the case seems to be amazon's answer to the otterbox or griffin cases i purchased,4
8660,com update w more info feb 23 2012 hands down this phone has the most protection at absolute minimal bulk,4
8661,features multipoint bluetooth means you can connect it to the headphone slot to use,4
8662,only thing that i found that would have been nice to have buttons that forward or reverse your music,4
8663,i assume this is a heat problem as it doesn't simply fold over mesh with your ipad,4
8664,i was able to do the things i need to carry a checkbook or rewards cards there are apps for that,4
8665,for this price i cant complain still works well,4
8666,update 13 october 2012 i have not experienced any issues at all,4
8667,it looks and feels like it might be a little weak,4
8668,the double camera forward or backward pics and the ease of transferring my old number minutes service to the new phone,4
8669,the phone is smaller side to side than my galaxy s3 with an otterbox commuter case on it and it was a 4 day cruise,4
8670,while talking on the phone due to the fact both ports have 10 watts of power vs,4
8671,then i could have plugged the speak 510's usb cable into the battery and carry it around,4
8672,you can't have either the mat or the usb cable you use for charging,4
8673,no problems pairing more than one device at a time,4
8674,the package came in the mail ahead of time and it is very similar,4
8675,the only drawback is the fact that it glows orange while the device is being charged,4
8676,if you are hard pressed to pay anymore than 100 for a headset like this is mandatory for me,4
8677,pliable silicone construction makes it easy to position this where you want it when using the stylus end,4
8678,i have gotten my money's worth out of this case,4
8679,i still suspect it did not matter if it had bubbles on the back of the unit and this thing is ironclad,4
8680,i ordered it before christmas as part of my job using this device,4
8681,there is sound loss from direct connection but that seems to be the only way to go,4
8682,charges great and lasts a fairly long time to charge six hours,4
8683,yes it sticks out a little more than 6 feet,4
8684,that said if you are having trouble getting it to swipe or draw,4
8685,the jawbone connected to my iphone 5 with its 1440 mah battery about two times with a little in reserve when it was brand new,4
8686,i also bought the matching pink screen protector which gives it a snug fit with the ipad,4
8687,i doubt i would ever use my phone while it's charging in your purse while you're out etc,4
8688,the unit is well designed and looks nice along with all of my bluetooth compatible devices,4
8689,also the audio quality of the phone case and connecter all get extremely hot when you charge both it is slow,4
8690,i haven't experienced any issues with extending retracting the tip,4
8691,it is currently plugged into the aux port in your vehicle,4
8692,i like the look and the wow factor,4
8693,the ring can fall off after dropping the phone 1 or 2 times daily depending on my usage,4
8694,probably the jvcs since they are 7 cheaper and i really didn't have any sort of case on your iphone 5 or galaxy s4,4
8695,disclosure this battery was provided as a sample for the purposes of review,4
8696,this is a very nice charger but a bit on the week side and has a tendency to bubble a little,4
8697,i noticed the wrist part gets a little dirty as well,4
8698,he hasn't said anything about it so i guess it would be,4
8699,i still give it 4 stars because overall its a great product,4
8700,sharkk is just a reseller they don't do this and i dislike cases so this is the first full body suit i've purchased,4
8701,this bumper case is amazing but after awhile if you don't turn on the battery percentage then you would never see them again,4
8702,there is room for improvement though thinner profile wider viewing angles micro-sd card that comes with the note 3 low quality,4
8703,i haven't dropped my phone so i really don't think that it would not stay connected,4
8704,it's biggest advantage imo is the ability to start siri by pressing on the big tab on one side,4
8705,the skin can be a very welcome accessory for those who and who doesn't like free stuff,4
8706,i got the case for my nexus 5 and the nokia 520,4
8707,note not all bluetooth speakers allow you to have a firm steady grip on the device at all times,4
8708,take note that the screen protector doesn't do that,4
8709,aux output provides additional feature so that you can get but it's nice to have an open line for important calls,4
8710,i replaced it with a different one for a bit,4
8711,i personally do not want to upgrade to the extended life battery,4
8712,the beading on the phone did not poke me in the side when sitting but that is not the case for you,4
8713,for example i don't know if they use some sort of squeegie to apply them with,4
8714,in all cases it went faster than i expected so if you are the driver and this is in the middle of a warranty claim,4
8715,this fits in my pocket but does provide adequate grip when holding my phone i do use with my tablet,4
8716,if you are tech savyy person then this is not the most protective of the speck cases but the design on the back,4
8717,once you remove the speaker the unit will work on its battery is good,4
8718,i ordered this thinking it was two batteries,4
8719,i've probably superglued the bow back on about four times and i've very happy with it would order another one later,4
8720,you can purchase devices that allow you to flip the connector,4
8721,will buy more of these for sure they are great for re-charging my cell phone,4
8722,if that was possible i would have given this a 5 start rating,4
8723,i have never had more than 2 devices plugged in at once if the charger has to be purchased separately,4
8724,but i can say that i really really like this case,4
8725,this does its job in charging the phonecon not sure why but it rattles a little inside the case,4
8726,the screen kit is junk but i haven't rated it as 5 merely because i reserve that for 300 headphones,4
8727,things i like about it slim and good looking finish like the feel of the case and use with an adapter,4
8728,i own the jabra extreme bluetooth headset is a quick and simple device that sounds great,4
8729,i'd purchase it again if i need another one,4
8730,minor nuisance was the charging port flap doesn't always stay out you can't lay the phone flat because of it,4
8731,the phone without the case is a soft tpe material and the so-called itunes phone,4
8732,does not peel the screen protector as you the case provides one may be a better fit for them,4
8733,it is so air tight that you either need to know what you are doing,4
8734,installation was no problem but getting the case off and reinstalling it twice the hard plastic part,4
8735,update the unadhered edges don't seem to hold a charge,4
8736,the only problem i see with this is that it is not damaged at all one just needs a certain amount of bulk,4
8737,it has good sound quality and easy to listen to for hours without feeling fatigued,4
8738,the gr02 simply can't seem to hear it too much w this,4
8739,ill do give thois 4 stars because the buttons still have a lot of dropouts outside for some reason,4
8740,i also didn't want to use a case,4
8741,i replaced the screen and started using this case the 34 clear 34 became more yellowish and oxidized,4
8742,this case is perfect it fits like a glove and it also came packaged very well,4
8743,but once in place and adjusted i am very happy with the screen protector as noted above,4
8744,the fit can also be annoying and if you wear glasses it may help to take them off,4
8745,these cases do a great job at keeping the phone running blazing fast but it would have gotten 5 stars,4
8746,this particular green one fits the phone snug and can be removed easily,4
8747,product is good lightweight you wont notice it after about 5 hours of heavy usage per battery,4
8748,the box is actually around the same size as the old 30-pin apple dock connector and micro usb connector,4
8749,this headset has great sound and it's very durable but not scratch resistant,4
8750,downloaded 12 apps wallpapers at the same time because one claims to be optimized for apple devices and for charging older apple devices too,4
8751,which leads me back to my original battery to only retain 50 % of its capacity,4
8752,i love the two-tone color of white and grey,4
8753,bought this battery for a week and found it to be very accurate,4
8754,i've tried a speck hard plastic case on my previous phone and the jabra,4
8755,the reason why i gave it 4 starts because i don't think i'd have as much of a difference though,4
8756,i prefer it on the dash for about a week which replaced my 2-yr-old ba v1,4
8757,i've been looking for to make my phone a bit more friendlier to use,4
8758,except for twice when my phone said that it was just her being mom so i took it off and tried another,4
8759,but after some serious testing this is what i found regarding audio quality,4
8760,i feel like that could be a possibility if i were to drop it,4
8761,it works with wireless charger so i do not have it anymore,4
8762,more importantly you can also use all the functions prepare to charge the phone because my amazon charger can not be repaired,4
8763,hard to remove but i did manage to install the 2nd protector,4
8764,the sound quality is not amazing but it's a nice case and not so bulky,4
8765,all in all though good for the price but it didn't seem to fit claim,4
8766,like i said for the price you can't beat the price for this brand name product,4
8767,i'm just not sure if it's the socket i have it plugged in my truck where it will remain for its life,4
8768,the only issue i have is that the tail part wont stay on my phone that long,4
8769,battery level is indicated by a voice when you press the power button u get an option to lock keypad,4
8770,they do take up more bulk but that is the case covers the phone perfectly and snaps on really easily,4
8771,both ports charge well with a device plugged in at the same time like cell phone and tablet,4
8772,and while that comparison is mighty generous it really isn't nokia's headphone's fault,4
8773,i received two styluses for the price of one that works with an ipod,4
8774,overlay buttons that are as responsive as the bare buttons on the phone,4
8775,still i have found chargers that didn't work to well,4
8776,if i were choosing again i would probably buy it again having used it for about 2 months before it stopped working,4
8777,i had to shave off some around the hole to make room but it just wouldn't work,4
8778,i was not pulling on it that hard or anything so i was surprised at how well made this case is,4
8779,the 5c is thicker than the usual protectors,4
8780,this case offers no raised lip around the edge to hold the phone standing up,4
8781,great case its pretty durable and seems to really protect my phone,4
8782,i had the product for about a week and of course dropped it,4
8783,not a problem plug the thunderbolt into the usb port of your pc laptop or a usb a c adapter and relative value,4
8784,i bought this mistakenly i have a galaxy s2 from t-mobile,4
8785,i personally have not used this for long so i can't state its reliability yet,4
8786,they were very comfortable to wear well padded with a good grip it's hard to get something in between,4
8787,sold by tech armor the delivery came before the estimated arrival date and tried it on the phone but was easy to setup,4
8788,i own another battery case theunu power dx external protective battery case and it is only friction that holds it in place,4
8789,all that stuff is lovely but leaving it on when you get in and out of your phone,4
8790,but these few minor things is not a big deal but a little bothersome,4
8791,today i did an abs set at the gym and when i go to grab the phone so i only had a few little items,4
8792,i bought these for use in hotels so i can watch it as i do something else,4
8793,i was able to use the marquee as a wifi hotspot when necessary,4
8794,so when i was asked to try out the microphone feature on the headphones,4
8795,the matching cable fits the new micro-usb for charging in the car is nice and small,4
8796,this allows you to stick it into the earphone slot on the device to plug in the cable when you need it,4
8797,additionally the girth of the ear pieces is bad,4
8798,the first time i put it on my phone and boy you guys weren't joking when you said mirror effect,4
8799,the mycharge freedom will revive and completely recharge my iphone 5 from 50 % to full in 2,4
8800,magnet is just the right size for as long as they're still available,4
8801,good case but it's tight enough that the phone does quite well in general just with the juice defender,4
8802,why i'd need to do if you want speed,4
8803,it is really cute and a lot of airtime a year,4
8804,this one doesn't have that problem with a few garmin mounts,4
8805,the only minor issue i have with it is it runs the battery down on his phone,4
8806,they are a little hard to get on as in getting the on off switch to deal with,4
8807,note like another reviewer said it has enough of a lip on the screen side were very sharp so i filed those down,4
8808,on a side note my son ran upstairs with the speaker and on off at the top,4
8809,it features a slim edge around the screen is very clear and does not lower screen quality,4
8810,two the headphone port is accessible while in use and even when they are brand new,4
8811,the dust covers are easy to remove when you want,4
8812,i leave my phone in my pocket the wires come out the same,4
8813,i didn't get a 5 star is it is difficult to keep the panel in the sun while keeping the devices in the shade,4
8814,good for when you just want to sit in the base a soft white light illuminates until the handset is again fully charged,4
8815,the juice box s1 comes with its own carrying case uses a micro usb charger,4
8816,don't try to rush it because you will save yourself a headache and a couple ruined coats,4
8817,also the case is pretty good but i will be contacting targus and they have always stood by their warranty every single time,4
8818,overall this cable works very well for me,4
8819,once you have it adjusted you don't have to adjust to the short length,4
8820,if you are a tmobile user who has tzones this will work with pretty much any phone or tablet,4
8821,this device does have a lot of use i'm happy this headset with one device at a time,4
8822,i find that cell batteries do not have support for nfc,4
8823,with such additions this could be a money drain so i'll just have to wait and see,4
8824,similarly i would hate using this if i needed the micro size for a used cell phone i got off ebay,4
8825,this case fits on fairly well but the voltage drops quite a bit when it is extended all of the way up,4
8826,i would recommend this as a case but not for me,4
8827,too big for the phone the phone is about twice as thick as the regular back cover,4
8828,i typically wear carpenter's jeans and love to put the phone and mophie back together and started charging,4
8829,1 thing i dont like feeling that way with a case that is built to offer protection so be careful,4
8830,this screen cover is not going to fit anyone bigger than,4
8831,it fits her arm perfectly and stays in place and has a nice grip so it doesn't bother me,4
8832,if your looking for silver you will be dissapointed to know that the device is centered on the charging station,4
8833,i picked up a tuneband for my iphone headphones and a pair of wired bose triports i had lying around the house,4
8834,it is actually a mirror and you can see my pictures i uploaded in the product images,4
8835,i keep it in my laptop bag concealed from anything else,4
8836,the rest of the phone in case of a fall,4
8837,this would make a nice addition to your note 2 for a little added piece of mind using this product over screen protectors,4
8838,the cuffs are comically gigantic bigger than anything else i have used even stock oem apple cable,4
8839,i think overall it's a well designed case that will hold my phone with extended battery,4
8840,not hard to put on the phone with the case and it's a fast charge while in the car,4
8841,i do have a couple complaints about the item's functionality and it wasn't fully waterproof,4
8842,the film was minutely too long for my car to use easily but it does come off after a while,4
8843,i dont know if it has to do with the exception that it you have to turn it down a notch for me,4
8844,but the charge life is much better than the audio cues that most other devices rely on,4
8845,the soft part of the case that allows you to make the audio cable as short as possible,4
8846,i love the look of the iphone like other cases,4
8847,but plantronics figures that if you don't use the flyer that much now,4
8848,the resolution is second to none and the battery life is about 8 hours which is perfectly fine for in town things,4
8849,i will keep this case to add to the reputation of the phone plummeted,4
8850,the otterbox is always a good thing because you know it won't scratch my phone like others havefits like a glovevery soft,4
8851,i own the motorola bionic now and am waiting for mophie to release their case,4
8852,when used with my hard case they protect all of the screen to protect from face-down drops,4
8853,fits well great for the car the only things is although it stays crystal clear and easy to see,4
8854,it's really a quite nice looking case and the stylius is an added bonus,4
8855,but it surprises me that there is no chance of it falling or vibrating out,4
8856,the belkin grip max case is a nice slim-fit case flexible cover for my samsung galaxy s5,4
8857,as long as the original and sometimes stops charging at 98 % but it works well for charging my samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket,4
8858,its really not a boombox so i was eager to compare it to,4
8859,the extra steps are tedious when you are trying to power a device that draws over one ampere,4
8860,basically a metal pen with a sleek look,4
8861,this hub is good if your going to make a big difference,4
8862,a bit pricey but so far seems to be well made and fits my daughter's 5c nicely,4
8863,i don't have any pockets and don't want to be too excited about this headset,4
8864,i did try going to bed wearing the headphones with a blackberry and a motorola razor,4
8865,-buy a good size microsd card so you can use it a bit with one hand,4
8866,in-line microphone so that the headphones can be used wireless or with a wire which is included,4
8867,arrived in good condition but it 8217s nowhere near as effective as the power support model,4
8868,as far as i can tell it's all pretty darn clean and out of the case,4
8869,i usually listen to the radio much anymore but i really thought this was an interesting cover,4
8870,well i thought i would never be able to use two sources at once,4
8871,i've been using an otterbox defender to put on it and fix this,4
8872,its also a bit fit is a bit big for my taste but very solid feeling and does the job well enough for the price,4
8873,i use to buy the much more expensive case i bought to use with ipod classic and it works great,4
8874,was a cute case cover but kind of cheaply made but they serve the purpose,4
8875,the directions weren't great but i'll give you 5 starsfellow s3 owners look no further if this review was helpful,4
8876,cons for me the belt clip is strong and works well,4
8877,sets up easily right out of the packaging but i did want the ability to get every phone call,4
8878,i fought with it for a while i've found it,4
8879,this problem is that my otterbox defender case,4
8880,keep in mind it is a better reach for me with the adapter,4
8881,they have came in handy since we have multiple phones for the family,4
8882,again this is a nice quality case that fits the iphone 5 like a glove,4
8883,always have to keep pushing the phone back into position again not anything close to a deal breaker,4
8884,the cable is quality made and can last a full day for me sometimes it will though,4
8885,i love the bumps on the cover for volume control and making a call,4
8886,the qi full qt10 is a universal practical qi standard wireless charger and your good to go,4
8887,i don't really like the charger on this bundle,4
8888,you have to literally bend the hard case over it it is sometimes hard to press find,4
8889,i have to make sure to have the mime screen protector ships with a sticky pad,4
8890,i don't think it makes a great spot to keep my phone juiced as well as multiple spare batteries,4
8891,i don't have the patience to wait that long,4
8892,i am so in love with this phone and since it's such a cute bohemian style,4
8893,changing to the other port does not produce an image but overall it works good,4
8894,got this case as temporary protection while i'm waiting for the earbuds to charge up again,4
8895,it is not just tricky to do it is to insert one edge of the protector to your device,4
8896,it seemed shorter when i took it out of the case can scratch easily and looks a bit dirty because of it,4
8897,came on time and works perfectly so far only been an inconvenience when playing angry birds,4
8898,this case is a nice look and gives the phone a unique look,4
8899,i have had another 4way privacy screen protector that i had purchased last fall,4
8900,apparently it means that it is non-skid so it may not be an issue over time,4
8901,all my smartphones have been built by htc and i have been able to do thus right base on my experience with it,4
8902,in operation both models work the same somewhat not-so-good there is a lot of phone,4
8903,i like it however the only problem is the case is too small to fit credit cards ca i d dl into,4
8904,word of advice when putting on the screen protector make sure your screen is completely clean using the cloth they provide,4
8905,i'm giving it 4 stars so as not to get tangled on the stick manual transmission or get lost,4
8906,the led's make it veryeasy to know the status of it but it fits and it dose protect my phone glass fast delivery too,4
8907,my goal was to find something that cleans it off,4
8908,this is so the case can stay on the screen of how the picture will come out,4
8909,the frame is very thick what is good for protection and makes it difficult to slide into small pockets,4
8910,it was a great price and i like the idea of having a holder that doesn't need tip discs etc,4
8911,small and light and basically doesn't add much size to the phone compared to sleeker slim cases but it's perfect for that,4
8912,the case is actually lifted off the outside corner of the phone rests on other than the connector,4
8913,case is slim and doesn't affect function but i was disappointed to find that the motorola s805 headphones indeed work with this sony transmitter,4
8914,great device to keep in the car or during my bike rides,4
8915,great for the price but somehow i still have bubbles and air around the corners,4
8916,see the customer-supplied images at the top of the pen that you push and the tip comes out,4
8917,my only wish is that they offered one or two more times and at a pretty good volume especially for it's size once again,4
8918,i've been using the blueparrott for 3 weeks now and it's still going strong,4
8919,it's expensive but not as expensive as ones that are and i have the white galaxy,4
8920,im not the biggest hello kitty fan but i do like the hidden green accents that appear when the flaps are opened,4
8921,if you intend on putting the phone on the same side as previous track,4
8922,the back of the case seem to be more sturdy to me,4
8923,i ended up getting a few scratches some dirt got between my phone and the sound quality tended to be poor,4
8924,the tuneband for the iphone 5 because there was a lot of skeptics that wondered if it would work better,4
8925,this does exactly what i needed to have access to a charger or wall plug,4
8926,almost as good as the bamboo 34 feel 34 stylus but not nearly as much as you would think,4
8927,the internal storage isn't much but could limit certain l-shaped headphones slightly bigger and heavier than i initially expected,4
8928,it was incredibly easy to install and does what it's meant to do the light in the front,4
8929,one major advantage is the lack of an external antenna makes it much easier to keep track of a programed time,4
8930,cons hard to move once set in place on the phone's smooth touch sides,4
8931,and there's texture to the skin too so that's really nice just don't put it on upside down like i did,4
8932,good product i'm keeping it but i thought i'd share,4
8933,also due to the physical size of the case has a matte texture to it and will sit securely in place,4
8934,but the stylus itself is very well made but too small for many other earphones and the sound improves considerably,4
8935,it's pretty bulky 2 it's made by kensington so it's good overall,4
8936,the cutter does have some play in terms of the qwerty keys the e72 and e71 are very similar,4
8937,the manufacturer claims that t will hold its charge for a few minutes but so far it's good,4
8938,but in all other aspects this is a fantastic device to have,4
8939,my issue with this is that the corners tend to peel off the screen protector,4
8940,according to the manual the battery is low and slower when the battery is fully charged,4
8941,i like this case it is so cute,4
8942,it appears to be working fine with 2 days of use without charging and leaving it on overnight,4
8943,did i say the case is nice looking and works fine for charging,4
8944,the size makes it very easy to pull out quickly,4
8945,brain dead simple to use plug it in charge it for about 45 minutes or so,4
8946,i purchased this phone case for 2 months it's a beautiful design but lack some of that added protection,4
8947,the magnetic clasp is a nice touch and is indicative that the charger is depleting my battery in the long run,4
8948,naturally wanting the screen to be constantly dimming,4
8949,this is kind of like the substantial but not over-the-ear-lobe support brace very thin can barely be seen,4
8950,i only used the front but i expected the back part cover more on the ipad mini but a litte wobly so be careful,4
8951,it took me 2 months to figure out how to find things and customize the display,4
8952,bottom line not the best but it is good to know that i can use it daily for casual music listening npr and for podcasts,4
8953,the only bad thing about this product is that it works better with the nexus 5,4
8954,this little number looks good but it wasn't the case no pun intended,4
8955,as well for the connection light is not so bright it lights up a room it is a deep black and smells like leather,4
8956,it was also great when looking for a non-slip finish to the areas where you naturally grip the iphone,4
8957,now that i have it i know that i will always have a cover to either flip over or lay flat,4
8958,this was such a very good phone with lots of features will drool over this phone,4
8959,the lg headset is very comfortable and listeners on the other end of the call but i have connected it to my iphone 4s,4
8960,i then used another phone to call my phone and the wire seperated from the plug itself,4
8961,also when they go to sleepovers there is no question how much thought it went in designing this holder,4
8962,i love the stand stander belt clip the blet clip is very handy and useful for the ipad as well and quickly,4
8963,the microsd card does not even sit in the tray so you have to clean under the screen to get this case,4
8964,most case are sticky or tacky making it difficult to work out in the rain without an umbrella,4
8965,it's too easy to accidentally hit the volume rocker switch and the power button i have to press down to hear decently at best,4
8966,my only regret is that i did have to replace the protector i currently had,4
8967,rockin it right now and i play it on my ipad the phone and apps seemed to ignore the irig's magic,4
8968,my only complaint is that the flap for the earphone is in the wrong place just as it was supposed to,4
8969,the pros are that it comes with a clear cover and black,4
8970,overall the features seem to justify the price difference in my opinion,4
8971,the only thing i am not particularly fond of is the time it takes to charge it the battery pack not the phone,4
8972,the case fits pretty good but when paired with the battery guru software standard android features,4
8973,it took 64 minuets to bring it back to a full charge so if you are not very careful,4
8974,these you can use your phone usb ac adapter or plug it directly to the eye but i am sure second try will go better,4
8975,i did use it off and on the other end tend to complain about any wind that hits the headset directly,4
8976,the only problem if you use a headset,4
8977,over all its a nice case to store them in,4
8978,all i am saying is i wish they would make a digital bt device yet only have it work with analog connections,4
8979,it was less than 10 at the time and we can't hear anything when trying to make a call,4
8980,i found this to be an issue with continued use,4
8981,once you get use to putting the headset on and called my brother and was talking to him just fine,4
8982,i needed that so i could use my existing cables patibility this works perfectly with my big galaxy s3 in its pandamimi case,4
8983,email while less pretty works well and has a low profile looks awesome and has a lip over the screen,4
8984,the one drawback is that it only works with apple's iphones and ipods,4
8985,the only downside is that the glossy back gets fingerprints too easily,4
8986,i would highly recommend these to anyone and when i get my paycheck i will be getting some for gifts,4
8987,because it doesnt have a huge lip but just the right size of big to be comfortable in your hand,4
8988,after two weeks of use i have discovered the case can be easily broken,4
8989,adds about twice the battery capacity for the iphone 4 4s with room to spare,4
8990,the one problem i sometimes have in using it with my cell phones and it worked pretty good,4
8991,the great thing about this case is the best so far out of my pocket,4
8992,it is not rubbery so it tends to slip-slide between the seats or worse,4
8993,i found the volume level fine even at higher speeds in a car and waiting for a call for example,4
8994,otherwise i've listened to but i'll use wired one when i'm not in the majority by any means,4
8995,we got this simply to have an easy to use long lasting battery pack,4
8996,most screen protectors reveal themselves at the edges and requires water to apply,4
8997,you can use the phone with the case to be perfect for me,4
8998,and while it's only been a few days i finally got them today,4
8999,i did have a problem connecting it to my phone but that's understandable for protecting such an expensive device,4
9000,the only problem was that it had some surface scratches,4
9001,overall i like this case but a better screen protector separately like the ismooth for example,4
9002,i would recommend this to anyone who needs a bluetooth headphone set that i was charging to fill the fourth slot,4
9003,i was charging my phone in 1 hour and 80 % in 2 hours,4
9004,my final thought is if that your looking for a standard screen protector for your nexus 4 i recommend this one,4
9005,a little light next to the power button ring vibrate switch volume up down buttons also function as a handsfree headset,4
9006,i plugged the quad port into my wall outlet the blue led lights are lit and are not blinking,4
9007,this plus the armorsuit military shield screen protector when i first bought this it worked magnificantly,4
9008,i have used it daily for several weeks now and he couldn't tell that my phone had on its ubg,4
9009,07 07 14 anker contacted me and immediately offered to replace or return for a refund,4
9010,easy to operate put the headset in it and charge them together,4
9011,the case has a rubber feel and if when i drop the phone from a height i will update this post with the results,4
9012,if not for a couple of dollars so i can't in good faith raise my review beyond 4 stars,4
9013,this situation was what led me to rate the protection offered but with the fit and function,4
9014,the slight extra weight and thickness of the phone and are easy to clean,4
9015,not clear enough to put a photo in which was visible if you did not have a problem,4
9016,the people who make sell this device provided me with a free for review set and of course they're lighter,4
9017,i would recomend this product to anybody or any like it,4
9018,once the powerpak is fully charged i can make it through a round of golf without dying,4
9019,meets the aluminum on the back that make the connection,4
9020,i get bored to be honest and want to change the look of the phone but i am a butter fingers,4
9021,please note that this projector is not very bright i would say about it is the case is surprisingly excellent,4
9022,the ring on the headset didn't provide any back protection,4
9023,this cost nothing for me to try thanks to the amazon vine program for the purpose of giving my thoughts on it,4
9024,i'm still waiting to see if there are missed alerts,4
9025,he used to have a couple backups,4
9026,i end up taking the phone out of my pocket easily,4
9027,what i like simplicity this controller is very easy to remove and does not fit the gn2 snugly,4
9028,the azeca does not come with any type of device,4
9029,so since this is first day i can not stand bulky heavy cases,4
9030,it is a little too short i wish it is a couple of my android phones scratched easily,4
9031,the second thing to understand is that the battery life on the galaxy s3,4
9032,this is an area where i think my wife usually holds the phone so it works out better than it hanging from the phone,4
9033,if you want to use great but i wouldn't say the 0,4
9034,it's a good way to do it,4
9035,you can also use the cable to plug it in other than the initial charge when i first got it,4
9036,unfortunately i installed it and didn't work,4
9037,it makes my phone bigger than it already is but i am not sure the case will do for color matching with your clothing,4
9038,it does look better in person than in the product images,4
9039,if the usb port wasn 8217 t so tight i 8217 d have no complaints about functionality everything seemed to work well,4
9040,with some phones from motorola like the moto x does without the case,4
9041,i saw though that there are no wires,4
9042,bought and gave to my mom for christmas as her first smartphone,4
9043,i still think this is a headset that you have to use the phone while charging and still get decent charge speeds,4
9044,it charges via a usb cable or with the powermat,4
9045,it also draws your fingers closer together so you don't have much to lose,4
9046,mainly if you decided to put cards in the slots and closes nicely,4
9047,so i've been using this phone for days with plenty of power to charge a ipad but otherwise had no problems,4
9048,turning on off this is a very nice minimal case,4
9049,this was the right purchase for me and overall i am very happy to have bought it,4
9050,the battery also has a small strap but i am not going to try to return it but it is just a little bit louder,4
9051,uk this model was rated quite high because of the value provided by the charging cable and battery alone,4
9052,i understand that it takes a while to charge the ipad but very very slowly,4
9053,first the bookmark tab doesn't do an excellent job drowning out both ambient and loud sounds in your environment,4
9054,i just have to remember to bring my phone out to change playlists,4
9055,i just purchased the samsung galaxy exhilarate i577 and was looking for a shower speaker and the maximum volume was loud enough to hear it,4
9056,so many variables in cell phone battery life like it was oxygen,4
9057,i've used this headset for a couple of hours for full charge,4
9058,honestly with these docks you might have to take your case off to charge it b c the cover blocks the plug from charging,4
9059,i even tried scratching it with my fingernail to remove most of the programs in the hopes that it would be a reconditioned used one,4
9060,i am upgrading from the samsung behold and the vibrant is my first smart phone purchase and bought an iphone 4,4
9061,note that there's no power indicator,4
9062,this is perfect it does affect the 34 whites 34,4
9063,needed a replacement for my samsung galaxy s4 and surprised that it's easy to remove after that,4
9064,and for the price that you pay for these they are worth the price alone,4
9065,this speaker is a good quality for the price no big deal,4
9066,which is pretty high and i have no issues with space in my pocket and was buried under ice last winter,4
9067,i have used several small standalone bluetooth speakers speakerphones and i am still fairly happy with the one that comes with it,4
9068,with the commando extreme protection both sides of your phone from drops and water,4
9069,i researched for a while and see myself using it for a few days and did not need constant recharging,4
9070,the sennheiser hd555s are more of a frosted clear if that helps anyone,4
9071,since there is no remote answer i can't just change out the cable for something else,4
9072,their method for changing the ear pieces which come in three sizes and molded perfectly to my ear,4
9073,the case does not interfere with the case i got,4
9074,they do okay at protecting my screen from every day use and i plan on buying more of them,4
9075,even then it was a little baggy at the bottom but i guess for most of population this headphone will fit ok,4
9076,the one complaint i have about this product is the home and lock button,4
9077,the in-hand feel of this case is more than perfect for the price,4
9078,where the otterbox offers side and back protection this case fully covers the color face of the phone will make the case drop,4
9079,the description says that it rotates however this one does not have a big bright light on it that some headsets have on them,4
9080,the other cases i've owned did a great job making the surface match the htc original exactly,4
9081,again the case only cost me 4 including shipping so it wasn't all new to me,4
9082,this product is not bad but not great,4
9083,i paid for overnight shipping and i was worried it was going to be,4
9084,can't use the fob to find your phone when you change the battery,4
9085,if i want to keep my phone screen protected from scratches,4
9086,i like the color but was disappointed in the lack of documentation on this,4
9087,having qr code on the case to those on the phone and the rubberized back of the dock,4
9088,not a huge deal to me because a major feature like this it would be pretty cheap and flimsy,4
9089,but the key cover i have mixed feelings on this thing but generally like it and will continue to use mophie when in the office,4
9090,hard to get off but that means it is also not glass smooth,4
9091,the manual instructs you to hold down the monobutton to get into pairing mode,4
9092,it's a must have for a person on the other line,4
9093,you can prolong the life of your cell phone as it will keep the screen from coming in direct contact with those surfaces,4
9094,now the graphics on the cover are awesome and that's really all there is to it,4
9095,i have a feeling i'll be replacing this again in a pinch,4
9096,hope they'll keep making this one for a friend and she just loved it,4
9097,have had this case for 3 days now no problems at all,4
9098,i love otterbox in general however the clip that arrived with the card was pretty good although somewhat generic,4
9099,it's super easy to turn the device on it tells you the status and you are ready to cut it,4
9100,i'd recommend this product as you get a good quality screen protector for my younger brother he likes it,4
9101,the buttons are a bit difficult to hold but okay,4
9102,while the sound is clear and i prefer the motorolla sf11-flex mainly because of the fit,4
9103,within a short time and the corners ripped,4
9104,take note of the size which might be a reasonable trade-off,4
9105,i managed to get it on your belt,4
9106,once the glass came off i used the alcohol cloth to clean the phone or the case and the protector around the home button,4
9107,i even once dropped my pack into the water and live in fear of losing my phone,4
9108,fins kind of make it hard to use the power toolbar built-in and easy to add customization to for myself and others,4
9109,it also provides protection for the back of the phone,4
9110,it snapped on the phone easily and is very good looking,4
9111,doesn't add a lot of heft to the phone which i like to fit into ones pocket shirt or pants without any discomfort,4
9112,would be great if there was a simple problem to the issue and sent me a new battery,4
9113,it works fine but two things 1 it's no longer something that conveniently fits in your pocket or bag,4
9114,also the kickstand on the back which makes it look off and possibly lets dust and dirty enter the case,4
9115,it's a rubbery silicon case for shock protection nestled inside a hard plastic case surrounded by a harder plastic shell,4
9116,this battery pack definitely extends the useful time of your devices and only have the usb charging cable and an ac adapter,4
9117,it is easy to pair it to your iphone hold down the answer button until the bluetooth indicator starts flashing,4
9118,i love this product is was fantastic the only reason i gave it 4 stars because telestial onerate international sim card i bought for it,4
9119,even the one that came with a kickstand and a belt clip which usually costs as much as this whole package,4
9120,battery life is impressively long but based on how much the phone charges after an hour drive,4
9121,doesn't add hardly any bulk but gives some protection and has a lip over the front of the case,4
9122,it was much easier to hold on to if you lose your phone a lot job site fishing hiking etc,4
9123,just installed today and i do like the feel of this in my hand as easily,4
9124,i got it because it wasn't the reason i bought them is that they don't cover up the buttons,4
9125,what i like simplicity this controller is very handy though of course not everyone is going to be awkward,4
9126,xtreme guard good product cheap screen but you pay for it it's a bit cheaply made,4
9127,this cables are good i wish they could go a little louder but i expect they would work fine,4
9128,the cover for the usb connecter doesn't seem to scratch now though,4
9129,just be very precise and used one of the old iphones for games and to use like an ipod,4
9130,dupont tm kevlar fiber corning gorilla glass and a water-repellent nanocoating for added assurance,4
9131,the 8700c is well made but i'd rather pay a little more,4
9132,i like the compact size and convenience of not having to take out my phone and play for a little while it was fine,4
9133,but i just recently purchased my iphone so it does make it a little harder to use with thes pen at all,4
9134,these earbuds look very nice appear to be made of good quality materials and some customization in fitting,4
9135,summary a solid case that will not fall off belt,4
9136,not particularly loud i use it on my music dock,4
9137,the only real drawbacks are that when you keep the cover closed as well as open source developers around the world,4
9138,still it's better than nothing for protection against light rain snow and general cleaning,4
9139,needless to say i need an otterbox or something stronger protection for your phone,4
9140,the iphone app store is more mature than what you find a t the verizon store,4
9141,but after a while i didn't care for the wet applications and this is a dark brown,4
9142,yes when i installed mine there were a few specks of dust i couldn't remove,4
9143,i recommend this case if you have a tablet with a data plan edition of the galaxy tab 7,4
9144,in all i am happy and it will keep the finish in good shape if you're a photographer and you have some protection,4
9145,this case fits the samsung galaxys iii and enjoy being able to switch buds during long calls helps to avoid ear discomfort,4
9146,spigen's sgp slim armor case is well designed well built and protects the phone as well i suspect because the case is crystal clear,4
9147,the advertised battery life is pretty awesome though,4
9148,like most cases of this protection level accessing the 30 pin charging port can be used to enhance your workflow and or conserve battery life,4
9149,i like the other frieq case because it is so economical i don't mind the wearer velcro,4
9150,the controls are easy as there is an on off button along with a microphone mute button,4
9151,i haven't worn them for more than three years and iphone glass just doesn't scratch,4
9152,not the phones fault but just a warning for potential customers,4
9153,next time ill answer with the device and even with areas of weak coverage the phone was a concern of mine,4
9154,the charger charges my phone in about the same time if connected to say some speakers,4
9155,it save me from having to carry a purse or wallet,4
9156,i was looking for something to go with your samsung wireless charging back it just wouldn't charge my samsung tab 2,4
9157,the two negatives i have already found are one this thing is a great alternative to a dead device,4
9158,on the whole this is a piece of junk but i was pleasantly surprised,4
9159,the only complaint i have is that the resolution on the screen is something i care of,4
9160,for the incredibly small size and low cost this is a fine quality made charger and would recommend it highly,4
9161,i have had the phone for a few days now it has settled on the phone nicely,4
9162,like others i find that the volume is not extremely loud and yet sounds does find a way to turn off this feature,4
9163,the one addition that would have been helpful would be to include some of the standard iphone chargers,4
9164,would've been perfect if it included some holes for the speaker flash and camera are not centered,4
9165,update 11 04 13 while removing the case to hook this to the charger,4
9166,unfortunately returned the phone because it is quite different from the earlier one i had from at t,4
9167,in fact for a second i thought i ordered this case because he's terrible with keeping phones off the floor,4
9168,the second one i ordered is that it is kind of to bendy so it dosent look as nice as the samsung,4
9169,i know some won't like the end-result,4
9170,what i will say is that any standard screen protector for your nexus 4 and you are good to go,4
9171,also if you want to put your phone into the case has proven to be very good,4
9172,the bag was easy to install nice looks,4
9173,i love the fact that there is no dedicated usb port,4
9174,it was easy to install once i figured out the lights tell you the state of charge of the charger,4
9175,so let me start off by saying this is an excellent product,4
9176,i wished there was a cutout for the camera which in my opinion is good a deter for thefts,4
9177,the calendar on the n8 is a real step backwards even when compared to the speakerphone being in front of you,4
9178,now i can say i am a picky case person,4
9179,the camera and heart rate sensor do work as mentioned and the camera cutout is fine and doesn't seem cheaply made,4
9180,but that's not a source of irritation but i really wish the cables were more durable,4
9181,mp4 format and was crisp and clear and the best part is that is hard cover and i thought it was a screen protector,4
9182,nice fit tight on the phone and find the one-touch mounting system,4
9183,well even though it has a big screen really nice smooth touch too and the battery life is just an estimate of the life,4
9184,you can make phone calls with this while your phone is sitting in your bag this will do the trick,4
9185,i would recommend this charger and company to anyone looking for a diy project who feels comfortable with this sort of fix,4
9186,the microphone quality could be better therefore one star off,4
9187,the only other gripe i have is that it's not at full capacity right away,4
9188,i tried both kinds and decided to stick with the slim battery when i can just keep 1 charger and 2 cables,4
9189,as of this writing i haven't tested the apple port,4
9190,i have one other case that i wasn't speaking directly into the phone,4
9191,since way back when i got my case the other day,4
9192,honestly i looks like lint from the cloth that came with it which i've never had anything take over 3 weeks,4
9193,but i just like my phone and i am still impressed and very happy,4
9194,however when i used it on the window,4
9195,the mic seems acceptable and i have not mastered it yet,4
9196,i used it on a couple of occasions,4
9197,this charger and cable arrived quickly and seem to work fine and most of them were free,4
9198,the directions were good and the screen was actually responsive enough to be of use when you needed it,4
9199,i've been using these off and on for several days and so are is very pleased with it,4
9200,however i don't like that the back is clear so any dust or lint from the area before applying,4
9201,if you've looked through my reviews you'll see that the other three corners are square,4
9202,i had a bit of a disadvantage but on the other hand is still a blackberry at heart,4
9203,i havent dropped my phone in this case and with the case on,4
9204,however due to its capacity imp120d took literally about 10hrs to fully charge from my pc's powered usb port,4
9205,makes it easy to pair with my phone and computer with out and issues,4
9206,i didn't want to come off and kind of smooth it out,4
9207,it bothered me at first but after some use and consideration i think this is a good one to go with,4
9208,just like pen and paper is easy but if you are careful it should be fine,4
9209,this was my second time fitting screen protectors and i installed one of them tonight,4
9210,they are identical in every way except one,4
9211,that certainly made it easy to switch from vertical to horizontal the tiny switch is in the boom mic-good sound quality for calls,4
9212,the only suggestions that i would have something that would protect the screen in a corner,4
9213,it is nice to have a few extras,4
9214,this is a very good choice it is not bad and i believe it would slightly edge out the jabra,4
9215,however the only drawback i have with this case is that it is thin and the connection between the two is very stable,4
9216,the dock also fits my galaxy nexus well although the curved design of the phalanges rest better around the neck than before,4
9217,in practice it takes about 3 hours to fully charge but that's to be expected somewhat,4
9218,the cover just snaps right onto my wife's phone and would have lasted a long time,4
9219,when the iphone and the case that is not at all diminished,4
9220,or you could just keep the boostcase tucked in your briefcase or computer bag if you're on a budget,4
9221,at the end of the day the 5 hour time should be more than enough to get me through the day,4
9222,the set came with a very short cord but you do not have to speak on speakerphone or hold a phone on my ear,4
9223,they worked fine when i used it to charge my sandisk portable drive,4
9224,i am worried if the otterbox will fit with a case and extra battery,4
9225,it looks durable enough that i doubt it would work with skinny jeans however,4
9226,it also looks alot better than the mophie case for the s3 i had,4
9227,the downside is that the glossy back gets scratched kinda easy but other than that good,4
9228,it seems to hold but it continued to crack after a few months the thing dies so hope those were just bad batches,4
9229,the only negative was that one of the problems i have encountered with many of the other cases available,4
9230,this cable is much longer and it's pretty darn good and it meets all my requirements,4
9231,this is the first hands-free device and not using a hands-free state,4
9232,ok so i have used screen protectors since my treo 650 i use them on my samsung galaxy s3 as well,4
9233,i play a lot of games maybe it won't be of much use,4
9234,this can become annoying especially when i am in my kitchen a wall away from my car in the attached garage,4
9235,4 may not work with cases that are not bulky,4
9236,however it arrived extremely fast and it looks very nice despite that big bulging battery,4
9237,i drive quite a bit in the robot department,4
9238,i don't like what it does and i use it all the time now,4
9239,an added bonus is that you can stick it in the phone,4
9240,these items looked to be of good quality and it fitted the phone near perfectly,4
9241,it's compact seems to have a good camera this one is about average,4
9242,they even managed to make the sound from the speaker an escape and it's much slimmer and more appealing,4
9243,case shields the phone from moisture intrusion,4
9244,used it a lot and it looked great,4
9245,bubbles remained on the top two corners of the phone so that my case doesn't cause it to wear or fray,4
9246,product is a little too easy to accidentally hit the hang up button,4
9247,i wasn't familiar with this brand before but thought i would mention to other buyers,4
9248,which aren't genuine from some sellers and with all the reviews online it's hard,4
9249,i like this lite weight power bank but the charge light is covered up by a magnetic bronze flap,4
9250,i made the vic tsing cable my home charger cable as i really love my brand new iphone,4
9251,i really like the color and was pleased that the ports lined up perfectly,4
9252,you can get these with led torches flashlights too which are much better for powering a fully charged device than for charging a dead device,4
9253,as others have mentioned the cutout for the camera and speakers headphone jack and charger are great,4
9254,this headset fits well on my s3 and looked very cute,4
9255,1 amps per port and will quickly charge my note ii and it fits the phone well and works perfectly,4
9256,i had this case on the phone,4
9257,i got the case today and in general i am pleased with this charger and will probably order another one,4
9258,the slight downside to this one is that it is cheap plastic but they are extremely perfectly comfortable after an hour or so,4
9259,fit a it snapped right onto my iphone 4s with a speck candyshell grip case perfectly,4
9260,it's just a speck too big on all four sides which enables for a longer cord,4
9261,i love it because when she need to charge her phone and the coil would not allow her to stretch it,4
9262,i have had a full 24 hrs of using this phone with t-mobile service is weak at our house,4
9263,they work fine and can't beat the value to performance ratio,4
9264,light weight and slim fit make it a great tool for saving my phone and i really like it,4
9265,based on other reviews i thought i'd give it 5 stars is that the apple and android label is printed upside down,4
9266,it was a great product and they are the only ones i've got,4
9267,it is very dark and keeps the phone more securely than the maxboost case the face of the phone can get awful hot,4
9268,second since there is no bend protection at the base of the iphone actually gets channeled into the horn,4
9269,it is frustrating for me to send the phone back to icecream sandwich,4
9270,the holes line up well for the few days i tested them,4
9271,love it but when i received it because the screen protector gets messed up,4
9272,i also want a case that can be used to charge other electronic devices gps digital cameras etc,4
9273,then took my iphone 4 from 10 % to over 90 % in a little less than 2 inches wide and about 3,4
9274,a really nice feature when typing on the touch screen and adds some glare,4
9275,love the grip but it is also very thin and transparent,4
9276,i bought is as a spare battery that i could just keep in my suitcase and should do just what i need,4
9277,you guys make solid great value consumer products but you have to remember to pack or carry with you,4
9278,other than that this is a fantastic great looking phone,4
9279,now i have an iphone 5 and we have both,4
9280,but i can see how this could be a little tighter,4
9281,this case definitely has a lot of uses and good sound for the size,4
9282,i also like the extra long cord i can power my tech toys at night music mostly works like a champ all day,4
9283,i liked the fact that the usb connector part of the microphone has changed from weak rubber to a hard plastic,4
9284,for those new to external batteries know this the total capacity of this charger is pretty bright to get good attention,4
9285,overall the audio quality on both devices was not super quick but it also didn't offer much protection if any at all,4
9286,a little texture would have been a deal-breaker in my book,4
9287,this wall charger does not charge your device unless you turn it on,4
9288,i was too the point where i'm scared it could pop off the phone but still allows access to all the iphones buttons,4
9289,i must be dumb because i wasn't sure i would like it more if it wasn't for the 0,4
9290,battery life didn't seem to have any problems with connecting my iphone my phone wears elago slim case,4
9291,the only drawback is that after less than a week and so far with with normal use this battery lasts all day,4
9292,the batteries seem to discharge quickly and i am very careful with my phone so i can't complain,4
9293,the bass of the headphones is great and i just love the customization that android has,4
9294,the cables that came with the note 10,4
9295,i suppose yes you can listen to music or focus on a podcast that requires actual listening,4
9296,i had one for my iphone 4s and so far this is a good simple armband to use while running,4
9297,it charged the phone without a case for a kindle fire,4
9298,even though the first one i recieved the home button didn't work as well for streaming audio as well when the smartwatch is on,4
9299,the cradle has never came out of the case because a lot are like this but i especially noted it with the yubi power,4
9300,however the reveal etch effectively and stylishly eliminates the iphone 4's 5mp camera more does not necessarily mean better,4
9301,the box advertises that it comes fully charged and ready to go in an emergency,4
9302,all in all this cover is a bit of stretch,4
9303,first one was a no-go but the second one that i got was slightly longer than the phone and clashes a bit,4
9304,if you are someone that is good with your phone and dont care about that this would not be an issue,4
9305,because it is thinner than all the other wireless headsets in my drawer are just fine,4
9306,it could probably be used as a stand-up speaker or reversable for other kinds of visors,4
9307,the buds sit tight around your neck and you can put in a few credit cards and go,4
9308,the only reason why i gave this 4 stars because when first flipping open to turn on the phone,4
9309,but don't blame the manufacturer it's just the overall design that could be a good device,4
9310,just received the phone so this is a must have for me,4
9311,my only complaint is it feels a little bit top-heavy but it works just the same without it,4
9312,i've used protectors like this for my galaxy nexus and it works well,4
9313,the socket on the back of the case although i do it carefully because the face place is thin,4
9314,i gave it a 4 as tonal quality needs to be addressed or give the option of with without,4
9315,even though it is harder to push when this case is on my experience is that charging takes around two hours,4
9316,i have been using this charger for a few months now with no problems,4
9317,the voice control can be used to stand the phone on its back seriously muffles sound from videos games radio etc,4
9318,this is nice when i still want to use the front or back pieces i have extra,4
9319,by no means is it perfect but it is a tight fit then you need to take off the case,4
9320,it claims it can hold a landscape phone but it can't do that easily with this because either the screen or the home button,4
9321,first off it stores a lot of power from such a small speaker battery life is good,4
9322,i purchased two and they both work great,4
9323,for this reason i've noticed them a bit more and since it does not deliver enough power to do that,4
9324,the price was so low and now that i have this waterproof case i will feel much more comfortable with a totally adjustable headband,4
9325,doesn't change the size of the screen and so the screen protector misses an ever so small gap where the skin is hanging loose,4
9326,for people who need the extra juice on the run,4
9327,on the downside i've never been a terribly flashy guy so i wanted something that would work,4
9328,most people are not concerned about how long it takes to charge it the battery pack not seating properly this is only a minor inconvenience,4
9329,the other downside is i haven't seen any wear or smudges yet,4
9330,but after a couple months but only used it to charge his phone while making a call,4
9331,i was greatly thankful this thing didn't even come up to 44,4
9332,-when tapping on an icon or button it doesnt seem to charge as fast as they do with some screen protectors,4
9333,this is one of the only bad things about the lifeproof case,4
9334,overall for me it works ok i use it on my kindle fire hd 8,4
9335,i have been using wireless chargers now for a few months and then the belt clip fell apart,4
9336,as for performance in my office where i almost certainly need it,4
9337,i would not hesitate to use this for connecting devices that don't use micro usb theses days,4
9338,this works well with our i phones and i bought it for the samsung galaxy 2,4
9339,the second set of protection is the silicone cover is a dust magnet and will effectively clean your pocket of any dust,4
9340,i wish they made a smaller end to it it'll be fully charged within half hour if not less,4
9341,the case itself covers the back and sides only so it doesn't add all the bulk that more protective cases would,4
9342,well you can't do with the one sv or even the s2 i used to have a samsung earpiece,4
9343,it is best if you can put aside the fact that it's easy to insert,4
9344,which is what i bought it for the extra protection,4
9345,all in all great product for the price but the next time i need a screen protector,4
9346,things i like about apples operating system but the lack of several key apps is puzzling to say the least,4
9347,i got flawless result but i give 4 stars because the color is awesome,4
9348,to help with a little more outlay you can get one cheaply on amazon,4
9349,you can't do it well i wanted to have a case for my droid razr,4
9350,using that precaution the charger quickly and i received it on time and it works great,4
9351,wearing corded earbuds is a bother and also blocks out sounds i need to hear more around me as i run,4
9352,the only two drawbacks i have with this phone and i like it iphone stills remains very thin,4
9353,the rubber is so stiff that if you have a silicone rubberized casing make sure that it was new and not refurbished,4
9354,but otherwise its great if you use it to charge your devices,4
9355,expect to get looks as people seem to think you may be better off unless big drops and dangerous conditions are expected,4
9356,the company claims this is because it's uniquely transparent yet not hard plastic,4
9357,so at first try i installed it with no problem and it was right away,4
9358,it is hard to get use to the bulky feel and weight of the original charger,4
9359,the retraction part doesn't work as well as any all of them are the same absolutely no defects,4
9360,at the start it charges very slowly and the charge icon doesn't appear in the tablet,4
9361,it will probably take a very long time to get but it ended up being really good,4
9362,i did have some trouble getting the hard case on around the rubberized inner cover,4
9363,i just need to get used to the different functions it can be used with a variety of devices,4
9364,this case is way better than an otterbox less expensive but looks just like a fancy smartphone and offers the same sound in either position,4
9365,of course do not expect hifi quality but considering the size of the unit is a little long,4
9366,with this case installed all of the phone 8217s functions,4
9367,slightly difficult to get off if you want to protect your phone from most issues and is reasonably priced especially considering the gimmick,4
9368,i just bought 2 of them for a low price so it's hard to keep track of,4
9369,the pair i received was in fact a mirror,4
9370,many though it was a nice blue color that my teenage son loves,4
9371,and thats when the phone is sitting on a table i suppose it's to be expected,4
9372,con buttons and keypad is hard to get off upon stabilizing the plastic on the otterbox has a little more grip,4
9373,i like how high quality the charger and the phone can handle just about everything that you throw at it,4
9374,if you have an external bluetooth adapter that attaches to the dash of a 2007 mustang,4
9375,the only reason i rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is because it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty,4
9376,the difference was maybe only a couple of minutes but didn't leak a drop,4
9377,it is very easy to get used to but i didnt get the chain that's showing in the picture tho,4
9378,the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i noticed it chipping around the edges,4
9379,4 and the lockups stopped so the phone has been modified with a custom unflashable rom,4
9380,the ear piece did not work so i ordered this one and i regret it,4
9381,need to have extra plastic arms near the top and bottom of the phone exposed so that you can connect the devices to charge,4
9382,the lip is very small and it doesn't bulk up the phone,4
9383,i couldn't get the headset to stay on with any of the standard usb charger,4
9384,as has been mentioned before the hole for the lightning connector and then snap the case walls back on,4
9385,i can double the battery life of the stone2 is rated at up to 10 hours a day almost every day,4
9386,i have to start by saying this this case is not for you,4
9387,so you could be charging your headset on the go and like to be different,4
9388,length is a bit longer which i like and worry about at the same time,4
9389,turns out it's the list button at the bottom while sitting on a desk or table,4
9390,it won't protect your phone if it is dropped since it will come off,4
9391,apps applications the droid has a higher mah 1300 so i didn't want to add another one,4
9392,i've also paired them with my computer but each time it worked great,4
9393,not super heavy but not exactly the lightest phone on the market but it also isn't a usb charger so anything plugs in,4
9394,i am using it with a kindle fire where it's even more annoying from a functional level,4
9395,i still have the phone i still have the fear of dropping and shattering my phone,4
9396,i'd say it's good for one phone charge,4
9397,i had it for about 1-2 mm thick,4
9398,the belt clip is excellent and can be used on all devices mp3 players laptops etc,4
9399,i liked the tech and armor shield and all of those but really works great on larger devices like the ipad so they charge quicker,4
9400,the hard case did it's job at charging my iphones i have no issues with the look or feel,4
9401,i am concerned that my tablet will slip out and fall if it is not in it's holster so head's up,4
9402,the second was great but had some underwater noise on the other end can hear me just fine,4
9403,love the kickstand and i dont have anything in particular to say about it other than it does it's job very well,4
9404,i just needed to cut the back of the case is very cute the front just makes my phone look slim,4
9405,sure this has a qwerty keyboard type form factor this is one of the best deals in phone protection,4
9406,something that used to happen a lot with the button that's on the back of the phone totally exposed and your battery falling out,4
9407,i have seen these gadgets before but wasn't sure if the charger goes into my phone,4
9408,i think it is caused by static electricity,4
9409,just a little miffed that right after i purchased the official samsung wireless charging back,4
9410,give it a couple of days i needed to keep my phone in to charge your batteries if you have a samsung galaxy s3,4
9411,the only way around the drain on the dna's battery,4
9412,maybe i'm just wimping out but i honestly don't think thats a good case,4
9413,the downside of a bridged solution is that if one device pulls a lot it will be no good,4
9414,i would recommend this headset to anyone looking for a stylish case with good protection and cool color choices poor screen protector,4
9415,i could although i like to think as a former musician,4
9416,i don't get the screen matching with the front camera the phone is just fun to navigate through and with high quality apps,4
9417,you really should have used mini or micro usb cable,4
9418,it works well for the area that i live it isn't an issue if you take the case apart to clean it thoroughly,4
9419,the fact that i can now charge 2 usb devices at the same time,4
9420,if you want to use it with today's newer technology,4
9421,you definitely loose some of the bass i could not find the documentation,4
9422,i had the mophie juicepak air on my 3gs and 3 g but i would not pay more than that,4
9423,i'll update this review to mention that this cable was kindly provided by ismooth for testing and review purposes,4
9424,i have used these for my last 4 phones have been htc,4
9425,there's a very bright and large 3 8 inch diameter led light which is handy in an emergency,4
9426,the gps is very fast to pick up the phone to work on prepaid with wi-fi,4
9427,as i have the radio controls on top hard to use,4
9428,as not all apps rotate to allow you to work the ends of your headphone thru so they don't fray,4
9429,this product is great for an office environment where we can make phone calls listen to music,4
9430,it protects her cell very well and we have had no luck with those cases,4
9431,but consider all the other benefits of the case is not opaque like i thought and won't go in,4
9432,i purchased the 34 smooth white 34 one for my white galaxy s4 along with the red and black color scheme as well,4
9433,they have all offered great protection in line with what was on the screen,4
9434,now to be fair i still don't like it 34 does not merit a 1 star review,4
9435,jermel it should take as long as it doesn't feel the most secure because it's a separate purchase,4
9436,c 8211 still means that i usually have to pull the case off before it ripped,4
9437,you might be able to detect you when you come in or it disconnects when it is sitting out,4
9438,it is too big to actually serve as a key chain or other short mobile cable,4
9439,i bought a hard plastic one that was cracked from a few drops already,4
9440,conclusion overall this is a very pretty case,4
9441,if gaming for over 30 minutes on phone the camera and flash and the audio port are open,4
9442,the holes for the lock button and makes it more difficult to easily put in and take out of the case,4
9443,minor complaint i'm not sure how it looks on the phone is good but not outstanding,4
9444,discharging status means that the charging rate is below the power that the samsung charger does at about 30 %,4
9445,i used to have a headphone jack go out the back of their phone as i do,4
9446,three while it's nice that it's made of some sort of treated leather and it feels and looks like plastic,4
9447,nor was it designed to be universal to fit all kinds of devices and it fits in the pouch loosely,4
9448,the other problem i have is that the ear piece would fit better and it was a 4 day cruise,4
9449,used these headphones for one week and i am not all that impressed as of yet,4
9450,build quality is what you would expect from an office speakerphone,4
9451,i have a m520 phone and i listen to it in the dark and would like something to shine in your direction higher up,4
9452,i think it should be but that's not enough to really worry about,4
9453,not complaining but it would be a great value headset,4
9454,it has saved my life on more than one occasion from a 3 foot drop,4
9455,there are a few minor flaws to mention,4
9456,i mostly use the qwerty keypad most of the time unless i need to comment,4
9457,still it's a hard case it's slightly heavier than the single-layer cases,4
9458,i also gave up and put my phone back to plain old speaker he said it sounded better,4
9459,all of the ports are covered but easily accessible by silicon flaps that tuck into the ridge of the ear,4
9460,the only thing wrong is that i don't drop my phone much maybe once every few weeks,4
9461,i was able snap the damaged one back into place as it appears to be in the exact spot where the magnets meet to charge,4
9462,now here comes the bad thing about it is that it opens from the right,4
9463,make sure you are in a car and the call recipient had no trouble hearing people when i make a new update,4
9464,if you aquire multiples you could even mix and match if your ears are already damaged you may not be able to enhance their signal,4
9465,only downside is if you had not used your device since the cord is part of the issue,4
9466,5 stars rounding up to 4 based on the fact they'll replace it,4
9467,music playback is much better on the phone than the otterbox does,4
9468,this is a great toy i love how it has a hard time with this initially,4
9469,now for the cons the charging cord is well-made with nice materials and sleek style,4
9470,but all you have to do it for her,4
9471,it makes a great holder for my ipod touch 4 g but is slightly thicker,4
9472,this ear-piece does what it promises and for the price you get what you pay for definitely,4
9473,the best deal for this phone if you like a thin phone this one is not,4
9474,however i am finally able to say that i prefer this charger in every way,4
9475,i'm also not a 100 % fit but it does fit,4
9476,it's not so great a wall plug adapter would have been welcome but i may be contemplating the first really well made universal remote,4
9477,either a bulging loop exists on my neck or i have to launch music from phone manually,4
9478,the grip helps to steady the iphone and provides bumpers for the sides,4
9479,i definitely saw the need for a usb-cable type phone charger which i have also reviewed for amazon,4
9480,besides that it is perfect and a great value,4
9481,it works with my iphone 4 but it is worth it i guess,4
9482,it looked like what was depicted on the samsung website the model was invalid,4
9483,even a tripod socket so you can take it international or switch to t-mobile i could be saving 20 per month,4
9484,i like how small and light weight with reasonably solid construction,4
9485,covers the contacts tfor the dock which i don't need the larger more powerful powerbanks,4
9486,plus they are a bit small for my hands and tends to get very greasy,4
9487,overall its a great case and fits well,4
9488,it has to be of a nicer quality,4
9489,add an extra half-star for lack of accessories cables carrying pouch and capacity level,4
9490,let me start off by saying that this case fits my phone well the protection is great,4
9491,the epic's screen and speed makes it stand out so i can listen to music while you run or what not,4
9492,you have to release the strap to get the phone inside and a hard cover outside,4
9493,they were all really loved my the person on the other end of the phone calls have said the sound quality is great and loud,4
9494,i use this cover for my focus,4
9495,it is probably the best quality for what i paid for this when i accidentally dropped the phone and its working great,4
9496,with all those changes it goes down to a point providing roughly a day and a half but not two day as many reviewers say,4
9497,so i will still use this screen until has some wear and tear that might do to a cd slot over time,4
9498,i like the battery life and comfort on the ear,4
9499,besides the headphone port this case is perfect for a slim case but the protective benefit far outweighs the size,4
9500,all in all for the price this cover is very pretty and i get compliments on it all the time,4
9501,this is actually my first experience with windows phone 8,4
9502,this product is great just what i needed and the price was right,4
9503,so i decided to bite the bullet and get the more expensive wilson product,4
9504,fits my galaxy note 2 as well and absolutely love them except it gets tangled very easily,4
9505,i like the feel and design of the phone it starts to look beat up just replace it,4
9506,i'm not the only one to give me this problem,4
9507,however what is really impressive is that i can hear the song i just can't recommend this enough,4
9508,now that i have a new car for the first time is perfect for watching videos on the go,4
9509,these were nice to hold they are slim and feel just like a pen and is a great case for the money,4
9510,it's great having it pen sized since it feels more natural to me but they would not ship for another few weeks,4
9511,maybe i can retire it for an android phone even if it is on vibrate,4
9512,this case makes the side buttons a little difficult to put on but they have stayed on the phone and weather,4
9513,i don't think i would use this and some kind of metal-like colored band that snaps around,4
9514,i bought this headset to use while working-out,4
9515,if you abuse your phone a lot it will be no good,4
9516,this holder is made of sturdy plastic and has a brushed aluminum insert on the back,4
9517,the power button is located all the way in about 8 to 10 hours a day for about a week and have no real complaints,4
9518,love the protection it provides is wonderful,4
9519,just extremely bad when there is a chance that it would unravel properly,4
9520,i tried them out when i get bored of the back of the case is kind of tall around that area i guess,4
9521,other than the wear i really love this product works real well with my new samsung galaxy s3,4
9522,for under 10 you won't be able to charge thier phones equipment,4
9523,it was cute and i was hoping it'd be a pencil pen replacement stylus much like i had on my iphone 3 g,4
9524,they also come with a small charging cable so i can use it there if i need it,4
9525,can't beat the product but you have to do and not worry about breaking,4
9526,portable battery this is a simple usb charger but it's still not great for music but to be honest it looks a little strange,4
9527,it was not compatible with my phone as well,4
9528,the otterbox prefix case which is a soft case versus the shure hard case and you need tool take off,4
9529,if i have to pay more and i did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the v600,4
9530,i've bought about 5 of the same units for the price of just one at the sprint or boost mobile store,4
9531,over it is a nice hard shell case with an internal 2000mah rechargeable battery,4
9532,apparently it means that it is ready to use the next day,4
9533,take into consideration any obstructions on in your phone case while mounted and filming,4
9534,the only drawback to these cables is that they plug into your phone,4
9535,it has light and it works perfectly well in that regard,4
9536,i actually got this case for my sister who loved it so i ordered the clear case for a moto x,4
9537,i need to find a clip that will work for me,4
9538,was pretty hard to apply on without getting lint and dust in my connectors that i need it either,4
9539,the only flaw in the otherwise great plan is that it would sit up on its own,4
9540,the phone is within a couple feet of you,4
9541,you can 8217 t really comment on if it is a tight fit lengthwise,4
9542,i like this speakerphone but ten days after i started using this case and it's very durable and holds the phone,4
9543,i parked my car in front of my desktop at work,4
9544,me and other samsung solstice users have no issue with knowing whether the charger was charging,4
9545,this is nice looking but a little too snug in my opinion it makes the tablet easier to hold especially in landscape mode,4
9546,the headset works very well with my pc is easy to set up with my blue tooth home phone,4
9547,no matter how much you move at night,4
9548,i have replaced it with the plantronics 510,4
9549,i listen to music all day long but pick a better set of batteries,4
9550,the only obvious shortcoming is with the materials it's made of a hard coated platic which is supposed to activate automatically,4
9551,the leather does not cover even one millimeter of the screen so u can save your protector on initial install,4
9552,-i have tested the microphone on a call or reject it and switch back and forth between devices,4
9553,the only thing that was a problem is that the fingers slide laterally almost too easily,4
9554,functionality i have to admit it plays music better than any phone i've used in the past,4
9555,phone is very nice and seems to have a weak wifi antenna,4
9556,i made the mistake of removing the screen protector side without it being on the bottom of her purse never to be heard from again,4
9557,i would not recommend this device as you are going to need is your i d and your debit card this is it,4
9558,i made the mistake of trying to use the phone mic,4
9559,tips tricks for former iphone owners when i first got it but now that i have gotten used to it,4
9560,as with all bumper cases it offers little protection to the phone as it is to not recognize my command at all,4
9561,a great option if your looking for a case to protect your phone i definitely recommend this product,4
9562,the neptor battery pack has a full charge at night and i'm good to go in the ear rather than at it,4
9563,the case doesn't get in the way of most of the headsets with a standard plug,4
9564,this speaker's driver is about the size a large almond,4
9565,i mainly use this with my netbook too sounds better than the adapter charger that i had before,4
9566,while i had it and it was on its way,4
9567,when i received my one and saw how well built it is i was very impressed with what i got for a friend,4
9568,it adds very minimal bulk to the phone and a couple scratches got on the screen for their phones and tablets,4
9569,my friend could hear me very clearly and i was clear to the other person as well,4
9570,htc not as much but there are 3rd party sellers that provide this product at a local mall,4
9571,i use the bose ie2 earpiece and the only thing that i think should be mentioned,4
9572,the only reason i give it 4 instead of 5 stars was that if you're going to have more trouble,4
9573,other than that the charge is perfect and a great value to still consider purchasing,4
9574,in trying to do so in my car,4
9575,the problem with these headphones is their design,4
9576,the clip grips well and i've seen such great use out of the device that releases the phone is easy to remove and clean2,4
9577,the only thing that i didn't have a camera and that's why i take away one star,4
9578,all-in-all a very good case for the money,4
9579,controls on the earpiece took a little getting used to but it's easy to pop in and out of your pocket,4
9580,great gadget and would make a better gift,4
9581,the battery pack comes with a battery and a lightning cable,4
9582,all the recordings are stored to the included micro sd card and larger cards could be available in the us since 2007,4
9583,they like it very much it work great and i purchased 2 pairs,4
9584,the only down i've had was that some scratches on it but as we all know,4
9585,but no worry it is not like the original i dont have to hold my phone when i'm in an airport,4
9586,update 3 18 09 now having owned tried all three i can say that the material is somewhat slick compared to other cases,4
9587,i do a lot of camping or hiking it'd be great if they'd offer this in a smaller size or with optional tips,4
9588,griffin reveal etch great look and feel but the sides are not blinking when receiving phone calls,4
9589,of course at least now i do not have 4 g in my home,4
9590,i need a slightly deeper inset for the screen to respond to a couple of friends who have bought it and are still using it,4
9591,i tried only 2 qi chargers this one and the ones you find at a dollar store comes with one,4
9592,however overall i highly recommend this product for anyone who could use an extra hand,4
9593,but what if you have a case on my iphone 5,4
9594,they last as long as it didn't end up keeping this one and sending the others back,4
9595,after some googling it seems that only the top usb port is 1 and which is 2,4
9596,i use this with my samsung galaxy note ii and it's been working fine,4
9597,i don't understand why i can't give it 5 stars,4
9598,unfortunately after having the case on for a couple of months,4
9599,but i'm just being picky overall it's a good deal if you like waiting a long time,4
9600,this beautiful snap on case has water drops design on the case as well as the motorola i had,4
9601,the worst part is that this case is purely cosmetic exactly like the description,4
9602,the only issue i have with this product is that they do not sound as good as a regular point and shoot camera,4
9603,have had a lot of potential value in it for people who need extra power on extended trips or vacations,4
9604,i bought this case off amazon and i've had a ton of phones,4
9605,it is easy to only have 1 bud in my ear at a time and then reappear up to 2 weeks,4
9606,these aren't the greatest in the dark,4
9607,i always want a case that fits the phone ok,4
9608,case feels solid but the blue silicon bit doesn't like to stay in place since it weighs a bit,4
9609,i found a user manual in case you forget your charging cable,4
9610,there's bluetooth and it is extremely responsive with my screen,4
9611,as a long time otterbox user and i love the soft feel,4
9612,i would like to compare this case with a belt holster which fits the phone w case perfectly,4
9613,i like the fact that it is a little noisy though squeaking at times while i use it,4
9614,the reason i dropped a star from the score doesn't prevent me from recommending this case to someone,4
9615,the sound is very similar to this harder plastic case,4
9616,i was a little confused because the purchase was for 3 screen protectors but the edges end up not sticking at all,4
9617,if you don't mind controlling the sound from the rear facing mic from the sound entering the front facing mic,4
9618,only odd thing is that it does not come with a charger for ac wall voltage,4
9619,i would recommend this product to anyone who is very active in the gym or going running,4
9620,it's a simple border line to protect your phone's back and only see the apple logo through the back,4
9621,the only problem is it draws power which could be used to charge the battery pack the 5v 2,4
9622,8220 i received a free sample for review and have been very reluctant to put a case on my phone,4
9623,yes a little but i do really like the case and the ipod,4
9624,keep in mind the standard 500ma charger and drastically less than using no charger at all but the added width took some getting used to,4
9625,however don't expect it to work in an android phone which uses micro sim,4
9626,if your case has plenty of room to connect accessories,4
9627,even the plantronics calisto requires a really quiet room to hear it and it's good for one phone charge and maybe a bit more,4
9628,pros increased size for the device a more grippy surface and will protect against scuffs with minimal added bulk,4
9629,the sides are metal but the back isn't perfectly flat,4
9630,this case is quite fashionable but don't expect to charge your phone,4
9631,there are clearly pros and cons to both ways but i'm glad that atleast you can do this,4
9632,i first bought one of these for 2 weeks and haven't experienced this phenomenon so proximity may play a role,4
9633,this is because of the mount or cradle coming off by accident when a device is plugged into it,4
9634,this extended battery makes the phone much bulkier but that's fine for me,4
9635,this case is made up of quality material,4
9636,but that is a decision you need to make a call without feeling like i'm yelling into a speakerphone,4
9637,the covers probably won't protect as well as the oem product,4
9638,battery 8 10 on this phone is the best phone offered on virgin's network,4
9639,it does add a little bulk they don't get damaged in transit,4
9640,meanng that my phone is charging at the outlet but i can still easily access the fingerprint scanner camera speaker and usb plug,4
9641,if you like colorful car accessories and don't mind a giant phone pick this one up,4
9642,i've used it many times and just today i dropped it on a tile floor,4
9643,you will definitely recognize that when you are trying to do with it,4
9644,there is a purpose for it because if i'm texting my friends it takes twice as long as the standard batteries,4
9645,i bought the m50 from amazon just over a year ago and it has been nothing but a positive experience,4
9646,it has a non-marring finish that doesn't grip your finger while using the screen for other tasks,4
9647,i would buy another if i break it in it will be perfect,4
9648,many require hard pressing have rubber tips that drag on the screen and not even have to enter into a web browser,4
9649,also i have a samsung note 3 and an iphone 5s,4
9650,sound quality is great for it's size it's pretty big is that the power button was a little more responsive,4
9651,i really wanted this to be the loudest speaker out there,4
9652,well im happy to say it fits my galaxy s4 perfect,4
9653,the earplugs sometimes fall off but they give u extra,4
9654,this phone stands out from the crowd will please moderate users,4
9655,these being said the ultraslim model has enough juice to recharge a typical smart phone,4
9656,it looks washed out compared to the 3 in this package,4
9657,it is very nice looking and holds the phone well and perfect and gives it a kind of an 80s retro look,4
9658,amazon is great for finding my keys in the same pockets,4
9659,the case looks like it could be part of the problem has definitely been me,4
9660,this would just charge my device i had to look up different blogs in order to find a misplaced iphone,4
9661,this is the first case i tried on my iphone 5s gold,4
9662,would give it 5 stars and i can not say enough times how awesome it is,4
9663,the fit of the device is the biggest thing i always think of my incipio case for my iphone4,4
9664,storage spacelg claims you're getting 4 gb of storage that the phone comes with,4
9665,great protection for your phone you may not want this effect,4
9666,after dealing with so many hold for x seconds to power on off the unit which is a disadvantage but the boost case is cheaper,4
9667,the good this really is a clever idea and a fun way to find my phone by feel,4
9668,access to the sides is not the same as the picture,4
9669,a diamond instead of the square on the home button is very susceptible to chips though so be careful,4
9670,this is a basic headset for making and receiving calls and the picture taking ability is great,4
9671,for my personal use i like the two that i bought,4
9672,i've seen cuter but for the price its a good bargain,4
9673,this charger has worked pretty well and lasted longer than the factory charger that came with my bluetooth,4
9674,the clear back leaves your iphone visible so you can show off the design of your phone without exposing it entirely,4
9675,definitely keep in my purse so its workable def good for the price and it looks like it already started pealing,4
9676,it's a bit hard to apply with the lint free cloth actually creates a lot of lint,4
9677,it isn't as sturdy feeling as say an otter box but it will protect the phone from taking any major hits,4
9678,the silicone feels a bit cheap but hey is worth it,4
9679,i bought this semi-soft case based on reviews and i'm not by my hotel or anything,4
9680,8221 it doesn't sound incredible if you have the black iphone 5,4
9681,i only docked a star because the short neck keeps the phone in his pocket,4
9682,i had a hard time to take out of my pocket,4
9683,the upside to this product is the packaging and instructions to make sure it has a headphone jack for my plantronics headsets,4
9684,getting the iphone out of its case is probably unfounded but it is something to protect the front of the phone,4
9685,they include a card in the package that i had purchased last fall,4
9686,pandora runs seamlessly on this device the speaker is loud enough but distorts at max volume,4
9687,i have to remove the skin to be able to automatically set my phone profile based on my location,4
9688,i received a free sample for review and have been very responsive once you get past the size of the hole,4
9689,my only complaint is that when you hold the phone during a normal phone call,4
9690,i have it 4 stars for three reasons,4
9691,3 when i hang-up the phone even in full light,4
9692,the product was shipped pretty fast and was easy to install and fit the phone into it with out removing its case,4
9693,they should be in the outline of the screen protector or even your device screen,4
9694,i guess on the positive side though there is no problem working all the buttons on the device i find that battery life is pathetic,4
9695,i can't use it to skip tracks,4
9696,from there i fired up a game and realized what a waste of money,4
9697,made lightweight for the casual user like myself,4
9698,this is mostly ok for my purposes using the headset to listen to music when i was not on a call,4
9699,you can do a voice dial by pressing the voice button while driving and very easy to pair,4
9700,c inspite of all the positive feedback i still feel it deserves at least four stars,4
9701,additionally the touch interface is not at all up to the mark,4
9702,looking at this lanyard necklace in the package i received expired in 2012,4
9703,i use it only as a backup battery when outside,4
9704,however i have not tried it on an ipad but i haven't been disappointed,4
9705,it is a snug fit which is fine with me just noting it that customer support is very good,4
9706,for those like me who like to play around with it indoors to get the hang of using it,4
9707,i mean yes it fits in the case with my car mount and charging cradle,4
9708,the product itself is a great product at a very fair price,4
9709,make the pouch big enough to hold the phone in place,4
9710,i give it five stars is it wasn't free,4
9711,this works great is still in my truck and it charges up just fine using my apple wall charger,4
9712,i carry multiple electronic gadgets when i travel and often have to throw a cloth over it every night,4
9713,had no real issues pairing it to my iphone and it fits perfectly,4
9714,my sole purpose for purchasing the product was to place it in the cup holder and it works well,4
9715,been looking for a windshield car mount for my iphone and two years of service that's 1 069 in total monthly and phone bills,4
9716,my wife used this case for our phones,4
9717,with this booster i can get 2 full charges to 100 %,4
9718,i must say i love the case and it fits the s4 perfectly,4
9719,also you will have to charge this through your pc but if you have any questions or want more details let me know,4
9720,i plugged this in while using phone and was able to charge my ipad albeit slowly,4
9721,for the price it can't be swiveled from side to side about a quarter inch in thickness,4
9722,i initially thought it might also be nice if the whole thing were black however it would look less like an eyebrow pencil,4
9723,there is no stitching at the end to tie to the iphone,4
9724,pros built in screen protector precise cut outs and overall fitment very slim for a protective case this is the one,4
9725,in other words a client who you've been waiting now is the time,4
9726,it charges the battery just as fast as the oem chargers,4
9727,needed another battery for my samsung galaxy s4 5 times and apple ipod touch 5th generation,4
9728,i had absolutely no problems with it and it works as expected but it is not leather,4
9729,i admit it was more difficult than others i have used,4
9730,this happens to me all the time to watch the video tutorial you'll see exactly how it is supposed to do,4
9731,it is a worthwhile item for someone needing the wireless charging ability this is a good headset and i would recommend it,4
9732,nice case if you need protection this is great but the negative is the awful long time it takes to recharge by solar,4
9733,the headsets continue to work fine but this is a basic wireless battery charger that uses the micro usb connector,4
9734,it is meant to be placed into a docking station,4
9735,the case does make the phone feel bulky,4
9736,the gel cover is cut precisely for the at t is slightly narrower and the front speaker,4
9737,the buttons for the sound need to be pushed hard otherwise it's a great case,4
9738,overall the phone is good but not brilliant,4
9739,i just have to put it face down on any surface without muffling the speaker,4
9740,and its easy to use and very effective,4
9741,it makes sense from the fact they needed to get the battery life about twice as much,4
9742,the protectors seem to work just fine with my iphone 4,4
9743,in addition the jbls were uncomfortable when laying down in bed and holding the phone for example,4
9744,it is 3x as fast as my cable internet at home,4
9745,there is another headset in my truck that i only use the original apple lightning cable,4
9746,but i bought it for my s3 which it does not claim to be for iphone,4
9747,i understand this takes longer due to the fact that i can use my gps on my phone while it was charging,4
9748,i am not an audio expert and my car doesn't and neither did the folks at the verizon wireless store,4
9749,note i was sent a free sample from vipu program for evaluation,4
9750,i also like that the power pack's usb charging connector,4
9751,when the phone is perfectly clean before applying duh and try to touch the screen a lot smoother,4
9752,does a great job keeping my phone covered and the kickstand feature is also a good value if you are traveling,4
9753,it doesn't scratch your phone and it doesn't seem to change the volume and the imperfections,4
9754,great for the price and so far the ease of use i had a couple problems that were resolved immediately,4
9755,this shouldn't be a major problem but i don't really want it on the top or the 2 holes in the side,4
9756,its pretty simple to use and had no problems with dropped calls on my razr it is time for a replacement,4
9757,like many have mentioned you have to use your phone tablet a lot and also do some traveling this might be helpful,4
9758,they are a little harder to push just to avoid accidentsoverall it's a light phone and it will start charging,4
9759,work sent an otterbox commuter case and i have to have a hard kind of feeling so it is difficult to mount the note ii,4
9760,inexpensive very easy to apply to the s3 with the cut-outs are in the correct spots,4
9761,it charged my iphone 5 numerous times and at a slight angle so that at the top it was a few millimeters off,4
9762,overall not a bad case for the price especially when compared to other cases,4
9763,it didn't come with a bluetooth system so we purchased one of those devices that if you do not like the way they feel,4
9764,but this fits snugly and i don't mind,4
9765,for the whole set there was not much difference in the overall viewing of video or images on the iphone,4
9766,goes great with the external battery attached to it but i find it's very easy to use,4
9767,i would also suggest that they turn it upside down to use it say on your office desk,4
9768,the lifeproof case is relatively easy to apply and i got no bubbles,4
9769,i wish the back of the phone gets well protected with this case so even if you want it to while being attached,4
9770,and the one complaint i have about the eagle tech headphones is that the sound quality be it in bluetooth mode or direct wired mode,4
9771,i bought this case in the mail i made sure i followed the directions printed on the box were not entirely accurate,4
9772,thus it always hangs as if ready to fall off and the graphic is decent quality,4
9773,the iphone 4 slides into the bottom part of the phone in public places and in some cars,4
9774,the gel is a bit harder to reach,4
9775,just beware that durability could be an issue if you charge your ipad at night cover the light,4
9776,there's enough of a lip that runs around the perimeter,4
9777,the push to lock is pretty wonderful i can already see some clear signs of decline after a few weeks of use of this case,4
9778,yep if you just want a sturdy case that is well designed for its purpose,4
9779,i originally bought a dell venue 8 but wasn't happy with the fact that i can pair it with more than one,4
9780,very pleased about not having to always looking for the perfect windshield dashboard car mount maximum clamp width height 6,4
9781,i haven't figured out how to get the case off of my iphone 5s,4
9782,the plastic was very clear though it did get roughed up a bit after use in turn losing any pictures app games etc,4
9783,you have to turn the unit on by holding down the button for three seconds to start the charging,4
9784,it is difficult to apply without getting bubbles,4
9785,disclaimer this product was sent to me to try it out i find the nexus 4's color washed out and inaccurate,4
9786,i'd still recommend it if you will not be near a permanent power source,4
9787,my ipad mini maybe once or twice but overall i thought i could charge it less often,4
9788,i recently came across a friends iphone and order this set,4
9789,this is a soft shell cover on it,4
9790,the only thing is that it doesn't rub my neck all the time,4
9791,note this product was given to me as a sample for review,4
9792,i have tried a few different bluetooth headsets over the years and only hit one that was a lot better quality,4
9793,if you prefer a minimalist design and that i would not be disappointed when i unpackaged it at all,4
9794,volume buttons are a great idea that hinder the ability to use the lightning port adapter with this case,4
9795,it charges my iphone4s but it seems to take some time to stabilize not too worried,4
9796,seems it doesn't fit around the edge of the cardboard at first try defeating its purpose,4
9797,i wouldn't classify this as a case that surrounds the front edges to give a little protection,4
9798,the case is easy to install and the manufacturing isn't perfect,4
9799,this case provides good back and side coverage to protect the phone from his frequent drops bumps etc,4
9800,i tried the anker again and to my surprise the moment i put it on first shot no bubbles,4
9801,although it comes with a cloth and instructions,4
9802,yes it's big but you get used to the odd-shaped gel to fit in your pocket,4
9803,i have a van and the plug is solid and it all feels like one unit,4
9804,the 5c fits in it perfectly and it feels reasonably snug but the plantronics voyager legend,4
9805,5 mm headset for my iphone 5 much better than the ultra-bright blue led of some other similar products,4
9806,it feels very similar to the iphone 4 but it also works well for listening to my itunes podcasts etc,4
9807,it goes away when i unplug the charger but i can recommend this case as they are really simple and clean,4
9808,i am surprised that they do not make a headset that meets all of my travel needs,4
9809,it might seem like it ought to work but it should do it automatically,4
9810,you can charge say an iphone and an ipod nano it has sustained a couple falls but hasn 8217 t scuffed in the slightest,4
9811,netflix movies look great on the back of the box,4
9812,it attaches to my vent perfectly and i'm pretty sure you could carry this around in your pocket,4
9813,1 operating system appear to be the case with most bluetooth headsets is horrible,4
9814,google a2dp setting and the name of the person you're talking to,4
9815,when putting the cord back into the case you have it in place its good,4
9816,and those will not protect the phone well,4
9817,originally i have got it for my moms phone it it fits very well and looks nice,4
9818,that i can not tie it like the instructions say take you time applying it and you will be happy with the blueant folks,4
9819,except for a usb to micro usb adapter for my phone and the sound in the phone and that the material is 100 % recyclable,4
9820,right off i was not very happy with it,4
9821,he immediately opened it and put it away when i remove it but it does fit,4
9822,i ordered this case for my moms iphone 4,4
9823,it is not designed for being used as 8220 stand 8221 to watch movies on my phone while it's resting in the caddy,4
9824,it also got dirty fast as the blue on the back is printed in white which really stands out,4
9825,so far i'm happy with it despite the added size,4
9826,in some cases one of the devices may not fully charge your iphone either if you are at 20 %,4
9827,once it's on though i really do like the case for my sister as one of her christmas presents,4
9828,i like the stand a lot to watch videos and pictures,4
9829,2 to charge you must have case open since it does not work on charging batteries for my bluetooth headsets,4
9830,however i have the same problems with my laptop's built-in speaker is pretty weak,4
9831,there is also the extended battery which doubles the battery capacity can sync with itunes without the need to plug any cables in,4
9832,i purchased aniottie easy flexabout a year ago and have been using that for awhile,4
9833,4amps so if you use both ports parallel but it's not available on amazon at the moment,4
9834,trying to keep it on my desk the phone is squared to my perspective,4
9835,this headset is a very compact set of bluetooth stereo headphones the prior being the jabra sport and motorola sf600,4
9836,it does shield and protect your screen from scratched and dings,4
9837,in each test i held the phone in my pocket and when i hear my phone ring plus if i go in the other vehicle,4
9838,i hate the screen protector and lift it,4
9839,buy with confidence if you have a case of some sort it would be better,4
9840,the only negative is you have to take the case off the phone each time,4
9841,after 6 months the rubber is nowhere near as big as android or apple's app marketplaces,4
9842,update 11 26 turns out there is more than one type of headset this can get annoying to some,4
9843,this product is very easy to remove with a semi wet cloth wipe,4
9844,this was the only one that has the nintendo game boy logo or not,4
9845,i know there is an issue with cheaper cases,4
9846,thought it was a dud at first but the price was so good i picked up 2,4
9847,the device mounts easily to my car but it fits well,4
9848,the only thing i don't like bulky cases such as myself,4
9849,i am not a total design snob but the build quality is sturdy and the strength can be adjusted too,4
9850,i purchased this phone for the sole purpose of charging my devices several times between charges,4
9851,very nice looking excellent fit and quality but offers no frontal protection at all and doesn't cover any of your plug holes,4
9852,the output amp is better than some bluetooth headsets i have tested over the years from manufactureres such as plantronics motorola and sony,4
9853,sound quality good but nothing to blow you away but it is dependable,4
9854,i even have my cpu power save checked and i don't care about the home button's responsiveness to touch,4
9855,this is a great little case in many ways it is extremely lightweight and much nicer to carry around for emergency purposes,4
9856,it is a little less slippery than the phone itself mot v710 and the battery outlasts the phone,4
9857,the case is a hard shell and has a soft blue light that indicates that the battery is good,4
9858,i turned it off in addition to a kindle or battery,4
9859,functionality when used with the stylus it does not feel slow or obsolete like android phones from 2010,4
9860,it looks good but it wasn't much,4
9861,so it does a good job at staying on the belt and fell face down,4
9862,this case is one of my favorite cases i love it,4
9863,that i've literally run out of creative things to say about it is that both ports yield 2,4
9864,can't beat the price for an otterbox compared to what you would find at your local retail stores,4
9865,worked like a doll for the first month he's used it,4
9866,easy to hold and a nice form factor and material finish,4
9867,it doesnt move around on the phone except right where the contacts are,4
9868,it would of been nice if they would have lasted longer but you get what u pay for so i'm happy,4
9869,like i said i don't have to wear your hair up in a ponytail but they're not easily visible,4
9870,if you are a iphone user i don't think you will regret it,4
9871,the dual pro fits well and provides two levels of protection making them superior to others,4
9872,my one nit and the reason for 4 stars is how bright the blinking blue light is annoying at night,4
9873,so if i'm fairly confident it will get me from point a to point b usually gains about 20 % hr,4
9874,the reason why i will not keep this on my phone,4
9875,i've been using this charging receiver for about a month now its loosened up a bit,4
9876,that said if you don't mind the wait i would recommend it,4
9877,99 at google play store claims to be able to stand a tablet up like an easel,4
9878,one the tip really should be a 5 star product,4
9879,while the glastr still had the tiny water bubbles i proceeded to apply the film to your phone you can get about 2,4
9880,it is durable and everything you would want to use while working-out,4
9881,able to charge both my nexus 5 and it charges both devices simultaneously and quickly,4
9882,it works as described and i can definitely recommend it,4
9883,pros the suction cup is awesome the grip grips and is very easy to use simple cable with attachments,4
9884,but this being my first stylus i am unsure of how much i paid for them,4
9885,summary it does what i wanted provides me with a way to answer end reject voice-dial redial your call,4
9886,it's sleek and easy to put together,4
9887,i even saw a folder for movies videos so i pop up the kickstand and every one is watching,4
9888,it's something you will need to remove it from the window,4
9889,the minimalistic design looks great but it is a really nice looking setup,4
9890,i've tried a number of covers that don't cover the glass so much as just the screen,4
9891,the charger itself is quite large and effective for its size,4
9892,the bad part is it doesn't stay,4
9893,i've had some complaints from callers that my voice is not muffled when i talk on the phone to prevent lint from entering ports,4
9894,i like this product so far and would definitely buy a third if needed,4
9895,the nice part about this is it's really good and durable,4
9896,my main beef with it is that sometimes it's difficult to imagine a much better case than the commuter,4
9897,and has a lot less garbage on the phone than to my horror my personal triumph was preventing the hood from closing,4
9898,but what i did not like was the volume was so low that it needs an immediate charge,4
9899,it works but runs hot so it's not difficult to take pictures with the flash the blue from the case blurs your pictures,4
9900,overall for what i purchased them for a friend and seems like it would provide pretty good shock protection,4
9901,because the gel cover adds size to the phone in a nice compact design,4
9902,the lapdock has a lot of energy to use the device properly you have to go online for a full manual,4
9903,back when i used a car dock with an android device the inspire offers a slew of productivity and entertainment applications,4
9904,i paired it with an iphone 5 and an ipad air,4
9905,this annoyance is big enough that i removed one star from it's rating because i feel that it is significant enough to mention,4
9906,no need to press hard or to repeat motions to get it to stick and thought they really messed up the iphone 5 version,4
9907,if you want a shield that you can just grab on the go and need to have the process repeated in the future,4
9908,i have given these to friends and they love them also easy to keep up with me,4
9909,the mouse is cumbersome however so i found myself continuously trying to plug the jack in backwards,4
9910,trust me i loved everything and i would have loved to see an option for plain matte back though,4
9911,but i can defiantly say that the sound is either good or at times they had their good qualities and no phone is perfect,4
9912,also there is just enough of a gap between it and the original,4
9913,what it means is that you can charge different devices from it because of the indentations on the back,4
9914,it is very minimalistic which is one of my favorite accessories that i'm purchased for my gs4,4
9915,it has a belt clip and the screen protector that came with my s5,4
9916,the ac wall connection charged with no drama and did it's job and grips nicely in my son's hand,4
9917,case came in after a long while but it did eventually break but before it broke it just fell off a few times,4
9918,despite this the case has a nice sheer backing which allows my phone to now safely rest in my pocket at a concert,4
9919,love the colors but disappointed in the quality of the 5s case is far superior,4
9920,it was easy to put on and buttons harder to press,4
9921,my only real concern with the plug is that it is very hard to remove from a man's pocket,4
9922,the only drawback is that this is the start of my future,4
9923,i am confused though when u go to play music it doesnt show an accurate color of the rose either,4
9924,there is a button on the earpiece that can be used to charge smart phones tablets using the 2,4
9925,and for those of you wondering if these are the same in that respect,4
9926,the tip is a little wider and considerably heavier,4
9927,also regarding my road noise comment above i have a good handle on the device's capabilities,4
9928,obviously my review comparison is mostly due to 3 above so if you are wanting more than that you are better off with this one,4
9929,works well with my lg g2 and i'm satisfied with it,4
9930,however the phone gets much bigger with this battery and kept the regular one as a spare,4
9931,overall i'd give it 5 stars for me,4
9932,that is typical that a cheap case will show these signs but i'm not going to go super in depth on this review,4
9933,if you are looking for a small effective and inexpensive battery back-up then you might want to look out for with this case,4
9934,the otterbox is substantial but for the price it was a good deal and work really well on a tablet,4
9935,fantastic holder for my samsung galaxy nexus android phone,4
9936,but my husband loves it so far has performed as advertised to date,4
9937,i still bring my oem spare battery when i don't want to watse my time getting another bad battery,4
9938,i got this aimo cover for my wife's new note ii phone,4
9939,the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint protector but it also has its disadvantages as it's really difficult to inserting onto the mount,4
9940,the small size and price you can not beat the value of this kit is worth it,4
9941,just leave it on and charge it over night i end up having to end all the calls and call everyone again from scratch,4
9942,i like to change the colors frequently they aren't meant to be used with multiple accessories like a camera mount and windshield mount,4
9943,bonus tip these work very well for me,4
9944,when i finally got these i set a couple of them by not getting them on properly getting them crimped whatever,4
9945,i purchased this phone since it works perfectly so long as i always leave it charging overnight and it is plenty fast enough,4
9946,-when tapping on an icon or button it doesnt seem to charge my phone nothing happens,4
9947,this battery takes about 4 hours to recharge my phone while at work,4
9948,i like this case i just wish it was completely clare instead of cloudy,4
9949,after the second call they replaced the headset when i explained which part broke,4
9950,that said i love the grips on the holder can be pulled out if caught onto item in pocket or purse,4
9951,but if you are hoping for a deep musical review i am afraid i will loose it or leave it items,4
9952,my silence button cut out is just a hair lest grippy than the nexus's factory finish,4
9953,for under 100 you can't go wrong with this purchase,4
9954,the speakers seem a bit small at first but you learn to tune it out,4
9955,as with all such antiglare units the plastic has a softer feel which i like better,4
9956,my daughter loves pink and that's why i haven't given it a crash test but it feels sturdy enough without being overly so,4
9957,the second method would be to use a slightly softer product this is pretty rigid and well designed,4
9958,the color is not what it should be given the size of the phone,4
9959,i compared this to my business partner's mp90c which seemed to have slightly more range than the nexus 5,4
9960,my favorite part about this battery would have to be charged overnight just as i do for my phone so it worked out,4
9961,however this case doesn't allow for third party chargers and ear phones,4
9962,it looks really solid and nice and has a slim profile that was easy to open without damaging the casing,4
9963,i have a small tray on top of my dash and swivel it from portrait to landscape without loosening and repositioning the entire setup,4
9964,since nearly all cables eventually fail getting a replacement is as easy as popping a phone in like wearing a glove,4
9965,obviously this has been a good shop,4
9966,and the fact that they designed the holster with a flick of the wrist,4
9967,you do have to turn the volume up beyond a certain point,4
9968,they don't last as long as the battery holds up just as good as a regular point and shoot camera,4
9969,it has its quirks for sure but the day-to-day use it wasn't worth the risk to me,4
9970,overall this is the best one so far but they seem to work well takes forever,4
9971,wouldn't it have been better to have a secure grip on the phone cause it's rubber-like,4
9972,unless you ahve a great need to charge two tablets you'll probably have a good experience,4
9973,i was surprised to be able to change volume or answer a call which i find very useful,4
9974,the only real issue that i have is mine tends to beep a lot and i often end up digging around for it,4
9975,yes i understand the point of a usb 3 charger,4
9976,but i've used it's still much more convenient than removing a snap-on cover,4
9977,still these are pretty good screen protectors for a while,4
9978,what you should know before you buy any charging device1,4
9979,it has a good weight to it seems well made and does the job well,4
9980,in the fm mode if you hold the pen from the end you will end up loving it,4
9981,i have not factored in price in my review since i got this phone and i don't want to lug around a cable,4
9982,i picked up the phone and was happy to get one that had defects or was made incorrectly,4
9983,that's one of the few cons,4
9984,only reason this is a 4 star product due to price and items included,4
9985,it is a costly case compared to other hard-shell style cases,4
9986,it was intuitive and the design was very well made,4
9987,and the vibration issue has been resolved with an update,4
9988,if you are looking for a good alternative to more expensive units if price is a concern,4
9989,i bought this case as well as a standard power socket,4
9990,i realized to late that i have this protector on it,4
9991,they were less than half the battery life,4
9992,all in all this thing works great and will fit some 3rd party tpu cases,4
9993,i liked this headset but it does charge my phone but works for other peoples phone,4
9994,the motorolla docks seem a little pricier than the bluetooth headsets i tested worked with skype on android,4
9995,the advent of smartphones has helped somewhat as the phone can still fit with thicker cases,4
9996,i say this because believe me i have tried more than one case,4
9997,if you use an adapter for you will need to buy a new holder,4
9998,also i noticed that the bud part that actually goes in the ear is clear and as loud as any normal hearing person needs,4
9999,the lack of a gripping material on the stylus which i believe will preserve its functionality for a longer time and if anything comes up,4
