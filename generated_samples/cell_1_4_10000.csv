0,most sickening inferior case i've came across in a long time on any phone so kudos to that,1
1,looks good from a distance but when you get it but tracfone can not help if anything goes wrong,1
2,the knockoff cable i had was a 16 dollar paper weight,1
3,i have bought many different electronic and audio devices from amazon and i hope the seller gives me a full refund,1
4,i have bought from amazon before usually good service but this is just not usable for me i will be returning both,1
5,i started off with the maxboost for the iphone 4s with casing on it already,1
6,i dont recommend to buy screen protectors on amazon and the tech armor ones are the best,1
7,i have purchased many different screen protectors on many different devices and this one i just couldn't talk because i could hear myself,1
8,it is cheap plastic and yes there are rubber bands,1
9,i have tried many configurations with this charger and it do not work for this new version's arbitrarily changed controls,1
10,this item is just terrible the first one i found on search because it seems to have been made with good quality material,1
11,on reboot from the hard reset the phone stuck on the gears turning screen for another 10 minutes,1
12,this case was gorgeous when i got it it was burgeundy,1
13,playing with the plug i can find one tenuous position about a quarter of the price of this phone with more capabilities,1
14,one came with the phone so seems capacity is about the same size look at a elago or casecrown case for a better design,1
15,i discovered that after only a few uses it stopped working,1
16,what you usually get doesn't have any richness and the bass is laughable,1
17,i was really hopeful for this product as i had it laying around for over a month,1
18,he dropped his phone from his bed to the floor and your holster is now worthless as the clip snaps off,1
19,it's definitely not for you if you want durability then chose something else,1
20,it does not have a non-slip back so it slips as soon as you plug it in to its overnight charger,1
21,some mp3's are louder than others and you can't pull on the plastic housing,1
22,what i hate about these cases is that they are two piece and i can't get enough ram free to do anything,1
23,i went to wal-mart and all three screen protectors ended up in the trash as soon as i tried to open it,1
24,it's very sturdy the faux screws look genuine and the serial number isn't crisp and smooth on most fakes,1
25,it's been a month and the back of this case is acceptable,1
26,no matter how hard i tried i could not even get it to work like once in 100 tries,1
27,of course i tried to get them to stick but they would not stick because of how severely bent they were,1
28,replaced the glass and the feel of the shell though,1
29,next comes the fit and comfort is excellent but it's so tight when you try to turn on or close your phone,1
30,if i had not encountered the following problems i would have kept my money,1
31,although the lights indicated it was fully charged brand new phone and is a total pain to try to use,1
32,the case looks good but it's very loose hard to use phone when it's on,1
33,the top most portion of the phone it comes off frequently,1
34,got it and it didn't work with another one that didn't work,1
35,i tried using some water from the bowl of water for fingertips,1
36,even after watching the installation video several times the screen protectors are difficult to install and does not stand phone,1
37,so it's not the port on my phone had to be on high all the time because of lock up,1
38,very pretty but the bow fell off the day i received the phone packaged ok,1
39,the screen protectors do fit the screen but there are cut outs at the top of the phone with the case on,1
40,so i thought it could be the battery,1
41,the cross fell of the first week its a very poor quality and appeared discolored upon arrival,1
42,so the outside of the screen leaving gaps around the screen protector including the top white portion,1
43,it was very obvious so i'm not holding my breath,1
44,when you pull the cord out to extend it it's supposed to be for the iphone 5 instead it beats others hands down,1
45,without charging at all i can not even give this products star at all,1
46,when i opened the package and wanted to see if it was infact comparable to defender series as stated,1
47,but it doesn't seem to be paying any attention,1
48,clearly from the photo something was designed properly but that's not their fault just be aware of the difference in the firmware,1
49,perhaps they forgot to actually research the specs of the phone are just laughing and giving each other high-5's dunno sometimes,1
50,the tabs near the center of base broke and the little metal piece where the wrist band goes through detached,1
51,i wouldn't have to be bedridden to make them work but i couldn't get this thing on straight or without smudging it,1
52,this is not apple-certified which means it will not work for the galaxy player 4,1
53,what a waste of money in order to charge my phone i wont be buying this charger again,1
54,i bought a tech armor screen protector in the past that worked i'd advise not risking this set,1
55,had i known virgin mobile performed this poorly in a big city with lots of radio interference,1
56,you should also check the rear of the docking unit for travel,1
57,did not fir my phone and i don't want the extra vizio remote for volume only,1
58,horrible product it is a pain to keep track of,1
59,it didn't even charge my phone when i'm using it for navigation at full screen brilliance,1
60,i bought three of these things about a year ago thinking it would be a pretty unique touch to my new evo i was wrong,1
61,i love these type of screen protectors to see the outcome,1
62,the kickstand doesn't really have the beefier corner most do,1
63,this i could of lived with if it just fit the iphone 5 exactly and thus stays out at an angle,1
64,my wife ended up having to return it,1
65,i'm out of my money even if it is cheap,1
66,i mailed the seller but they never got back to me on where the product is,1
67,what a shame i decided to buy this one and just buy it from walmart instead,1
68,a product that i haven't gotten them in the mail today and it looks nothing like it shows online,1
69,1 the volume control doesn't line up on the hyperion,1
70,the holster looks nice seems to be well made and are a total waste of money,1
71,so if need to get to the point of inhibiting calls,1
72,from the reviews this is a fantastic cable,1
73,this phone holder would not stick to the mini's surface,1
74,i have the 5s and it's crushing the phone to the headphones is less than 2 feet yet the connection fails,1
75,returned the product and will continue to look for a mirror screen protector as advertised,1
76,that's one expensive way to charge a second battery while the phone is charged,1
77,it was very obvious so i'm not so unhappy with it,1
78,i ordered several of these at the same time or the phone freezes,1
79,amazon quickly sent out a replacement without asking me to return the item without trying the batteries,1
80,i have purchased two of these cables and none of them would charge anything,1
81,with no instructions it was a bit too large so the phone slipped out easily and the plastic back is flimsy and overly glossy,1
82,the case looks like it came out of the plastic bit,1
83,the sound doesn't have any richness and the bass is majorly lacking when using this unit,1
84,on the other hand this product is constructed well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for,1
85,however when i ordered it a second time it would not work with any of our devices it didn't matter what i did,1
86,second this case is not what is described,1
87,30 minutes after use the device is so hot just from being in my pocket,1
88,the case looks decent but very thick and makes it feel like a cool wrap around which it is not,1
89,the feel changes completely and i could not connect to the att network to register the sim card,1
90,i did put a dead phone in the morning that it'll be charged,1
91,in the end not a good deal if you're looking for a really great sounding bluetooth set i,1
92,the samsung charger had a samsung original hologram on the front of the case that breaks in half after some use,1
93,the corners would pop open all the time so i tried all the tips and they still work themselves loose,1
94,the clear case does not show up well on the back but as we know the iphone is long and slim,1
95,phone says charging and it seems to have a defect as well doesn't fit snug at all see the main photo here,1
96,i am very very gentle with my phone and second the end of the stylus,1
97,update 4 25 2013had this case a while ago and although its junk it worked better than this one,1
98,funny thing is though it will cost you if you don't speak hindu pay a little more for better quality,1
99,didn't and don't want to have while driving,1
100,i put this on the window and it will increase your reception,1
101,it is nothing like the picture at all,1
102,this case broke the same day and it was completely scratched all over,1
103,first off i was an idiot and bought these for my new gear 2 and thought they were pretty good,1
104,i received this case i was very excited about the duracel mygrid starter kit,1
105,this does not fit my device and it just made the whole tablet experience awkward,1
106,i could put up with all of the problems had been fixed,1
107,this product does not fit the phone for the cost and shipping it is not worth spending any money on,1
108,decided to get it for my car and i used it for maybe 20 minutes,1
109,however this is by far the worst item from intocircuit,1
110,broke right after taking it out of the box but the sound quality was no where near the standard the original set,1
111,also it has a circular connector bulk on the back side where i put a zagg skin,1
112,remain in a prominent place and can not be replaced by a new one,1
113,i think my wife kept this for maybe two weeks and it breaks,1
114,there is no action allowed for volume on my phone to the pc and pow,1
115,my samsung galaxy note 3 it did not charge more than one phone at a time,1
116,this happens about half the time and would not 34 dial out 34 my out going calls,1
117,i don't think it will last long,1
118,the back of the case when it finally arrives,1
119,i broke down and paid far more money to get the connector for your phone,1
120,but it seems to be a much better fit and higher quality,1
121,after 2 days it would no longer pair with my phone,1
122,i am just using it as a phone this case would be the last one i cleaned everything really good got a bunch of bubbles,1
123,they were to big for our 4s i phones they said they would send another package of screen protectors,1
124,what is the point to have a good case on this big nice phone,1
125,i bought 3 of these and i thought they were flexible plastic but it's cloudy it completely ruins looking at the screen,1
126,i thought that i couldnt get it off,1
127,update on 2013-08-17right out of the blue all of a sudden it just stopped charging my phone and case,1
128,the battery life is worse than that of my original battery which has longer life than this battery,1
129,i bought this for my little nephew for his new tablet and to my surprise the phone was 1 percent charged,1
130,i contacted the amazon manfacture and have had no problems with on my prior droid from the android market,1
131,i've had similar cases for other phones but this one was ruined right from the box,1
132,i tried using some water from the bowl but when wet i could no longer get a car charger from them,1
133,until something pressed against the screen and made a dent in the corner and cracked in the center,1
134,on the first time i try to take it of or put it back on,1
135,btw from my recent experience you will find all of the apple plugs i've had over the last few months,1
136,i did an overnight test charge with my nexus 4 and i have used other screen savers before and these rank right with them,1
137,and the one wasn't meant for and did not work do not recommend to anybody,1
138,what i received looks identical to the one i had before hand,1
139,i spend a lot of money for my samsung galaxy player 3,1
140,it's also hard to get all the options at once,1
141,i was sent a used and defective product in lieu of the new one i got did not work properly hence the single star,1
142,my car charger would not charge my smartphone,1
143,it works like a charm and now no matter how much it cost save your money,1
144,nothing on the front and it didn't charge the phone,1
145,when gorilla glass is used you do not need this headset for a playstation3,1
146,i did everything right during the installation except for the lack of security this case offered i thought it looked great,1
147,i was not happy with these or the spigen case i bought for my sons phone and what a mistake,1
148,given the issues you may want to look into another item,1
149,i have purchased 4 different jabra headsets because they are the most comfortable and best sound quality i have ever seen,1
150,i hoped for the best and ended up with the zerolemon the hyperion 4200mah battery works great,1
151,and did not see any faster charging on my iphone 4s all summer long last year and never had a problem,1
152,i have purchased many products from them over the years and have always been satisfied with them,1
153,so to use the stylus like the free pen i saw the other day would allow you to use ussd codes,1
154,the little clip that adjust the phone in the little triangle cutout on the case,1
155,didn't work for what i wanted so i had no choice but to buy this cable since it is rated to charge at 2,1
156,also tough to hear through the speaker with the case on my cell phone i have bought that proved to be defective,1
157,there's no other way to go back to the drawing board,1
158,i ordered this case and after a few days of use,1
159,i watched a lot of youtube videos and read a lot of reviews saying it charge their ipods,1
160,i ended up switching to a razr 16 gb which i had to trash in 10 minutes after i received it,1
161,now i know why it only cost me 5 or so,1
162,i had to remove the protector because it was so bad i had no choice,1
163,based on this poor quality and the fact that it worked seamlessly with my samsung s3,1
164,the magnet flat would not stay closed and the case itself is pretty decent and deserves maybe 3 or 4 stars,1
165,i threw it away considering the time and it was taking literally 10 minutes to open programs,1
166,would have been a very cool feature especially since i have the 4s and i had to pay for,1
167,what a joke of a product i had rendered useless already,1
168,even though this bumper is a good looking bumper i do not recommend anyone purchasing due to poor customer response and poor quality control,1
169,however if you're willing to lose a couple of bucks on a new iphone,1
170,i've used the ultra fine in the past and have always been satisfied with the quality,1
171,it didn't matter that the only reason i am giving it one star because the apple brand one was not as pictured,1
172,they make a point it is less accurate,1
173,it would have been better if it came with a huge scuff,1
174,if you never remove the battery it may last but if you have tmobile like me you will be surprised that the phone is on,1
175,this is battery pack and there is nothing they will do for me,1
176,my phone does seem to respond somewhat because it takes the home screen and said waiting then it turns off automatically,1
177,the problem is that it doesn't fit my samsung galaxy s3,1
178,i have tried to get them to stick but they would not stick because of how severely bent they were,1
179,i got this product pretty fast but it was not going to be at eye level,1
180,i was in such an hurry to get the item covered by my warranty only to find out its a very bad case,1
181,it doesn't matter because you won't be disappointed as iam withtrendon,1
182,using the knob i feel much more confident that i would be able to get customer service if anything goes wrong,1
183,they determined the break was my fault it wasn't and watched about 10 minutes of video on netflix,1
184,ps because of the extremely long delivery date i went ahead and ordered another one and will be sending this one back,1
185,this wouldn't be a bad move i'll see how long it lasts,1
186,also the phone number is in the uk and i was expecting to get the stowaway case for my iphone 4s,1
187,when it arrived i went to plug in my phone to the computer then it just stopped completely,1
188,love this product and hated to return it but who'd believe me,1
189,good the package was not as nice as the maxboost and is also super slick,1
190,i also like the price however it didn't work and will not provide current for the cell phone or tablet,1
191,these definitely take up less room but you have to pay for shipping in sending the headset back to them,1
192,i've only had this bamboo case for two weeks never dropped it and there is a crack guess this is what i will get,1
193,i shook as much of it out as i could and proceeded to apply the protector as seen in the video,1
194,i am so disappointed and for the cost it's not worth it because it never quite fits your otterbox like it should,1
195,i am currently in process of having amazon ship me a new one and paid for shipping and tracking make sure you pay for tracking,1
196,overall this is a waste of your money,1
197,silicone feels cheap after i managed to get the fourth protector to line up but i still haven't received it,1
198,i still have been using them since i got my phone im very disappointed buyer beware,1
199,had it on my new phone with the same headset,1
200,i have an htc phone but this is still evidently not a good product unless you have no desire of putting a case on it,1
201,i saw the reviews were good on this but i am not happy at all i will never buy one again,1
202,the problem is the adhesive or the screen protector part might work great,1
203,let me get to my story first of all i got this product it was very horrible it didn't stay on,1
204,case does not fit nor clasp on the iphone 4 with its call dropping fail of an antenna design,1
205,when i received the cable they did not work for me and sadly can not recommend,1
206,very upset that this will not work with an ipad mini retina,1
207,hers broke after having it over a month and the edges are already coming off on this 2 piece construction,1
208,it is so new i'll have to buy a case,1
209,if you can order from a different seller with a better case than this one but 2 buys a 2 case,1
210,if you look at all these 5 star reviews all have the same problem no phone signal no recommended,1
211,the unit has serious issues which leads me to believe that this item has a 3 year warranty,1
212,leaves residues on your phone after you remove it and close the ear thing it shuts off,1
213,they should have tried to return it would cost more than just going to walmart to get a new phone,1
214,since switching to an iphone 4 on att i have not had any issues with anyone on this site until now,1
215,the unit itself is sleeker and not at all with a thin case,1
216,for 9 bucks wasn't worth returning it so i just gave it 1 star because of the comfortable fit,1
217,i had it connected to a working surge protector and i am not really happy about it but you get what you pay for,1
218,for the price i am not looking for a refund to apply toward the much better anker unit,1
219,i just got this a little while ago plugged my phone in when i checked on it after 30 min,1
220,i didn't like that there is no app called that on google play that i could locate,1
221,this case was gorgeous when i got it i sent it back for a refund,1
222,problem 1 i bought these because i thought they would last a little while longer,1
223,it has a glittery shimmer to it and looks like one but it is no where near real,1
224,i seated the battery and used it for a while so that i can work out without cords getting in the way,1
225,five or six times during a night it goes thru these recycles you are asked to send a noticfication to the compaby,1
226,they also do not want to reuse the charger as it doesn't mention anything about that on this page,1
227,i've had these for a while and then on a bike too flimsy and with a sketchy mounting system,1
228,i had a plantronics blue tooth headset in the past and this case ranks as the worst,1
229,i don't really know unless you are a surgen you will tear the first one,1
230,also the hard shell will fall off of the phone but not impressed at all with it cracking into pieces,1
231,1a and plug the other end into your device and the other end contacts the power clip,1
232,they told me to return the bad battery,1
233,i lost my money thinking it was a fluke with the first,1
234,i try to answer an incoming call and has a good snug feeling to it,1
235,i bought an up on the first day and another 11 hours the second day it is now charging wirelessly,1
236,not meat for a phone that has an app that tell me the amount of juice it holds duh,1
237,i have had this about a year and i will not be buying products from this company again,1
238,it looks old and scratchy definitely looks like it has taken a lot of abuse from my toddler,1
239,i plugged it in via aux cable but i got the speaker it was obvious it was used,1
240,but after about 2 weeks there are these parallel running distortions along the face of the phone not the operating system software of the phone,1
241,it's way too loose phone doesn't stay in the charging position consistently,1
242,i returned and purchased a different tool set,1
243,don't buy if you want the real 34 back 34 button on the application will just restart the music in 1 seconds,1
244,i did read the other reviews before i purchased this product with caution after reading the reviews i thought that this is a counterfeit product,1
245,many people praise the audio quality so there must be a problem with the phone itself,1
246,the charger worked perfectly fine for about 3 days and died as well,1
247,i discovered this by plugging it into my computer the whole computer turned off,1
248,it does it's job in terms of protection and doesn't wear well,1
249,given the issues you may want to look into a phone that gets lots of use,1
250,lesson learned order 1 check for fit keep the packaging and all that as i was leaving on my three week trip,1
251,it also stopped working altogether after a month or so after i received it,1
252,have bought cases from this company before and it was excellent but this film need to be cleaned daily,1
253,unlike others i love the new charging connection you just have to be extra careful with the phone because if it drops,1
254,initially it was to expensive but when i saw it for my new nexus galaxy,1
255,this also made me think there was something wrong so i did it several times,1
256,i was hoping this case would work but it was obviously internally defective,1
257,the connect ios and android app customizes your headset to provide the best mix of form factor and protection,1
258,didn't fully protect the screen of the phone and the battery life has been steadily decreasing,1
259,broke within a week of using it and the bottom part of the case blocking the headphone jack its likely counterfeit,1
260,it doesn't serve the s-view cover would not work,1
261,they take me a lot of grief as i was not able to test it out to see if it worked,1
262,i purchased this extended battery hoping to give my phone just a little charge while at work,1
263,the only thing i liked was the flip but that wasnt enough to deter a potential buyer let me add this,1
264,the case came pretty fast in the mail however they still charged me for the old one,1
265,i've owned this for nearly two months and it cost this much without any ac charger,1
266,they fell apart and frayed and became useless after a few uses i bought this one for my note ii is pitiful,1
267,so please people learn from my mistake and don't buy it it'll be money down the drain,1
268,rubber tips did not work well for me,1
269,bought this forever ago thought i already wrote a review for this product for a while now and my friend send me this link,1
270,but beauty is in yhe eye of the beholder but this does not bring any of that do not recommend it,1
271,you would be better off not bothering to order it in the first three days it worked great,1
272,i have bought 6 otterbox cases now and this is one of the most frustrating experiences of my life,1
273,i rebooted and sometimes it would charge for a little and then got a spec and same thing happened,1
274,bought this usb charger after i replaced it with the blueant z9i and what a amazing difference clear as a bell,1
275,i thought since belkin is a trusted name that this would be a fantastic device but not so,1
276,the first issue i wont take it when it comes to the usability of the phone,1
277,the volume buttons are hard to press when in this case the phone slipped from my hand twice in a day,1
278,if the buttons worked properly and had a crack on the side of the phone using double sided tape which leaves sticky residue when removed,1
279,i've had many smart phones over the years and have always been satisfied with the quality,1
280,never going to use it for a while like a pair of snazzy shoes on a dew-covered church lawn slick,1
281,today i discovered that after only a few months of use the remaining good battery swelled up and went kerblooy,1
282,however when it got here and i tried to make the screen protector,1
283,pay some extra bucks and buy a much better brand battery,1
284,upon receiving the case it didn't fit my iphone 4 as an ipod now and it works without issue,1
285,good polycarbonate 5c lumia series is not the same as what apple has on its iphone,1
286,the window camera opening on top of the original purchase price and will not be bought,1
287,he has resisted getting an iphone because until he i met a couple of years is the bright blue light it gives off,1
288,they didn't stand behind their product apparently they don't,1
289,this cord worked for about a week and one of the wires to the ear buds were more durable,1
290,i've had this headset for six months and do a trade-in,1
291,the headphones fell apart within a week after purchase,1
292,first day of use with this product on my cell phone ran the cable to the dock like your description suggests,1
293,if it hadn't broke i would have given the 2nd one at least 4 stars,1
294,it is not worth it for this kind of stuff i want to just buy a high quality product,1
295,i was looking for one that will work,1
296,its a pretty case but it was the adapter itself that didn't work double boo for taking so % % long to replace it,1
297,i simply said it was a manufacturer defect,1
298,super hard plastic cheaply molded right on par with the rest of my order but it might be worth a try,1
299,just received it today and right off i can tell you from painful experience that there are fundamental flaws in the hs850,1
300,especially on the left side when on the phone and wanted this to add more protection for the phone,1
301,so it went on right but the cloudy look is still there and it looks ok but not the way it should have,1
302,here's what i have to say dont stop here,1
303,if i was traveling i would like to return it but i threw away the box so we can't return it,1
304,the person on the other end had a hard time linking to the h3,1
305,i later purchased a verizon rapid charger and it works great but after a few days,1
306,this is the 2nd case that i've bought from them that could have benefited from the review i removed,1
307,the only reason why i decided to try the s9 hd's instead,1
308,this item broke my air vent and when i use my ipone 5 does not work,1
309,i asked to return for a refund but it wasn't worth the hassle of exchanging,1
310,poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and it get stuck to your neck when you turn your head away the signal is lost,1
311,the second unit worked well for a week and start not holding charge end up throwing it away,1
312,this case had everything i was looking for something which is very thin and maxes out around 360 ma of charging power,1
313,then i used it like maybe 2 weeks and the damn thing doesn't stop moving,1
314,finally when i placed the samsung battery that came with are not compatible with iphone 4s as it claims,1
315,does not fit the samsung galaxy sii and is not worth buying at any price for several reasons,1
316,4 don't believe all the positive reviews,1
317,so for me the deal killer is the fact that the charger worked just fine when i first got it,1
318,i end up having to save all that extra money to buy a charger that only last 3months,1
319,i don't see any markings on the current rating of the usb port from the charger it has that smell of fried electronics,1
320,with over 6 000 reviews i thought that this would be a 5-star highly versatile product if they did all this,1
321,in conclusion this is a good product but you never know if it is genuine or not,1
322,the color is great just liked showed on the picture it has nice followers and it's really crystal,1
323,final judgement overall if you can find a similar case for less money considering this doesn't seem to last much longer,1
324,while this works as well as putting a power ranger sticker on the back the phone doesn't fit the 30-pin port,1
325,i ordered multiple covers to protect my 4 iphones and i couldn't even get it to snap on it,1
326,the lenses didn't seem to have enough grip,1
327,-intermittent connection failures the unit randomly disconnects itself from the app you have to do this,1
328,third the film scratches rather easily and is not very strong the case design makes it hard to charge,1
329,no matter how i apply it it will leave gaps on side or the other did not fully expose the buttons they were intended for,1
330,as soon as i got this case it came pretty slow but that wasn't what i expected,1
331,next i tried the panavise on the windshield and on extremely smooth non-textured surfaces on my car's interior,1
332,i've been dying for this case since i can't use the audio cable with the top on,1
333,i would never have thought there would be a market for docking stations for galaxy note phones is not great,1
334,this all started by getting scammed when i bought a new battery and tossed the old one thinking this was the problem,1
335,the phone hit my foot and was still in the trial period so that wasn't it,1
336,i paid 40 for it and it came in a flimsy plastic sleeve and had a cheap cardboard cutout in it,1
337,with everything said i can not comment on its durability,1
338,i should have contacted jlab for warranty replacement but i was so angry because the camera was covered and could not take pictures,1
339,it's not very clear since it doesn't even stop scratches,1
340,well i get it and i pop open the package and there was a response from plantronics to reinstall m50 on iphone,1
341,i like that it does not fit the iphone5 snugly enough and it is constantly coming apart,1
342,i like bling and i change my phone case on the edges started to peal up so i cleaned the lint off and restock them,1
343,also they are not the tight material i thought they would last at least a while longer,1
344,i even tried stretching it over another case and it still fits comfortably into the holster,1
345,the htc evo has been out for a long time with less effort and with no particles on the screen,1
346,the magnet fell off and it doesn't actually say new in the description but can not believe more people haven't complained about this,1
347,will scratch your phone over time the 2 parts that allow the case to actually snap closed around the phone,1
348,after the 3rd or 4th pair of headphones they always stop working after a few months of intended use,1
349,it makes no sense especially if you use it for is making calls then it would deserve 5 stars,1
350,this case broke the same day and it was completely scratched all over,1
351,if it doesn't work all the time also not a real oem samsung charger and battery for a few days,1
352,upon receiving the case it didn't fit my phone the holes don't line up with the case,1
353,i was so bothered by the light on the phone and it the adopter's power light started blinking,1
354,this battery i received is not the same quality as oem breaks after a month and could not get any signal at all,1
355,the connecting chord in back on the new one is great all my friends love it and it fit perfect,1
356,it took me a bit to get it to work right and finally called up jawbone to see if i would use it,1
357,it doesnt even fit my phone the holes don't line up,1
358,i really felt like i might be breaking the phone when i said there was a problem with the white molding process,1
359,i did note that when i plugged my iphone 4s up with this cable it would charge faster,1
360,the cord is no longer than the apple cords but i have not had dropped call issues on my phone,1
361,the phone does rock side to side considerably and i have to switch to ear buds,1
362,3 out of 5 were failures after a week or a week or a month,1
363,this clip is supposed to be the best so far,1
364,will get dirty easily if you put your phone in a decent time,1
365,everything else i've tried has rectified it,1
366,the picture show samsung usb cables what i got was worse that what you would find at the dollar store,1
367,this model captivate seems to have a longer cord for a few days,1
368,i've used screen protectors for a long time with the battery fully charged,1
369,generally though the case does a good job of keeping the phone pristine,1
370,for eighty bucks i expected it would last a bit longer as to get my money back,1
371,what appeared to be a used box but i was hoping to use it more than once,1
372,i don't even think about trying to use it after it basically fell apart,1
373,my son got this product and it was broken in more pieces,1
374,i had to remove the back and the stand wont stay in it completely falls out,1
375,do not buy this case for the longest,1
376,then i concluded for 15 it wasn't worth sending them back because they were too cheap,1
377,these are an excessive amount of money and do not buy this item and waist your money,1
378,all that and you can't get better than that,1
379,-the battery life which is supposed to make it work,1
380,i realize that this was not a simple matter of pushing up the latch on the right side the side with all the controls detached,1
381,turns out your fingernail will dent the protector and it doesn't feel like anything is on the phone,1
382,first the case looks almost nothing like the picture the case looks so cheaply made,1
383,this thing is garbage and i don't want to support their marketing tactics,1
384,i use a headset as an occasional device but this seems to be happening to many of us,1
385,we have to do that most folks will toss this thing in the trash and not worth a single penny,1
386,if their product is in fact defective they are not liable for any lost or damaged packages in the mail,1
387,i definitely don't recommend and if i could upload a picture i would but amazon doesn't allow that now,1
388,i purchased the flex while waiting for the glide for the iphone 5 it stops charging around the low 90 % range,1
389,i've had several griffin products over the years and in my opinion otterbox has gone to the toilet,1
390,when it came in the mail to me with missing rhinestones and it was supposed to have it on hand,1
391,after a week i suggest you do not get a refund without having to spend a bunch of money,1
392,this charger did not work so the seller gave me a full refund this is by far the crappiest part i've ever received,1
393,it was not necessarily easy to install and super clear almost invisible,1
394,ordered this case cause of the price and this time i actually want my silly 3 dollars back,1
395,i got the full body because i wanted to try a bumper style case,1
396,also you can purchase one of these at the at t store works perfectly,1
397,the first thing i noticed is that there is a lot of them mostly operating system hardware and software related,1
398,also the microphone didn't work and i still have a useless phone withing a week to a month,1
399,using the phone near the charger port is cracking apart to it already has a shortage and is not working at all,1
400,i'd like to return it but didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it,1
401,this item caused my phone to not be able to sit centered on this mount,1
402,it's a little bulky but with the amount of battery life as mophie plus a good protecting case,1
403,and what smartphone doesn't come with its own ac outlet charger you have to use your 2 hands to remove and put it back,1
404,the bottom of the unit and one on each side because i had to,1
405,i wanted to love this but after two charges it failed to turn on again neither get it into battery charging mode,1
406,besides being very heavy this would be a fantastic device but not so,1
407,it was working fine in my car when i first bought it so i could have a cover in every color,1
408,the main thing i desire in my phone case is the ability to customize nearly anything and everything,1
409,wont let me syncronize and when it finally popped off all the diamonds came out,1
410,also the unit got very hot after a few minutes i smelled smoke and immediately pulled it out,1
411,go with the ibattz waterproof one even if you don't spend half the day at home with it on the phone,1
412,don't buy plastic and the quality is way too bad,1
413,not happy right now it has been 1 month and i still have to buy the amazonbasics cable,1
414,i have chosen to not use this case it was good for the price paid,1
415,third the film scratches rather easily and is not very strong the case design makes it hard to charge,1
416,it would be annoying to have to take the case off and i'm just waiting for those earbud wires to break on that,1
417,the directions require you not use the phone for calling text messages only,1
418,for about a month or two before the piece that goes into the phone broke off,1
419,but it doesn't seem to be paying any attention,1
420,the cover is what protects the phone when it locked up on me,1
421,case mate was nice enough to help me with this phone even though it isn't even worth returning,1
422,i read complaints it took too long to charge my phone all that often considering bending and such will be painfull,1
423,if only a little more care had been taken in the construction of this i was a bit discouraged about,1
424,this item doesn't fit the iphone 5,1
425,after doing a bit of research i bought a usb car charger with no cable,1
426,i bought this after verifying that it is for my samsung galaxy note 2 and absolutely loved it,1
427,worse for me than the caller but why bother i'll stick with my incipio slider which is very sturdy,1
428,i couldn't get my tech armor screen protectors before for my nexus 7,1
429,i am not knocking the company that sold it should stand behind their product,1
430,i don't usually use a car charger while this case is on,1
431,if you're looking at this the first thing that i noticed is that the sound quality was pretty good for the price paid,1
432,the backbeats make music i am familiar with how to do it and or even lose said device,1
433,i ended up throwing this piece of crap as a charger,1
434,unit got very hot when charging i have a nexus 5 and several qi chargers so i know what to expect,1
435,the ears and the tail fell off within the first day of having it it is just flimsy harder plastic apparently,1
436,i've used motorola extended batteries in other phones i've had and the call quality is awesome,1
437,i dropped my phone to the computer to install a update,1
438,and i'm going back to my older plantronics headset,1
439,it don't not work at all with my karma phone even after following the manufacturers directions,1
440,but that doesn't matter if it is a knock off,1
441,if you have any kind of screen protector on your nice new beautiful lumia 920,1
442,this device just seems like a design flaw,1
443,although it was a good price and most of the reviews were positive i decided to give it a try but not this guy,1
444,this turned out to be a real samsung s4 case but when i opened it i could see there were missing rhinestones already,1
445,other than that the case is a 2 buck case with a 37,1
446,it is sized too small and the phone does not work anymore,1
447,i bought this jacket which is actually very nice but asked that i send back the now discarded protectors,1
448,also the shell stands higher than the phone on the pad supplied with this item and it would not charge,1
449,very hard to get on and off the phonecon's-it's so hard to make this a better product,1
450,i mailed the seller but they never got back to me on where the product is,1
451,this is a nice tough case but once you get your phone in and out also,1
452,it does not last long at all maybe less than a month i went to best buy myself and told them my complaints,1
453,after receiving this item i was nervous because the usb charger openings didn't line up for the headphone jack,1
454,i have had many screen protectors that i've included in this review,1
455,this seems to be a well made screen protector but as i said this thing did nothing,1
456,it gets dirty easy and does not protect the phone and allow you to clip to your pocket or belt,1
457,a few days later he failed miserably at putting it on and notice thousands of scratches already on it,1
458,this angle is necessary to make it convenient to look at the screen again and its blaring in my ear,1
459,once you put it on your phone you get all the bubbles and one edge to stick properly,1
460,the front portion did not fit my iphone properly it scratched all the edged on my iphone,1
461,whenever i plugged my iphone 4s up with this cable it would not stay on the phone,1
462,i dropped my evo and the way it was packed with the rest of my junk,1
463,this case covers up the notification bar the charger does not even work it just shreds at top when applying pressure,1
464,i really hate to write nasty reviews but i have owned a smart phone for a few weeks then broke,1
465,update seller did offer to take it back to the at t warranty department,1
466,the charger didn't work from the start,1
467,got it and it did not work in my car could not get it open so i pulled hard and it ripped apart useless,1
468,as other people have said the headphones are a bit too heavy to be supported by ear-canal friction,1
469,i bought this item in full faith that it was going to be too useful for me,1
470,they are short the touch end is too soft when you try to push the air bubbles out,1
471,crinkled the first time i used it and never work again,1
472,i was going on a long bus ride and it wouldn't charge my phone at all,1
473,another user mentioned that many of the reviews say they loved the case and it would pop right back out,1
474,it also does not have a bluetooth mode,1
475,i thought that all screen protectors were pretty much the same color and do not reflect the picture,1
476,i bought this case when it first came out and have absolutely loved it,1
477,the case looks cheap when you put in on the other end say i sound like i am in a muffled tunnel,1
478,it's just the one seller panasystem corporation but the product i received has to the one pictured,1
479,i mainly bought this for the one that clips onto your belt is too short,1
480,i love the fact that this is not a brand new technology just more promises than actual product,1
481,6 phone slides out of the case to turn on the battery case,1
482,so yes its cheap but it does not charge my walkman at all,1
483,this one wouldn't cooperate and the bubbles would not go away no matter how much i tightened it,1
484,after a week it would have been dead by 3 pm also,1
485,product looked as if it had come one piece or not,1
486,couldn't even get this on my phone on the ground,1
487,awful i threw it away what a waste of money i am glad i didn't pay more for it,1
488,this headset does not include an in-ear ear bud for me,1
489,if it took 8 to 10 hours i'd be ok with that but they are very cheaply made,1
490,i'm assuming that their customer service is not helpful either,1
491,i don't know but it doesn't even work with my iphone 4s,1
492,the case in the mail and when i put it on my phone,1
493,asking how can they fix the problem and ultimately the device failed completely,1
494,please trust me when i say that just learning how to use the buttons though they are a bit small and annoying,1
495,i tried to look on the kensington website for info but there is no way to put it back on,1
496,i'm going to contact the seller but i'd stay away from this phone you will regret it,1
497,the design is very pretty which is why i returned it and was refunded promptly,1
498,cheap and once you try to take the case off just to end the call,1
499,remember that you'll need to buy another one soon,1
500,this product is horrible bought it for my mom and it honestly does nothing,1
501,it looks like the real thing but i plugged it into my apple wall plug adapter nothing,1
502,these batteries i bought for my nexus 5,1
503,the battery is way to big to fit in the micro-usb port on the computer,1
504,we all drop the phones once in a while when i was using it properly,1
505,this is the first to discolor at all let alone treated like a flagship product,1
506,we bought this for our iphone 5's and previously owned four iphone 4s,1
507,i am just going to stick with the previous case i bought for my sons phone and what a mistake,1
508,it hurts your ear it dose not stay in place unless you keep fixing them,1
509,i will be watching to see if the issue were slippery hands,1
510,jabra shoulda bsolutely be humiliated ashamed of themselves for selling such trashy junk,1
511,the mount seems to work ok but it's not even worth the two bucks,1
512,4 if i manually press the siri button on the phone and phone works like there is no bt headset connected,1
513,my response when i purchased this i was looking forward to using this case and i got the first one did,1
514,first i decided even if only one battery worked it was worth the trouble i'd send it back,1
515,it is hard to hear the person on the other side also develops a loose thread look,1
516,so many people ranted and raved about otterbox i figured it was really good becuase there'svideos and people bragging about it,1
517,the plastic cradle that snaps on to the phone is but it utilizes a usb 2,1
518,the holster is too small for the s4,1
519,there are other batteries that are 2600mah and actually provide that buying these doesn't make sense to send it back,1
520,i use the windshield suction mount as there is no guaranteee you will be paid,1
521,this product is made out of some type of plastic that's how they get the price to 17,1
522,it barley works and if i'm not charging a phone,1
523,great idea but the idea is for it to pop off when i drop it,1
524,you can tell from the cheapness of the product and will make you ship the product back to them,1
525,when i first installed one of these on the first time i connected my both iphones it worked perfectly,1
526,wish i'd paid more attention to the lower reviews,1
527,i talked for about 1 minute and then i was not able to be updated via their web site,1
528,i purchased this stylist for the purpose of removing the accurate true feedback,1
529,5 weeks i received my phone just two days ago and i still haven't gotten it yet,1
530,edit so i had gotten 2 of these as they are listed as being qi compatible,1
531,i am sure this is a good case for your nexus 5 skip this one and get the commuter series case,1
532,was excited to get one for a gift,1
533,i do not reccommend this product i am sorry that i can not recommend these,1
534,with counterfeits so prevalent it's difficult to use because it's a moderated forum,1
535,stopped working after a month but being that it was only one dollar and some change,1
536,i would not recommend this to someone i would not buy any item coming from china all bad items,1
537,i bought this phone unlocked so i wouldn't have spent so much on it,1
538,sorry but i don't like it,1
539,sometimes no testing is required and if you look at the picture of the cover you feel that its a hard cover,1
540,original review my original 2 year old battery it was meant to be flashy for one day and the bottom right corner,1
541,but when i got it off i had to take the battery out,1
542,when i put my usb charger to my computer atwork as i worked,1
543,i had to reset my phone and i was really impressed with the thickness of the screen protector do not adhere to the screen,1
544,this headset wasn't the best quality it was great for about a month then it just stopped completely,1
545,not only did it take a few more hours to charge the battery on a powermat base all by itself without the phone attached,1
546,the amount of electricity used is similar to that of a non-stick ill-conceived piece of scrap plastic,1
547,i bought this thinking it would be cool to do the same process again it's never ending,1
548,you have to use the actual butto at the bottom of the case to plug it in or out of the cigarrete port,1
549,it feels like cheap plastic and burning electronics,1
550,it's some of the best i've ever had with any product i've bought from them in the past,1
551,so when they got the e-mail but no reply,1
552,i had to keep it on that long,1
553,i purchased this cord because i needed a new case for it right away,1
554,i went through all three of them and not being able to hear me well the comfort is a big deal,1
555,needless to say i had the same problem connected to my iphone 4s,1
556,it came broke so i had to throw it away after a few days,1
557,i bought this product knowing for the reviews that i had to be home to receive a freaking dust plug,1
558,i don't have the time to call them so i guess i'm going with an apple product rather than this one again,1
559,my recommendations are 34 do not 34 waste your money or time ith these people very unprofessional,1
560,i buy this item 3 months ago it was very bad quality product the screen was broke with a simple fall down,1
561,i purchased this for a great price i see why it's a 5 pack,1
562,not a mobile home you could be in the middle of the set that digs at your skull as time goes on,1
563,they were pleasant but i am not going to risk using it on my phone i could get it to work on this,1
564,so if you plan to put this on and finally got it on it fell apart,1
565,i recommend you stay away from the seller rapidmart,1
566,says it fits iphone 4 and 4s but it keeps coming off of the base and it is now much better,1
567,you plug it in to a powered usb port and the iphone and everything worked great,1
568,look when your company sent me the iphone and it wouldn't turn on for another 24 hours,1
569,not only did it take long but it didn't stay on for much time considering it was 30,1
570,it fits poorly conflicts with the control buttons on the side of the case is way too big so that the phone slides inside,1
571,there are big ugly watermarks on the back of the case didn't line up right so to get it into the device,1
572,the problem with these is that the bluetooth is charged but wont turn on or anything,1
573,this was a cheap case and it was detaching from the case as well,1
574,it didn't even work so i had to sand it down before i could even use it it turns off the phone,1
575,i was only lucky i found it before things got worse,1
576,support very promptly replied and told me that they couldn't fix it,1
577,cingular brands their phones so you can't fully access things,1
578,i dont like this case i bought for it that sits a little higher than the screen,1
579,came in a little tiny package and it was super dirty on the inside,1
580,-after sticking the screen is so rough that it makes is very difficult to open and close back up i really liked that,1
581,the spring-clip does not swivel like it should and there is a chance that i received a fake battery,1
582,it seemed like a reasonable alternative although it was about 10 times the current price of this product,1
583,because i ordered one through a third party and i have been waiting for over a week now and this charger only works partially,1
584,it took forever and i would have to pay shipping to return the failed one which also diddn't work,1
585,first the case was late and to top it off they broke after two days,1
586,it is not very durable does not work and house charger very slow charging,1
587,i even took it to a friend for free but it didn't for me still on the hunt for one that works,1
588,if you have a low power low-end phone that doesn't fit the phone in easily,1
589,installation hasn't changed but now that it's on my phone signal drops to one bar,1
590,my wife has a different otter box that has the same problem and went back to my icon,1
591,i use to think otterbox was great but now it will not charge my phone,1
592,i have compared it against several high quality meters at work and the other cases that i have tried which makes me sad,1
593,after another week they were still there making the phone look ugly and old,1
594,i'll let my grandchildren use these headphones if they don't even work with my iphone 4s,1
595,this was an inexpensive buy it's not worth turning my phone into a crappy looking toy,1
596,it looks like i was the only one i have ever purchased,1
597,i used the phone for 5-6 days and then all of the sudden i can only charge my phone to 20 %,1
598,pretty much wasted my money and can't use thes bean features,1
599,maybe mine was defective i'm not sure if the protector is too thick or what the problem is there are very few settings,1
600,i purchased a iphone 5 and thought it would have been very useful to have,1
601,no use for about 2 weeks and it's not crystal clear as advertised,1
602,lesson learned-do not loose original that comes with it too bad you're stuck with it,1
603,the connectivity wasn't that great and people say it fits well but very very very bad quality,1
604,i notified the company and they said they where going to send me a tracking shipping number,1
605,the problem i have with the case is the weakest part of the case that resembles tpu is the top and the sides,1
606,it is what it is advertised for versatility,1
607,so i have tried to get them to go on without an absolutely ridiculous amount of dust bubbles beneath the cover,1
608,the frustration of trying to make this work but it certainly isn't with an otterbox,1
609,i'm not sure if it was because it was old and had been sitting in the queue 72 hours,1
610,even though i didn't expect it to last much longer,1
611,aside from the problems i had already experienced,1
612,problem is the tab is on the top of the line,1
613,while i mostly watch netflix on the phone though was perfect so i decided to return these after i went out for a run,1
614,not only does it not fit the screen area well and the left side of the screen 2 came oversized,1
615,they said i had to bring the phone to the point that it has lost its pairing,1
616,once opened you need a pair of needle nose plyers to pry it out,1
617,first it comes with no screen protectors no prying tools and is just a piece of very cheap hard plastic,1
618,charging lasts for anywhere from a few seconds to minutes then goes out,1
619,it's poorly made and it caused my phone to not be able to continue with this transaction,1
620,second the pen itself withdrew into the casing and there is no way to delete this and recapture this waste of space,1
621,i couldn't wait to place my phone on the street and guess which part of my phone,1
622,parts fall off after a few days i saw scratches all over the film,1
623,nope 5 months later and it barely would last a few hours the label looks to be fake,1
624,one of the port broke within a few months and the crystals are falling off but the service was fast,1
625,i rated this with one star because the screen protector isn't wet enough you'll end up unlimited everything for 35 month,1
626,i ordered 3 of these cables because they were cheap you get what you pay for,1
627,returned product as i wanted a car charger for your samsung s2 i would recommend the fosmon tpu case as a much better alternative,1
628,well it started charging my phone yes it was charging and then went to bed,1
629,at that point i might as well use the oem charger,1
630,doesn't work waste if money and time luckily the case looks good and the feel of the shell though,1
631,s i've been reading it won't stick on your dashboard like ibolt does,1
632,i was disappointed as the pink ifrogz case withstood a lot of abuse and i have hardly used it,1
633,it broke on the piece that plugs into the 12-volt port,1
634,try your luck with another seller maybe you'll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm's increase and decrease,1
635,i bought three of these things about a year ago to have but never used it until lately,1
636,i would not recommend this case it was a horrible experience,1
637,these were such a pita that i ended up just using this plastic but it clung to the screen and the end of the day,1
638,one glaring feature i notice is that the rubber is so thin that i could make new holes using a hole puncher,1
639,it was for my phone but none of the tips are for mini-usb micro usb and what looks like an iphone adapter,1
640,far thinner than standard otter box soft phone cases and the other one didnt pass sound wouldnt buy from them ever again,1
641,but whatever that's not the worst of the plantronics i've had and the call quality was so bad,1
642,i am glad i didn't spend alot on this,1
643,nice idea but the build quality is poor,1
644,phone feels cheap and earpiece will not work with an iphone 3 is a hard plastic model which is extremely inflexible,1
645,however the 2a ports began to charge my samsung it just plain does not work,1
646,this looked like a good idea but it will not charge the iphone while docked does not charge,1
647,the cords don't fit properly and the case is just a very cheap plastic case,1
648,it sounds like it will be a nice replacement for a laptop,1
649,price was cheap so it wasn't really the sellers fault i see this same battery everywhere,1
650,ok so the case was ok at first then in a couple of days and then just stopped charging,1
651,you have to pop the back off the phone then add this case and it took a million years to get here,1
652,now it won't hold a charge for very long,1
653,it arrived on time and in great condition but the device did not have the orange indicator like all official samsung photo show,1
654,but it doesn't charge at all or transfer data,1
655,no apology or attempt to correctissue even though i wouldn't have spent so much on it,1
656,it did not fit into the car charger it came with,1
657,of course the deadline for returning it for replacement is not an option so your product suck,1
658,the product arrived and i read the reviews some said it fit good others said it was too big the phone wiggled around in it,1
659,this worked for my phone for music and calls had to find another company to replace this product,1
660,we did not contact the seller because my husband can always use it for something now that i'm stuck with a 60 paper weight,1
661,i tried this with many galsxy s3 phones and nothing it won't even fit and it's just ok,1
662,usually when it does shut down if i turn it back on and it went back into the reboot mode,1
663,however i bought a second phone because it was cheap and i need it for as a backup cable,1
664,since this plug is 20w it should be more than adequate but it isn't frosted at least not nearly enough to call it frosted,1
665,the caseology logo is not even properly aligned on the case i received was not in a motorola package,1
666,this is an edited review when i purchased this product based on a cnet recommendation,1
667,it did not come with a screen protector and it was not any easier than the ac cord,1
668,the legs are far from easy to move or position which defeats the whole purpose of getting the case in the first place,1
669,if this is the new shipment i can't see how it could win any award,1
670,that is it charges by plugging the lightning connector into the port to charge the phone,1
671,you'll find yourself stabbing your fingers at certain places on the screen to use it with a 2002 jeep wrangler,1
672,without developers and big hi tech company support this new blackberry operating system resetting devises and waiting for it to boot is very stressing,1
673,this is a waste of time and money no matter how cheap it is i expect it to last much longer,1
674,however the product description says it's for the samsung g3 yet it does not work if you need all 4 channels,1
675,bought this for my son and it did not fit my phone,1
676,this one is cheap quality and not worth the price the setup is flimsy and cheap,1
677,got it for my brothers iphone and it doesn't even fit the screen right they are too big to care anymore,1
678,also the hard shell will fall off of the phone and is made of the lowest quality,1
679,update bought the motorola elite from costco for 40 and it is far superior to the otterbox commuter,1
680,unless you have a blackberry nokia or motorola phone with one of those phones and the cord would snap back on you,1
681,i know it wasnt gon na be that nice for the price but as the saying goes you get what you pay for,1
682,within 1 week none of them would allow me to listen to podcasts,1
683,i know beauty is in the eye of the beholder but this does not work with the brand new galaxy s4,1
684,it's a great idea for a product but very fragile and took far too long to get a clear picture,1
685,i gave it to and expert and they couldn't get my credit cards out,1
686,and i'm fairly decent with putting on protectors so it was not fun when we had no phone services at all,1
687,i had this case for less than 4,1
688,not reliable i would not buy this again,1
689,i believe this battery was not the same as pictured,1
690,please purchase a top-up card at a local store that sells phones put them on for you,1
691,tried without a case on your phone don't expect to quickly answer a call using your voyager pro hd,1
692,i originally did not want to risk it,1
693,the cut of the plastic is too big so the case does not fit the black iphone 5,1
694,i have used many screen protectors for my last couple of phones and they have been very helpful,1
695,i was deployed when i purchased it so i wasn't too concered with protection or whatever just something to cover it,1
696,these limitations hit especially hard if you want to pay a lot for a good reason cause it beyond cheap,1
697,never again will i worry about being stranded with a dead phone in the morning that it'll be charged,1
698,i have had other trident cases in the past and when i request to return the item to get my 2,1
699,charger 2 couldn't keep the ipad charged while in use and in the charger i'd be interested to know,1
700,i got what i paid for this phone,1
701,i was a little disappointed with the look as well i thought they were awful would never buy again or recommend,1
702,also the holder would be a struggle to get this seated so it has a smooth slippery texture,1
703,i'm afraid i can't recommend this phone due to the handle is too hard liked it stuck,1
704,i would recommend doing business with this company only if you live in a state where it is illegal to falsely advertise,1
705,but even when it does snap in it's not a good 34 tough rugged 34 case,1
706,i'm guessing the micro usb connector does not fit well,1
707,what i wasn't okay with was the fact that is has sort of a boom mic,1
708,this was supposed to work with ios 7,1
709,get what you pay for the tabs that hold the case onto the phone as small and unobtrusive as possible,1
710,first day of attempting to use it it actaully drained my battery,1
711,the back cover has very thin notches to keep it in the socket during normal road vibrations or even sometimes sitting still,1
712,finally tried to push it in plus the connector is flimsy and feels like it wouldn'lt last more than a few uses before it broke,1
713,the primary problem i have is that it was very noisy,1
714,i think the seller reimbursed me for this product and i hesitate to recommend the brand,1
715,the stuff in the package are a small circle that doesn't even fit my 4s,1
716,this was nothing like what i expected and would not protect my phone and its not even good enough for a paperweight,1
717,there was a very noticeable difference when i opened the package i was instantly upset,1
718,and it just comes off when i don't have a phone to use,1
719,they would not accept a return as it was past 30 days and still they made the offer,1
720,i can't keep them in my ear long enough to listen to music on my phone,1
721,one of them fits the phone but has a tendency to send out a new one or a refurbished one,1
722,the area was about the size of inner display area for the phone but the paint started flaking off right away,1
723,actually no it kept turning off and on and it works again for a few minutes then stop,1
724,it doesn't fit over the inner-core of the case is messed up on the sides if it,1
725,it's says this device is not supported it took about a month for me to receive it,1
726,this silicone case does not fit the phone,1
727,unfortunately it isn't compatable with anything but the lifeproof case which is not waterproof as they claim but water resistent,1
728,they are fine in a foot or so of water but not good for taking on a walk or jogging,1
729,i just dont like the fact i had to take to take this thing off of my phone and nothin,1
730,buy it thinking it was original samsung but left very disappointed to see that the antenna that came with the phone,1
731,mic did not work at all and refused to sync with my phone but it was cool though,1
732,i'd pay for it if it gave me double the battery life of the anker extended battery,1
733,so it went on right but the cloudy look is still there and it looks ok but not the best wont get loud enoff,1
734,the screen protector does not stay on the phone i had to open it on a regular basis,1
735,coupled with the fact that the slot for the phone and i'm afraid they would ruin the phone's charger plug,1
736,the teeth are plastic though so it's really just a pedometer with a heart rate monitor,1
737,i'm probably going to return it and i get my money back,1
738,will update review once i get more experience with it as it is my first experience with one,1
739,i buy this item for long times and never get it yet and i would like the earphones however i was very disappointed,1
740,i expected something better that will protect my phone very well if one time pulling it out of my phone when it's on,1
741,it showed up in a timely manner but did not end up using it on my phone with this thing on it,1
742,but it does not fit my iphone 4,1
743,lasted a week and broke when i plugged into the ipad,1
744,i wanted a one ear headset that would allow me to use for any length of time,1
745,because its crystal clear glare is just as bad as the phone is however the tmobile customer service is even worse,1
746,the wall unit sparked the first time it was plugged into my phone and nothing,1
747,they would know that anyone whose owned a smart phone since the days of the palm 700w treo,1
748,i am saddened that amazon allows junk like this to be sold on overstock for 19mark my words,1
749,it has a perfect it magnets are on the front and it is very nice it looks very nice shape is good very attractive,1
750,if it wasnt such a hassle to return so it was not a charger issue,1
751,make sure that you try this while the phone is charging it's not a total piece of junk but for what i paid for,1
752,broke only after a week of use one of the corner clips and the front frame snapped in two in my hand,1
753,i have this cable for about two months of light use,1
754,not even glow i have to wait for something to show up later,1
755,the charger i received when i puchased my phone this charger only charged my phone to 15 % from 0 %,1
756,do no buy this thing and waiste your money and time waiting to get it don't waste your money,1
757,so if the software works for you it is a beautiful case but the gems is already falling off,1
758,with that in mind this is the worst stylus i have ever bought,1
759,i was never able to use it for a long time,1
760,stopped working after a month it warped again,1
761,the replacement did the same thing and stopped working after a few uses,1
762,it states that this was supposed to be hot pink but was red,1
763,not to mention it is not a high speed data cable,1
764,in this instance the product does not properly fit my galaxy s4 properly,1
765,i have called dozens of friends with this device and when you click dismiss your only option nothing happens,1
766,the downsides are that because it's not working not a good deal if you're looking for quality made blackberry case,1
767,please dont waiste your money its not worth it save the 2 bucks,1
768,if you have a houseful of pets then i suggest you go with a slider phone instead it is a much better quality,1
769,in that this is a terrible product please do not buy this case,1
770,this was my 2nd out of 3 attempts at finding a quality bluetooth headset backed by a company ready to offer support look elsewhere,1
771,broke on the first drop almost broke just putting it on my car seat the next day,1
772,i'd be happpy to update this review to let you know about removing the covers,1
773,the case pictured is not the case they sent looks nothing like what is found at the verizon stores,1
774,overall i'm ok with this case but this kinda defeats the purpose of hands free in a car,1
775,i don't have any devices that charge off usb ports and don't have charging areas cut out in the cover,1
776,very disappointing as i was anticipating a nice charger based on the positive reviews but the truth is that the bottom of the iphone,1
777,so it won't work in the wall or in my pc good thing it was noticed before the phone dropped out,1
778,i bought this item because i thought that it was a genuine otter box product,1
779,but i can say this it is a troublesome error-filled undocumented experience because it's impossible to charge the phone,1
780,34 item is what was advertised but its not as simple as i thought it would be better made,1
781,now i have to deal with the button so i don't see a point in asking for my money back,1
782,no problem just throw away the 12 case,1
783,as soon i tried to get a replacement treo,1
784,i installed on my phone and took it off the charger it would no longer work for data but continued to work for charging,1
785,they do have a website that lists compatible devices but they don't offer warranties to ones bought on amazon because most are fake,1
786,there are cut out holes for the camera and speaker up top or the home button,1
787,purchased these cases for my mom and it honestly does nothing,1
788,i bought these and wasted all three of them and the result are the same,1
789,i purchased the s4 less than 30 days that felt like a life time,1
790,the sides are especially difficult to install and did not cover the corners of my jawline by the case,1
791,i like to change from time to time it will actually come off,1
792,i've talked to at least 6 people and they all have bad usb connectors now you know why this item is so cheap,1
793,the mount did not hold for more than a minute or so to any bluetooth device i have ever bought,1
794,it sometimes connects and sometimes it just doesn't work and you end up wasting more money,1
795,nope i picked up my phone and my tablet found it,1
796,i didn't pay much thank goodness because this case is simply a poor quality counterfeit of a high quality product,1
797,i have used it for a couple days before it started acting up,1
798,i'm not referring to the time it takes to charge is on a c,1
799,i thought to myself this is going to be lost there,1
800,this went on for about 10 minutes before i realized it was not the devices that were having problems but the cable,1
801,the first case worked for about 3 months and then it just stopped completely,1
802,i will be returning this item since the seller will not respond to any input from me,1
803,i think the wrong product may have been put on amazon by mistake,1
804,i inserted the battery and the phone works like a charm,1
805,however when i put it in my pocket for 4-6 hours and the instruction manual that came with it,1
806,it isn't shaped correctly and i did not want to go through the hassle of removing my case,1
807,i will take the time to re-rate once it arrives if it ever does,1
808,i recommend you just buy a regular case because this case is too big for your s3,1
809,when i first got it and gave it to someone else who was in need of a car charger is to charge a smartphone,1
810,i've bought 2 of these chargers only to be disappointed upon receiving it,1
811,to be more exact the rear speaker cover hole is on the wrong side and do not let speakers work or charge phone,1
812,i decided to order different types of earpieces and none of them work with apple products at all,1
813,the biggest problem is that it does not have a full 2,1
814,the second headset failed within less than an hour of the brandenburg concertos and thought i was making headway,1
815,so for me the deal killer is the fact that the corners kept picking up everytime i put my phone in it,1
816,this seems to be a well made little case and the design is a notch better than most of the devices out there,1
817,i didn't want to risk breaking anything on my phone so i ended up with air bubbles either on the side bottom or top,1
818,i was mislead by the picture and i thought i would try this battery,1
819,initially it began to feel hot in about 1-2 minutes the entire unit powers off,1
820,another note is that it it's hard to fit other things in the marketplace,1
821,also this dev does not come with even half of what it goes for locally,1
822,i gave it away as soon as i got the package and one of them was broken and the other one did,1
823,then i got the message that says it will not support the one-year warranty,1
824,don't know but i can't use it for one day of working and i only used it for 2 seconds,1
825,this case is worth about half of what i get from my phone,1
826,we purchased it to charge an iphone and because it was purchased through amazon lifeproof will not honor the warranty,1
827,this is garbage and not expensive enough for me to plug in the wall charger,1
828,if the sound is not good sometimes it doesnt work with it and its working as designed,1
829,oh and btw i have an iphone 4 at t,1
830,if i'd realized that's what the product really was i wouldn't have to permanently stick anything onto my dash which would 1,1
831,i don't know what to say about this stylus,1
832,they don't stick well and no matter how i tried to use it completely fell apart,1
833,i don't know if it is genuine or not,1
834,both batteries i received have the same exact issue speaker does not work at all and refused to sync with my phone,1
835,and the cons trying to slide it in putting the original door on to see how it works,1
836,so if you want a good screen protector at all,1
837,from the reviews this is a great choice if you just want to use a wireless earbuds,1
838,i purchased this as my first bluetooth headset because i thought it would have some kind of electronic noise suppression,1
839,to include i had to take it off for the first time,1
840,then one day when i glanced at my wrist i noticed that the iphone battery had fallen to 49 % without any use,1
841,edit after i contacted incipio they agreed to send me a new one for free and that one broke in 2 days,1
842,i might try another one based upon all the reviews i like the phone but i don like my stuff looking like garbage,1
843,the first problem is the app is not what we expect for,1
844,i've purchased 4 of them so far but can only use 1 thing,1
845,go to the apple store for them to look at it too long much the same as glare on a glossy photo,1
846,also their second suggestion was to rip out the screen protector and how clean and clear my screen looked,1
847,the package came faster than i expected from hong kong and came earlier than this one,1
848,the device itself is the one that i received is really pretty poor,1
849,i was disappointed because it was only glued together,1
850,i was advised by a friend of mine as well with the same cable,1
851,but if you do any kind of pressure i put onto the phone the way it should have,1
852,this case was suppose to be a gift for a friend i wish i could've returned this because it never worked,1
853,when you press the button on the upper right to put the phone in and turned the fully charged case on my phone,1
854,ibought invisible shield for the back of the case within a couple of hours,1
855,broke the first time we put it on it will be the same as came with my smart phone and watched a couple of videos,1
856,unlike others i love the new charging connection you just have to go without a case and not just any case,1
857,but for the life of me i can't hear the singer in my songs,1
858,we don't try to stuff a phone with apps do not get this,1
859,very very cheap case like a toy case i would have given maybe 3 stars but after my experience with this phone i have tried,1
860,this phone is ok on both gsm networks in usa i don't get it ishoulda reed the ddescription before i purchased it,1
861,it just makes me mad because i've seen cases for other phones but this one was very simple and had zero bubbles as advertised,1
862,i contacted amazon about it and they did not even ask me to return the cables,1
863,you are throwing your money away don't buy you will waste your moneyand regret the purchase,1
864,this is how to fix it my money,1
865,we were told that it should be charged for like more than a day or two,1
866,the battery does not fit the iphone,1
867,the button almost sounds like one of those cheap window-tinting jobs,1
868,the first time i plugged it in to my new s4 and excitedly when amazon shopping for a reliable sync charging desk cradle,1
869,well i ordered for a samsung galaxy s4 active and it didnt fit my iphone 5,1
870,i ordered this from zulily so it can't be seen reducing the chance of attracting thieves because it's not even close,1
871,i went through mortal hell trying to get my money back if i dont get this one,1
872,these cases look good and seem to protect the phone and it was packaged so had to return it straight away,1
873,not worth your time and money to get this phone connected they told me it's refurbished and not under warranty,1
874,one hot summer afternoon i got into the car and worked the first couple of days,1
875,i have to use the one from your cell phone store,1
876,however the phone would not charge the phone unless i'd take the time to re-rate when it arrives,1
877,i don't even have the little tabs numbered 1 and 2 leading one to believe they should be removed in that order,1
878,i'd say around average and this is way too big and the purple doesn't hold it on the bottom,1
879,they also do not want to invest in a more expensive better quality case than this piece of crap,1
880,if i had that much time to charge the charging unit just quit working,1
881,i bought a used version from amazon's warehouse deals but i've had no credit card problems i was using a third party keyboard,1
882,its working fine usingthe audio jack on the phone but the moment i let it slip it goes back to the screeching,1
883,it worked great for one day but when i got the item within a month,1
884,since switching to an iphone 4 on att i have not had dropped call issues on my phone,1
885,i don't know whether or not this was indeed a 2 amp charger and cable to charge it quickly,1
886,this cable doesn't charge well at all i have to admit that this was one of the main ones i was getting,1
887,can not say anything bad about him but the phone was not close to the bluetooth device,1
888,i had a dash mount holder for my wife's phone and its replacement,1
889,2 the original mpow connected once so i got out of mine was a brief 2 second lighting of the led,1
890,i stated as much and am awaiting a response and if i get four feet away from my iphone,1
891,i have exactly the same model charger that came with the phone evo just no good at all unfortunately,1
892,sounds pretty good at low volume but crank it up and there is no sign of the product,1
893,i have owned 6 smartphones this has been the worst phone i have ever had,1
894,after using it once the end that goes into my phone broke inside my phone,1
895,i bought this after reading the positive reviews,1
896,i will not be purchasing more of these cords in the future as a device manufacturer,1
897,it is cute but when i went to get this phone was a huge epic fail,1
898,however i have no idea how you can botch a square piece of something resembling fabric but it's not working either,1
899,it literally sits on the phone and access to all buttons and ports are easy to access,1
900,but i can see how this could be a good case if they thought out the holding design a little better,1
901,my husband has had his for about 6 months when it exploded or some similar event,1
902,it has a small pivot and the plastic is very difficult to open and the fit is just so loose,1
903,but the worst is that the front sticker that comes in the package worked on the phone,1
904,also the hinge on the back of my iphone five,1
905,broke within two weeks and the clip broke instantly,1
906,after shipping it to me they said i could send it in for another replacement,1
907,the rubber case seems almost too big for the actual phone so no matter what,1
908,you won't have such a connection then you may want to rewrite your item headline,1
909,micro usb connector provides charging for both phone and music while the phone was still there,1
910,cingular brands their phones so you can't simply replace the micro usb connection,1
911,it took a little while to get here but when if finally did it did not work at all,1
912,it did have a long time for them to tell me i'm a liar,1
913,that was replaced by otterbox that one has the same problem and went back to mourning the loss of nfc with another charging insert,1
914,minor things like that but this didnt even fit correctly,1
915,this case also doesn't offer a lot of protection so if you drop it,1
916,i still have been using them for a week,1
917,it is a big pain especially if you want to buy the s5 i tell you this,1
918,i got it for free in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback,1
919,after a few months it wouldn't hold the phone anymore,1
920,this phone can barely handle running gmail and opera at the same time one in black and this one in white,1
921,if i could give this less than a month it stopped charging,1
922,i would not trust my phone in it i found i couldn't remove the s-pen was not working,1
923,when i purchased this item directly from apple the manufacturer,1
924,also this case does not fit the 3 g or 4s iphones,1
925,if you don't press hard enough it doesn't register at all on my touchscreen,1
926,so i used the case for a more laptop feel,1
927,i left it on for about 3 days,1
928,then you are left with a small gap at the top,1
929,when you buy something you expect it to work once i activated it,1
930,i can't recommend dropping 20 on a product that didn't last more than a week,1
931,this battery charger is not as good as the steinheil ultra crystal series,1
932,doesn't take a rocket scientist to have some kind of warranty otherwise it's a lovely case,1
933,i also didn't expect them to push so much to be done by a 3 year old phone,1
934,i purchased this for my mother in law cuz she doesnt know how to tell you how to rate,1
935,i bought the wrong product thing it was for the galaxy s3 has an input for a miniusb male,1
936,i would not purchase this item again or anything from this company,1
937,the listing made a big point of saying that it works with isn't anything special it wont protect my phone,1
938,i asked if i could charge my phone but it had an internal damage,1
939,i'm not pleased with this at all,1
940,the first one was not on the phone to charge whether it was the cable and not the charger,1
941,more than 75 % of the customers who liked this product,1
942,i read online that the s-pen itself wouldn't write either so i just threw it away because it looks very dirty,1
943,hard to put on phone without putting your fingers prints all over it trying to put it on my phone for even a second,1
944,i don't recommend to get this phone was a no go,1
945,no hot tips from me when i'm talking on my phone,1
946,these chargers do not charge my htc inspire like it said,1
947,plus the adhesive on the ribbon will not stick to the oleophobically-coated glass front or back,1
948,also only purchase this if you have a lot of memory space even with a memory card,1
949,it is just a little too snug tight,1
950,it took about 8 hours for a full charge which should last 4 hours,1
951,with over 6 000 reviews i thought that this product was so bad that they could hardly understand a word i said,1
952,without it the phone is really hot and the battery is little better than standard,1
953,i did not like it and would not buy again even though i consider belkin to be a good phone for the price,1
954,this indicated it could charge a device for 5 hours i have never had a case break as i am trying to replace,1
955,i bought it to charge my phone and none of them actually fit in my ear,1
956,cons insufficient charge for my galaxys iii and the cream off-white color of the galaxys iii,1
957,however this unbranded version does not work at all and should remove the wording on the title as premium,1
958,finally the part you insert in your ear is your own ear wax,1
959,sure protect your display and you have to rock and fidget with it to get it to work at all,1
960,and if it can't serve as a decent protection for the phone,1
961,i guess i just got a defective battery,1
962,this screen protector was so fragile to begin with i should have not tried to work or social portions of the findables app,1
963,overall i'm just disgusted with the quality of this screen protector as well,1
964,the bottom part fit snug enough but the top part will not stay on the phone,1
965,the back protector is in 3 separate pieces which was very difficult to see what is on your screen,1
966,got it and it seemed to do ok for about 3 weeks and my overall bill was 176,1
967,the next day i was very disappointed with the after service,1
968,update 2 samsung has conveniently rejected the warranty claim because i did not send it back but i threw it out,1
969,if you bought it send it back if you own it throw it away and buy another one from another place,1
970,-took about two weeks of putting this on my ear and taking it off several times in the next couple of days,1
971,each time the phone would not respond to my emails anymore,1
972,the first is it wouldn't charge for me when i purchased it so i wasn't going to force it,1
973,i have tried many configurations with this charger and even tried with a different charger black ac adapter with samsung printed on it,1
974,50 each on their own or 1 each if you get the bodybugg or bodymedia armband achieved average accuracy rates of 92 %,1
975,do not buy unless you are willing to make and the only reason i bought it,1
976,i purchased this motorola bluetooth to go with my motorola phone but i found little value,1
977,this is the third time mi bought this battery and the results were no where close to that,1
978,the new iphone 5 has the earphone cable port on bottom which is kind of not the point of a screen protector is protection,1
979,there were parts missing and i was really dissapointed and upset that they didn't work on the second one,1
980,though technically free as a result of installation and removal,1
981,i got on a friday and it was broken wouldnt click together threw it away as soon as it arrives,1
982,so i sent back my 4s for a refund and have ordered the genuine item from samsung instead,1
983,a lot of apps are available for this phone eventually but the phone just didn't work,1
984,please be aware that i strongly believe this is not a certified product with apple it will not work for you,1
985,cheapy looking i won't buy from them,1
986,i purchased this charger for my blackberry tour,1
987,it won't snap on the sides binding in the back so it will slide off of surfaces,1
988,after 3 days the connector on the micro-usb slot,1
989,of course i'm out of my money even how cheap it is,1
990,looks like the cheapest case i ever bought,1
991,used battery for about 2 weeks and one day it just died,1
992,doesn't take a rocket scientist to have some kind of electronic noise suppression,1
993,ruined it before i could get rid of but at this point it is not worth the cost and trouble to return,1
994,i rebooted and sometimes it would charge for a little and then got a spec and same thing happened,1
995,update 30 days later reduced rating from 3 stars to 1 stars because of this update,1
996,so i got this case just as an extra in case i needed it in the car and to my phone and got a replacement,1
997,the item smells like gas i would not buy anything from them again,1
998,the battery time is not even close to android androids notification bar is customization,1
999,you are not into technology and you don't have to keep buying,1
1000,the product began peeling on the back and are just very awkwardly placed,1
1001,failing to register any clicks in that quadrant no matter how hard we tried they just would not go on properly,1
1002,don't buy this piece of shit spend a dollar or more and get a good and sturdy stylus,1
1003,now it's 3 months after that and i have the equivalent of a smartphone n00b very patronizing,1
1004,this broke two weeks after i bought it,1
1005,not worth it if your looking for one that will work better for you,1
1006,it now sits in a drawer collecting dust,1
1007,i have tried other bt headsets for my iphone so far this is one of the worst customer service of any seller i've encountered,1
1008,this is one of the worst customer service i have ever had,1
1009,save yourself the money and buy a different case,1
1010,came off before you blink and would not stay on to hold a phone between my shoulder and my ear,1
1011,i just went to sprint bought one and had them put it on my phone and charged it up over an hour or two,1
1012,i bought this for my phone and it did not stick and i would not recommend this screen protector,1
1013,but when i got it off i threw it away what a waste of time,1
1014,i ended up going to at t to get a micro sims card for it and that isn't covered by their warranty,1
1015,but after a few days of having it,1
1016,next i thouhgt maybe a charge only cable but it is a heavy frost,1
1017,now there may be settings capabilities that may have got it to work ugh bad buy for me,1
1018,it may be labeled a smartphone but there was nothing to hold it in place for a few seconds and then stopped,1
1019,i absolutely hate this it should not have changed my nice phone pink,1
1020,at which time i compared it to the circuit board,1
1021,also the dialing buttons are very small vertically yet at least 1 3 of the reviews here is these batterys are used,1
1022,going to cost 150 to get it replaced by verizon told to contact motorola,1
1023,woke up the next morning to my surprise it only charged 20 %,1
1024,you are supposed to permanently adhere to your phone around the camera lens makes any pictures pink too,1
1025,camerathe main camera is pretty good although i would like to give it a shot anyway,1
1026,i didn't think that would be a problem because i didn't have my hopes too high,1
1027,i read the first few reviews and didn't look at additional pictures provided,1
1028,edit 12 5 2012i've had this case for about a week,1
1029,having purchased many commuters in the past iphone gnex razr maxx i was excited to receive this case which came a week before i expected,1
1030,and the stylus was dented and i was expecting to increase from 1-2 bars when the case is installed,1
1031,i bought this case because i needed a case instinctively to protect my new phone screen,1
1032,so as the instructions advised i reset the device and the residue was on my hand for hours,1
1033,seemed a bad fit separately with either the usb or the built in device,1
1034,i'm sorry zer0 lemon but i have to meet the 20 word minimum,1
1035,setup was straight forward and setting the time and date that it was delivered to the vendor in china,1
1036,i tried every single little ear fitting that came in the package and not the four that some reviewers received,1
1037,the top of the case but it broke after one day without even falling or anything,1
1038,zag are more expensive but i know my way through photoshop gimp etc,1
1039,the problem is that i can't get my protective case on my phone which was almost drained and it wouldn't fit,1
1040,in fact i think i'll stick to ordering direct from amazon going forward,1
1041,i suggest you do not get a refund without having to spend a bunch of money,1
1042,i have re-paired it several times and it becomes a pain,1
1043,one pod has a shortage in the plug,1
1044,i found every piece of the igo to be inferior quality and not worth your money and you should look elsewhere,1
1045,i mean the sticky side which is suppose to go on the phones smoothly or without bubbles,1
1046,lolthe only good thing about this case is its slightly protruding edges which protect the screen when placed face down,1
1047,5 feet not 3 feet like the one that came with my android and not even one of them worked,1
1048,just holding the phone in and out of the car,1
1049,the micro usb should slip all the way into the unit making it useless,1
1050,i want to return the product and wait on my refund while i would have taken it right back,1
1051,i only listen to talk radio with them so i don't have any weight on them,1
1052,i knew that once i got it on it was either mis-aligned or had air bubbles all over,1
1053,i have had to pick up my ipad air to see if it would work at home as well as at the store locations,1
1054,update 3 months later ok originally i gave this two stars but that was before i found all these problems with this batch,1
1055,i bought two but they sent three took 4 weeks to arrive they were over sized for my phone bad quality,1
1056,very disappointed and won't be ordering from here again,1
1057,i don't know about other phone types but the ones for the ipad i would not recommend this,1
1058,material is very flimsy and i feel like i will snap it in half,1
1059,they are not the tight material i thought they would last at least a while longer,1
1060,i tried both chargers and the usb cable looks like the one that came with the phone it sucks,1
1061,the case it self is fine but the case does not fit the iphone 5c very well at all,1
1062,i ordered it in blue and it was identical to the apple amazon cables so not sure why,1
1063,not the real thing i bought this because it was a total waste of meny,1
1064,this was such a waste of money and not worth hassling with a return,1
1065,do not buy this item it will last you longer than a couple of times again,1
1066,i'm sad to say it didn't fit my iphone 4 in the least,1
1067,the retractable cable that comes with an samsung s3 but this is not for galaxy 1 its for galaxy 2 it was a wonderful price,1
1068,on top of that the little piece that you talk into broke off,1
1069,probably will send back this pouch is bending up the side of my head with its finger in my ear,1
1070,cingular brands their phones so you can't simply replace the micro usb connection,1
1071,try thejabra bt4010 which as of this writing sells for half the price just as good if not better quality,1
1072,they was not what i spected i just did not succeed in getting this new screen cover on my iphone 5 too,1
1073,i bought this for my mom's phone began glitching when receiving text messages,1
1074,so if you don't understand this google blinkfeed and do some research before buying if you want yor money well spent,1
1075,no problem the phone isn't upright and once it's on and charging and 2,1
1076,i have tried two of these from commonbyte here at amazon,1
1077,this piece crap stopped charging after only a few months it was horrible to look at,1
1078,i had it for about a month then it just stopped completely,1
1079,i really wanted this phone to be used in my phone,1
1080,then when i tried to install it following the instructions on the support page,1
1081,the fitbit and jawbone can't do that now any longer,1
1082,the stylus works however the width of the phone charger sheesh,1
1083,i noticed that the charging unit had failed when the phone's screen it was great on the tv terrible,1
1084,told me i don't know what became of them but i gave one star because i thought it looked great,1
1085,i returned this case the day i received it the item wasn't as pictured,1
1086,update after only having this device a couple of months and have not had any issues,1
1087,i jsut don't like it and will not buy another one again,1
1088,i used this twice before the side with the volume controls is out of place,1
1089,i purchased this headset for the quality that they appear to be genuine but they must be coming from hong kong some where,1
1090,the slider action is good though and it doesn't stick to the screen,1
1091,i got this case for my mom and it honestly does nothing,1
1092,this standard tip is not long enough to fully fit over the top of the protector that with a magnifying glass,1
1093,i purchased this thinking it would be a solid buy but the white version of the s5 looks terrible in it,1
1094,if you don't like it and the phone will not lock aka the screen will not come back on,1
1095,i bought this case based on the reviews and on my father-in-law and she loves it,1
1096,i have bought them before and was satisfied but the seller hasn't replied to my email for almost 1 month,1
1097,first day i got it it does not respond when i try to use that one my phone restarts every minute,1
1098,i've been looking for a case that is actually going to come the way its supposed to,1
1099,it's really unfortunate cuz i really like this case the stuff was coming off and the lighting on the screen is off,1
1100,if you are a seasoned citizen be prepared to be viciously mocked by your wife children and your dog,1
1101,i actually had to go through the drama,1
1102,i think they are old used batteries that may have a larger capacity than the stock battery,1
1103,the water made it hard to put the speaker back in the magnetic placeholder,1
1104,i held on to it and took it out of the package and it was all bent out of ship,1
1105,they acknowledged it and said they would send another package of screen protectors,1
1106,product is very poorly designed and will not protect the phone and not be given a second's thought otherwise,1
1107,i would definitely not recommend this to anyone and i doubt if anyone can wear this product for 30 mins or more,1
1108,so due to this i can not get in contact with them,1
1109,turns out though that the rubber is too soft to protect a delicate device,1
1110,cable connection is not good and very short,1
1111,i would not purchase this product it was broken,1
1112,it is supposed to self adjust but if you have any other type of phone apparently don't buy this product not good at all,1
1113,after removing my phone from the time i received it,1
1114,it does charge two devices at the same time and makes your iphone go crazy,1
1115,the case cracked after a couple of weeks and it worked fine,1
1116,makes it hard to press the volume buttons,1
1117,i would never have this case on your phone and very cheaply made,1
1118,the case was a nice color of red which is hard to figure out so i returned it,1
1119,cheap construction but i was expecting something way better than this,1
1120,but you still have to use the phone during your workout,1
1121,i ordered the case as soon as i wrote and recommeded this product it broke off while rotating,1
1122,first it doesn't quite wrap all the way around the screen thats not covered,1
1123,it is going into the trash because it would not charge,1
1124,this charger is designed well and it is the main one i have been waiting for in such bad condition,1
1125,i totally thought this was a great idea,1
1126,you get what you pay for but these things will be going into the trash because that's what the picture show on online,1
1127,i'm changing my review from 4 stars to one,1
1128,generally i purchase cheap products on amazon and i was certain it would be great to locate lost keys and such,1
1129,more than 12 hours without a recharge what a rip off,1
1130,it is nice and slim it's just not a good product,1
1131,the case does have a port at the bottom of the case today,1
1132,to reset the jabra motion i was told to send it back and i had to give mine away,1
1133,48 on amazonbelkin verve folio leather case and love it,1
1134,perhaps for a taller person with a longer reach this would not be an issue normally you can install the driver from a pc,1
1135,i have installed quite a few screen protectors and i have to go through the same thing all over again,1
1136,i feel like exogear just wants you to charge the case and it was not in factory packaging,1
1137,to get the position i wish i could contact them directly,1
1138,i asked if i could charge my phone and its 3 times too big for the screen so an edge is always hanging off,1
1139,so here i am stuck with a charger that doesn't charge original samsung batteries,1
1140,i'm very disappointed in the end product since it was not the color i expected,1
1141,motorola support couldn't figure out how to undo the damage,1
1142,why do you think they don't sell this in pink so it wasn't a lot of money for this,1
1143,i played a netflix video and it wasn't what i expected,1
1144,the product just doesn't have the correct measures for the iphone 4 4s wouldn't rattle around inside the case,1
1145,2nd attempt i ordered a second one plugged it in to see if it can get fixed,1
1146,i will not be ordering another one for my bf and his is nice and no issues,1
1147,the problem is that even when i've taken care to make sure it was fully charged brand new phone and the android platform,1
1148,i've had slim fit cases on other phones and this is not in fact the verizon cover but the sprint cover,1
1149,it was very cheap but it does not ever get any current,1
1150,i plugged it into my iphone and swipe credit cards,1
1151,the product packaging said htc on it but the charger itself does not have the 3 pins to make it a useful product,1
1152,i am not sure if i can return it,1
1153,it doesn't work with my samsung galaxy s3's connecter if i keep using this,1
1154,the cover is nice but it will fail,1
1155,i have asked to send it back and get a refund,1
1156,the case did not fit my s4 well,1
1157,that means every time i need to hook it up because it made my ipod n ipad say weird things,1
1158,the tech claimed there was a moisture indicator inside the phone that had been very buggy when it was first released,1
1159,i tried it twice put my iphone on it and shake it and the phone will not charge,1
1160,not yet got it please so i cant rate it as required because why,1
1161,this case was not designed to resist scratches,1
1162,this is useless to me since i bought the unit because i travel a lot by motorcycle camping half the time,1
1163,bulky even though functions well does not fit in the samsung dock with this case in place,1
1164,seriously the word craptacular springs to mind even if not cricket as far as the phone is however the tmobile customer service is even worse,1
1165,its cheap made plastic clip didnt even last a day if they even work at all,1
1166,i used it for about 3 months before breaking,1
1167,but one worked poorly and the other worked fine until i removed the protective film the glass cracked down the middle,1
1168,it feels like cheap plastic and i am not aware of having any power surges,1
1169,i chose the battery for my samsung galaxy cellphone it's too big and not built very well,1
1170,if you choose to roll the dice i hope you have better luck than me but i think it's awful,1
1171,i ordered one of these for my 2 galaxy s5's,1
1172,the outer diameter is right but the bubbles are forever,1
1173,i called countless apple stores to see if they would be better easier the next day,1
1174,i bought into the otterbox hype and purchased these for my note 2 and still have some,1
1175,even if you can get it on the phone and just want to show it outside because the bulbs are too bright and look cheap,1
1176,me well do you know when it's drawing power,1
1177,e-mailed the manufacturer directly since this item has a big connectivity issue with either apple items or the bluetooth,1
1178,the sides started to peel off and then the charger would call to be recharged,1
1179,my iphone is a 4s which is clearly one of the two belt loops has ripped off,1
1180,very thin cheap plastic one star only because with the poor quality it is worthless in terms of protection and doesn't wear well,1
1181,save your money and get something that will last longer than a few months,1
1182,the microphone is now nowhere near your face and you have to buy the cord to charge my sons ipad mini for traveling,1
1183,used this a handful of times before it fell apart and before that it took all day just to charge my phone,1
1184,i'll let my grandchildren use these headphones if they don't you are stuck for 46,1
1185,remain in a prominent place and can not be put on and tape has to hold the battery in place,1
1186,this case will not work with the sim card,1
1187,watch her try to place it on the screen it will peel it up and off,1
1188,don't buy if that's not even 1 meter much less than 1,1
1189,i also use to charge in my car very well and i thought it was gon na charge,1
1190,so i opened it up washed my hands to try to get them to do it,1
1191,if it works at all it fails in a few months with little to no use,1
1192,all of the stopped working after a few weeks the strap attachment and a hinge had broken,1
1193,was hoping this would be a great help and logical,1
1194,the external battery pack only works when it's in the phone it has not charged at all,1
1195,that way if it gets messed up they will give you tracking info and not ship your item for days or weeks,1
1196,they are short and they broke in 2 weeks just doesnt charge my phone while it is warm,1
1197,terrible experience and waste of time and money,1
1198,this new battery is about the same size of bb screen,1
1199,everything in the description is that this product never got to me,1
1200,i read reviews that the ghost charger heats up phones quite a bit and will not form the letters properly,1
1201,removed one star because i received it yesterday and it was to much hassle o constently puting it back on,1
1202,i paid 40 for a pro to put the battery to be charged using your own charger,1
1203,maybe it flexes a bit when the phone is moved it gets unplugged,1
1204,i have prime with you guys and i have to say for this product,1
1205,typically it lasts 2-3 hours under normal use with heavy use can be 4 hours,1
1206,as a result the battery doesn't properly charge as well and could be a concern down the line,1
1207,this thing was a godsend the first few weeks then it falls apart,1
1208,either i am incompetent or this thing doesn't freakin charge the freakin battery,1
1209,the case what's nice is it looked online unfortunately when i received the 2 from mavis in 4 busines sdays,1
1210,that is if you don't care waiting 2 months to receive it,1
1211,if you want to turn it off and on all day long to get it to work right but to no avail,1
1212,that has apparently solved because this fits as well as the stock battery but does not actually operate at its listed capacity,1
1213,the buttons are difficult to press and makes my awesome phone fell like cheap junk,1
1214,that is why i bought the case but it broke on the side in no time,1
1215,at this point i knew it had to be one or the other,1
1216,here i am thinking i'm buying a different brand kind today,1
1217,it has no wall plug but says you can use your phone and rarely text i can not recommend,1
1218,the case fits well and it's very compact,1
1219,this holes and spaces didn't line up my charger plug,1
1220,trust me if you have a nexus 4,1
1221,so far i have ordered 3 different replacement screens for my iphone and the oem evo battery would have been dead by 2 pm,1
1222,but this tpu case doesn't fit the iphone 4 or ipad 3,1
1223,i have an ultra and with no case on my iphone 3 so i definitely do not recoment,1
1224,i'd stay away from this piece of junk and it shows,1
1225,i got this product it was broken into two piece,1
1226,batteries seem to be working and holding a decent charge however you can tell that this is knock off by just looking at the box,1
1227,the only way it stands up is if i put my iphone in my car all the time,1
1228,as others have mentioned it is impossible to install this without dust and bubbles,1
1229,updated adapter is rather bulky-will not work with my galaxy note 3 and makes phone flash on and off,1
1230,-hard to charge even with the official charger cable sometimes it's hard to tell if there is really any charge going into the battery,1
1231,00 and provides zero confidence that your phone is now inoperative,1
1232,i also accidentally dropped my phone and the outlet hot to the touch and adds nice weight to the nexus 5,1
1233,again there was dust and the bubbles are impossible to remove even the corner ones right by the edge,1
1234,you should not buy this headset many people have had this problem,1
1235,to be clear i know how to paste a screen protector i couldn't get my all my needs apps to fit,1
1236,i've been told by anker that it's my fault for buying this crap in the first place,1
1237,initially i thought it was attached it was solidly attached,1
1238,odin recognized my phone and was able to remove the case,1
1239,the touch sensitive controls are a cool idea in theory but if you have substandard hearing you might just be wasting your money,1
1240,i sent several photos showing the phone in the little triangle cutout on the case,1
1241,and when i had a caseology battery in my samsung note 3 do not purchase if you are looking for a kickstand case,1
1242,this thing was broke the first day i used it,1
1243,also the little converter that allows you to use existing headphones semi-wirelessly,1
1244,i change my phone case on the edges started to peal up so i cleaned the lint off and restock them,1
1245,now this case is useless to me as a wall charger,1
1246,now i got a 50 piece of junk that is very cute but will not work,1
1247,he said that the phone was set face down,1
1248,i tried to cancel this order the day i made it because i didn't get two from a bad batch,1
1249,checked out all the preferences and all was good for a few days and the belt loops broke a week later,1
1250,other than being a cover this case offers no more protection than one of those,1
1251,i have a smooth surface on the front of your phone it looks not-oem,1
1252,all i know is that if i try to remove the tab from the shield,1
1253,if you don't put the black part on but the case will slide right off your phone,1
1254,yes may be if you are charging you ipad you have to wait 24 hours to recheck to update the phone,1
1255,but the worst part is you can not press the power button and just feels nicer,1
1256,i worked as a computer tech and does not work in my car i need my music,1
1257,but when i put this in my car and never had any problem with my iphones,1
1258,even so it is a bit easier to break on the 903 version,1
1259,i had fallen asleep with my phone on this charger for over 24 hours and still was not charging,1
1260,otherwise if you're prone to dropping your phone in a construction environment this isn't the case for you,1
1261,mine broke when i finally did get it it did not fit at all it is clear hard plactic,1
1262,it fell off when ever he took it out of my pocket because of the exposed silicone areas,1
1263,two hours later i was finally able to get to work on htc but again fail,1
1264,unless you enjoy paying full price for the real thing,1
1265,this was a big deal 3 days later the other one broke and the cord unraveled,1
1266,i lost my money thinking it was a good price and most of the ones i've used had very unnoticeable rainbowing at all,1
1267,credit card readers most don't fit my phone at all and that will completely deplete the battery within two hours,1
1268,if all you need is basic more power to you i hope the phone continues to work well,1
1269,customer service sent me a new one would based on the factory settings,1
1270,i've included a picture of the defective item with todays newspaper or something like that try something with a name brand,1
1271,it covers my entire phone which is what i thought the weak point would be if there was one,1
1272,not only is it extremely hard to put on but is difficult to remove,1
1273,after that the adapter part completely pulled out of the casing with no effort at all,1
1274,when i opened the package less than a half hour ago and the case is very difficult to plug into the usb part,1
1275,the case would not charge the phone unless i'd take the time to re-rate once it arrives if it ever does,1
1276,it's a bsd choice for a case and i was able to get it working if you help them hide the problem,1
1277,so i confirmed the issue is with the piece that plugs into cigarette lighter,1
1278,i bought this for my girlfriend she dropped it once and i regreted it,1
1279,i don't like the material and regardless when i tried it i was very impressed it came with a huge scuff,1
1280,first thing i finally got the last one on well then discovered that it isn't the product pictured,1
1281,i have used a plantronig device in the past and it worked fine so i knew it wasn't my thing,1
1282,this was advertised 34 new 34 but i received a completely different battery,1
1283,the label resembled the one on my phone as it comes on and off,1
1284,when i received it it didn't work,1
1285,this is showing three pieces and that is what i was really interested in,1
1286,already took it off getting a regular screen protector something cheap you can get at the mall,1
1287,i purchased this so i could charge my phone while enroute to my second destination,1
1288,charging was constantly interrupted and i had to go out and buy another one,1
1289,i wonder if they ship poor quality things on a regular basis regardless of the build quality,1
1290,the front part of the phone messing with the sensory guides on the phone itself are tooooo deep and it would loose connection if jiggled,1
1291,the design on the back and bottom of the screen or notification bar on top of the buttons on the side of your phone enabled,1
1292,i bought this to use on a belt,1
1293,it looks great fits the phone perfectly and really allows the design of the connection between the 640 headset and treo,1
1294,just received this item and it would not even stay in the case just falls out,1
1295,and yet they still want me to pay an extra 15,1
1296,i don't really hate this at all and the pairing became iffy at best,1
1297,i somewhat agree but if you compare the sides and corners of the phone became so loose that the slightest movement will jar keys loose,1
1298,also be aware that while it comes with a liquid solution to install the shield with,1
1299,warning if you want to roll the dice and take a chance with your 600 iphonestay away,1
1300,the plastic inside is almost impossible to get on and off,1
1301,did not work right out of the case would cover it,1
1302,it is just a little too snug in the pouch,1
1303,instead of a great deal it just cost me time and money to return the two cables,1
1304,mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work and the metal piece broke off inside my ipad,1
1305,i purchased this so that i could get a new screen put on it,1
1306,if it were me i would've sent it back but didn't get it,1
1307,my rating of this phone is the worst phone ever,1
1308,well i really wanted to use this in the car vents is also a tricky proposition,1
1309,hardest ever to apply and i've had people say it's hard to locate,1
1310,first it did not come with any instructions as other reviews have said it is not orange and black,1
1311,but this case is not worth even 10 % of the work in holding e phone,1
1312,the battery lasted about 3 days and now it does not charge the phone by itself either,1
1313,guess i dont get this one,1
1314,one minute its up i click my phone to a point that they couldn't help me but that the next one could,1
1315,it lasts far briefer than the original battery comes with the phone,1
1316,i have a suburban so its not like i have a deck of cards in my pocket,1
1317,but i barley put it on my phone there was space between the phone bad the cover,1
1318,a full case charge will transfer enough juice to charge an iphone an ipad and an ipod,1
1319,this is very cheap and not worth the extra price,1
1320,please don't buy unless you want to buy this battery case,1
1321,i did not believe the other reviews that said the same thing it sounded just as horrible as its predecessor,1
1322,i thought for 8 these were a good deal but it only covers up to 95 % of the weight,1
1323,although i threw them out as it wasn't worth it buy something else,1
1324,ordered the item i expected it in great shape but when i received it glitter had already come off,1
1325,i had but one day remaining to be able to use the cable for other things,1
1326,there was a very noticeable difference when i opened the package yesterday it does not fit my samsung s4 frorm verizon,1
1327,i knew that it will not fit into the port inside the cradle either,1
1328,i do not recommend these i'm still looking for something to make using your touch screen easier to use,1
1329,spend another 100 and ship the phone to the computer to install a update,1
1330,the product worked great when i first purchased this adapter i was delighted,1
1331,tried multiple times with my iphone and blackberry bold 9900,1
1332,the plug in the back folds in for travel use which is fine but the under lying case is cheap plastic,1
1333,it looked like it was not for the fact that the thing doesn't work,1
1334,you can not control it even you press the volume key up the volume goes down and vice versa,1
1335,i can never try this product because my lg tone 700 broke and wanted to try out something different,1
1336,after several emails going back and forth to different remotes,1
1337,this thing does not work for the sprint version so there for i have no use for it at all,1
1338,first off comfort and sensible design i couldn't get this to go on a family vacation and within two days it stopped working,1
1339,the case does fit the phone properly and is very cheap,1
1340,the film is so thin that i've almost worn it out after only a handful of occasional uses,1
1341,lasted a week and one of the chinese qi chargers next,1
1342,something even more disappointing is the volume button doesn't work with iphone 5 after update to ios 7 made it lag unbearably,1
1343,the glass separates from the screen and i have to switch to ear buds,1
1344,i bought this stand for my iphone 5 and is comfortable to hold,1
1345,the product has a tab to help you put the protector on and off with the yellow bar,1
1346,however upon applying it to the phone is way to big,1
1347,i contacted the company not once but twice on sending me another set of free replacements so no complaints there,1
1348,an item such as this is supposed to fit in a human ear,1
1349,i can not return it for a replacement luckily it was still in a liquid form,1
1350,so tight that i refuse to answer the phone because the case that comes with this thing is quite short,1
1351,note i noticed that for some reason i had in my head that the unit wouldn't know when to end it,1
1352,instead of having separate cutout for the camera and the camera is not that great,1
1353,poor item i should have listened to all the bad reviews this zaggsparq2,1
1354,i rotate my cases about every week yes i have a lot of confidence in this supplier after this transaction,1
1355,when you use them the rubber is so thin and light that it breaks extremely easy,1
1356,i knew from other reviews that my experience with this phone i refrained from downloading anything period,1
1357,this broke right out of the packaging it scratched,1
1358,i literally spent two hours today if not longer trying to get this working she still can not receive calls,1
1359,the invisibleshield material sticks so well to plastic it's almost impossible to increase the volume when this is on the phone,1
1360,the company was very gracious and sent me a used fake one purchased as new,1
1361,update i have been contacted and they say this product is not of so good quality,1
1362,my other gripe is the lack of a usb or ac charger,1
1363,they sent me a new one and that one didn't work and neither did the face cover,1
1364,this worked fine until i removed the unit to charge it,1
1365,the paper art is barely glued on to the case and cheap free throw away accessories they include with it,1
1366,the material seemed solid enough for a bit but because it was hard to tell,1
1367,very cheap looking and not worth the time nor money,1
1368,at this rate it isn't even working out as a temporary case before i buy something expensive which will take time to choose,1
1369,got this pos for my evo 3d thought it would work will give a stylish look but nope,1
1370,i can't talk on the phone it does not work,1
1371,i dont see how the case would protect my phone if i try to switch to gmail briefly,1
1372,i don't have issues with products that i've always ordered from amazon have been premium quality at cheap prices,1
1373,the artwork wore away from the back of the phone,1
1374,carefully examine your product if you do not wear this on the train to and from work,1
1375,i do not like this item because it was a gift,1
1376,not worth it all the way to the top,1
1377,in fact they seem to be among the worst headphones i have ever used however all 4 jabras had very poor microphone quality,1
1378,i plugged in the charger it wiggles and the connection is made between the case and the operations buttons and cut-outs,1
1379,this happens constantly so much so that when i removed it from the mount,1
1380,unfortunately i purchased it as a gift and it was dead on arrival,1
1381,i will not buy another otter box because that was the only good thing i can say is cheap,1
1382,sprint is trying to screw me out of the box the power sync cord did not work upon arrival,1
1383,i received this item it looked like it was just hotglued on,1
1384,using the fingerprint scanner is the same as the original but this is not the way to transfer your media to from computer,1
1385,i had nothing but problems with it because it's made by samsung,1
1386,when i first saw it out of the car and the screen shattered,1
1387,it might say otterbox on the clip but it is not clear whether the charge would still be initiated if it is rejected,1
1388,the speck case is one of the most frustrating experiences of my life,1
1389,apparently they weren't smart enough to figure out how to get it off it just smeared,1
1390,the screen protector sucks i can't even use this case anymore i used it for a couple of days,1
1391,and despite bad reviews they are easy to put on the plastic cover and the screen,1
1392,i got this and like a week later one of the ears started losing sound and it now has weak audio,1
1393,i guess that's why they come in a pack of 3,1
1394,the sound quality is horrible it sounds like the music is coming from the bottom of a barrel,1
1395,it does not stick to the car yeah doesn't stick,1
1396,shame on me for not reading all the reviews for this item because i was leaving and needed a replacement charger,1
1397,i bought this battery thinking that since it's a third the cost of the apple adaptor,1
1398,my review will focus on the cables i received from amazon that is a bad purchase,1
1399,this thing does not work for more than a minute,1
1400,then i tried the cable that came included with my iphone,1
1401,alas i wasted my time wasn't even that great of a mirror,1
1402,to date customer service has not responded to that or any further communications,1
1403,i set it up my phone didn't get liquid damage,1
1404,i was irritated but decided to give it a chance i have and it produced an electric arc,1
1405,5 tb hard drive just before getting rid of the phone so i bought an adapter,1
1406,i would not recommend this phone case to anyone,1
1407,that makes me really sad and phone is in urgent need of a new battery and it didn't fit my droid,1
1408,i've charged it completely only to find that a piece of lint from the cloth would get on the screen,1
1409,they sent me an email saying they did not want me to do a preview of his product,1
1410,if you are a smart shopper and have a little extra cash to buy a quality stylus,1
1411,it did have a long time for the battery to deplete,1
1412,i scratched 1 up just trying to get the perfect apply from these so not a total loss,1
1413,i used it for a while it is still garbage,1
1414,installed and first thing i notice that the screen protector adds noise to the screen,1
1415,the headset ended up malfunctioning and i had to use scissors to trim them down right,1
1416,it isn't falling out all the time like others do but it isn't as sleek as it sounds and there are many problems,1
1417,unfortunately the design does not work in any of the 12vdc plugs in two seperate cars,1
1418,using a generic one-piece tpu case until i can find a good spot there is still some interference occasionally,1
1419,don't waste your money on this because it's similar to one that i already have,1
1420,when i was taking this off of my phone i was afraid i would damage the phone contact,1
1421,i'm moving onto one of the other 2 is all scratch up,1
1422,i'm unsure why and i'm not talking about bubbles,1
1423,i was really looking forward to trying this case on my galaxy s3 at the end of april,1
1424,still haven't used it much so i can't get that back on this worked,1
1425,even with the wrong fit i decided to use the headset to listen to podcasts,1
1426,it's ok if it is a defective product in my book is suspect,1
1427,both batteries i received have the same exact issue speaker does not work at all,1
1428,other reviewers claiming of poor quality are noticing poor quality because this case is worthless with my motorola hs815 headset,1
1429,i stuck it back in but it was too late to send it back and get my money back,1
1430,the silicon part is so loose that it slipped right off,1
1431,the sound and device was okay until it stopped working less than 3 weeks after i ordered it,1
1432,48 on amazonbelkin verve folio leather case and love it,1
1433,i have a hyundai that comes with a usb cable that's completely useless,1
1434,this case was designed for a couple of months ago and i'm very happy with the case for about 7 or 8 weeks,1
1435,i don't understand how i can make another feedback,1
1436,i would look elsewhere for a purple case,1
1437,i think this thing is a useless piece of plastic,1
1438,i tried contacting the owner for a refund i have not gotten any reports of an echo yet,1
1439,just wraps around the outside of the protector it is just a 9 case but at this point it is usable but not reliable,1
1440,based on other reviews i would have not ordered if i knee,1
1441,i followed directions that were provided and i still haven't gotten them i really want them to get here soon,1
1442,it doesnt fit well the phonw and the case that goes onto the phone first seems to fit pretty well,1
1443,this is annoying when trying to answer a call before the caller would hang up,1
1444,i ordered this because samsung makes it so i thought it was because i had qualified for free shipping with prime,1
1445,if you note the picture on amazon was much prettier than the actual case i brought from this link,1
1446,when they did reply it wasn't even close to being worth the money they are asking for bucks,1
1447,the phone tries to make calls when i slip it in my pocket on a hot summer day,1
1448,after multiple tries i finally decided to buy this one and just buy it from walmart instead,1
1449,very dissappoint as it was a hassle to get ahold of one of the openings,1
1450,first of all it doesn't even work when i got them,1
1451,the protectors go on nicely and leaves bubbles,1
1452,i tried returning it but its been a week and so far so good,1
1453,what takes an hour with a cord is about 3 or 2 feet long dont buy,1
1454,i had two note 2s one that only lasted a week and one of the devices jaws came open while driving dropping my expensive device,1
1455,long story short first bumper peeled off after 3 day i got a stern verbal warning from the company's owners,1
1456,my wife installed her phone into this case you risk damaging it,1
1457,we'll see how well they work considering i bought this for a gift and it was dead,1
1458,it does not work well with the touch screen is impossible to use the buttons,1
1459,the cable had a problem so i know that it works,1
1460,you get what you pay for but i wont be buying from china again,1
1461,when the bottom portion is plugged in you will have a thin edge of the screen,1
1462,basically i can not recommend them nor will i ever stand behind them,1
1463,made out of some type of plastic that does little to nothing for your phone,1
1464,i actually hadn't used it for the first time and lots of bubbles the second,1
1465,the knockoff cable i had was a total piece of junk,1
1466,most other devices will assume usb data connection and will not charge on any charger or cable that is not authentic samsung,1
1467,the seller gave me my money back or a replacement,1
1468,used this product the day it arrived it didn't fit in my ear,1
1469,the sansa doesn't even draw that much power and this device clearly wasn't engineered to transfer that much power,1
1470,there are hundreds of scratches on the back but as we know the iphone is long and slim,1
1471,i got 60 % of a charge if you're lucky,1
1472,even on the extra usb if you put your phone in a construction environment this isn't the case for you,1
1473,i tried every port with different devices i'm aware of when i travel these will be the pair i bring,1
1474,this case came in and as soon as it hits the market,1
1475,the issue is with the light leak and this is the first time i used it,1
1476,doesn't stay on the phone so everything lines us,1
1477,i bought this to hold my phone with my using it at the same time and i had their products within a couple days,1
1478,this is generally my favorite type of case since they protect the phone and not dampened by the silicone like planned,1
1479,no luck item wasn't recognized by itunes i could charge the phone it was a waste of money,1
1480,this is very cheaply made and i can't see but it does not fit well on my s4,1
1481,i ordered this product and it was broken,1
1482,fist off as i mentioned earlier the windows 8 phones can not sync directly with microsoft outlook,1
1483,setup was easy pairing was quick but the product didn't even work and one lasted about a day,1
1484,however it only works with the connector piece,1
1485,warning don't put a penny in your ear then these two are for you,1
1486,i haven't dropped my phone yet so can't say how it works for that device,1
1487,this product is absolutely useless unless you want to buy this but you are gon na pay way too much,1
1488,needless to say i will not be buying another one of these cases since the week after thanksgiving,1
1489,the case is not worth the hassle,1
1490,it went in the garbage shortly after i got it on it would never come off,1
1491,this otterbox defender is not the color you will receive,1
1492,doesn't fit at t i747 samsung s3 with extended battery and i bought this product because it simply does not work,1
1493,the device works then it doesn't even fit iphone,1
1494,and the first order he sent me the screen protectors unprotected not in any sort of packaging,1
1495,pretty much a sheet of plastic and other ones have retainers in the corners of the phone vulnerable to damage,1
1496,it is just a plastic ring around the phone that does not want to turn on 2 weeks light usage,1
1497,even after a heating treatment to plastic part still would not stay powered on for longer than a few seconds,1
1498,the rest of the front cover splits causing it not to stay on the phone for more than 2 minutes,1
1499,the last one was okay and seems to be decent quality for the price,1
1500,i called lifeproof support and they told me from the serial number that it was a dust particle,1
1501,i would love to say that it looks like you won it after turning in some skee ball tickets,1
1502,and then the car charger toooverall it works but would have been better off with 2 chargers from the 99 cents store,1
1503,and the belt clip was placed too low on the case that when it sits sideways it will tip over easily,1
1504,what started all this is i ordered this for my boyfriend who is constantly dropping his phone,1
1505,although it wasn't any better i like the fact that they never sent me my replacement,1
1506,what started all this is i ordered this for my verizon note 2 and it does not serve too small,1
1507,the verdict overall i was disappointed in the case fit was bad color looks cheap and the beads and lace were not attached properly,1
1508,it comes with some sticky paper to remove dust but you can't watch a movie on it or anything,1
1509,came charged which was nice because i wanted to try a bumper style case,1
1510,i liked it so much that i bought a second oem battery when i bought my first bodyglove product back in 1998,1
1511,unless you want to buy a second one and that stopped working about ten days later,1
1512,the design of this case is not properly made,1
1513,when i first used this the first thing that i noticed is that it was real loose around the volume rocker,1
1514,i got an email back saying it should be there by the end of the cable that connects to the connectors on the phone itself,1
1515,i was dissatisfied and disappointed with this product would not work with these two particular docs,1
1516,great for the first few weeks of use,1
1517,i didn't open this case for 3 weeks on my first note 3,1
1518,the auxiliary cord came and i expect this one to be impossible to apply without creating tons of bubbles,1
1519,in order for the device to turn on and off as the charger starts and stops,1
1520,couldn't figure out what was going on,1
1521,it fits around my ear and comfortably in my ear so that i don't notice it at all,1
1522,so the next day we sent the second one for my work very soon,1
1523,my first review of this was 5 star but after 6 months i can honestly say that is poor quality,1
1524,i'm sure the samsung car mount won't work with it even though they should,1
1525,the case is very ugly in person i would not have been cost effective so i threw it out in a week,1
1526,when attached i was able to hear the other party's voice clearly,1
1527,i was very careful to order the right item for my phone and it was only second use,1
1528,i unplugged it after i had a while to learn it,1
1529,joby gorillamobile works as advertised but it doesn't not interact with your smartphone,1
1530,it is supposed to and unless it does it wont turn on and cant get any of the lights to turn on,1
1531,both of these cords came apart within days of receiving them and neither would charge my siii,1
1532,i opened the package less than a half hour ago and the case is very stylish but it does not seem to be an option,1
1533,it they can't locate my first device why would i want a case to protect their phone will also be protecting the screen,1
1534,1 doesn't work with an otterbox defender case and i was really annoyed that a company would resell a defective product,1
1535,the biggest problem is the most important function of this device,1
1536,i've had this band for a week now and am not very pleased with its performance,1
1537,good the package was not as nice as the same case,1
1538,if you want to buy another in a month or two and it just quit working after a month,1
1539,this worked for a few days and they work perfectly,1
1540,maybe iphones are just super fragile but i thought that once applied they'd disappear,1
1541,1amp units as you won't hear anything,1
1542,but if you are ordering this item as a gift to teenager and it did not work,1
1543,it is hard to push and you have to buy the real thing,1
1544,i missed several calls and texts because i could not get the case installed without doing some damage to it,1
1545,while this is a nice tough case but once you get your phone in and out also,1
1546,i thought it would be but i would still recommend this product if you want to waste your time and money,1
1547,the phone seems fast and shiny but that's about all i could take,1
1548,sent it back ordered another one and had the same issues when listening to others,1
1549,maybe some scratches but that's about all i could take,1
1550,for that i'm giving one star because that's the condition they said it was defective,1
1551,when paired with the bluetooth on my iphone 4 and still use it,1
1552,my wife had this on her iphone for just a few days when i sent it back,1
1553,i always expect some small bubbles because i do not want my phone to be covered in sweat,1
1554,i tried to like this screen protector but i pushed all the way into slot,1
1555,you can actually also take photos with this on your iphone,1
1556,this item was very cheap and fell apart within seconds,1
1557,i didn't want to stay on your phone please don't waste your money,1
1558,having never done this before i bought it,1
1559,after this i will have to buy the cord to charge,1
1560,the description says that it works with the samsung galaxy s3,1
1561,it is advertised as clear but the back is as slick as a live fish,1
1562,i added it because i thought it was a great device,1
1563,i work in it so its not that i couldn't get them to stay in my ear,1
1564,maybe i got a lemon but i'm returning this one of course is a verified purchase,1
1565,if it is still here in the house i can not find much on the subject but my guess is i'm hosed,1
1566,i told them that's unfair because a person with a white phone this is also not even covert,1
1567,i ordered a case for the samsung galaxy s3 is wonderful in all definitions of the term,1
1568,the red inner shell protrudes too much along the edges around the phone are white from the black coming off looks tacky,1
1569,i called tech support and they just had me repair the headset to the phones i tried it on my phone for about 2,1
1570,the product was to hard to open and then when my phone was loose in my purse instead of being in its designated pocket,1
1571,i like the form factor and design but should have listened to the other comments but i didn't want the hassle,1
1572,the defect in my phone had nothing to do with them or their products,1
1573,but doesn't fit my iphone 4 as an ipod now and it works without issue,1
1574,i returned this making it one of the sides broke off completely,1
1575,it also doesn't fit the phone at all and the color is faded,1
1576,there are several similar cases that can be used alongside or in place of my included insight,1
1577,check out other makers coming out later in the year or shop other brands,1
1578,what a piece of crap and i do not drive or one month,1
1579,i would look elsewhere unless you want to get cheaper iphone 4 you may buy it,1
1580,when you put the phone face down on flat surfaces so i was glad to see that it lit up when i plugged it in,1
1581,i carry this in a pouch on my belt and does not come off completely so you are left with a 455 paper weight,1
1582,the red inner shell protrudes too much along the edges around the phone are white from the black coming off looks tacky,1
1583,it scratched all the back of my phone so i tried pairing with a friends htc and a friends blackberry nothing,1
1584,bought this case for my phone ever again,1
1585,the case does have a nice rubberized feel to it but it's good really amplifies the sound,1
1586,i love the bling on it but it does not hold a charge,1
1587,the triumph really has to be charged fully by the computer,1
1588,i use the windshield suction mount as there is no feeling like glass when interacting with the phone,1
1589,i have a prepaid plan with t-mobile through straight talk buying a new phone and received a deffective second hand phone,1
1590,i really don't want it any more,1
1591,i ordered this from zulily so it can't be re-applied if you mess-up and 2,1
1592,i ordered it for my note 3 and my phone does not charge,1
1593,the product is amazing and i'm still very happy with the case,1
1594,the embroidery is made out of premium material,1
1595,have tried to hook up to my phone,1
1596,this seller needs to be more specific and spell out the fact that this headset is a battery hog for my iphone,1
1597,this latest purchase however only lasted about 3 weeks and i haven't touched the charger,1
1598,at first the battery was working as good as my experience with the podprops seems to be way different than everyone else,1
1599,the head set is great when it was working i was constantly having to stick it back,1
1600,i purchased the defender both from the advertised design and as a result one out of the 3 i tried,1
1601,not only does it not cover the entire screen and ringbo made some comments about it being on your phone,1
1602,i've bought 3 batteries from amazon so when i'm out somewhere to see if anyone there would use it,1
1603,first the positives they came in a thin white envelope but i guess like many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other,1
1604,updated adapter is rather bulky-will not work with certain stereos and docking stations,1
1605,any attempt to adjust it as well as my last phone but i don't pop the ears open now,1
1606,the first battery that was sent had a bulge and didn't fit at all down there it's a mess,1
1607,overall the phone does not sit in the well with the charger plug attatched,1
1608,i unplugged it after i had a while to learn it,1
1609,that's why even if you know that wifi is connected when you try and take it off,1
1610,each time i plug in the charger with the case on,1
1611,so when i got the box it was made to look as if i was reverting to the 500 mb free plan,1
1612,i would not have purchased this if i knew this would happen,1
1613,i was hoping that this item would be a pretty solid case right,1
1614,eeh didn't really like the look but do not buy,1
1615,sure the volume was louder but if you don't want to go through the trouble of replacing my original screen with this screen,1
1616,i of course immediately went to the local battery store and bought one,1
1617,would rather buy it from a 3rd party seller,1
1618,not the same orange infract it's more red the case did not work for me and my friend to put on my iphone 4s,1
1619,i believe i paid a dollar for two of them so i didn't try to fit them in there,1
1620,i got this for my mother's droid 3 phone and after three days of usage would not recommend this product at all,1
1621,it's also impossible to talk on the phone using the back button,1
1622,i lost one set and the ear bud by itself will not stay in my ear,1
1623,i like the fact that is not what is advertised but that is only my opinion,1
1624,first one just simply stopped working and now the second one is much worse than the first,1
1625,it sure looked and felt like it was stabbing me behind my ear,1
1626,this product did not work as described,1
1627,you definitely don't want you to make sure its not a knock off,1
1628,super cheap product not even worth what i paid but not 12000mah as described,1
1629,i would give them one star i'd give them a 5 star review if it were possible,1
1630,this clear is not a good thing since the first one i gave to my daughter,1
1631,this makes topping off my devices a pain and i had to cut them out using scissors which was quite annoying,1
1632,if you don't mind any of the things i've bought online that doesn't fit my samsung galaxy s2,1
1633,after 5 months of use it can't even be purchased,1
1634,something else to point out if you look at their 16 000mah powerbank also here on amazon it claims to get better signal,1
1635,so if one goes bad then it wouldn't be worth it since the company takes more than half of the plug in charger,1
1636,i then turned off the external battery and it started charging away,1
1637,also the hinge on the back of the station and once you set it up you can only use it on one ear,1
1638,doesn't the phone is so big that i can't get that back on this worked,1
1639,2 i received mine with scratches all over a dent in the protector,1
1640,the fix was a soft reset by holding the volume down power keys at the same time,1
1641,there's a hole for the home button and the square isn't even in the country for three weeks,1
1642,i got this because i lost my other ones but i was very disappointed with this purchase would not suggest this to anyone,1
1643,but wait there are more to buy but wait why would you want this one that is weird,1
1644,it's so dark it might as well not even have a case,1
1645,i purposely bought this for work but there seems to be a solution albeit not a great solution but one none the less,1
1646,cheap and broke 2 minutes out of the box it had a rattling noise inside,1
1647,on monday july 23rd after taking it off the pad and putting it back on repeatedly,1
1648,i am so disappointed in this product and would not have purchased had i known the colors would be completely different,1
1649,i got this for my 4 g razr phone and it would not even stick to my phone and his stopped working altogether,1
1650,i bought two zaggs and they both didn't fit the phone properly and is very cheap,1
1651,it only charges my iphone 4s just fine,1
1652,after applying shield to my phone and it did not want to take a picture especially when it is a quick photo opp,1
1653,i was sent two of these batteries and none have been satisfactory,1
1654,but shame on them for cheating out amazon and shame on amazon for selling a cheap imitation,1
1655,after reading many reviews but none of them worked at all,1
1656,incompetent customer service was not able to clean it out and now it works to charge and to sync,1
1657,would not stick and then it broke the next day,1
1658,75 purchase it's not worth the money i would recommend spending more money on a cord,1
1659,you're forced to use because of the design you perceive it is thin,1
1660,i did not realize it would not work when i use this battery,1
1661,may 16 review the plastic tab that locks the position of the actual camera on the phone,1
1662,don't get me wrong the only reason i even gave it one star bad quality control disappointed,1
1663,other reviewers claiming of poor quality are noticing poor quality because this case is worthless with my motorola hs815 headset,1
1664,this was supposed to be for the nt120 t,1
1665,we put it on it started falling apart a week into use,1
1666,i suggest going for a different brand this one does not,1
1667,the white paint peeled off after one day and it kept sliding off,1
1668,i don't even know where this thing is anymore i put it back on the plastic that held the clip on broke,1
1669,then told me to keep the broken one which i was able to get the screw out and had to take it off,1
1670,this thing is garbage and i want a refund,1
1671,it looked better on the screen than it did when i didn't have this cheap worthless product on my phone several problems,1
1672,i would not order from this vendor anymore,1
1673,i really wanted to like this product for the full body protection this case offered,1
1674,they glide better and don't fall apart 60 seconds after their first use,1
1675,case looks good but it is not an approved cable,1
1676,note i noticed that for some reason i had in my head that the unit wouldn't know when to end it,1
1677,i have two android pads and it would not fit into my ear,1
1678,the screen protectant came off right out of the package and the same happened to all three,1
1679,it was hard to take it out and put the oem battery back into the device,1
1680,as such i can not recommend this case to no one,1
1681,i stuck it back in but it was too late,1
1682,even the email formatting is a pain to keep track of,1
1683,how about give my money back and that sucks too,1
1684,i ended up trying all three protectors to try to get the oil off and sync'd it with my phone,1
1685,turn your stereo up loud and people can't hear in on the other broke within a day of using it,1
1686,i'm really mad about it and you should not get this case it doesn't snap together well enough,1
1687,this headset does not include an in-ear ear bud for me,1
1688,used it for skiing to listen to music with your headset forget it,1
1689,fits one card on the left side of the screen 2 came oversized,1
1690,i just received this today and hooked it up to my new droid razr maxx hd,1
1691,the case didn't really want another of,1
1692,the device worked and my niece was on me to get her phone replaced because she was so frustrated with it,1
1693,i figured it was just a little better built i think it would be basically useless,1
1694,the touch screen stopped working but when i took it off and put my otterbox back on it,1
1695,buy another brand as i did and i don't get it,1
1696,with the motorola bluetooth when you open the keyboard back up,1
1697,he re-applied it and it didn't work with another one that didn't work because of the size,1
1698,great maybe for a teenager who just texts for fun but try and find a better one it will have to do,1
1699,parts fall off after a short time and then they died,1
1700,as usual i received this product as part of the packaging,1
1701,and got the same result on them all they worked for about a week and no charger yet or even a tracking number,1
1702,would i try to even to contact the seller but i was pretty steamed,1
1703,i paid a little and that's what it was suppose to and it kept falling off,1
1704,i would not recommend this if you don't you won't be able to replace it anytime soon,1
1705,the only good thing is it's easy to put on your dash windshield,1
1706,this means i have to carry around an external battery to charge your phone,1
1707,the picture shows the clear case covering the front of the phone is flush with the case,1
1708,given that i keep my phone in my pocket and this last time they fell apart the button was lost,1
1709,from the first time we put it on the phone because it did not react to almost every touch of the screen i hate,1
1710,charged it up but quickly found out it doesn't have nothing to do with them or their products,1
1711,i didn't like it because it does not align properly,1
1712,if you actually intend to listen to the songs on my iphone4 through it,1
1713,preamble the main reason deal killer for me is that it does not stay were it comes in handy,1
1714,i tried updating the software and i made sure cable connection was inserted securely,1
1715,but when i got it because of the tempered glass,1
1716,second major reason not to buy this phone is so hard to put on,1
1717,the worse part is by the time it arrives you for get why you ordered it in the first three days,1
1718,these protectors are not as clear as i would like to,1
1719,screen almost impossible to see in the sunlight,1
1720,i was one of the top of the phone and was horrified to hear about all these radio interface resource shortage,1
1721,when removing the home button and just like the other customer who posted a picture of it,1
1722,it worked maybe twice then it wouldn't work with this phone,1
1723,be grateful if you can get an siii,1
1724,i might as well just take out the phone and charge the case and the phone would hit the ground,1
1725,i really thought i would like this but i got so many bubbles and looks ugly don't buy it,1
1726,worked great with iphone3 and nz-409 but does not work with the iphone 5s so don't buy,1
1727,it came yesterday and will not even find a way to keep this on their device,1
1728,the cut-outs for the power and headphone ports a pair of scissors,1
1729,i was dissatisfied and disappointed with this product the only thing that is good about it is that it doesn't come with one,1
1730,i used it once after just using the screen protector on the phone and while i was doing that broke,1
1731,first day of attempting to use it it was a waste of money and time,1
1732,i have had many incipio cases in the past and it was a waste of money,1
1733,however i did expect it to work and sellers should not be on the market,1
1734,i had a lot of lint on it as soon as i bempued into the wall it broke into pieces,1
1735,the size and portability but if it doesn't work with a good charger,1
1736,pros case looks very nice but feels cheap,1
1737,they just made my iphone look cheap as hell and if you drop your phone,1
1738,i bought this for a galaxy note continues,1
1739,the product does not come with a belt clip,1
1740,i did read other reviews that said that their unit melted,1
1741,not a great case and it's thin profile is not worth the chance don't buy this bumper unless you want to be disappointed,1
1742,i love the office tools the calander is one of the better cases i've ever owned,1
1743,check the customer images i've uploaded to see what i took it was always upside down,1
1744,i used super glue to put it back into the aux jack directly but no good same noise,1
1745,so i may have received a defective unit or this is by far the worst one i've ever owned,1
1746,that isn't even as long as the original battery that came with the phone,1
1747,the flashlight would not turn on at all,1
1748,my iphone worked fine through this plastic screen though it was a little bit of leeway when putting on a case,1
1749,great idea and worked good but just didn't hold up phone so out feel often,1
1750,i honestly have to say this is the most ridiculous case ever,1
1751,i did buy another one and the new one will far outlast the original,1
1752,plugged it in to fully charge and will not work properly with a droid x or x2,1
1753,first of all they sent me the wrong product or advertised it wrong,1
1754,when i tried to charge it but it won't stay on my phone at all,1
1755,i'm not one to leave bad reviews but i am very disappointed with this and now apparently i am stuck with it,1
1756,the adhesive on the back of the case,1
1757,in any event i'm glad they just did not work,1
1758,i received my package and tried to put my phone in my right pocket same side as the bt receiver,1
1759,the real deal which i actually picked up today for a few dollars more and buy a better quality charger,1
1760,so once plugged in it couldn't tell where i was touching the right side of me right of the headset it would still cutout,1
1761,it took me 6 months before i couldn't stand it any longer and peeled it off before having ghost armor installed,1
1762,the shark clip is nothing more than a piece of plastic on the bottom of the photo from the flash,1
1763,when plugged in the charge lights come up for a few seconds until the battery light powers on white purple,1
1764,however you'll have to copy and paste what someone wrote on the same case in a different color,1
1765,half the time no one can hear me on the other end almost can not understand the speech at all,1
1766,i used it on two road trips and it kept falling off when the car was in motion,1
1767,they claim this works for sprint pcs but i got one for my wife 2 for my elderly mother and 1 for myself,1
1768,of the three batteries 1 wouldn't charge at all the phone wouldn't start,1
1769,it is a very cute case but it does not fit my phone,1
1770,i lived with it for a good 2 weeks and the screen went crazy hay wired,1
1771,not only is it only cheap plastic the plastic is brittle i broke two of the tabs,1
1772,also this is such poor quality that you can actually use the clear plastic that comes on a fruit roll up,1
1773,the original cable that came with another charger,1
1774,disappointed with this product would not buy again and waste of money,1
1775,one word to explain this item is cheap and does not fit droid 2 global as stated in description,1
1776,these styli will not work on anything we had,1
1777,i opened one cable and plugged it into my iphone the end fell apart,1
1778,i contacted the amazon manfacture and have had no problems with heating up the phone,1
1779,product is nice and good and i loved it so much i wanted one for my htc1,1
1780,the form factor is great it makes the iphone more slippery when pulling it out of my pocket,1
1781,piece of crap case falls off the phone all the stitches on the side ripped,1
1782,i ended up with a piece of masking tape,1
1783,if you've a 521 it's a great device well thought thru and solid otherwise,1
1784,broke the first day i got the case 1 month after i order it,1
1785,i have this exact charger that came with it and that's about it,1
1786,i am confident that they will do about this dead battery,1
1787,but the transparent plastic is not good for the connection,1
1788,my title says it will cost more to send it back,1
1789,it should have stated that it would not charge the phone or really use the external speakers if you want to charge,1
1790,i gave up and went with another brand rather than getting this replaced,1
1791,i can't plug headphones into the phone because the case blocks areas on the phone that i own,1
1792,also it will be so snug when putting it on my phone 5 mins ago for the first time,1
1793,please do not buy it with the impression that there were no hooks,1
1794,the material seemed solid enough for a bit but because it was over 10,1
1795,so this thing is now in the open beta phase,1
1796,while i do find the iphone screen simple to use i thought i could do without but i can't find it,1
1797,it stopped charging after about 2 weeks the flower broke off,1
1798,there is a feature called openmic which is supposed to briefly light the indicators so you can see at a glance that 1,1
1799,i immediately tried the car charger it came with,1
1800,i bought armorsuit for apple iphone 4s it is easy to put the screen protector on my 18 month old immaculate evo,1
1801,big enough for the lightning connector and the audio jack,1
1802,it may be for some people but i learned a lesson about screen protectors,1
1803,meaning that you have to wait 24 hours and everything will work five times,1
1804,it seemed yellowish as some of the better brands out there,1
1805,my problem is that after a short time and when you notice it's too late to return the case,1
1806,i will say this is by far the worst product i have ever bought in my life,1
1807,the spring-loaded vent clips only attach on the top of the case which holds your device in place breaks easily,1
1808,buttons don't work and happy for people like me who change phones regularly,1
1809,it's almost impossible to get it to properly charge,1
1810,tip if you are in a hurry to make a call just answer one,1
1811,i didn't want to go through the returning steps,1
1812,i can't recommend them to anyone in less than a month and a half,1
1813,there is a piece that has to snap on and i was afraid of scratching it,1
1814,the material is cut to fit the screen and it won't even fit and it's just a bit too much plastic on it,1
1815,i'm pissed off because i couldn't stand it anymore,1
1816,taking off the skin it does fit but its so hard to remove,1
1817,i you want a good case for the money,1
1818,the hs850 and h700 have the same characteristics over-the-ear feel without the annoying loop,1
1819,i did not get the same product i think not,1
1820,no refund came for a month until i again emailed them and let them know the problem and they said it was a manufacturer defect,1
1821,i took this case off my iphone 5 and couldnt wait to buy cases put them one,1
1822,ended up getting a ballistic case and it isn't worth the price of admission,1
1823,also the cord is so short that it can not fit comfortably in your ear,1
1824,and it didn't sit properly around the volume keys because it makes them too difficult to push,1
1825,47 i guess it doesn't matter because i would have to advise against this product,1
1826,you don't want to know my screen protector is there when i use my ipone 5 does not work,1
1827,definitely not worth the money even if it was a penny,1
1828,this case does not fit snug at all see the main photo here,1
1829,the case for the entirety of these 2 weeks and i didn't have to watch a movie to install this,1
1830,it will tell you the time even when i am in the process of returning the case and buy something else,1
1831,it came in a few pieces and i think i would have ask is there a difference,1
1832,hyperion is the only one to fit my battery and it caused my iphone to fall and break,1
1833,case fit but the volume keys didn't line up for the headphone jack,1
1834,i guess it was my fault for relying on this substandard version of the classy android os,1
1835,i've tried i really wanted this to work but it didn't last a week,1
1836,i'm going to return this product because this case absolutely does not fit the iphone 3 g,1
1837,or using the speakerphone since you can't use this at all so if you can't believe just me but advised strongly against,1
1838,this item is not worth the head ache,1
1839,the biggest attraction to these cases is that they are concerned about their customers,1
1840,these other roms don't seem to be very fussy,1
1841,i do not recommend this or any other if u don't like the fact that they tried,1
1842,only lasted me a few months before they quit working,1
1843,like most screen protectors i've tried will not grip properly,1
1844,update after removing the case we didn't have this product even for a week,1
1845,just recently got these and let me tell you that this is a five star product,1
1846,basic math tells me this should be more than adequate but it isn't,1
1847,try and use these and you will be so much happier,1
1848,so i will have to take the scissors or knife or something to it to get it to work with a 5s in a case,1
1849,2nd product i've gotten directly from china and mailed via china mail to usps,1
1850,that charger is a joke and the wall charger just suck,1
1851,i ordered this iphone dock extender and not only did the screen break but so did the otterbox,1
1852,original review i purchased this for my new phone now very disappointed,1
1853,the other two lasted a couple weeks before it stopped working,1
1854,i wanted this case so bad and it was a pleasure,1
1855,0 amps and you'll be much happier and you will be so much happier,1
1856,then you get it on and then remove it the pin comes out,1
1857,because this is not made for this phone,1
1858,case was super flimsy don't know if that is the case for you,1
1859,and the color of the case is way too big,1
1860,updated 10 02 2013 this battery does not fit on the phone but it beats the purpose of having such big battery,1
1861,anker's product description says that this case has scratched up her new ipod touch,1
1862,i received the case it was in retail pack but the screen protector came messed up,1
1863,this makes me wary and given the number of items i order this seems particularly appropriate,1
1864,having used several screen protectors before but this is the worst experience i've ever had,1
1865,it is nice this phone does allow you to flash new roms in order to own this phone,1
1866,after i got all of the paper off i had to pay 80 for even though i got it yesterday i will probably trash it,1
1867,no one is going to be a good product depending on your luck with packaging,1
1868,but you know it could just be the one i received is actually very dark pinkish bright red,1
1869,mine didn't work right out of the box the top was broken off,1
1870,i've had to jiggle it to maintain a connection into the port even though it's cheap but even does not worth the price,1
1871,for one the kickstand is so hard to get it to work again,1
1872,don't buy and spend the money and get the incipio stowaway case instead,1
1873,another cheap china product but you get what you paid for just heed my warning and don't waste your money,1
1874,incharged it and it only worked for a few weeks waiting for my first generic screen protector to kick the bucket,1
1875,to leave the device on the ear properly,1
1876,i was really looking forward to receiving it,1
1877,of course i return this case for a galaxy 3 phone,1
1878,i don't like that is just a minor nuisance is the fact that the case was unusable it's an acceptable case,1
1879,do not buy this item it will last you a bit longer,1
1880,i removed the case squeezed it a bit to get the phone out of my pocket the white on the face side of the phone,1
1881,i'm not sure if there is a small protrusion on the top and bottom exposed easy to get nicked,1
1882,one star because they do function but i'm pissed off because i could have gotten the same thing at 5 below,1
1883,when it arrived and then when i received the product somewhat a month after,1
1884,anyways i sent the phone back and i got a connection but the battery icon does not shown charging is occurring,1
1885,this charger is horrible it broke within 2-3 weeks it hardly held a charge,1
1886,now stuck in my dashboard player because the modular adapter broke off and the black case is hardly attached to the actual wallet case,1
1887,its too small who ever made these did not think about the size of a credit card you could stick in your wallet,1
1888,it's not worth the money it didn't last long at all,1
1889,i thought that given the cost this would be the perfect case for my note 3 but the seller send me the wrong one,1
1890,oh and yea i followed the directions there is still a wire connecting the two ears so it isn't truly wireless,1
1891,i figured i would be safe because the case was not of good quality,1
1892,if your gon na get a prepaid phone do yourself a favor and don't buy cheap chargers,1
1893,i do like the size of the screen the rest all good lens and touch,1
1894,this cover does not work with iphone 5 it's absolutely true,1
1895,the rubber paft of the case that surrounds the flash,1
1896,last night as usual i fully charged the battery and connected it to my audio system via both 3,1
1897,when these people make these cases do they even check to see if they would be better easier the next day,1
1898,possibly the problem is the front plastic piece that holds the phone started to lock up,1
1899,to make a long story short i have a worthless dock after only two months,1
1900,i just won't buy from them again,1
1901,this was not what i expected i just didn't like the screen protectors,1
1902,i am really disappointed with the quality of their battery is crap,1
1903,but this happened several times and was pleased with that order,1
1904,my previous cover still looked great after more than a year is the birugear metalic black gtmax and that is the major flaw,1
1905,which you have to remove the thing from the case to take pictures,1
1906,very sad product it can't charge your phone when you try to remove the tab from the shield,1
1907,so i'm giving this a 1 star because at the time when gc audio i got for almost 50 dollars,1
1908,it is obvious that it is not a long lasting product,1
1909,this is not like the shield that you buy from an at t compliant 2 g device this was faster,1
1910,now i have to replace it on a daily basis and had to get a replacement,1
1911,thought it would be better just to get a regular screen protector something cheap you can get at the mall,1
1912,by that i mean i couldn't keep it in my pocket and i can't imagine how much worse these would be for exercise,1
1913,not only does it not stay stuck to the windshield it would fall off,1
1914,what is it about amazon that they can't even cut out straight,1
1915,the reviews are all over the place is near to impossible,1
1916,the snap closure is annoying and it feels as if your phone is gone it's like cutting off your lifeline,1
1917,the charger doesn't work well with ipad 4,1
1918,it only charges the phone in the case and it was visibly bubbled up,1
1919,it will only cause you heartache when you really need to get a grip on this item,1
1920,after hearing back from skinomi they pointed out the disclaimer on the product description that it is a glittered textile glued to the case anymore,1
1921,since i couldn't get this to work i finally gave up,1
1922,the case does fit the phone properly it's way too loose phone doesn't stay in my samsung phone,1
1923,bulky even though functions well does not fit in the plug with an iphone bumper,1
1924,i ran this battery down to empty and recharged to full when it first came out its battery stopped charging after 10 months,1
1925,i think this was a reliable phone to have,1
1926,i was very saddened to find that these screen protectors don't stick to the phone,1
1927,i bought it to replace a pink one that came in at the same time and they both broke,1
1928,the cord does not work for galaxy s4,1
1929,that is true but don't expect a long lasting battery,1
1930,they fell apart and frayed and became useless after a few uses in my experience with this battery has been similar to many others,1
1931,i find that if put my phone in this case without any damage occurring,1
1932,and did not see any faster charging on my iphone 4s so it tends to fall down and not fit comfortably,1
1933,purchase this cool battery case only to find out that she was immediately disappointed with this battery,1
1934,pro's bright blue colorsleek-doesn't add bulk to your phone and not do much more than than,1
1935,if you don't want to risk it again,1
1936,my rating of this phone is a joke,1
1937,always in my opinion look to see if you are not looking directly at it,1
1938,sometimes it would hold the battery in sideways,1
1939,it doesnt look red once you get it on and give it a positive review but unfortunately i can't,1
1940,now to figure out if shipping it back for a refund and elected to return this less inferior product 8230,1
1941,since writing this review i wanted to test it out,1
1942,i took the old screen and put it on her phone and couldn't get it off,1
1943,after installation the phone would not charge when placed on the charging pad the green light never comes on,1
1944,i purchase 4 piece of this screen protector but the dried paste can't be removed at all,1
1945,the case gel around the screen is so rough that it makes is very difficult to take out of the case,1
1946,knowing that this is not oem blackberry,1
1947,if it is still here in the house i can not find much on the subject but my guess is i'm hosed,1
1948,i bought this to hold my phone for more than an hour,1
1949,be sure to read other comments what i received was the headset in a zip lock bag,1
1950,this is by far the worst screen protector i have every tried to apply,1
1951,i saw the various reviews and figured it had to give some kind of protection for your phone and the quality of the item,1
1952,this charger takes 2 1 2 hrs to charge a battery as well as the stock batteries but it obviously only worked once,1
1953,retaining stickers are cut to fit the screen which obviously did not work,1
1954,i bought armorsuit for apple iphone 4s it is easy to pick up start using right off the bat and using it forever,1
1955,if i tried to return it but got stuck with it,1
1956,its exactly like it is on the touchstone are nice,1
1957,i purchased a plastic one as well as a sharp lip on the back of a piece of garbage,1
1958,reached to amazon and was informed to reach out to the seller and they agreed to send me one,1
1959,not worth the money i don't use a case,1
1960,she has the samsung galaxy 2 and htc amaze quickly,1
1961,it's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't need a cardboard box for such a small item,1
1962,note regardless of what people say there is no way to tighten this up at all,1
1963,i'd be happpy to update this review for a refund then i would be happy with it,1
1964,the item shipped very quickly however that's just about how long i got good service from it,1
1965,my otterbox will be going into the trash because it was not shipped by amazon i got 2 day prime shipping,1
1966,i could not in good conscience suggest this product to anyone unless you just have money to burn have fun,1
1967,i really don't know what i was shipped is much thicker than my old mophie and gives my iphone the same hour usage,1
1968,it was ok but i just wasn't happy with these screen protectors it didn't stick,1
1969,i tried and i tried but it would not stay on pay for a better ones it is not worth the few extra,1
1970,it doesn't last the suction cup quality is horrible and it not loud to hear phone conversation at restaurants or events,1
1971,you have to utilize water which i didn't know what i was doing it just plain wasn't compatible with my son's phone,1
1972,got it and it didnt fit my iphone 4s,1
1973,this charger just worked for a couple months and now it won't hold a charge at all,1
1974,product was awful didn't work at home i lost my paperwork so i couldn't use any mobile coupons or anything,1
1975,literally when i purchased this screen protector because i do not have one i have a kindle fire,1
1976,because i have a galaxy s3 and not on my s4,1
1977,i should have read the other reviews before i purchased this product because of the safety issue,1
1978,good thing they're inexpensive and come in a 6 pack because i didn't have the green color like i ordered,1
1979,the red led light comes on then goes off in a few weeks it became a bit loose but still usable,1
1980,i wanted it to protect my phone from impact,1
1981,so me and my cousin ordered it for the iphone 3gs it does not fit mine,1
1982,left speaker doesn't work properly and it fits very poorly,1
1983,the case is cheap and i have bought more than few,1
1984,it broke in less than a week later,1
1985,your best bet is to keep looking so you don't feel you have a good connection,1
1986,it leaves an adhesive residue on the phone and phone works like there is no bt headset connected,1
1987,wont use this at all so if you can't access it then it becomes no better than a generic case,1
1988,i tested it when i fist got it and it did not work at all,1
1989,it worked the first time i've had an active noise cancelling headset for a long time and then came back white without ever connecting,1
1990,i am not sure if my use of it would have been awesome if it was packed correctly,1
1991,which leads me to believe that this was an oem replacement,1
1992,i have tried using this and my phone will not work well with any phone i got,1
1993,there are better cases out there for a just a little bit more money and getting a better quality case,1
1994,so if you are charging the phone in your pocket because it probably won't work,1
1995,too bad i can't find a way to contact the company,1
1996,again i did not test the design with more than one charger because not one of the best products i ever bought for a case,1
1997,never in my wildest dreams did i think something like this would kill the thing but it did,1
1998,it looks good seems to be very good but the functionality is useless for me,1
1999,i carefully put the screen protector on my wife's phone despite 34 breaking it in 34 with several charges,1
2000,the bottom line is this does not fit the phones it says it will work with a case either,1
2001,but when i'm listening to music i really trusted it,1
2002,you get what you pay for but i will never purchase a product by them again,1
2003,i bought 2 packs for me and my phone at all,1
2004,if i were to go to the store and purchase a mophie battery pack,1
2005,plastic tool that supposed to be used to lift your screen is way too small and the plastic too thick and rigid,1
2006,this has got to be the worst case ever why its hard to put on,1
2007,i thought to myself this is going to play out at all,1
2008,when charging the battery you have to set it up to charge all phones or products,1
2009,save your self frustration and time and just spend a little more money and get something that is going to last,1
2010,i thought that i had done something wrong so i tried another one just to see if i get lucky,1
2011,after one week i emailed them and let them know my issue bc no listing for this product made the distinction,1
2012,this lasted all of 2 weeks and when it finally arrived it stinked something terrible like chemicals,1
2013,even when it does snap in it's not a big deal since the price was right,1
2014,if it wasnt metled and burned so bad i would have to push it in slow and about half way in,1
2015,it is not very convenient though if you're going to sell a product sell a product that actually works in this category,1
2016,so i am way past the 30 days they didn't work for me,1
2017,i'm assuming they have had this problem with the iottie one tap,1
2018,my son wanted this so i got it replaced through the website,1
2019,i feel that having to charge it this way 1 star is due,1
2020,i went to test the glass on it was too thick not evenly cut from the factory,1
2021,and actually puts more scratches on your phone than using these screen protectors,1
2022,sure the volume was louder but if you do i am not sure about and they do a good job,1
2023,update 2 18 2014 i've had the cables for about three weeks but has now stopped working,1
2024,the bottom lip while looking good on the picture but when i got it,1
2025,to make matters worse the butter knife scratched the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in,1
2026,but when it started having poor reception i started getting concerned that i had a 12 second workout at 1 am,1
2027,i love this style case as i can't get my money back,1
2028,also the volume keys do not work at all and i couldn't refuse trying this,1
2029,i use the windshield suction mount as there is no guaranteee you will be paid,1
2030,now it's july and the unit doesn't appear to be designed for adult size ears as noted by other reviewers,1
2031,the bad i have never been able to use the volume and screen shut down button,1
2032,they left a lot of bubbles even though i tried to keep the phone alive if i am actively using it while plugged in,1
2033,its flimsy and doesnt even fit the phone,1
2034,i returned this produced it was not what i spected i just did not succeed in getting this new screen cover on my iphone 5,1
2035,got all distorted and will not go back here say the truth about the experience as it took me to write this review,1
2036,if i do i will update this postingwould i buy this phone again not even worth the it would cost to return it,1
2037,they are short and take forever to charge my phone previous similar chargers took 4-5 hours on this battery,1
2038,as someone who travels for work i have found this to be incompatible with my perfectly applied anti-glare shield,1
2039,while the oem charger certainly charges more slowly while i'm using my iphone while charging it can barely keep up,1
2040,what a waste of time and money i don t recommend,1
2041,hopefully there is no technical reason why they can't negotiate between three signals is annoying,1
2042,i even got my phone so i wanted one that i could voice text etc,1
2043,order from apple not from where i can get them out but these were terrible,1
2044,the plastic backing that holds the phone came apart from the wallet and my phone hit the floor 10x as much as it does me,1
2045,so i get stuck with something i did not order and i had to use the bass boost option on all music,1
2046,and the thing is it doesn't let you hang up the phone,1
2047,seller then wouldn't take the product back and stuck with the motorola roadster 2 bluetooth and fm features,1
2048,don't recommend and it's a white case with dirty spots on it and also keeping the money,1
2049,bought this for my droid and it does not work as described to date i do not know what the issue was,1
2050,white version color is far more white than the nexus 5 and see how thick 12 mm is,1
2051,the tiny slider mount will not fit into the phones port properly,1
2052,i haven't tried it with my wife's s4 to connect,1
2053,these did not cost much but crapped out in less than a week the clear back was so scratched up,1
2054,95 on top of the phone in the same place mine did,1
2055,i can't get any of the lights to turn on,1
2056,she asked what i wanted and i feel like i was lied to about it working on the note,1
2057,big mistake as now i have to deal with any hassle of the product not working right,1
2058,original review so i was looking for a case that i will like but this is not an original otterbox holster,1
2059,you don't want to keep replacing them every other week,1
2060,this case was too big for nexus 5,1
2061,all of the provided sleeve sizes are big enough to warrant calling shenanigans on this product,1
2062,do not waste your money on this non-working product,1
2063,some apps just won't work too cheap i would not recommend this brand model to anyone,1
2064,the unit looks very promising when you unpack it but this is the one that's the most fragile,1
2065,since this product couldn't do what i needed it for and what it claims to do i suppose,1
2066,if you are going to have to buy a little pigtail or use a pair of apple headphones,1
2067,granted you have to make sure my phone was working flawlessly,1
2068,it fits snuggly and protects the back sides and possibly even the front of your phone it looks not-oem,1
2069,i should have read the reviews but did not listen,1
2070,this was the worst thing i have bought from amazon for my telephone,1
2071,the little round thing that is supposed to work with my sprint samsung galaxy s2 and it doesnt work,1
2072,if it wasn't for the fact that the top lock button part doesn't even fit on my droid x,1
2073,also the quality of the product is as good as it is shown on the pictures but i instead received a medium baby blue color,1
2074,this item was cute and was broke when i got it in a day after ordering using amazon's prime shipping,1
2075,after weeks of trying to get it replaced with sprint,1
2076,look pretty but i know it would be cool as a wallet but its big and bulky and then you can't hear it,1
2077,installed the screen turned on the phone but would not pair or be detected,1
2078,these are the facts if you do not use a case this is great,1
2079,i tried to get it replaced they never sent me another one which never got to me,1
2080,i returned item because they didn't work for my device case,1
2081,i then tried the suction mount and not only did the product arrive scratched and beaten up it didn't hold a charge,1
2082,it replaces the original back cover that came with the phone,1
2083,i saw that it didn't work only about a week,1
2084,my original battery easily lasts 12 hours with moderate use talking texting web browsing and e-mailing,1
2085,i bought 2 of this and one doesnt charge at all after a week so yeah its junk,1
2086,the device has some positive aspects and i don't notice it's there,1
2087,i like the thickness wish i got a different case now and it fits better,1
2088,i would not recommend this to anyone looking for a headset to try anything else,1
2089,looking at this purchase i shouldn't have purchased this if i knew this would happen,1
2090,by all means i was not expecting this not happy,1
2091,looks cute in picture terrible in real life was going to give two stars but now it is down to one,1
2092,in this case it looks very cheap and the plastic clips that holds the phone fell apart in my hand,1
2093,i didnt realize it was soo gaudy looking its huge the only reason i didn't return it right away,1
2094,i would not recommend it for everyday use,1
2095,this portable battery is about the same from a connectivity standpoint,1
2096,bought these and after about 2 weeks the second lasting about 3 weeks,1
2097,when i purchased this product based on the reviews,1
2098,they were written by google translate and i can not understand how this product possibly made it through engineering and testing,1
2099,1a usb car charger works with iphone 5 5s and ipad and it is incompatible wow,1
2100,worked great for the first month after purchase so i'll say thank you amazon for always being so open to returns,1
2101,a the number one problem with this phone let me start the music player sucks don't get this one,1
2102,i don't recommend anyone to buy it,1
2103,i finally had the chance to test out the black update on the lumia 1020,1
2104,the quality of this product is that its cheap and it has a rainbow or waterlike effect,1
2105,i had mine all of a day before it stopped working,1
2106,the price seemed to good to be true it probably is,1
2107,the only time you'd want the device to be rooted i suspected that smth,1
2108,totally amazes me that a screen that is both bright and not defective,1
2109,if i could easily store the charger with it as well,1
2110,shame on me for not reading the reviews before choosing the right case for your phone,1
2111,although it states right on the case itself no longer connects to the cable,1
2112,it does not offer any sort of cushion for front droppage,1
2113,six of these come in a pack and that there is a slide button on the right side doesn't close,1
2114,save your money this is pure junk and it is a not a good use of 20,1
2115,feeling crafty i attempted to install the micro sd i discovered that this is a five star product,1
2116,after less than 1 month and only a few uses i wouldn't buy this ever again,1
2117,i don't even know if it works on the road,1
2118,even if you slip out the adapter the clip on the face of the phone not just the flat top surface,1
2119,1a output for fast 34 one big lie it charges very slowly like 4 hours to go from no charge to the full charge,1
2120,i plugged it in again later that night when the phone's icon for battery life remaining was far lower than normal,1
2121,keep in mind i just received my order today and these things do not stick to anything at all,1
2122,probably cost me more to send back then i paid for it so into the trash it went,1
2123,the only plus is that when it doesn't stick to that included disc either,1
2124,i ordered 2 and don't know how to get out,1
2125,amazon awarded me and found in my favor and this ended weeks ago,1
2126,price was good but the bow broke in half within a week after purchase,1
2127,the reason i am giving 1 star is because of my experience with this battery has been similar to many others,1
2128,i like that there is a charger but it doesn't deserve a half a star,1
2129,worn correctly it still does not work and there were problems charging,1
2130,if you're willing to take the risk of having a phone with a case on it just to be sure,1
2131,do not purchase this you will be very glad you did,1
2132,i could not get it on my phone,1
2133,i don't know if it's too late for a refund and can not recommend this product,1
2134,the sides were also not square and didn't line up and now i have a lock button that i have to swipe to use,1
2135,and here's what i did here it's going back tomorrow,1
2136,its very soft and durable but is for an iphone 4 this does not fit tablets 7-10 34,1
2137,since it was coming from china and going through customs i would not have so many charger connected to the outlets,1
2138,this charger worked for one evening and it worked great in this regard,1
2139,i would save your money and time and go with a different brand than iloome,1
2140,i have used screen protectors for the front and it's just terrible,1
2141,i am now using the cords with my laptop to charge my phone because it wouldn't write,1
2142,without developers and big hi tech company backing supporting it most likely this new operating system that don't have a smooth touch,1
2143,when i was setting it up i noticed there was a gap between my phone screen and the screen protector and my phone,1
2144,all four of the hs850 headsets worked for a few days it stops working,1
2145,apple is going to have to buy a male male audio chord and plug that into the att charger,1
2146,surely it would sound better if i plugged it in and left it overnight,1
2147,i had to cut the screen protector to fit the screen properly,1
2148,very pretty but the bow fell off the day i received the item,1
2149,the indicator light blinks but it will not stay connected when my phone isn't in it and damage my phone,1
2150,it looks good but the cut was not even close to being able to control this soundbar with my directv remote,1
2151,it fit fine and it is good enough for us with little motoblur,1
2152,that said the keyboard is great the specs are good and the headphone cutout is especially large,1
2153,now in june the battery is to the point where i had convos with a corporate supervisor and other corporate,1
2154,so the outside of the case actually helps the on off button maybe 8 times when it broke,1
2155,this case does it's job in terms of protection and doesn't wear well,1
2156,although it fits well on my htc evo 4 g when i occasionally use it for gps,1
2157,plugging my sync cable into the bottom of the band you end up pushing on the flat ridge under the rubber bulb,1
2158,unfortunately not only does the usb cable not work but it will not stay clipped to my phone,1
2159,used the 2 and did not fit not only it took about a month for me to get this external battery charged,1
2160,with the skin on it you can not close the battery door,1
2161,my only issue with it is that it does not fit dust gets inside your side buttons,1
2162,i wish someone gave a better description of what this was but i am pretty sure this is not a good quality case,1
2163,not happy the back part of this case is pretty good but with one major flaw,1
2164,i still am not sure what is going on,1
2165,upon closer notice i found the white stripped backing as well as the flexibility of charging three most common devices i use,1
2166,this battery cases kill my signal so i can not return the three i purchased,1
2167,the look of the phone plus it didn't seem automatic after the initial pairings,1
2168,please do not buy it because it's feather light,1
2169,if you have a 4 g phone and when you are in a workout and have to re-pair the unit,1
2170,they are too weak with thin plastic and too small for the iphone to fit well it has to be for the nt120 t,1
2171,unfortunately the first time i've seen this type of thing before but it's definitely not worth the money i spends,1
2172,-easy to get on and once i finally managed to get it to slide all the way down,1
2173,it is thin it is flimsy it is not a portable battery pack charger which is amazingly compact for such a powerful charger,1
2174,into the back of my phone which is a galaxy s4 and it works great,1
2175,original review i was a little surprised to,1
2176,i would say that this product just does not work,1
2177,the rest of the case and frankly it looks like hell on toast,1
2178,not that seidio would have done anything because they don't use standard usb cables for connecting its not worth the money,1
2179,upon closer inspection however you will notice the two retaining pins on the micro-usb cord to your pc,1
2180,when attached to my windshield and does not move once you've found the correct gels it comes with three i only got one,1
2181,took forever to come which i realized after i had ordered the phone and was not deformed,1
2182,i think it coming in the mail broken and would not stay clean,1
2183,i bought it because of the tempered glass got a chip,1
2184,secondly this thing is a oil magnet and i'm just waiting for those earbud wires to break on that,1
2185,arrived on 3 jul and all was well until i dropped my phone so much for high impact,1
2186,i ordered screen fosmon screen protector for both galaxys 3 and you can't upgrade it,1
2187,the unit said it was fully charged and the phone battery still drained,1
2188,01 i figured i'd buy a second one and that stopped working about ten days later,1
2189,the screen protector was too small for the samsungs ii,1
2190,i recommend klearkare for the money and i promptly returned them,1
2191,that is until 6 months later and it won't charge this battery or allow me to access my phone while charging,1
2192,it broke within the week he got it because it won't stay shut,1
2193,the inside of the case was badly bent so it doesn't take much for the case to stay put together,1
2194,bought it and it doesn't last the suction cup quality is horrible and it not loud to hear phone conversation at restaurants or events,1
2195,the next day i get a call from my credit card company is now handling the dispute,1
2196,it about 2 weeks and one day it just didnt fit my phone at all,1
2197,here are some photos of our covers only after 2 months of use the battery just crapped out,1
2198,i was surprised to see that the micro usb end is very low quality,1
2199,needless to say i was satisfied with this device but after 2 weeks of using it,1
2200,i got my phone yesterday it looks similiar to the pic but the product isn't well made and customer service is terrible,1
2201,i got a charger set for a kindle fire and none for my galaxy s4,1
2202,this purchase was an absolute waste of money for such poor quality,1
2203,i have wanted a sidekick for a couple years but they crapped out on me,1
2204,there is no way to stick it to the back of the phone,1
2205,your mileage may vary but i can't ruin my battery with this product,1
2206,don't waste your time money on this product and will be returning it coz it didn't fit my phone and its screen,1
2207,since it is the first micro usb cable that comes with the kit,1
2208,the socket opening for headphones is too small to fit my phone with it,1
2209,i have really big hands and i could no longer text accurately using my swype,1
2210,i figured they'd work with a 4s but i knew it would last me a year or longer,1
2211,however when i reinsert it into my telephone to see if it was infact comparable to defender series as stated,1
2212,does not keep a charge to my phone and his stopped working altogether,1
2213,while this is only the second day that i've had this case for about two months,1
2214,but the key thing it is supposed to sit on top of the display screen is shaped differently,1
2215,this bluetooth model not only feels flimsy but worst of all the device smells like a burnt electrical wire,1
2216,i'm disappointed in it but i guess i'll see if the replacement sounds any better,1
2217,cancelling before it's up via the website doesn't work as advertised and there is no problems accessing these,1
2218,i thought all the hype about this being a common issue,1
2219,if you use this charger you flip the battery so the back of the phone causes the phone not to lay flat,1
2220,after installing the lcd i noticed that the charging unit had failed when the phone's charge had run down again,1
2221,however upon plugging it back into my ear and reattach the ear hook i was like what,1
2222,not the case with the iphone 5 and they weren't the right colors,1
2223,when the phone ring sometime it does not respond when i slide my finger on it and not non-glare for me,1
2224,it took about 5minutes to take it off and it still doesn't stay in place very well,1
2225,i called dhl and they told me because it was past the 30 day window,1
2226,i bought this battery for my evo 4 g because i wanted to see how good these were,1
2227,they should at least withstand abuse because they advertized that it's good for the garbage i was very disappointed,1
2228,believe me when i tell you to spend a few more and hopefully the charger will last as long as my regular battery did,1
2229,so i sent them back and will spend a few extra bucks and buy something that will last you,1
2230,if they fixed the size it could be a virtual tossup i guess i would be happy,1
2231,i am not pleased with this at all and the material itself gets dirty and does not wipe off easily,1
2232,looks good but won't do much for your phone is one of life's goals but this is not it,1
2233,also when purchasing one note that there isn't a little molded cover for your on off button on the top,1
2234,thanks for nothing and i hope it a better design,1
2235,you can either line them up with the camera and the speaker is off slightly so it cuts into the camera some,1
2236,it's much more expensive but worth every penny,1
2237,charger takes too long to charge my phone faster,1
2238,this is very unstable and i'm not at all impressed with the product,1
2239,the 34 glittery 34 finish actually started to come off on all four corners from this case,1
2240,its a lie this is not leather it's synthetic and bad quality material,1
2241,after many frustrating hours i came up with the workaround noted above it was sort of 34 loose 34,1
2242,the product was difficult to install and does not stand phone,1
2243,nothing about my case leads me to think it's ok to barrage amazon customers,1
2244,so i'm giving this a 1 star because i had to take out to hear my phone calls,1
2245,sellers should rise or fall with the quality of this item was very poor,1
2246,i guess i also figured that based on my research the clips on the edges do not fit do not clip it falls apart,1
2247,material is very flimsy and i feel like i wasted my money on this product,1
2248,on a positive note all of the buttons are hard to press,1
2249,after about 30 minutes i noticed that the charger will not slide into my lighter socket,1
2250,very disappointed i was expecting something a lot better than some of the others,1
2251,i tried to use it because i'm in colombia,1
2252,i found that it was too big,1
2253,i got all the colors but the reason i dislike it is because it doesn't seem to be very fussy,1
2254,case stopped charging phone after a week it was malfunctioning and now it doesn't even power up my phone,1
2255,for traveling the usb issue is not a huge deal but enough for it to disappoint me a bit,1
2256,it ships from overseas so it took a long time to load icons even though the phone is on your hip or in your hand,1
2257,these batteries fit the phone and it doesn't work on anyone's phone sold as is total piece of garbage in my opinion,1
2258,i gently peeled it off and tried again,1
2259,original review this is the best thing i have ordered from you guys before and never had these type of issues,1
2260,shortly after she got it she called me and asked me to contact them before leaving feedback,1
2261,i only had it for a few hours then poof,1
2262,this backup source charged my phone twice and hers once,1
2263,i only remove the ase about once a week so it should not be for the price while relatively stationary,1
2264,after arriving at my new location i attempt to plug in the usb cable to the bottom and it's stiff as heck,1
2265,i couldn't give it a negative star i probably would,1
2266,return through amazon was perfect as always though so was not a big deal i proceeded to use it as a phone absolutely terrible,1
2267,these are not like the pic but doesn't fit my galaxy at all,1
2268,i was very disappointed as many of the previous reviewers have noted this is not compatible for iphone 5,1
2269,needless to say it was coming off the sides a lot,1
2270,purchased september 2012 this is specifically supposed to be a extended high capacity battery but the life of the oem battery,1
2271,but for how expensive it is i thought it would of been like a big crystal ball,1
2272,i have asked to send it back but it doesn't,1
2273,it was cheap but i didn't pay a ton for it so i am not upset about the money,1
2274,it does not have a good recommendation for you but i'd still be weary,1
2275,if you look at it and it became more obvious that this product is a waste of monies,1
2276,but i can say the seller is top notch and the shipping was way too long,1
2277,it's like the company couldn't figure out why these chinese can mangle up such a simple design concept,1
2278,this cable is pretty much only used to charge the battery with 4 different chargers and all failed,1
2279,bought this because of all the positive reviews i read,1
2280,overall i was not impressed by this case at all it's probably too late to return,1
2281,i reset my phone on christmas and had to take it out the vents is a hassle,1
2282,the case doesn't fit the phone properly,1
2283,worked for 4 weeks but one day all of a sudden it just stopped working no clue why or how,1
2284,i knew it was a bad experience for me i had just chucked money out the window go find another product,1
2285,this is a standard screen protector that is advertised is really really good,1
2286,so i am a little angry about that but i didn't have anything nice to say i shouldn't say anything at all,1
2287,i was very disappointed when i got this i was using it it made my phone feel a little safer,1
2288,i would love to have a refund for this item i would save the money,1
2289,your young kids have been begging you for a cell phone account just the above message with no explanation,1
2290,the rubber part of this case is not even in the same room as the router,1
2291,i just upgraded to the samsung galaxy s4 and i want to make sure it was ok,1
2292,what i like about this item is that it holds the iphone straight up like this is that the microphone seems to work,1
2293,so this blue tooth device is going to work and you may want to look into a phone that gets lots of use,1
2294,i also later found out that it was defective,1
2295,got this cover for my granddaughter and it's a lot easier than swapping out batteries,1
2296,it is generally in a larger carrying case or on a table or floor or in the water,1
2297,i don't think i'll be switching to the motorola photon,1
2298,the product doesn't have the holes at the bottom to hold the tablet is too thin,1
2299,guess i will have to return this phone to them and get my money,1
2300,since i only use it occasionally the bulky nature of it and the battery doesn't last much longer than my old pathetic original battery,1
2301,the leather like exterior is beautiful and the product is cheaply made and is highly unlikely to protect your ipod from very much,1
2302,the silicone black part is really thin and the two ports at the bottom are extremely hard to take apart,1
2303,it is also a poor fitting connection to the phone is way too big,1
2304,the case itself is a piece of junk right out of the package it looked pretty solid,1
2305,after getting the charger fully charged i plugged my phone up to it and it works,1
2306,unplug the usb from the external battery and started using the phone's battery,1
2307,this screen protector does not fit the back of the case was so stiff,1
2308,now again this is my experience so as i know i had to keep the volume low low low to avoid the buzzing,1
2309,0 sure the connector to the phone is not in the least bit,1
2310,don't buy it it won't protect your phone due to natural damage,1
2311,i've had previous zero lemon products with the tpu case and it holds the phone securely,1
2312,on the iphone 5 i bought 2 of these and they've all broken upon plugging them in,1
2313,i couldn't get the cutout portion that goes over the pink case is plastic crap,1
2314,i was pleasantly pleased with the case because it got stuck to the charging cable,1
2315,my sister lives in a light green area which means i should have great reception 5 bars,1
2316,apple is going to have to buy a new one different company though,1
2317,1 the covers you peel off are very thin so its hard to find and press without dislodging the unit,1
2318,i provided them with the model number of my phone and inserted it into the case and inside the old phone,1
2319,but for how expensive it is i thought it would be quick easy and convenient but i was wrong,1
2320,there's zero chance an evo would fit in this case an old type flip phone will fit,1
2321,i am now using an otterbox case and enjoying it even though it claims this is waterproof its not,1
2322,it barely charged my galaxy s4 and the sound is terrific bold crisp and clear,1
2323,i kinda figured it was too cheap to be real but i bought it to use as a paperweight or a doorstop,1
2324,i ordered this case as the fit was good and i feel it would have protected my phone from a hard wind,1
2325,after getting it paired to the phone i found the option to turn it off and on everytime i remove it,1
2326,the good reviews i read about this case the one problem i can't recommend it on any level,1
2327,i still have the product in hand at the store and it's done the job so far,1
2328,i turned sync back on only to find that t-mobile refused to release the numbers,1
2329,mine worked for a day or two throw it in a drawer somewhere,1
2330,unpacked it and plugged it into a usb port to recharge it,1
2331,this thing does not fit my iphone 5 this case is clearly not made for a nokia 1020 the sides are to wide,1
2332,when i received the order the clip would not fit on the arm of my recliner and it fell off,1
2333,sony needs to make a better quality product this one is junk,1
2334,i also tried it in a usb wall charger i have and the charge last only for about 4hours if you lucky,1
2335,can't recommend it no matter how cheap this is was never happy with this case,1
2336,although the bag it came it says new i am not sure how long this worked for,1
2337,i really thought i would like this but i got so many bubbles and looks ugly don't buy it,1
2338,this causes me to wait until i have used it couple times and it gone bad,1
2339,i will not advise anyone to buy this product and it wasn't what i wanted in the first place,1
2340,i wanted it to be my favorite but it turns out it is very thin and probably more prone to breakage,1
2341,these batteries don't work they will not hold a charge as described by the manufacturer,1
2342,i bought them to use with my ipod nano latest gen,1
2343,not very happy crystals come off after using it for only a couple days,1
2344,check the customer images i've uploaded to see what i took it was always upside down,1
2345,i purchased this item for my iphone and was very happy how quickly it was delivered,1
2346,i'm going to try to return it,1
2347,this is a waste of money and a big pain in the butt to return things that aren't marked correctly,1
2348,after having it for only a week now and they still hold the number,1
2349,it does not fit my phone at all,1
2350,check my other reviews and you'll see exactly what i mean,1
2351,wall charger did not fit into the port on the phone was bent somehow and no longer works,1
2352,pros case is thin compared to other options take a pass,1
2353,maybe it's not so back to amazon it will go,1
2354,it only fits the phone if the phone is face-down on a hard surface,1
2355,i guess i shouldve read it a little better but then your vision is blocked by the visor,1
2356,plus it took a really long time to receive in the mail,1
2357,give me my money back but thats not a problem the problem is the samsung tablet software,1
2358,i opened one cable and plugged it into a usb port on your computer,1
2359,the top most portion of the phone above the main button,1
2360,i doubt it will protect your phone but it's not so bad,1
2361,i picked the correct case for my phone and a few colleagues have bought it,1
2362,that was not the case for my iphone 5,1
2363,the stupid red light just blinks all the time so i tried all the 5 peices thinking that some of them might be like that,1
2364,i have used better products than this and i didn't even use both ports but then after two days of using,1
2365,broke within a week i wanted it to do i returned it,1
2366,i had the anker product for the s4 and it doesn't work,1
2367,i'm very disappointed with the screen protector looking funny like a long bubble,1
2368,i paid over 40 dollars for this case and didn't fit at all on my touchscreen,1
2369,i've had plenty of screen protectors in the past but i still have not heard anything,1
2370,what a cheap piece of crap that i have ever had,1
2371,i can not get it to work once since it came in the garbage because expected it to be a better headset,1
2372,this product absolutely does not work for galaxys ii t mobile,1
2373,unfortunately while this case is definitely slim,1
2374,edit after using a month i found that it was very thin and brittle,1
2375,i was upset because it was a gift to someone and they were waiting for it but i can't use my phone at all,1
2376,instead it looks smeared on the surface of my dash which is like the picture it is hideously ugly,1
2377,i followed the instructions and it worked the first time i used it i put it on my truck,1
2378,again this isn't a fault of this mount but there's not a hint of the original audio source emerging from the static,1
2379,at first i thought that chargers don't have to deal with a company that operates out of china,1
2380,this phone case did not fit in either of our cars securely,1
2381,people made this product out to be the worst of them all,1
2382,it sometimes connects and sometimes it just doesn't do a good job,1
2383,i was able to hear the spears well,1
2384,if you're happy with it because you can not use s-view and the phone doesn't even raise it one percent,1
2385,then i returned it and they claimed they never received it on their end and asking me to take a fall for it is inexcusable,1
2386,however it didn't so i threw it away the same day,1
2387,i then put it on my phone 5 mins ago for the first time the case broke the day i recieved it,1
2388,the case what's nice is it looked online unfortunately when i received this item as a set of 3,1
2389,it's just doesn't hold a charge for about 2 days then your stuck with this dirty looking case,1
2390,unusable because as shown in detailed image there is one big hole in the bottom that isn't on my phone,1
2391,i don't know that for sure i still don't have sip working,1
2392,their customer service was great with my refund but the phone was not close to the bluetooth device,1
2393,the duracell powermat pm1pb1 travelmat portable charger is about the same size of a deck of cards,1
2394,2 of them didn't have the right nomenclature,1
2395,i had a problem with this item,1
2396,i will say that the design is such that the edges bubble up as soon as you put it in top first,1
2397,if you're driving the best i can say about this headset,1
2398,i still can't understand why this case gets 1 star 1 the quality is terrible for this price,1
2399,i've connected it to my phone again it didn't work once i got it on i was very please at first,1
2400,i hope eventually they do let go of it the phone cradle fall over,1
2401,the connector end on the phone side around the edges,1
2402,i'm surprised that they got so many good reviews of this one and the cheaper ones,1
2403,i often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like pebble has no fix for their problems,1
2404,the rubber part of the case broke the phone but i don like my stuff looking like garbage,1
2405,even though it looks just like the original one year old battery that came with the phone,1
2406,so unfortunately i had to try 3 of them before i could get one on right,1
2407,i can also sync my email to it so that is why i bought this particular one,1
2408,one for my blackberry storm 9530 and the other for my car but i can't tell you about it's charging ability,1
2409,this battery cases kill my signal so i can not use this phone or any wp8 phone for that matter,1
2410,don't buy this but don't buy from this seller,1
2411,putting the phone on gsm only as browsing speeds will be slower and you will need a micro sd card for this,1
2412,i got this to charge my phone but i have a feeling that this is not useful for me,1
2413,i just did not like the quality of the part the black strip came apart in the package,1
2414,i like thewilson electronics mobilepro cell phone signal booster zforce extends an in-vehicle cell zone,1
2415,i received this case in the trash after a week,1
2416,i gave it one star but now that it's colder outside i have to wear a coat,1
2417,this one was used only once or twice and charging it it starts to not fully charge,1
2418,i charge my phone for more than an hour or so to fully recharge again,1
2419,it is clear this is not for nexus so don't buy this if you want something better just buy a apple product,1
2420,he said it does not have a contact number for i-blason customer service number,1
2421,i've had this for a little screen protector,1
2422,i charged up the charger fully and connected it to my car audio the noise in the cable was unbearable,1
2423,it doesn't fit my phone well at all and i had it plugged in over night while i slept,1
2424,it fell apart after only a few days of use,1
2425,i am going back to my cheapy until i can find something else,1
2426,i am bummed it's broken but it was so cheap but i regret buying this piece of junk,1
2427,i had the samsung s3 it was a great price i would not recommend,1
2428,after realizing i had to keep jiggling it to get it to register that it was connected,1
2429,hot pink doesn't sit well on it,1
2430,so many issues that i don't know if i did something wrong or didn't have the green color like i ordered,1
2431,the battery lasted about 3 days and now it is cluttering up my closet waiting to be discarded,1
2432,so unless you have a clean room or you just don't care about a vertically worn holster go with otterbox,1
2433,accessory support at cingular stores rather poor two cingular stores did not have the orange indicator like all official samsung photo show,1
2434,i was definitely sweating but come on they don't even have to swithch back and forth to deside which were better,1
2435,if you try to use it and fail,1
2436,tried the case within a couple of days and then stopped working,1
2437,second set of wires i bought for my two droids were similar,1
2438,instead it seems like it would be stylish,1
2439,and it doesn't last as long as or longer than the phone,1
2440,my wife describes it as peach pink so i don't have cable or satellite just ota antenna,1
2441,it was so cheap it would cost more money to send it back,1
2442,brought it home plugged it in and it was at 90 % and it is still only at 96 %,1
2443,the only thing good about this product was the same product so i bought it,1
2444,for a product that i have bought online,1
2445,after reading all the reviews because i liked the x so much,1
2446,should have known this from the price but it's not awful considering the previously mentioned benefit hiding just below it,1
2447,i only used this 2 times the first time it came from importer520 it was perfect,1
2448,i was barely on it as i was thinking the blue was going to be,1
2449,worst screen protector i have ever had the displeasure of using,1
2450,i researched because i'm having the same issue in a short amount of time,1
2451,does this company realize that they recommended this product for a refund but could not after 30 days,1
2452,i'm also concerned that it puts pressure on the cover and therefore the phone and screen cracked badly,1
2453,the triumph really has to be charged fully by the computer,1
2454,the magnet was not strong enough to keep the face off flat surfaces,1
2455,i have used these protectors before and they have always lasted a long time with less effort and with no particles on the screen,1
2456,not a good quality item at all i would try to run some water over the protector and wash off any particles,1
2457,my intent was to use this to charge your phone,1
2458,bought 2 unit for me and my phone at all,1
2459,all im saying is dont be dumb and waste a lot of time on the phone to even handle it,1
2460,otherwise it just seems like a poor option if you can't believe just me but advised strongly against,1
2461,it wasn't the same as the prior,1
2462,this 1 star review is you can see the screen so it would be on hand when i became eligible for a subsidized phone upgrade,1
2463,looked at the phone and the cover doesn't even snap together,1
2464,so if one goes bad then it wouldn't continuously charge the phone,1
2465,i won't recommend this to anyone at any time,1
2466,yes i rocked it ever-so-slightly curved from grinding,1
2467,all im saying is dont be dumb and waste a lot of money but it's worth not even half of one star,1
2468,now i have a brand new phone and now i have nothing,1
2469,people i would call said i sounded like i was listening to music 100 yards away through a metal wall,1
2470,bug 1 this is the worst this ever,1
2471,now i'm faced with trying a different item or the quality has taken a severe turn for the worse,1
2472,this unit is hard to take off when i wanted to appreciate subtlety of sound,1
2473,after waiting over 3 weeks i receive a case that doesn't even fit and it's just ok imo,1
2474,when i finally got it it didn't even color the whole phone,1
2475,i cleaned the screen and placed it on and with in the next day air thus the great customer service,1
2476,they won't be able to see past the mirror protector,1
2477,to be fair the vendor wanted to send me another case i wasn't clear i would not recommend it to anyone,1
2478,guess its time to look for another manufacturer for a 3,1
2479,and i wanted a better way to make the fit without damaging the iphone in the process of being connected,1
2480,i knew i was taking a risk after looking at some of the reviews and was hoping to have more colors but theses are useless,1
2481,maybe you'll have better luck than me which is cool,1
2482,the biggest problem i have is that the case tends to push up the screen protector really messes with the phone's docking station,1
2483,the white part of the case was all scratched up,1
2484,the first part of my dissatisfaction was my own fault for not reading enough reviews,1
2485,i d did save my screen from many a scratch i will have to glue it back in if it is even possible,1
2486,and all on top of that if you use this case,1
2487,add after 2 weeks of use and the phone was loose all the way around the edges,1
2488,the sad part is it took almost a month to get this item to work and have to return it,1
2489,needless to say i will not be buying from this seller,1
2490,one will not stay plugged in the phone unless you hold it perfectly still almost impossible in a moving car,1
2491,i ordered this after all kinds of problems with my wife's phone and i received the case the silicone cover was cracked,1
2492,since it comes form hong kong it would cost more for shipping handling then the product,1
2493,i got this as an extra charger for when i am out of luck,1
2494,the seller did give me a full refund if i sent it back right away,1
2495,i wish i can post the name of the plan is 500 unlimited data,1
2496,i bought a tech armor screen protector in the front of the phone,1
2497,it looks like the real thing but it isn't easy either,1
2498,it's really unfortunate cuz i really like this device i can charge my iphone through the plus,1
2499,to make matters worse when the phone is in my pocket or in my purse,1
2500,at first i liked that the case was very loose around the edges and just continued to get worse,1
2501,actually 2 corners at the same time and they have ripped me off the first time i used it,1
2502,this item kept falling apart since the first day i had them the little gems started falling out,1
2503,i am still waiting and now i am waiting to see if they can help,1
2504,the sides do go up a little past the lip so it will not charge your battery properly and could reduce the lifespan,1
2505,i wanted to like this charger because of the ratings but be warned that this may not work,1
2506,the cell phone will not recognize that it is plugged in,1
2507,on speaker phone this case does not cover that edge,1
2508,not sure if the one i had was a low power cable not to apple spec and won't charge,1
2509,they received them 12 days ago and i absolutely loved it,1
2510,while this works as well as putting a power ranger sticker on the back that wouldn't peel off all the way,1
2511,this product sucks and it does not work for iphone 4,1
2512,but this was the very first use and it's not that big of a deal but it does sacrifice some grip,1
2513,i've used screen protectors for the iphone 5 here from amazon,1
2514,all five protectors were bent and would not adhere to the iphone easy and bubbles did not disappear,1
2515,respectfully sellers should let buyers know this and not have much cushioning when i did if it even fit,1
2516,update i looked at my phone and it is not fingerprint proof,1
2517,both the wrong one for my phone so that's forgiveable,1
2518,don't look at the back side nearly as much as i would like for it to be snug-fitting and easier to hear,1
2519,the case came in 2 different colors this one has a car charger,1
2520,i'll update my review in a month or two of using it,1
2521,i have to hold it in really hard,1
2522,waited a good while for this case and i can not recharge the phone at the same time,1
2523,for those wondering the case does not fit to protect the phone in case of an emergency or similar important situation,1
2524,want to type while on the phone with it on,1
2525,i actively try to stay away from this item and possibly the seller,1
2526,you have to turn off the phone or the holder itselfhope this review helps,1
2527,within one day the plug for earphones broke off and the cassette will not fully eject,1
2528,this thing will not even fit my phone like at all,1
2529,the design is very pretty which is why i can not recommend it to anyone,1
2530,it has been delivered however i'm unable to pursue resolution any further to remain in compliance,1
2531,did not fit properly over the phone's camera flash or rear speaker,1
2532,amazon awarded me and found in my favor and this ended weeks ago,1
2533,the internal memory is not enough and it just kept peeling off the whole thing,1
2534,then i thought i would be able to pick up ham radio television signals and de-scrambled cable television,1
2535,as soon as i opened the package i was instantly upset,1
2536,i bought armorsuit for apple iphone 4s it is easy to see through them buy at your own risk,1
2537,what this means is that instead of the ca-100 cable that has a usb cigarette outlet wall charger and a bunch of cords to boot,1
2538,it feels like its about to fall off and the black part was stuck inside the case,1
2539,and it doesn't fit my samsung galaxy s2 and re-verifying,1
2540,i love changing the case on my cell phone thank glen wells,1
2541,it covers my entire phone which is what i wanted but shipping would cost almost more than the phone,1
2542,now for the bad half of the time and then after less than two months into having the device it stopped charging my tablet,1
2543,i bought this phone only to use while i was doing homework that i could listen to music throughout my car,1
2544,first of all i ordered this item took it out the box and it looked fine,1
2545,the holsters is practically useless since when you slide the case off each time i wasn't really too bothered about this,1
2546,the clip broke off after 2 weeks of usethe protection on this case is subpar,1
2547,there are to many bubbles and i couldn't get them out even with scotch tape,1
2548,ive had this charger for a month and it did it,1
2549,for some people this phone and the reality is that this type of prodcut doesnt seem tomwork with the note,1
2550,the edges are too tight and do not have the activation button on the headset,1
2551,it looks very pretty online and when i got the phone and it was nice,1
2552,if you only use it for a keyboard but in my experience with them by writing a review,1
2553,i got a case for the note 2,1
2554,when i send a text it takes about 30 mins to an hour to charge barely 2 %,1
2555,i was very careful when lifting it off the phone sooo they aren't that sticky either,1
2556,i bought this product coolstream so i could listen to music throughout my car,1
2557,judging by the material though i don't know why but i don't really think i have a choice,1
2558,i just got this and paid extra for 1 day shipping for a client i will be losing money on now,1
2559,i've had this phone for about a month and now no longer aligns properly with the earpiece sensors and buttons,1
2560,not sure if this was a defective unit or this is by far the worst screen protector that i've ever bought,1
2561,guess it's time for a new pair of headsets w mic i really do not recommend them to anyone,1
2562,this cover is made of a very cheap plastic,1
2563,it doesn't even fit through the hole in the screen protector,1
2564,the pebble blue back cover that came with the phone and another piece covers the back of the phone is hidden behind the mirror,1
2565,this had a lot of lint on it as soon as you plug it in the red light comes on,1
2566,not a huge deal unless you are in an interference-free zone,1
2567,i like bling and i change my phone cases like every other day and this broke the first or second time you use it,1
2568,the other two were dead i asked to return for a replacement and see that it is out of the line of sight for distractions,1
2569,i went to freedompop to activate my device and i couldn't bear to have it there for more than a few minutes,1
2570,my original samsung battery with components claimed to be made in japan but now looks like china,1
2571,i do not like this case at all to protect my phone so i could clean it and the upper portion will not come off,1
2572,if i return my current phone back to samsung it is going to take responsibility for a tiny little device,1
2573,however i did look at them and try them on to see if i can get a refund or replacement,1
2574,not reliable i would not buy anything from this owner,1
2575,looses ability to connect up to 8 devices at once and can switch to the called phone,1
2576,the signal is weaker by at least 1-2 bars inconsistently before putting on the sticker,1
2577,it won't stay on so i can't rate this highly enough,1
2578,so i checked amazon and found this one for under 50 and i didn't not abuse it in anyway,1
2579,i slide the phone into a charging cord,1
2580,i was getting really frustrated after a few days of daily use before breaking,1
2581,i bought the to keep in my pocketbook for when i'm out and need to charge two phones or battery chargers,1
2582,once initiated you can go into the ipod app and disable it but as soon as you can thanks so please send it to me,1
2583,the pro fits awkwardly in it tight fit and the base does not sit flat and rolls around on the desk,1
2584,i am very disappointed because i threw away the box so we can't return it since i haven't received it,1
2585,i received this iphone case today and it has a place to attach it to a monopod then forget it,1
2586,but when it started having poor reception i started getting concerned that i had a dud because this was a piece of junk,1
2587,product received was not the one that they sent me don't know how i am the first to give a negative review of this,1
2588,i don't usually use a car charger while this case is definitely slim,1
2589,it beeps when the battery is charged until you unplug it and don't use mobile network much why pay more,1
2590,the only problem i had was the car charger and the quick start manual,1
2591,i was very excited to see i finally had the chance to use it,1
2592,did not stay on thescreen like others i have used with two usb outs so it doesn't protect at all,1
2593,it was cheap enough that i did not even receive the correct case,1
2594,you can never get them to insert close quite properly and one of my cellphones will not charge properly using this adapter,1
2595,as others have noted if you want to roll the dice and take a chance with your 600 iphonestay away,1
2596,i really don't want it in my pocket unless i disable the emergency call button,1
2597,it's a little different as long as it's the real thing,1
2598,no amount of pressing would get the protector to go on without bubbles,1
2599,update case has now broken in several places to the point it won't snap into place on one side,1
2600,but these aren't even worth the money i paidwould be happy with a refund,1
2601,i tried every possible way to make it work for a little while and then stop so,1
2602,save you money this is so overpriced it isn't worth the risk and there are other cases that fit,1
2603,the only good thing about it was that it was fully charged and then it died,1
2604,at first i thought it was completely bricked,1
2605,this latest purchase however only lasted about 3 weeks and i haven't had this charger long and i have a samsung galaxy note 10,1
2606,these don't stick to the device for more than a few dozen times before something fragile in there gives up,1
2607,this is the third or fourth one i have purchased for nokia by nokia has been perfect to this point,1
2608,we contacted straight talk and made it clear that i would be safe going with another speck product,1
2609,he said it was too big and the cutouts or lack there of is really bad,1
2610,first of all i took everything out the package and there is this strange tactile feeling to this protector,1
2611,the price was so cheap it's not worth buying even at this great price,1
2612,i've contacted the company and they work with me to make it through an entire day,1
2613,i ordered this item thinking it would work well since of all the good reviews it turned out to not work for my iphone,1
2614,one can only hope that the case i received and the deceptive nature of the listing i will not buy from hong kong again,1
2615,everyone complained they couldn't hear me unless i yell into the mic,1
2616,i had the skyrocket with 3 of these and i thought they were would love a refund,1
2617,i liked the picture more then when it finally arrived the charger did not charge my phone,1
2618,i plugged it up for as long as you still have the chance when you read this,1
2619,atleast not from this company and do not buy this wire,1
2620,i bought this specifically because it was htc and i have an article in editing for a popular online review regarding this,1
2621,however i received a fold over case for the galaxy s3 and needed a backup charger,1
2622,there is no back to it although it shows in the pictures that it had a front cover as well,1
2623,i went to the website youtube and followed the instructions being careful and the protector would not stick to it,1
2624,the ultimate slap in the face was when one of the extendable ratcheting arms broke and wouldn't charge,1
2625,the rubber stoppers that go over the top of the case,1
2626,it wasn't expensive so i guess i'm not having that much luck with bluetooth earpieces,1
2627,i tried using this product with a number of different ways and support mono stereo mic etc,1
2628,isn't this one of the only lightning cables i've been able to use the product but the chip got larger and sharp,1
2629,the cheap thin leather has peeled all the way off and left either the tab on it or a sticky mess,1
2630,no matter how cheap this is not worth even 10 % of the work in holding the phone,1
2631,mine may have been a lemon but the rubber part is coming apart at the seams after less than 2 days of use,1
2632,5 might be a good case if you don't,1
2633,phone feels cheap and earpiece will not work with my cell phone ipad 2 kindle and ipod shuffle,1
2634,but if i can't find a way to contact the company about a return or refund and never even heard back,1
2635,my biggest complaint is that while i was able to get my phone to read the blue tooth anymore,1
2636,the sim card adapter does not work with the new 4 g phones,1
2637,delete them immediately when you get this case it will break,1
2638,2 of them didn't work at all with this case,1
2639,attempted to disconnect my charging iphone from this cable and it still managed to break within a week of receiving it,1
2640,the era won't stay in the phone very well and also doesnt work to charge what i bought it for the sleep function,1
2641,if i rebooted the phone when it is placed on it,1
2642,so i just went to the local walmart to purchase a new and different usb charger from elsewhere,1
2643,i'm sticking with zagg invisible shield protectors from now on and i would have to dail the number on my cell phone,1
2644,one cable that i just disconnected and which prompted me to go back and will probably not order it again,1
2645,i hoped for the best and ended up with a small bubble under the protector,1
2646,i purchased a three pack all three were cut poorly and did not fit my phone for the first time ever,1
2647,the cover picks up when you put a case on my phone as a medium i could not get these ones to install without bubbles,1
2648,pretty much it sucks if you own a smart phone this will not help you after 30 days,1
2649,or plug it into a powered usb port and the blue light turned on for about a second then turned back off,1
2650,the battery lasted about 3 days and now it is cluttering up my closet waiting to be discarded,1
2651,i almost have to bang it on my phone and tried to find tips on there and in other reviews,1
2652,this device does not charge long and almost has a mind of its own and no read zero memory retention,1
2653,not sure which models listed work and which don't but the fact that i didn't purchase mine from amazon,1
2654,like last revies if you don't like this at all,1
2655,it has been two months and two of them were really nice and i've found that quite annoying,1
2656,however the holes on most of the fm offerings here,1
2657,the connection did not hold using this and i had to return it for a replacement,1
2658,i love the look of it when it arrived and read the instructions,1
2659,i reglued it and so far it seems to live up to its name,1
2660,i charged this little thing and when i used the pen the protector got scratched,1
2661,it lasted less than a week of use,1
2662,there are other similar products on the market for a case that provides little protection,1
2663,broke in less than a month since i've had it i thought this phone would take me through 2 years,1
2664,i was disappointed to find that it was actually new,1
2665,the case does not fit my iphone 3 phone,1
2666,it has raised ridges along the side and these help keep the phone from resting directly on it's face,1
2667,she never called and the service still does not work and the case is so much so it would not snap together,1
2668,the second time i described the back of the arm rest to minimize the light's distraction,1
2669,hope you get no calls or don't need to use it as it didn't work for my particular remote,1
2670,in seriously a couple of days it took 12 hrs to charge the battery wore down to 50 %,1
2671,this product did not meet my needs then,1
2672,and i had waited too long to return it so i'm just going to throw it out the case and left my phone unprotected,1
2673,i contacted motorola and i'm waiting to return it,1
2674,i was ok with that it was in the three pieces like i was expecting,1
2675,tried two of these from this vendor,1
2676,warning don't put a penny in your ear then these two are for you,1
2677,when i took the case out of the phone after they fixed it they wouldn't,1
2678,however the more i handled the cable the more i started to notice that the color was off,1
2679,one use for a day before it was said i would get it and i just got it in the mail without breaking,1
2680,then i have no use for the battery at all so it's pretty much useless with glue left on the film surface,1
2681,i love the fact that this case is hard to get on and off,1
2682,hope it was a little slow out of the box you must download one,1
2683,i wanted to be able to continue with this transaction,1
2684,dear otterbox i am writing to let you know when it's drawing power,1
2685,i bought one before and it did not stick 100 % to the screen,1
2686,i only had 1 nokia wireless charging plate and didn't want to because it only recognizes solid touches,1
2687,i could barely get the phone in and of itself was 3 weeks from the corners,1
2688,i have two of these devices but am unable to return it or anything but it only charges your phone for ten minutes,1
2689,well then yeah go ahead and buy the real deal,1
2690,the quality and texture of the case is thin and flexible and does not protect your cell phone,1
2691,unfortunately i'm now outside the timeframe for returns and i'm stuck with a broken headset that i exchanged 4 times in 6 months,1
2692,sounds like the person on the other side of the world,1
2693,also the phones buttons are covered by the rubber case the rubber button overlay works flawlessly,1
2694,if you use your phone to call people you don't want this if you drive a manual transmission,1
2695,it looks very pretty online and when i got the item i am happy with my car charger the price was right,1
2696,they basically said they made two types and they would send me a new one for me 18,1
2697,the bluetooth headset itself is great and fits very well when you first receive it,1
2698,my mophie was only 1700mah and this one is very thin which the make the case not protective,1
2699,lastly you get a belt clip holster that is one of the stupidest things i've ever seen,1
2700,when i put my usb charger to my computer atwork as i worked,1
2701,i used it for an hour and i was able to fix with some krazy glue,1
2702,i thought it was because i could no longer use just one hand to reach my extremes,1
2703,second you can not get the bubbles out without scratching the actual screen protector,1
2704,the second time i tried to plug in several different cords and none of them behave like that,1
2705,i ordered this item expecting a good replacement for the htc evo i've been using it for about two months,1
2706,amazon sent me a replacement that was a different connector so i didn't give it a negative review,1
2707,i've replaced this with the following which also has a built in usb port for charging,1
2708,magnetic latch closes on the back which drives me crazy,1
2709,they're not sticky enough to actually stay on the phone because it did not work,1
2710,plugged it into charger and then i noticed that the watch was missing,1
2711,the cardboard squeegee that this comes with has a lot of deficiencies or if these are just lousy headphones,1
2712,you can hear everything in the background down to if you have your phone in your pocket is a long lost dream,1
2713,i'm going to see if i could trade it,1
2714,this cover didn't fit and it leaves a 2 mm gap around the whole phone,1
2715,worked alright for a while but once i received it it didn't even work when i took it out of the way,1
2716,does not fit that phone so please don't buy if that's not even the same material,1
2717,discovered the hard way that you can not get the smell off of the case,1
2718,i did that but they said they couldn't help me but that the next one could,1
2719,i just used it to charge an iphone and because it was purchased through amazon lifeproof will not honor the lifetime warranty,1
2720,i bought the dash mount with the weighted pads on the bottom that will prevent it from working,1
2721,but sometimes i'd have it charging on this for 30 minutes and using the phone's battery again,1
2722,i emailed the seller and they gently sent me another one and it wouldnt work,1
2723,we ordered a micro sim card which it does not e,1
2724,this product sounds great and i am sure it was just this phone,1
2725,it's sad because it was so cheap i am not looking for a refund and have ordered the genuine item from samsung instead,1
2726,anytime you take it off to send the phone back to rest on the object,1
2727,i am hopeful for the future of the pressy app,1
2728,case seemed very cheap all though it was cheap so i am not happy as you can imagine,1
2729,i received these way before it said i would but the first day i got it totally a loss of 4,1
2730,if you are looking for a cheap case make one yourself,1
2731,spend your money on something else even if it is textured that is not smooth like glass,1
2732,you think people look strange talking into a bluetooth headset what do you think they don't sell it at all,1
2733,cracked and broken after less than a week due to amazon's problem,1
2734,this product arrived in a timely matter but it did not charge my phone at all,1
2735,holy moly what a piece of garbage that doesn't work,1
2736,the display of the phones say that the phone was being charging but the battery continued to deplete,1
2737,i literally had to just throw them away,1
2738,this is a great case and it's totally not worth it,1
2739,the pros are that it is super cheap especially on the phone side around the edges,1
2740,i think we don't have a bluetooth you are out of power,1
2741,also the iphone 5 is not compatible with apple products and doesn't work,1
2742,my only complaint thus far is that the case is so fit that somehow pressures the note a little too much for me to enjoy,1
2743,please rate if helpful when i ordered this case april 3 2013 and it was shipped april 7th,1
2744,not only does it look used it is all scratched up just from laying it down on a table counter top,1
2745,just enough too small so phone did not fit snuggly in the case,1
2746,i do not know how to return it,1
2747,i only gave this product 1 star because it did not react to almost every touch of the screen i hate,1
2748,the worst part is i bought 2 of them from different providers and none of work,1
2749,the usb cords are not compatible with iphone 4s as it claims,1
2750,i was almost able to get it to work with the phone,1
2751,i was suppose to set my phone into it again at 7 % while power on,1
2752,i don't understand why this one does not do anything when connected to a dock but charge the device,1
2753,fortunately amazon has a fantastic way of handling returns and i was able to go a full day then some off of a single charge,1
2754,it has finger prints or water marks on the back where your fingers hold it,1
2755,for 15 i would say that i am not the best at applying these so maybe other people have better luck,1
2756,the camera hole is teeny at the top and bottom of the phone are not protected,1
2757,our cell phones are motorola but none of the tips are for mini-usb micro usb and what looks like an iphone adapter,1
2758,does not fit screen and it will not fit it makes a huge difference,1
2759,it'll end up in the same place don't buy this it's trash,1
2760,the battery doesn't last much longer than my old pathetic original battery,1
2761,try to take it out of your pocket,1
2762,it looks professional and indeed protects the front of the bear and the brown isn't very dark,1
2763,one word to explain this item is cheap and breaks very easily,1
2764,i can't see the screen but what i can say is press hard,1
2765,it looked better on the screen than it did when i got it i did not like this brand of screen protector,1
2766,she had to deal with it so i threw them both in the garbage and immediately ordered a different case,1
2767,first of all im a person who loves her phone and i said didn't the color make it easier to fine,1
2768,but looks as is made clear in my experience with them was truly awful,1
2769,i have one on net10 my nephew and his wife have 2 of these one for each vehicle after reading lots of good reviews,1
2770,wouldnt recommended it to someone who buys a samsung galazys 3 phone and really did not protect my cell phone galaxy s4 twice,1
2771,all too often i don't like it will protect my iphone,1
2772,or having to turn off wifi so that you can not use any of the phone's true colors,1
2773,optics have lint inside that can not be a finger print magnet and it collects more dust then anything else,1
2774,this cover is exactly the size of the battery itself let alone in the title of this auction,1
2775,it's hard to describe how yucky they feel but i used it once and it didn't hide my business,1
2776,case is alright but the plastic is so cheap that it wont turn on,1
2777,my complaint is that my phone loses service every time i put the headset in your ear,1
2778,but i still have not received my order,1
2779,great idea and concept for the iphone but the usb plug came off after tried to unplug it,1
2780,bought it for my grandmother and then i found out that it is darn near impossible to get of your phone,1
2781,not satisfied the product says that they are three products and came only one,1
2782,i ordered this for my ihome radio and read some reviews complains about the same problem,1
2783,cheap looking plastic for starters i'm not sure what vents this fits but it will not typically be a new one,1
2784,i need to find a better product and pay a little more and get an oem battery,1
2785,doesn't work on all parts of the screen protector is still on my phone,1
2786,it didn't fit i inserted my regular charger cable to make sure that people received a good product,1
2787,as an example of their slimy tactics there is a screen with a bunch of scratches on it,1
2788,i unplugged it after i had a full backup battery but a dead phone,1
2789,doesn't do what it's supposed to but it's worth the extra amount,1
2790,we had so much love that i don't know maybe someone switched batteries then returned the product,1
2791,this product was terrible it was cut up smelled bad did not fit phone could not get phone into case much less close it,1
2792,if only a little more than a month or two,1
2793,i have not yet got this product and it didn't,1
2794,maybe whomever wrote them will read this and realize this item is a complete piece of junk,1
2795,received in the mail quickly but the battery only worked for one day only and somehow got frozen up the emergency call mode,1
2796,the product has failed and jabra has not responded to that or any further communications,1
2797,i suppose many who left the reviews didn't mind that it was bulk packaging because that was part of the message,1
2798,then i bought the nuud because i thought it would be good for at least 2-3 days to get a response,1
2799,reminds me of the plastic that comes on the phone when you are using the case but bad once you remove it,1
2800,my biggest problem is that it is much smaller in size than i expected smaller than the battery,1
2801,i thought it would be worth your time and hassle,1
2802,i am not impressed with this item it does not stick at all,1
2803,looked almost good enough to be real but i bought it anyway,1
2804,my phone died wont even turn on the phone it said movistar and refused to work with my phone electronic equipment that doesn't,1
2805,it covers my entire phone which is what i should have thought was oh my god this phone is horrible,1
2806,installed it and one part of the sp doesn't stick on the edges and came off within a couple of months,1
2807,what a waste of money to buy a phone that actually works,1
2808,i like thewilson electronics mobilepro cell phone signal booster but this one does just fine,1
2809,how ever i did contact the seller and hope they send me one with a head,1
2810,the case protected all 4 corners of my phone because of a drop,1
2811,though the cable can be stretched to make it longer it is too hard to shape do not expect a soft and easy flexible haste,1
2812,it purports to be very thin but i couldn't use it for more than 10 minutes,1
2813,i will return this as soon as i snapped in on the phone,1
2814,the opening for the charger was not aligned with the rest of the reviews say you get what you paid for,1
2815,this isn't a fault of this mount but there's not a hint of the original audio source emerging from the static,1
2816,thank god i didn't pay a lot of money for a phone case for my boyfriend who is a truck driver,1
2817,usually i buy something i try it if i don't want something that is going to do what you want to do,1
2818,but if you expect to use this as a candy dish at work not a good fit,1
2819,i have the 4s and i had to pay to return this crap after paying 4,1
2820,mine worked for a day or so of use leaving sharp edges,1
2821,the screen has dead spots and does not have the life of the standard 2800mah battery,1
2822,now i have a phone with a screen that is both bright and not defective,1
2823,it broke after one drop on the ground so it didn't last at all and i couldn't even donate it,1
2824,i did not know how much i was missing until i got one with a clip and it works much better,1
2825,not only does this screen protector not fit too small waste of my money,1
2826,after having installed in 1 car for a week i am downgrading my rating to 1 star i hate it on the official amazon scale,1
2827,i did not treat it badly or anything i was very gentle with the cable not sure whats up with that,1
2828,this thing didn't work from the start,1
2829,once i took my cell phone out of the case and after a few days it fell apart save your money,1
2830,it doesn't come as listed where you can actually plug it into your phone doesn't fit the 30-pin port,1
2831,my phone has quickly gone back to not holding much of a charge weren't much of a help,1
2832,otherwise if you're prone to dropping your phone then this is a fair listing,1
2833,however once i put it on my phone which almost completely discharged the battery,1
2834,i got mega excited when this came in and tried to put my credit cards into the slots,1
2835,bought this to serve as a backup to my htc mytouch 4 g,1
2836,thinking about returning this but it was cheap and you got what you pay for,1
2837,we placed the order twice and the first time she tried to use it,1
2838,get this item if you like to use your phone's insurance to get a replacement,1
2839,the product is too small for my iphone 4s after reading the glowing reviews,1
2840,i have frequently called someone just by trying to put a case on my phone,1
2841,the worse problem is that the volume and power buttons,1
2842,i did contact the seller and hope they send me the black one or the picture is terribly wrong,1
2843,when i received my shipment i was so excited about the colored cord,1
2844,yes this product is not worth a penny,1
2845,nothing but the device in a plastic bag in my pocket and removing it,1
2846,i did contact the seller and they said they where going to send me a replacement i will be sure to change my opinion,1
2847,i purchased two sets of lg 730 bluetooth headsets and i am not hard on this kind of product who you buy from,1
2848,i purchased one of these for my motorola droid 2 global,1
2849,clearly this device is not supported it took about a month to get to me,1
2850,i tried restarting everything and still had the same exact % from before i put it on my camera,1
2851,you can push the on off button pressed the entire time,1
2852,thank youme so i removed the ottorbox from the phone and use the port directly,1
2853,i've just recieved this protector cover and i found it while cleaning up and finally decided to review it,1
2854,it does not add much bulk at all to the iphone and very difficult to remove once its on,1
2855,-back button is only a charge no charge button and does not have the logo in the picture,1
2856,i've been putting screen protectors on but this was the worst phone case i've ever had,1
2857,sure it feels and looks nice but it doesn't pass the signal through for hdmi output either,1
2858,was really excited about this case thinking maybe i could personalize it so i wouldn't have returned the item but it never arrived,1
2859,when i put my iphone in my pocket and this last time they fell elsewhere and are lost,1
2860,with cover on it you can not put your phone on sleep,1
2861,this thing is made out of some very cheap materiel just spend a little more and get something better,1
2862,even now a few weeks after getting the item the on off button and volume rocker become more accessible,1
2863,however once i put it on my phone the battery often goes dead,1
2864,it fits my i phone 5 and i got one on properly but when i tried to take it off the market,1
2865,it worked for a couple months then just up and stopped charging my phone after two months of use it became pretty much useless,1
2866,i ended up having to make a hole for the back camera flash have not noticed an issue taking pictures,1
2867,this is not the case you receive was made,1
2868,i bought something else that was shipped together and thought it was great but that only lasted for about 4 months before it also died,1
2869,i put the screen protector on the screen,1
2870,i would have returned them but by the time i peeled it off and the tackiness to it started to peel off the protectors,1
2871,it is tiny and flush with the phone and its data capability,1
2872,i can not count how often my phone has gone dead and i had no other charger and was far from a wall outlet,1
2873,i then noticed the pins had stayed inside my device which i had to pay 15 to get overnight shipping for the replacement,1
2874,they offer no protection and they went right to the red it hadn't charged the nexus 5 at all,1
2875,this cord is always tripping me up when i am at work i turn the volume up it resets all the sounds back on,1
2876,perhaps i will just put it on 4 days ago,1
2877,after about 20 minutes using the original charger that came with the phone it will be clearly bigger than this case,1
2878,stopped working a week after i ordered it but it sure seems suspicious,1
2879,of course i lost it and had to pay for more shipping,1
2880,i bought this adapter to use with a car charger in the phone too,1
2881,i unplugged it and clicked it to find that the battery inside is the wrong one in a sealed package,1
2882,audio isn't bad though but not good enough and sturdy enough for every day,1
2883,wrong size wrong openings for any of the ports speakers or camerai was expecting bouncy ball material,1
2884,as said in the title this does not charge the oh so not extended life batteries,1
2885,the lack of quality control on the cover earns them a 1 star review is you can see the screen,1
2886,i liked the look of it when it arrived and the charger flap broke within 2weeks,1
2887,ever so slightly thicker than the frame that comes with the note 3,1
2888,that's when the bowing shows up at least it did not fry the phone but it beats the purpose of having a dual charger,1
2889,getting started was a bit of a rush given i was busy and every time i tried it for about 20 seconds,1
2890,i do not recommend anyone to purchase this product because i just wanted to replace the broken back cover,1
2891,very very cheap i bought this for my husband and i haven heard the last of it from him,1
2892,this product was terrible it was cut up smelled bad did not fit phone could not get phone into case much less close it,1
2893,the quality for reuse is not there there is a better way but it didn't,1
2894,then the charger broke and wouldn't retract or extend anymore,1
2895,don't waste your money you can find a decent tpu case that fits well go for it,1
2896,but this is a scam it can't be taken out for a spin,1
2897,i was fooled buy a new phone i decided to get these,1
2898,this was a total waste of my hard earned money,1
2899,although it fits well on my htc evo 4 g lte,1
2900,i understand that they are closed on weekends but still if there is a zero star option i will rate this product zero,1
2901,i'd been looking for a case to stay on the phone and that also makes for a cheap tacky look and feel,1
2902,it looks just like the real thing but when you plug it in it stop working anymore tried on my ipad and iphone,1
2903,clearly from the photo something was designed properly but that's not a big deal but just a slight annoyance,1
2904,i threw it in the trash at christmas,1
2905,the description was incorrect and the product did not did into my pocket well,1
2906,i attempted to install it on my nexus 5 quick,1
2907,this is impossible with the mountek mount you have to use the phone to charge but rather the mini-usb connection on the case,1
2908,the quality of the cable is huge so it does not have a back cover just around the edges,1
2909,bought this thinking it would be really clear but it had an internal damage,1
2910,i wound up getting a replacement phone altogether,1
2911,also the clips that hold the case together broke the first time i have tried a product from spigen though,1
2912,all in all i saved money buying this but i am sure others are having this same issue,1
2913,it never felt like the rubber part of the case broke the plastic cracked off and shattered my phone,1
2914,we ordered two and both were defective out of the box and had to return these,1
2915,then when i opened it up it was already scratched not too much so i decided to give this a try at the gym,1
2916,perhaps these fit however do you want to protect and look good on your phone,1
2917,i also like that it had a very slippery grip,1
2918,the phone cover is not tight on the phone and immediately sent it back,1
2919,it never felt like the rubber part of this case is pretty good but with one major flaw,1
2920,either way this thing is not worth the hassle,1
2921,looks like it could have been much better,1
2922,ie utf8 psc 1even at 2x the price i'll just throw it in the trash,1
2923,i guess the seller expected me to do what i had already done,1
2924,i will go back and look into purchasing one like the one that came with the product quit working,1
2925,blew up the second time i extricated the phone all the time and finally after years of abuse i killed it,1
2926,on the second day of owning the product i accidentally dropped it from knee-height and it was fine,1
2927,so far they don't get the connector twisted just right,1
2928,too bad i didn't have any connectivity problems,1
2929,then i would get picture for a few seconds before it stopped functioning altogether,1
2930,they sent me a stylus for a touchscreen phone and they sent me just the screen what a joke this phone is,1
2931,what's the point if people can't hear in on the other end of the pen and attach it there,1
2932,after reading the reviews i thought i'd try it on my car seat the next day,1
2933,overall due to potential phone damage i really can't recommend it on any level,1
2934,first of all i ordered this item as i never bought it,1
2935,sure had my hopes up i thought this would combine those two things into one,1
2936,i charge my phone for 30min-1hr with this charger and even tried with a different charger black ac adapter with samsung printed on it,1
2937,the fingerprint scanner doesn't work and doesn't appear to be many high-quality competitive offerings so i remain disappointed,1
2938,what this does is darker the screen and makes it look like it wasnt connencted right in socket area sad,1
2939,in this case it looks cheap and dirty,1
2940,i got this product to protect my device and it just made the whole tablet experience awkward,1
2941,i noticed the same review from other people who bought these and had the exact problem,1
2942,this cable may have charged my phone once and then never worked again,1
2943,i order cheap stuff from china all the time and i was pleasantly surprised,1
2944,i followed online install video to the letter tested without a phone in the case was very scratched would suggest this to any one,1
2945,if you drop your phone and it was the only thing i'd change about this case if i could,1
2946,the connection did not seem to fit properly,1
2947,i definitely don't recommend it at all,1
2948,the swivel screen is in the way when you try to read something,1
2949,save your money and a better one it will have to do,1
2950,yet had no 4 g signal and could not connect to the at t store which obviously does not sell fake products,1
2951,but a waste of money i will not purchase zerolemon ever again i will not recommend this product to anyone,1
2952,overall i really dislike these headphones because there is no pad and the control surface is shared with 4 other buttons,1
2953,i was extremely careful with this charger and it do not work for my iphone 5 i really disappointed,1
2954,didn't fit the phone well enough to be useful,1
2955,after receiving this item i fully charged it and it had the added benefit of a battery charge meter displayed on my phone,1
2956,if it wasn't so defective it would be a sound buy based on other reviews,1
2957,though it's nice and slim i would not buy this since it will not work in your vehicle,1
2958,you have to take it out of the shipping package,1
2959,as for the phone it didn't even completely submerge the case,1
2960,i know they are a little to large for the galaxys 4 g either stayed at current charge or very slowly gained a little,1
2961,this adapter will only play hd videos so it won't break but that's ridulious,1
2962,failing to register any clicks in that quadrant no matter how hard i tried i could not get a good fit on my arm,1
2963,i don't know i just know that if you use a third-party vendor that uses original lcd and touch digitizer,1
2964,and they're mailing me 2 free 6 replacements so i can't even give it one star,1
2965,today i discovered that after i received this case put it on the screen it will peel it up and off,1
2966,can't understand why is it so hard to make the earpieces softer is anyone's guess,1
2967,if your phone falls your phone will flop out of the case i received was not the screen protector you should spend money on,1
2968,however upon plugging it back into my car is when i got the item it was already damaged,1
2969,i was so excited to get it but my phone looked blurry,1
2970,i haven't had it for long but so far it doesn't seem to work if my phone battery drops too low,1
2971,as a side note i talked one of my friends loved the green color so much she just chopped them off,1
2972,for example if my phone is on the bottom of it,1
2973,i will not buy again this case was so cute to me,1
2974,the headphones worked but when i put it on a charger,1
2975,luckily i was able to try the s5 for a few days but i just didn't like it,1
2976,i bought this charger-case and doesn't work for my galaxy s3 which was no longer charging at all,1
2977,after i couldn't keep it securely in my ear and the cover fell off during normal use,1
2978,very upset that this will not fit the orifice is just too small and the only way to stop it,1
2979,didnt get it yet and i would like to put 0 stars,1
2980,used it to charge my samsung galaxy s3,1
2981,i couldn't read it it was too bulky i don't recommend this product or seller to others,1
2982,seeing the number of reviews i went ahead and bought one of these ordering it ahead of time so my expectations were set accordingly,1
2983,it just locks up for no apparent reason rendering the headset completely useless,1
2984,i have been a big supporter of bb over the years but this is the first time i used it was mid-january,1
2985,the home button has to be pressed really hard it's just more trouble than i want to go through the trouble of returning it,1
2986,i bought this case for my wife's iphone 4s and one for mine,1
2987,even though it has this issue the sound quality and will continue to look for a mirror screen protector for ipod touch is great,1
2988,bad purchase decision on my part great concept just doesn't work very well with my ipad mini retina,1
2989,the lg optimus slider specs aren't anywhere near as good as the coating on the case is a huge dust and lint collector,1
2990,as for the delivery it took 12 days to get it charged and it hasn't glowed once,1
2991,this product doesn't work for my at t samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket,1
2992,this is not acceptable for this product and thank god didn't ask me to ship it back,1
2993,i put my phone on the other side of the call,1
2994,the phone was garbage poor sound and everything i had to return the charger for a refund,1
2995,this device is not ready to support the weight of the phone so i can't even use it,1
2996,oh now i remember if they are the ones that are thicker and heavier feeling and more sturdy,1
2997,if you like the thin snap on cases i would go with a ballistic hardcore series case,1
2998,so far the call quality is in line with other bluetooth headsets that have lasted 1-2 hours longer,1
2999,the sound and device was okay until it stopped working within 2 weeks of light use,1
3000,i tried to move the jabra to different locations closer to my car stereo outlet or even my computer without all that extra cable,1
3001,if i connect it and leave the cord fully retracted it does not charge my ipad not with any charger,1
3002,at this point i contacted the manufacturer to get one,1
3003,i also contacted the seller about this and the sent me a replacement item overnight,1
3004,it will not close around the phone once you put the phone in the case and it actually drains the phones battery,1
3005,i just received this item and i have never had this problem,1
3006,the font is different and the vent holes do not match with real serial numbers manufactured by them,1
3007,i bought outter box which is great and is a 5 star but the case is useless,1
3008,i think soft plastic is not good enough to justify spending money on a product that didn't even last four days of light use,1
3009,it sure looked and felt like it was stabbing me behind my ear,1
3010,i was really excited when i received this cell phone cover,1
3011,needless to say i returned these the day after i put it on fire,1
3012,im just glad that it was so difficult to find a decent pair of headphones at a somewhat mid-level price,1
3013,you know the one i bought from amazon and shipped by amazon,1
3014,the case came through the mail and when i put it back on it didn't fit,1
3015,neither battery charges completely the charger doesn't work and won't provide any feedback,1
3016,the face is still unprotected and it tends to fall down and not fit comfortably,1
3017,probably should write good reviews but meh so i received the package and opened it up it wasn't usable,1
3018,i contacted the seller who has yet to respond to consumers nor has a fix been put out,1
3019,i bough this when i got it it wasnt good,1
3020,i ordered these chargers for my families samsung galxy 3s and they worked fine for about 3 days then went on me,1
3021,this means that i can not access the power button or volume but instead push the case right off the side of joby gorillamobile,1
3022,worked fine for about 3 months before breaking,1
3023,so far 4 have had to be returned and refunded which they did,1
3024,that is it charges by plugging the lightning connector into the port to charge the phone,1
3025,each end has a manual lever to lock in place and do not sit or seal firmly in the ear,1
3026,then you can use the phone if you have any kind of back protector on your phone,1
3027,i just don't recommend it to anyone unfortunately,1
3028,i hate the case it feels very cheap and flimsy case,1
3029,was absolutely useless as i had fight to get it out of even doing a hard reset didn't work,1
3030,if i put it on my phone either,1
3031,it isn't worth the risk and there are other cases that fit,1
3032,not sure why i had to throw it away,1
3033,these are obviously not compatible with the ipad or the iphone,1
3034,not zero stars it kind of works for voice calls and you don't have an exotic or low-quality car securely,1
3035,often they are cheap knock offs and do not perform as indicated,1
3036,i should have read other reviews before buying this product which really makes the whole experience flawed,1
3037,save your money and buy a good one don't try to stuff a phone with apps and after that you're stuck,1
3038,you could break them if you try to take it out and put the original oem battery,1
3039,but i really wanted this to work but it was a mistake,1
3040,these are the facts if you do not heed this plea to protect yourself,1
3041,this did not fit the phone well i'm here to tell you it does not affect screen sensitivity,1
3042,but since it hasn't worked since,1
3043,i wanted original headset and i bought this product based on semi-good reviews,1
3044,i bought this item in full faith that it was going to be a great product boy was i wrong,1
3045,only got to use it and i am gentle with these things,1
3046,the problem is that you can manage to get both of those clips undone at the same time and on time,1
3047,this thing just doesn't work for 4th generation ipod shuffle,1
3048,and now i have to wait for that port to be,1
3049,i then went to costco and bought a new one i didn't like it either,1
3050,when i got the case and its short extension limit,1
3051,the newest and definetly last pair worked excellently for about 3 months and then it simply died,1
3052,i keep giving amazon a chance with these amazon marketplace sellers,1
3053,wasnt worth the money and more,1
3054,amazon accepted my return without hassle 5 stars for amazon for selling the real deal,1
3055,i was hoping that i could use this to play music from iphone and others it does not,1
3056,i contacted the seller since there seems to be a bad battery or something,1
3057,i repair computers and i will say that the seller almighty wholesale has been very accommodating since my post,1
3058,fortunately i had a screen protector that when on doesn't feel like it will last,1
3059,try as i might even using distilled water on the surface of my phone as the supplier sent a damaged case to me,1
3060,this is battery pack and there is nothing they will do for me,1
3061,thought what looked like a name brand might be better but it's not awful considering the previously mentioned benefit hiding just below it,1
3062,when i purchased this item for my droid incredible,1
3063,i now have an elago case that i purchased through amazon from a sonic your usa store,1
3064,even the markings and details were wrong with side by side comparison that there was nothing they would do to remedy this nice no,1
3065,if i tried to return it would cost more to send these back,1
3066,i actually saw this on sale on facebook and wanted to pick up the device unlock it and then control the app,1
3067,the jabra wave did absolutely nothing to give me better service,1
3068,6v which may harm the device you are charging on a flat surface,1
3069,i was mislead by the picture and i received it within a few days and all got thrown in the garbage,1
3070,product was no as expected basically trash but i guess i wont have it any time soon,1
3071,if idling no activity no calls a full charge lasts about 4-5 hours with a light use,1
3072,i would recommend buying this battery directly from amazon not this third party and it was perfectly find,1
3073,i literally leaved on my phone for 10 minutes and it is now september and guess what no screen protector,1
3074,the phone fits in the case but the case just sucks,1
3075,first the corners started to peel then the whole thing fell off and on to the floor,1
3076,outside of protection which in this case is a poor excuse for a case i've ever seen,1
3077,we tried all kinds of placements stretching as far as the ui for a smart phone is concerned look elsewhere,1
3078,i got a kink on one side from the hard case,1
3079,would not recommend purchasing this product at otterbox if you want the ue for home use perfect,1
3080,i got an email asking to rate these and i didn't bother to replace it because it ruins the whole 3d effect,1
3081,fell apart before i even got my phone so i'd call that pretty much a complete fail,1
3082,seller shipped decently fast nothing to call home to mom about but the product isn't well made and customer service isn't that great,1
3083,i like to change from time to time even after adjusting the sizes,1
3084,bought this to charge my samsung galaxy s4 one side was always sticking out of the case by accident,1
3085,i'm sure it's some kinda coating to keep the iphone's screen was all scratched up the day i got it,1
3086,i do not recommend this case it looks very cheap and cheasy and doesnt protect the whole screen,1
3087,as i said completely worthless save your money and invest in a better charger and save yourself some frustration,1
3088,some of the other reviews i think its a bit pricey,1
3089,it's taking me hours to resolve something that could have been worth it had the product been as presented in the amazon listing,1
3090,the device charged just fine but when i tried to snap it on and it wouldn't charger to transfer data etc,1
3091,they were to big for our 4s i phones they said they would send another one to replace it,1
3092,ordered this to give as a gift but now that i've gone back and started looking for another case,1
3093,update 7 1 powergen does not respond to any input from me,1
3094,its definitely a nice case but until then it's a real waste of money,1
3095,i realize none of this is a technical description but in my opinion not worth the extra size,1
3096,they are great when they work however they are poorly made and there's no feedback when pushing them,1
3097,as for the charging base it looks nice but then i noticed my phones back cover has dings all over it,1
3098,but here is the worst part unfortunately i can't change my original review,1
3099,also i have a honda crv and the dash is slightly curved so it will not add significant bulk to the phone,1
3100,it was a cheap price as well so it was not fun when we had no phone services at all,1
3101,flimsy loose cheap ugly and not worth a fraction of what they are charging for them,1
3102,many times i had it cranked to the max and barley heard a sound,1
3103,with the prism this is not a true otg cable,1
3104,the reviews looked ok so i took a shot at a cheap cable that i would not trust it to protect my phone from impact,1
3105,we finally went with this hybrid armor case for samsung galaxys iii retail packaging black and a samsung,1
3106,and the battery that came with my ipad has none of these issues,1
3107,it really doesn't fit my phone so if u have a note dont waste your money unless you want to keep your money,1
3108,i'm sending it back because its too much of a hasle,1
3109,the quality of this product i am going to wait for the lg-g3 instead,1
3110,i inserted my sim and when i attempted to charge it when it was turned off,1
3111,this can be really be dangerous for the phone if it fell from the windshield,1
3112,i did not like the idea that i had to wait 3 weeks for it to start unraveling,1
3113,my problem with this is there isn't a mesh screen on these,1
3114,the outside is well constructed steady but i didn't buy it for the throw away box,1
3115,but the replacement case is the same size of the others and its all the way to the edges either,1
3116,being unable to make calls because the phone was not sold by at t,1
3117,with nothing to hold it in place without the cover on and in the process more stones came off,1
3118,it was a wasted time for me to replace my phone case due to the positive reviews i'm not sure how long it lasts,1
3119,the first time the other day and no wonder why no one in my family would let me put the screen protectors on,1
3120,it took about an hour and i was able to pause back track and forward track songs adjust volume,1
3121,i had to force it to fit the casing itself presses on the buttons and battery though,1
3122,it's a pain to take off every day to clean,1
3123,i originally ordered the wrong batteries and had to return it to the vendor,1
3124,buyer beware many people i have talked to has said that the clarity of the screen was reduced by 90 %,1
3125,we did not bother to send it back the postage wasn't worth it and i gave up,1
3126,i purchased this charger as a secondary i have a verizon iphone 4 perfect condition never drop it,1
3127,i purchased this product because i needed the extra cable but this one was not one of their better products,1
3128,i really thought i wouldn't have returned the item but it never arrived,1
3129,as soon as i connected my iphone 4s to the sync cable it just didn't live up to my expectations,1
3130,my previous phone was in an otterbox defender case and i was able to wrestle it into place since it is basically formless,1
3131,some may think that you don't have as much of a protector it was the pic i took stunk,1
3132,i tried 3 different chargers and my phone is dead after a couple hours,1
3133,the end that plugs into the phone it won't register in order to charge the phone,1
3134,i read all the reviews i have read,1
3135,i tested this with my ipod touch but it doesn't provide a lot of protection itself,1
3136,after the first 3 days i bought one for myself and a friend of mine,1
3137,bought it for my husband and he didn't like it removed it with in the first couple times,1
3138,i bought this case it took over a month to arrive don't order it,1
3139,like tommy boy said if you want me to in a box and they weren't even bubble wrapped,1
3140,once phone activated and placed in the obliq case you could not re-insert it as the plastic layer under the phone,1
3141,i ended up cutting the charging port cover which is also made of cheap materials and was broken bent,1
3142,at best this is a case you store in your pocket or a case because the shield will peel right off,1
3143,these are obviously not compatible with the phone because if it drops,1
3144,ok so after about 3 weeks i still don't recommend these to anyone,1
3145,i don't know what to say this case did not fit my phone snugly,1
3146,i used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and beat the crap out of it,1
3147,at times it does not connect well i have to get my phone in it it was a waste of my money,1
3148,i could immediately after putting it on my phone disaster struck,1
3149,our cell phones are motorola but none of the buttons work again and i can hear music again,1
3150,i gave up putting it on since it did not come with a lifetime warranty,1
3151,this message came up by the second day the phone was in his pocket the day he put it on,1
3152,need to answer a phone call if you have to pay for return shipping to send it back,1
3153,2 the film is slightly too big for the phone and i got this response hello i apologize for your dissatisfaction with our product,1
3154,was really small for my iphone 5s gold yesterday and i tried to fit it in,1
3155,they would not accept a return as it was past 30 days and still they made the offer,1
3156,had the phone in there for less than 1 that were better quality than this one,1
3157,other complaints are that the home button doesn't work with any of the ipods charged and they didn't get it,1
3158,this only lasted a couple of weeks it stopped working,1
3159,it pairs it connects and it gives you a very bad limited view of how to interact back,1
3160,even if it's less than half of the fancier smartphones on the market,1
3161,this product could be considered 2 stars because i've heard you could buy a bunch to use as coasters for your drinks,1
3162,if the usb cable is difficult to plug into the wall so its not a charger,1
3163,like the phone is going to fall out and it doesn't fit,1
3164,i contacted the seller and got a replacement,1
3165,used it to charge my iphone and i am submitting a claim to amazon because it's not worth it,1
3166,i knew i was taking a few weeks ago for my note 2 not from this company,1
3167,that's not effecting the rating of the product that works is no longer available,1
3168,please i wish i can give this a negative rating if i could,1
3169,i'm not sure how i'm supposed to gift it as planned,1
3170,i got this from acc stop at the end of my happiness with this purchase,1
3171,this worked great for a few minutes after i took this out of the factory without testing it,1
3172,i would not advise anyone to puchase it,1
3173,i just got this case in the mail and when it arrived it didn't fit the phone,1
3174,i thought i did not have anything else,1
3175,what good is the style and feel of a very expensive charging set,1
3176,really left very unhappy with this it didnt work so i still had to pay to send them back there stuff,1
3177,it does not look anything like the photos at all,1
3178,like others i was excited to receive this case,1
3179,charging lasts for anywhere from a few seconds to minutes then goes out,1
3180,bought a verizon charger that works great once then this is the headset for you,1
3181,was so overwhelming i had to keep plugging unplugging the charger from my old blackberry works better,1
3182,this case looks like a copy of the invoice i never heard from lance again nor did i receive a replacement battery,1
3183,the outer diameter is right but the bubbles are forever,1
3184,i returned and purchased a different tool set,1
3185,but used it one day and it started to come apart within 2 weeks,1
3186,not worth the couple of dollars or less i paid for it i did not like this product,1
3187,there is no serial number no where on the box did it state that the phone wasn't next to my face,1
3188,nice that the iphone5 is so thin it slides in my pocket and leave the phone pretty much unprotected at all,1
3189,the lady took the bubbles out and the screen looks like crud,1
3190,the fact that the blue rubber on the top of the screen allowing dust and lint to enter,1
3191,again very disappointing when the product doesn't fit very snug fit but it's too shallow to stay on,1
3192,the covers do not fit my phone as it does it to other's as well,1
3193,unfortunately it did not last a day,1
3194,never had such a bad out of the box and one of the pins that makes contact with the electrodes and powers the phone,1
3195,the bottom portion of the case didn't line up correctly but it still stayed together,1
3196,when you take picture it takes too long to charge the note 3,1
3197,the case is not even in the sun,1
3198,i do not recommend this phone to anyone,1
3199,the smoke color fit decently but it didn't last very longbad quality and didn't last long,1
3200,the tripod was the only piece that could have been resolved in 10-30 minutes before being completely drained,1
3201,i did notice that it is not defective because it worked for 2 days,1
3202,how hard is it to make a call fast this case is not exactly as described,1
3203,i bought one these belkin cables from a local retail store as i had to remove the outher layer to get better reception,1
3204,i've tried to be fair in my review of the amaze after owning it for 11 months,1
3205,the phone still has strange issues that i can't even imagine using it to listen to music on my phone,1
3206,i figured since my old case was ruined and i really like hello kitty so i am disappointed,1
3207,so i have no choice but to vuy a different case,1
3208,ok its been only 4 days now and this charger only works with iphones not for ipads,1
3209,this item arrived cracked and would not snap on to one of the plans,1
3210,did not work not happy with this charger for a while and i can say that they are not as protective as many others,1
3211,the headset arrived with a broken speaker and i never got it i wouldnt buy from them ever again,1
3212,i paid an exorbitant amount for shipping from this seller and amazon should step in and not let this be sold,1
3213,go for theigadgitz black glossy durable crystal gel skin tpu case cover for the enlarged battery and door,1
3214,the second headset is still working but i have not received it so rating it seems silly,1
3215,i've reported this to amazon and buy something else,1
3216,i have yet to ask att if they're selling a bunch of their returned units,1
3217,this phone cover is so cheap and cracked when i put it back in,1
3218,as for a refund it's simply not worth it for this kind of instant loss buy yourself a milkshake instead,1
3219,i tried to fix it but an hour later the phone was done charging,1
3220,has a random hole in the middle of the right side of the phone,1
3221,the cable was thinner the the original and the first time i went to use the kickstand,1
3222,if that still has the problems i'm going to trysony ericsson hi-fi bluetooth stereo headset with fm radio,1
3223,i wound up getting a replacement that looks the same but the difference is the quality,1
3224,purchasing it or any other vm phone would be inadvisable unless you live in a state where it is illegal to falsely advertise,1
3225,i contacted otterbox and while they wanted to send me another one because the first one was defective,1
3226,i did get excellent service from the vendor who was very responsive and gave me the address to return the item without trying the batteries,1
3227,i have a hyundai that comes with a usb plug to sync and charge both the phone and the phone only charged to 60 %,1
3228,make sure that you try this while the phone is in the case and it looks disgusting,1
3229,my package came from ebay and i ordered from amazon and that didn't help,1
3230,the battery does not fit on the iphone 4 buying beware,1
3231,the case itself looked like it would be a sound buy based on other reviews,1
3232,this is the third or fourth one i have purchased for my iphone 5c and absolutely nothing happened,1
3233,failing to register any clicks in that quadrant no matter how hard you try you will scratch the screen,1
3234,i blame it on myself because i wanted a thin case made from tpu,1
3235,i did not like the idea that i had to wait for the manufacturer to manufacture it after placing an order,1
3236,the unit feels very flimsy and the connection was flaky,1
3237,usb cable was garbage and so was the car charger and the quick start manual,1
3238,sounds like the person on the other end say i sound like i am in a crowd or restaurants,1
3239,keep buying more hoping they work-they never last more than 24 hours before taking it off and straight to garbage can,1
3240,until then i'm not sure if people will understand my analogy or not but that's what i bought,1
3241,i hate this i though i was getting the best bang for my buck,1
3242,too bad this one was so bad i had no choice,1
3243,the screen worked good for about a week then the suction cup quit sticking,1
3244,i would not recommend this case to anyone and i will not be placing another order with this distributor,1
3245,i've used many different brands of screen protectors and it clearly states that it is an unlocked phone,1
3246,i understood that it would need to be on the case,1
3247,i use it when i go to the bathroom,1
3248,the blue just didn't fit i could not get these to go on without bubbles,1
3249,i shook as much of it out as i could and proceeded to apply the protector as seen in the video,1
3250,so to be sure i got one good one at least they're not over the actual touch screen,1
3251,i also thought that the sound quality was awful with delays,1
3252,there are a lot of problems with my wife's phone and it has more unremovable preinstalled junk than the previous 2 phones,1
3253,if you put the top of the charger nothing charged,1
3254,i love the colors on the other case,1
3255,first of all yes it's a good thing this came with three,1
3256,still lifted most of the protector leaves space on the edges because it doesn't match the description,1
3257,i tried two of these and both are the same,1
3258,yes i know how to install these screen protectors as i have to handle this case i wouldn't need the cover,1
3259,i tried the supplied cord the usb chord supplied with the phone and one that came with the phone,1
3260,i've bought other cables like this and they ranged from 40 60,1
3261,well big mistake as all the other 720's i have had in the past this one was terrible,1
3262,i purchased this after reading the positive reviews for this case i will never use it its so hideous,1
3263,he wanted to keep but i didn't want to stick and stay on i'm always disappointed with these things,1
3264,the waste of money is monumental when it comes to changing the battery out,1
3265,after reading some of the reviews but i decided to splurge on something nice for my new palm pre,1
3266,instead it seems like it would be better but nope,1
3267,got this as a gift for someone and the first day they were available one for me my mom and my dad,1
3268,it's literally a piece of paper god knows why,1
3269,for the price i didn't even return it since it's only designed for 1 amp,1
3270,on the plus side it lasts on standby for a few days then item literally fell apart after 2 weeks,1
3271,-if the backup battery gets low the whole thing is likely to drop off your waist and again hit the ground,1
3272,however it would be a fine tip like the one on my phone as it comes on and off,1
3273,this may even hold my 7 34 tablet on this mount,1
3274,the first few times i bought them they were more expensive than 18 cents,1
3275,it doesn't work well with my phone,1
3276,i like to take animal pic and you can not get an accurate charge each time,1
3277,it is so hard to get on almost bubble free,1
3278,it was a wasted time for me to return expired on june 5th 2011,1
3279,the black plastic attachment for your cellphone had a hook on it you are always taking it off to remove the battery to reset,1
3280,it could be fixed with super glue but i didn't expect it to be good,1
3281,the connection is longer than the other so they fall out of your ear at full speed then you are left scrambling saying wait what,1
3282,this charger did not work and after a week the case looke 6 months old,1
3283,btw my review is not meant to be used for critical emergencies such as heart attack stroke or fire,1
3284,new update the black plastic piece that holds the phone to the other side of my body the connection gets fickle,1
3285,i'm not sure how i'm supposed to gift it as planned,1
3286,now i have so many loose pieces i do not know why there is this strange looking cable with an audio jack hanging off it,1
3287,i bought two both were identical but neither of them well and did not stay in very well on their own,1
3288,tried to remove the phone and it was packaged very well,1
3289,my phone with a thin belkin gel casebelkin grip candy sheer case cover for iphone 4 4 g 4s not a fan,1
3290,totally makes your phone different but not worth it if your looking for something that will stay tight and comfortable on your body,1
3291,i was very disappointed that it started to break apart and the paint started to chip off after the first day,1
3292,i regret that amazon won't take it back because i'll just by something else,1
3293,even after cutting back the molding and jumping the two pins it still didn't fit i will never order anything,1
3294,item does not fit the iphone 4s like it should,1
3295,the tip has changed i have to touch each letter 2-3 times per week for the last 1,1
3296,i would never put on my phone to protect it,1
3297,original review so there i was sitting in my car so it didn't last long,1
3298,the front and back which then doesn't line up on the case that it looks horrible,1
3299,the only plus is that when it works it was great,1
3300,while i know this is just adaptation of the human mind but it doesn't work with the touchstone charger,1
3301,they may look like a bargin but to me its not worth risking your phone to get scratched up even when in the case,1
3302,it's like whatever coating was on the back to protect the camera lens,1
3303,i have tried a few of them for christmas gifts,1
3304,if you are interested in getting a quality case for your phone to be charged wirelessly by this battery,1
3305,the first two were useless and the last one barely worked but it doesn't happen to the original batter though,1
3306,the 3d forming films do not use a case this is great,1
3307,the dock is fairly small and unnoticeable while holding the phone it actually helps when using it with the nexus 4,1
3308,it's the first battery case that did not fit my phone and it lasted about a month before the screen went totally blank,1
3309,to be fair virgin mobile has the least expensive plan i've seen on other chargers with poor quality control,1
3310,i do not like the quality of this product is sub-par,1
3311,unless you don't mind the orange peal effect but the thing can't seem to find any use for it now,1
3312,withing 2 weeks of use it stopped working,1
3313,plus the case is hard and it does not work the phone does not respond when i slide my phone it nothing happens at all,1
3314,i've owned a blueant headset for quite some time and have had zero issues now that i got rid of it,1
3315,i bought 2 one of them is worth a dime,1
3316,let's see how it goes but if it continues to go unchecked,1
3317,but this unit was 150 when it first came and my phone is dead after a couple hours,1
3318,either the screen is off and doesn't turn on at all you need to re-think your pants,1
3319,i bought this product because i live in florida sand is everywhere even though the phone says it is,1
3320,i got it on my phone was 1 hour,1
3321,a couple of things were wrong though like the ear piece not a big deal i proceeded to use it as my primary case,1
3322,i wanted rubber to protect my phone when it's new,1
3323,the fit was comfortable enough but i'm looking for another one but obviously not a motorola,1
3324,darn wanted to hookup my external hard drive to watch movies from it but it was not,1
3325,i waited for almost 3 weeks and the case is difficult to snap together,1
3326,they worked a little better with my nexus 7 than the 2,1
3327,it was always a bit hard to get my phone in and i had trouble fitting it in still,1
3328,i do not have the right tips on it hurts your ear it dose not stay in place no matter what i do,1
3329,if you're like me you're going to sell a product sell a product that actually works in this category,1
3330,broke within minutes of me attaching it to my phone while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage,1
3331,i would give it a minus rating if i could but i'm forced to give it one last try,1
3332,obviously cc must believe that this phone is compatible with them but as for the other 4 times nothing has ever gone wrong,1
3333,the silicone is very cheap and i will not be buying from this company again,1
3334,the units i received were so poor that they are not the color they are in the garbage,1
3335,it's stiill a good case and well worth the 20 i paid for it so into the trash it went,1
3336,with this new charger the cord is out of the line of sight for distractions,1
3337,since htc only includes a wimpy little battery that only lasts a few hours the label looks to be fake,1
3338,doesn't works i have the same problem as others have reported in a way that it would charge,1
3339,add to that the blinking blue light in my ear,1
3340,barely but enough to when you put it on your phone it also collected so much lint or other materials,1
3341,i guess i'm retarded or something but i bet it won't,1
3342,sad he liked the look of this case online,1
3343,its not solid gold like it looks in advertisement i was expecting exactly what i saw and paid for,1
3344,worst mistake in buying a case for my phone and literally so hard to get off,1
3345,would have given 0 stars but that is not what is described here,1
3346,i have one on net10 my nephew and his wife have 2 of these one for me and we both had the same issue,1
3347,buttons are hard to press and the 34 metal 34 ok plastic edges didn't last through one drop,1
3348,she's worth it and i'm not on my phone,1
3349,i have had the note plugged into the six foot cable barely charges the note if you are using it,1
3350,this was caused by having to leave the flap open if you plan on doing lots of work on i devices,1
3351,it will not allow me to return it,1
3352,this case didn't even want a new one i didn't not abuse it in anyway,1
3353,this didn't work for anything but a brief 34 i'm on the phone,1
3354,i found this adapter doesn't work for you also be prepared to pay a stiff fine,1
3355,i purchased this based of the reviews for this phone regarding dropped service,1
3356,i just don't recommend it i'm just not pleased with it at all,1
3357,it gives a very bulky protection to the phone and the phone with a stock rom from samsung,1
3358,i have never had a problem with my phone as it should,1
3359,the case covered up the ports and was a very thin material that was very soft and pliable,1
3360,really doesn't work much more than a couple of generic ones i have,1
3361,at least i couldn't in most of amazon prime purchase but at least i don't expect a long lasting battery,1
3362,it's not even worth it for me to send it back to us with a copy of my invoice,1
3363,sure it looks good but it is no longer charging,1
3364,this one though didn't power the phone and was disappointed but was only out a couple bucks,1
3365,checking navigating voice mail the screen would go black and i would have to push it in slow and about half way in,1
3366,i run a filter in my office and one in my truck,1
3367,the picture was extremely blurry and the case itself was not broken or something and that it was an usability issue,1
3368,the phone freezes and can't be used to protect your phone,1
3369,it went strait in the garbage can once i opened the package it gave off a very strong chemical odor,1
3370,but my initial impression is that it isn't the first one with problems like that,1
3371,however i have never dropped it and there is a sharp piece of plastic on the bottom of it because it does not work,1
3372,lt sarcasm tough choice there lt sarcasm i just don't buy it it'll be money down the drain,1
3373,i would recommend getting a cheaper pack of screen protectors and i only got one and that one was horrible,1
3374,it turned out this is no better than the old holster,1
3375,will spend the extra dough to get one directly from the t-mobile apps and keep on downloading updates that you will never need,1
3376,i do not feel totally ripped off as the back piece is not leather it's faux-leather fake leather,1
3377,anyway this is too big for the iphone 4,1
3378,my son is more than willing to get my old iphone 3gs could do this as well as a pixelskin hd for an iphone 4s,1
3379,took a while to get it back on was to remove the battery then put it back on,1
3380,i just removed the neck now and use it as a swap battery on long trips,1
3381,i left it on for about 3 days,1
3382,the battery doesn't fit in very easily and even though i cleaned my screen before applying them and still no luck,1
3383,it hurt the back of the phone due to the otterbox being defective,1
3384,you have to take the back cover off,1
3385,sent it back ordered another one and it doesn't die on you after some light use,1
3386,seeing how others managed to get this to work on my wife's phone and i received the case i felt a little upset,1
3387,did not take time to try to return it but i threw away the packaging,1
3388,i stopped using mine and went back to the gym and worked up a sweat,1
3389,i was going to have a matte finish but it does not work with the asus tf300,1
3390,the mic does not work at all that's all i have to admit that it is a bad imitation of the samsung cable,1
3391,cheap plastic tabs ears broke the moment i stretched it a bit to get the cables and cords plugged in,1
3392,as you can see s-pen is crooked and wouldn't go on all the way like its weird on the iphone,1
3393,by mid day you have a dead battery and can only charge it in your pocket or purse or nice leather carrying case,1
3394,especially around the top right corner it will allow damage to the device caused by excessive water or improper installation of techskin,1
3395,the case i received is nothing like the cord that came with it and it snapped directly into the holster,1
3396,to me water and soap on a cellphone is not a very good phone and android is a work in progress,1
3397,this product actually caused damage to the corners of my brand new nexus 5 had it's screen shattered into a million pieces,1
3398,it came off when it did the phone would not charge when connected,1
3399,i bought into the otterbox hype and purchased these for my note 2 and still have some,1
3400,you then power it back up and sent it back,1
3401,back in 2011 this was a good idea but quality problems made it dead on arrival,1
3402,it costs a little more but at the end of the cable separated,1
3403,will not buy another one of these screen protectors on,1
3404,one time one using it and then removing the screen protector from the base the trouble really began,1
3405,they do work to transfer files etc to and from the pc but none of them charge my phone,1
3406,that's all well and good but if the product is sold by or fulfilled by amazon,1
3407,and you guessed it the adapter doesn't work for walking around or driving or when you just want hands free,1
3408,the battery i am replacing was made in japan and assembled in china instead of korea as my battery is labeled,1
3409,not when you buy it the one with the tab to peel it off had to strong of an adhesive,1
3410,it is very sad becuase it looks nice on the picture but when you open the cover the phone should come on automatically,1
3411,what's the point of a car charger is to charge a device actually my battery charger and or my galaxy nexus,1
3412,i've had plenty of screen protectors in the package and returned to amazon,1
3413,the material of the case is white and it turns orange after a week of having it it started to peel off,1
3414,to be fair the replacement battery that came with the phone charged about 4x as fast from the same dc outlet,1
3415,the screen protectors came in on time like it said and it was and it just felt so brittle in my hands,1
3416,reordered another because it is the absolute worst product garbage i have ever gotten i'm sure it was a four-pole connector,1
3417,not surprisingly i had trouble figuring out how to use it or if will fall out,1
3418,the screen protectors are cheap and after following their video instructions on how to use it or how to get them out,1
3419,had to throw it away because it looks very dirty,1
3420,the edge is way to high and to close to the edge of the screen protector and this screen protector is just disgusting,1
3421,hard to take off once it is snapped into place,1
3422,however upon first trying to put it on so many times,1
3423,this item is surely going back to its stable along with the usb cable held together with a twist tie,1
3424,the next day when i try to do anything and it was different,1
3425,the only theory i have come up with a wireless charger than a fully integrated user experience,1
3426,don't buy unless you are willing to pay for a special box to ship it out 39,1
3427,its working fine using the audio jack on the phone but felt a lot less sturdier than this one from belkin,1
3428,thinking it might have been a fluke but i ended up just tossing them,1
3429,this case also looks cheap like if it had been glued on and didn't belong to the cord,1
3430,it is very easy to break and would not buy again sadly because if they stayed working they would have been very well protected,1
3431,no matter how many times my son has tried it will not go dead but it will not work in your vehicle,1
3432,its a whole lot of money for my iphone 4s but scratch very easily,1
3433,the sound was crackly and was never able to try it out on my samsung note ii,1
3434,the bottom line is that i would have to take the case off and tried using another one otterbox commuter and the issue remained,1
3435,i was really excited when it came in we were both very disappointed,1
3436,right away one of the speakers so i decided to transfer that perfection to the television and therefore bought this adapter,1
3437,the battery would not charge in my phone,1
3438,for a 6 cable i'm not going to really complain about it because it's made of thin plastic,1
3439,as soon as i got home i tried it in a usb wall charger i have and it produced an electric arc,1
3440,the ball joint is to loose to hold the weight of the phone htc hero so it slowly collapses in either position,1
3441,stick with what you know the ones you had to hold it a certain way for the cord to charge,1
3442,i can have it plugged into the charger using this cord,1
3443,i was able to get it to work in my area,1
3444,ordered one of these holsters 3 months ago and it worked fine but then it just stopped pairing at all,1
3445,the stand does work good or i would give this item a no star but i can't use it,1
3446,i have ordered screen protector for samsung galaxy 3 7,1
3447,i don't have an official apple chip inside them they simply won't charge your ipad iphone ipod at the correct rate,1
3448,initially i was so excited to get this case loved the color but the case itself will protect your phone from water,1
3449,even with following the instructions not included to the t i got the phone i've had to deal with,1
3450,then they tld me to send the other one back,1
3451,product doesnt last long at all and the weight of the headset itself,1
3452,another user mentioned that many of the reviews for the other phone cases mix with the reviews for this case,1
3453,i have never used it because the material is so thick and unforgiving you can hardly push the buttons,1
3454,keep in mind i just received my ipod touch 4th or my hubby's ipod classic it simply didn't charge,1
3455,the car mount doesn't stay mounted to the windshield,1
3456,the outer soft shell is very loose and i can't hear them,1
3457,it is like the hard plastic case does not fit perfectly,1
3458,they argued with me in my review to tell me i wont be using it at all just to annoying,1
3459,i somehow got the camera into video mode and it took a while for me to take the decision and i regret it,1
3460,it makes the phone unusable i can't see how it could win any award,1
3461,so you get an accurate read even if what you are doing and has multiple steps many starting from the menu,1
3462,do yourself a favor and stay away from this case its very flimsy very cheaply constructed,1
3463,in the end they fit the iphone 4 properly so don't get it,1
3464,i found an article online that showed me how to put it back on each and every time you use it,1
3465,3rd the blinking blue night is also a huge pimple sized bump on the lower right corner of the phone,1
3466,therefore i placed it in my briefcase in a sleeve for about a month just put it back in,1
3467,the feel changes completely and i could not pick a winner,1
3468,after taking them out of the packaging but after a few weeks of use,1
3469,this did not fit my phone it was not secure n list it the same day i received it,1
3470,it sounds like it will be a hit or miss experience,1
3471,as the other reviewers have noted this is not compatible for the iphone 5 not the iphone 4,1
3472,this is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and i also believe this case should have came with at least one bruise,1
3473,like i said for 4 i wasn't expecting that when i signed up,1
3474,i've replaced this many times because the top white plastic separates from the cardboard where the suction cups are located,1
3475,the material started coming off of the phone but in few seconds the phone will tilt it over and make it fall off,1
3476,and the first order he sent me the screen protector that i can't use my protective case on it now because of that,1
3477,unfortunately a plastic tab on the inner case do not match with real serial numbers manufactured by them,1
3478,short story i took it off and put it on my phone to see if i would like it,1
3479,bought the extended battery and i'm not hard on my phone and it got stuck and my phone would be unprotected,1
3480,after doing a bit of research i bought a usb charging cable go down to your local electronics store,1
3481,not that seidio would have done anything because they don't really tell you how good or bad it was,1
3482,i returned the cable they were really good about that but i did not i got this one as a loss,1
3483,or contact the seller and hope they have some kind of pads or insulator to protect your skin,1
3484,it's not a true apple case like it claims to be expert at,1
3485,this type of stylus hardly ever works right and there was no abnormal indication or use of the smartphone,1
3486,yes i actually put that i hate this product it stop workin after 10mins ill never buy from this company ever again,1
3487,i think the seller reimbursed me for this product and when i finally got it,1
3488,the external battery pack only works when it's in the holster so you need to press really hard to get your presses registered,1
3489,this is not good for the phone no,1
3490,the cel phone company rep here airtel told me they have no wiggle room and without being so tight it's hard to use,1
3491,doesn't do what it was suppose to work with texts and calls,1
3492,the case came pretty fast in the mail however they still charged me for the old one,1
3493,i called back yet again and they sent me the screen protectors unprotected not in any sort of packaging,1
3494,i still use it as a cloud device,1
3495,i read up on the best way to charge your phone,1
3496,i was unable to use the case but now i'm just over it,1
3497,at first it's ok but if you scroll all the way down into the cut-out hole,1
3498,i do not recommend this product to buy unless you are just buying it for the cord,1
3499,terrible quality phone case i dont recommend this one at all,1
3500,but since the sd cards are different it makes it difficult to view the phones apps in bright light,1
3501,they are ridiculously hard to put on and hard to use at some point in time,1
3502,based on my experience with it and that's no bueno in my book,1
3503,update belkin has updated this product and it wasn't what i expected,1
3504,this was a defect in the top piece where it wouldn't fit properly and they are impossible to put on,1
3505,the speck case is really a poor design,1
3506,they are not connected to the outside of the screen is noticeable here,1
3507,it has a sharp edge which makes it very uncomfortable to have it on my gear but it's still not worth it,1
3508,also the microphone didn't work and have not received a replacement for it,1
3509,it made my phone look and feel so fat,1
3510,i could barely fit my iphone into the charger it made a sound like it didn't have any connectivity problems,1
3511,once this items is on your cell phone don't order this product you will be wasting your money,1
3512,i did not try to return this product because it is hard to put in or remove the phone due to the poor plastic quality,1
3513,the battery time is not even close to the quality of the om battery and that was horrible,1
3514,you also have to push really hard to get off once its on,1
3515,i have had over 15 and i was really excited when it came in the glass seperated from the frame,1
3516,do no order this i promise it is a waste of money until i can figure out how to get it off the site,1
3517,it gets worse the back of the phone iphone 4,1
3518,i put it on my boost mobile samsung galaxy s2 and it doesnt fit my ear right,1
3519,although it is a good case and it is a shiny almost patent leather look that shows fingerprints and is slippery,1
3520,the price is so cheap and i knew i was taking a chance on the bulk packaging but i was soooo wrong,1
3521,i sat and swapped the original samsung cable for this one back and going to try a motorola s11-flex hd headset is amazing,1
3522,i returned this product and would not have an opportunity to resolve any grievance and avoid bad advertising on amazon,1
3523,i wanted a car charger for your gs3 i recommend it to any of the buttons,1
3524,1a and plug the other end into your device and the other end contacts the power clip,1
3525,i tried several power supplies and it didn't fit my phone well at all,1
3526,this stupid little thing got stuck in my phone and it didn't even recognize it,1
3527,i had to send it back but i forgot,1
3528,not gon na even bother putting it on my s2 that the manufacturer did not go through the proper process to ensure compatibility,1
3529,i expected the mirror screen protector to be like the one i bought didn't work right,1
3530,on one hand the company is a good honest company on the other hand you're not going to see any benefit from multimedia capabilities,1
3531,the holes are all in the wrong place and another in the right,1
3532,i received the item in a timely manner in acceptable packing in pristine condition,1
3533,as for the charging base it looks nice but then i noticed my phones back cover has dings all over it,1
3534,this chord didn't work at all we tried all of the screen protectors was deformed,1
3535,after a week it was unbearably ratty-looking and i had to keep powering on the phone for a refund,1
3536,now it may have been my cable but i tried multiple cables and it wouldn't even charge after hours of being plugged in,1
3537,i was almost able to get it to work on the dock,1
3538,the tvs recognized that something was plugged in but with no charging output when the charger is plugged in i do not like that,1
3539,if you align it to the screen on the phone shattered,1
3540,especially on the left side of the phone is flush with the case,1
3541,i kept it though i do not use this product anymore,1
3542,they break sooo easy and i am not able to use them at all,1
3543,it is so good but it is so short it's almost unusable to reach,1
3544,this should not even be allowed to be on the top 2 for installation and protection,1
3545,for the few people that have given this product a rating of four stars,1
3546,how can you tell how you may drop your phone it may be from a completely different manufacturer may not hold the same charge etc,1
3547,the product was difficult to install and does not stand the test of time i hope,1
3548,new one continues to work but person on the other end of the conversation couldn't understand me on this headset with my iphone 4s,1
3549,edit2 after 3 months it no longer held up my device,1
3550,please be aware that i strongly believe this is not a case its basically a cheap plastic back cover,1
3551,used this product the day it arrived it didn't fit well around the actual phone,1
3552,the more precise version the product is the epitome of 34 you get what you pay for,1
3553,save your money and a better one it will have to do,1
3554,if you read the reviews this seems to be designed to be worn at all times,1
3555,got ta order me another one of these and his actually worked,1
3556,the bottom part of the case had a plastic film you have to remove your protective case cover,1
3557,they fell off pretty quickly and there were sooo many bubbles even though i tried multiple times following the instructions exactly,1
3558,i guess making a rubber case is really hard to move and adjust,1
3559,the thin piece that stretches over the front and back for the extended battery to use on my moto droid,1
3560,trust me don't waste your money because it doesn't charge well and to top it off my screen,1
3561,edit the dock broke just a few minutes which also indicated lower quality materials,1
3562,i did not test it as soon as i bempued into the wall it broke into pieces,1
3563,it'll fit perfect by my front camera but off when it comes to reflection on the sun it glares the whole screen,1
3564,i bought this charger add an extra being that i already had the unit and have the tools,1
3565,unfortunately i will have to hope the screen is durable enough that it does not allow access to the ports,1
3566,if that is what you are doing on the phone when you are using the case but bad once you remove it,1
3567,don't get me wrong this is a good case and it is a not the samsung charger,1
3568,too many wires to plug so for me to make the extra trip to ups to mail this garbage back,1
3569,then i purchased the wireless cover and did the same thing after 3 days of use,1
3570,i originally bought one of these for my motorola droid,1
3571,but it just doesn't make the fit with the buttons,1
3572,you can go to a t-mobile samsung galaxy s2,1
3573,if your smart you would buy a samsung galaxy s3 charger this product popped up,1
3574,i was so excited about this case thinking maybe i could personalize it so i wouldn't accidentally use it and damage the phone,1
3575,and when i used this cable to plug my phone into the cord,1
3576,which means that if you are going to use it as a gag because it falls off,1
3577,i like that the cord is long but the part that plugs into your cell phone is much louder,1
3578,i tried this substitute but the hole in the case it wasn't silicone,1
3579,this product actually caused damage to the corners of my jawline by the case,1
3580,i'm afraid i can't recommend this for anyone the data cables didn't work to charge 2 samsung galaxies,1
3581,the bottom volume rocker is covered by the case as was one of the unlucky ones,1
3582,there has to be a little bigger inside,1
3583,etc so if you don't need it to be crystal clear,1
3584,looked almost good enough to be real but i bought it to replace my charger cable but thos cable is a waste of money,1
3585,very disappointed that 9 out of 10 times at most i try to charge with diferents charge pods but it dont work,1
3586,about 3 hours later i went to unplug except it wouldn't unplug,1
3587,it was cheap enough that i didn't get the screen protector on the steady it and eventually i just threw it in the trash,1
3588,during a call i heard a loud pop and it stopped charging when trying to just charge the charger,1
3589,this is battery pack and there is nothing they will do for me,1
3590,the backlight was low the volumes across all apps was low and it just wasn't right i took it off,1
3591,as such i can not rely on or trust them with my wife's security and you should think twice about it yourself,1
3592,my phone just kept saying it does not recognize this product but i was wrong,1
3593,i've learned my lesson and will spend a couple more bucks and buy a standard or some good branded speakers,1
3594,i purchased this to charge my samsung galaxy s4,1
3595,it's the worst cell phone that i've owned for a few years,1
3596,but then it started getting all glitchy and unresponsive i tried to hard reset it unfortunately this would be the same,1
3597,using on a new t-mobile galaxy s2 doesn't work but this wasn't meant for and did not work at all,1
3598,almost immediately i noticed that the battery was 100 % drained,1
3599,would rather buy it from a 3rd party seller and fulfilled by amazon,1
3600,front doesn't cleanly wrap around case and there is a chance you will get one that works,1
3601,a couple of weeks and then the whole piece cracked when i removed my phone from this case,1
3602,i didnt feel like trying to return this small-value item,1
3603,i keep wanting to give it another chance and i am upset i did,1
3604,also there is a paper inside that says that the case has an area that does not operate with the phone,1
3605,the second headset is still working but i have not received it so rating it seems silly,1
3606,suffice to say i had to throw them away,1
3607,if it was more than 3 inches away from the device telling you that the device is unsupported,1
3608,in my mind this is a crucial element of this product i am going to find a better product,1
3609,i have no idea why it's there as all it does is darken the shade of the screen a few shades,1
3610,my samsung note 2 and it doesnt cover the entire screen and ringbo made some comments about it being on your phone,1
3611,it still charged things but everyone around me begged me to turn it off then back on it is really annoying never again weak bluetooth,1
3612,would not recommend this product to anyone and i will not be ordering another one anytime soon,1
3613,amazonbasics silicone case and screen protectors for at t and verizon ipod touch 1 g 2 g 3 g networks,1
3614,this is the same side of your body all the time,1
3615,interferes with my radio when my phone is literally right next to it,1
3616,on the good side i don't have any real objection to the second,1
3617,not to mention it had a very strong smell so i had to hold the connectionso that it would charge,1
3618,not a very good remote control and the phone doesn't have a problem with the charge pad itself,1
3619,tried it several times and i could never use it had to take it to the store it was purchased from amazon via uag directly,1
3620,but the slot for the phone and the plastic back cover was bended,1
3621,they did however have great customer service and i'm willing to live with that for the clarity,1
3622,i can barely hear anything out of the ear even when correct ear placement is done,1
3623,be sure to check the about section of the phone,1
3624,plastic shell did not fit properly the volume would change without touching the buttons and the charge which i know is otg compatible,1
3625,they worked for one week which leads me to believe that this item has a 3 year warranty,1
3626,micro usb connector provides charging for both phone and music while the phone was off but then i turned it on,1
3627,very smooth and sense of security because of the thickness of the phone but it also covered the flash do-dad on the phone,1
3628,further attempts result pretty much the same similar happened to my samsung galaxy tab 2 doesnt charge well on the na,1
3629,the material doesn't stick well to the phone screen and peel off,1
3630,they don't charge well it takes an hour to get it off it just smeared,1
3631,the most obvious is that nfc doesn't work with a iphone nor a droid,1
3632,my current holster is starting to show signs of shorting out and two days later it was coming off,1
3633,the sound quality was good but the product wasnt like the what it was described as new but it was far from it,1
3634,i don't keep my phone in my hand while i use the phone,1
3635,plastic tabs that are to grip the phone and hold the phone to your ear,1
3636,didn't work for what i purchased for,1
3637,also this dev does not come with a screen protector on product is good customer service is horrible,1
3638,for this reason i'm giving this supplier a 1 star,1
3639,we have to do that most folks will toss this thing in the trash and got atenergy t-3000usbinstead which works infinitely better,1
3640,in fact when this screen protector is thick and sticky,1
3641,it did not work at all that's all i have to actually turn my device off for it to fit inside,1
3642,i figured maybe it was just plastic from when i bought it i thought it would look similar to what was being advertised,1
3643,just hated it was not able to test it out to see if it works,1
3644,i liked the fit and they paired easy but what good is that when it does work it charges very quickly,1
3645,update june 7 2013i contacted the manufacturer having been outside of the 30 day return policy and appear to be stuck with another dud,1
3646,does not fit my iphone 3 g with a broken screen,1
3647,sometimes it retracts sometimes it doesn't allow a pass through charge as soon as you put pressure on keyboard,1
3648,the iphone is so slick a bumper is essential just don't buy them from abe-123 unless you want to be disappointed,1
3649,it's a day after i put it on i went from full reception to none at all,1
3650,i had high hopes for this when i saw how flexible the skin was prior to application,1
3651,i like the fact it's slim but if you take it off you will ruin your phone,1
3652,i can't see but it does not cover the front does not protect it at all,1
3653,as stated monday aug 13 they are looking for an awesome cable keep looking,1
3654,it really wouldn't have been so great,1
3655,sprint has issued an update and the voice quality is not good and very short,1
3656,the product is fine but the interface makes it almost impossible to read though,1
3657,if you never take pictures in the dark it is very very very slowww,1
3658,it was a waste of money i am glad i didn't pay much for it,1
3659,i have an iphone 5 with a small bumper surrounding it would not fit on my phone at all,1
3660,with it installed i was very conscious of not putting pressure on the phone as the material is plastic and thin,1
3661,as i put them on today to listen to music on my laptop and wired earbuds for my phone,1
3662,ok phone not the best out there for the money,1
3663,i received a message that it's not compatible with the white iphone,1
3664,i don't usually use a car charger but worse than that it did not work,1
3665,i had pushed the on off button gets depressed every time,1
3666,i don't know for sure if it was just taking a minute to find but it never did,1
3667,i would not buy this product if you want tools that will last longer then 20 min,1
3668,it doesn't fit and today the case on the sink and it held up so i thought i'd try it,1
3669,it doesn't look how it's supposed to be peeled away for the final application of these screens,1
3670,everything else looks great but i dont expect it to last much longer,1
3671,i general the cover gives the phone a fuzzy grainy pixelated look,1
3672,because you have to take the case on and snap it in place,1
3673,hope u don't do the job it was intended for,1
3674,i had to physically push hard to get it on and pressing the buttons doesnt work especially the home button,1
3675,but i had it for a few days,1
3676,i regret purchasing the phone for following reasons even if you get a defective case don't bother with this,1
3677,i did read the reviews before you buy,1
3678,the adhesive was visible and the peices did not line up great with the cutouts of the phone but when i went to purchase these,1
3679,there are a ton of posts under every single one of them gave me the same problem,1
3680,however the magnet on the back of the phone as it was and given that it wasn't nice looking on my iphone at all,1
3681,this product is a waste of money since you can't turn that one once you're in a tunnel or something,1
3682,this item is very cheaply made and smells so bad,1
3683,sorry ill pass no more for me as far as i could find someone to take it,1
3684,for those wondering the case does not protect your phone,1
3685,it's normally hooked up so it had to go back go my old apple cord,1
3686,i did not want to return this item for the product that was advertise,1
3687,i used the case for a couple of bucks and it's not really ambient but pretty darn bright,1
3688,i can't keep the case on for a full day i returned them,1
3689,15 mm thick it's less than half of the fancier smartphones on the market,1
3690,the charger shipped is not the one pictured with the two connections on the correct side that will work with that phone,1
3691,the case is also cheap looking but i suppose that's because they had to fit in to the correct items,1
3692,product not the same battery as in the picture and it was very good,1
3693,i used one of them and it's the best on the market,1
3694,the silicone was stretched out and the charger flap broke within 2weeks,1
3695,the second layer did not fit well on my s4,1
3696,the sound is good but once you try to put on the phone and the battery at the same time,1
3697,while the cable has chip for iphone 5s the connector is so short that it will not warp due to heat from the phone,1
3698,i ordered two of these and both are the same,1
3699,i have to say that i can no longer do that,1
3700,i thought that all screen protectors were pretty much the same color and do not reflect the picture,1
3701,only five days with it and the screen protector has kinda a weird surface,1
3702,i hope this is a fake i contacted mophie and they sent me a case for a samsung galaxy s2,1
3703,i have contacted the seller and asking for a refund and the company issued a credit right away,1
3704,but its almost the same in functionality as the 2200mah not to mention the included microphone would also enable speakerphone,1
3705,i brought this case because i thought it would heal but it never did,1
3706,0 port which is terrible and defeats the purpose of the phone is awful itss great inconvience,1
3707,it seems that based on the positive reviews on here but it was junk,1
3708,i have the original lg bumper case for my nexus 4 and it barely added 640mah to the battery,1
3709,they are fine in a foot or so of water but not good for taking on a walk or jogging,1
3710,well if you are willing to make and the only reason i don't return it,1
3711,i emailed the seller about the problem their response was to buy another one but not from akron,1
3712,these get scratched super easy and you can not use as a wallet it will not stay charged i am not very happy with it,1
3713,i went to freedompop to activate my device and i was desperate to get it back,1
3714,i got it from gumball machine as soon as i placed the first protector on i noticed that one of them was already broken,1
3715,they could not confirm whether or not this was indeed a 2 amp charger and cable to charge it quickly,1
3716,i've already dropped my phone in snow and because i had this case for months and have never used it,1
3717,unfortunately i'm now outside the timeframe for returns and i'm stuck with a broken headset that i exchanged 4 times in 6 months,1
3718,i bought it for my boyfriend and he doesn't even use it,1
3719,its cheap made plastic clip didnt even last a day if they even work at all,1
3720,i love this case for my husband and one for me,1
3721,first the suction cup would not stay secure for more than 30 minutes it is too painful the sound has no fidelity,1
3722,unfortunately it did not turn out to be just as cheap,1
3723,my first one worked well for a week and then disintegrated,1
3724,i lost my money thinking it was a fluke with the first,1
3725,if you don't want to keep replacing them every other week,1
3726,first one worked fine for about 3 months and then it will be out of warranty,1
3727,next the case stays open as you can see from the number of poor reviews and the great,1
3728,i had such a good opinion of this brand of case for my phone and saw this in a bundle,1
3729,this thing is fine for people who are looking to protect their investment,1
3730,plus it had a huge crack in it and the plastic was more squished bent than cleanly cut,1
3731,the sku printed on my new one differs from the original one i've had for an iphone 5,1
3732,do not buy this if your significant other wants to use this as a candy dish at work not a good fit,1
3733,other complaints are that the home button doesn't work at all,1
3734,and the fact that it is gel so it would be difficult to answer had it worked all the time,1
3735,yet i was very close to the top and bottom edges or more importantly the four corners of the phone,1
3736,would not charge or connect to my mac laptop which is what i have done and it works great,1
3737,the last good product i received from ringke was the slim for the galaxy nexus extended battery so it's this or nothing,1
3738,hey dont get me wrong but i didnt get it until august 13th,1
3739,the bottom portion of the case and politely told them that it was not the color i ordered,1
3740,bought 2 and both quit working the cords are good but the mat itself is not easy to carry around for travel,1
3741,this didnt fit my phone at all,1
3742,do not order this case if you decide to order a product that simply doesn't live up to hype,1
3743,note when i said my first note 3 and loved it,1
3744,i put the silicone part on my iphone and it got water in it,1
3745,and then within a week it fell apart and i've tried contacting the seller several times and was pleased with the results,1
3746,i do not reccommend this product i am going to have to buy a regular battery and spend more money,1
3747,only wished i would have returned it but not worth the trip to my local radioshack and 7 to get an adapter that would fit,1
3748,one end of the tip goes into your device and it should start charging the device,1
3749,reposted because the company didn't like this case at all,1
3750,unfortunately the design does not seem to be available separately,1
3751,it's gone on very very bubbly and doesn't come with a cable for the iphone,1
3752,you get what you pay for but i will never purchase from you again,1
3753,if i order something i expect for it to work the concept is great but this product is bad period,1
3754,i worked as a computer tech and does not work in any mild noisy environment,1
3755,i bought this product knowing for the reviews that i had to be moving it around for it to work,1
3756,this bumper case was cheaply made and the shiny studs on the back began to turn and even got a little rust spot,1
3757,bad purchase decision on my part great concept just doesn't work with the direction the sim needs them to work,1
3758,anything else i don't mention there is nothing to protect buffer the crash on the faceplate,1
3759,this slipping allows the case to turn on the battery case,1
3760,it does not give an easy release of the phone and that's what i've been calling the just so syndrome,1
3761,what made it worse is the extremely poor customer service from the philippines spend almost an hour on the phone,1
3762,i'm now starting over in my search for a multi-phone multi-source charger,1
3763,when i check on the tracking number it tells me that it's lost track of my phone even when my phone is plugged in,1
3764,so if you are looking for roughly cut screen protectors there are many other reviews saying the same thing but wireless but had no success,1
3765,so if your a fast texter then this is not the way to go for the connected to my phone,1
3766,seems htc finally figured out how to work around the flaws at the end of the day you get what you pay for,1
3767,thus the area around the phone display does not cover the top part like shown,1
3768,well to have the unit work you have to plug in the charger the phone stays on,1
3769,i had two sets of these buds to keep in the car and you can hear other cars passing,1
3770,then i would get picture for a few seconds and neither of them worked well,1
3771,i first scratched when i was trying to separate the backing the tab broke off,1
3772,fifty bucks isn't a lot of money for it and watch it disappear,1
3773,just had it just in case so when i went to use this on my computer just to charge my phone,1
3774,tried this and it was hard to take it out and i wasn't expecting much,1
3775,the phone did not recognize the phone and i'm glad i did,1
3776,however the 2a ports began to charge my samsung it just plain does not work,1
3777,i tried going thru the reviews on this product i was confident to order it,1
3778,hard to get cell phone out to get to talk to someone it pulled the other one out,1
3779,when they had to escalate to a supervisor to tell me how long the batteries will last under normal usage,1
3780,when it came it was a used one,1
3781,i loved this thing when i first got my iphone 5 i really disappointed,1
3782,beware you will not get the item that is displayed do not buy from them,1
3783,they quickly replied and apologized and sent out a replacement and i returned the defective charger,1
3784,79 on them so i'm not going to waste my time in return for no reason,1
3785,yes i connected it via a powered usb port and the blue light comes on,1
3786,the picture shows the hard case covering the face of the phone is only 2 feet away,1
3787,there are no instructions like most screen protectors i've used,1
3788,i wished this would have worked more than two days i would give it zero star if possible,1
3789,the case is peeling off along the sides and corners of this case against the back the back is still thicker,1
3790,so to sum up for a little over six months and it's useless,1
3791,as a former iphone 3 g customer i was impressed to see such a good deal on a broken headset,1
3792,there's an available app but it's not so back to amazon it will go,1
3793,i read several forums and this has been true of all of them,1
3794,but i must say it is very hard to get a straight line,1
3795,the cord didn't last long before cracking,1
3796,had i known they were gon na be jerks i would have never chosen this p0s for myself,1
3797,it's a pain and it's messy and i wanted a black one for my fiancee his is still holding on,1
3798,this item did not even charge my phone for a minute,1
3799,this also made me think there was something wrong with my evo and the screen cracked so i bought this one,1
3800,i wish i hadn't removed it to try this one out from my son's droid,1
3801,thought armband was great until i started using it and it cracked in half and of course i will throw it away,1
3802,another indicator is thin rubber inside and thin rubber bumpers on the corners and bottom of the case is pretty good,1
3803,then i was asked send it back before they could do anything and it's not that hard to repair,1
3804,and even if it were a little less opaque i think it would be basically useless,1
3805,i was extremely excited to receive this wallet but was seriously disappointed when i opened it new or claimed to be,1
3806,to this day i still have not heard a word,1
3807,the salesman said give it a chance but it doesn't kick back on even when the call is done,1
3808,the case is hard to remove the top,1
3809,the case is thick enough that i feel like it's going to break with pressure while taking it apart,1
3810,when i went to charge it a second time i did not receive a reply,1
3811,almost impossible to get it in the case then turned the case power on,1
3812,and i will continue my search for a dashboard mount for my iphone that i really like,1
3813,i have had this for over 6 months and i never use it because the gap doesn't allow for contact,1
3814,i put it in my phone and it did but i had the case for less than a couple hours before returning them to amazon,1
3815,by the time it got to the point where if you do not heed this plea to protect yourself,1
3816,but what we could get to work and when it did i put it on my phone but i could barely hear him,1
3817,materials seem ok the case doesn't cover the earphone jack,1
3818,i got sent a case for a samsung galaxy s4 active and it didnt save it at all,1
3819,beads fall off and it is junk regret making purchase as it is worthless in spite of the fact that the screen protector was damage,1
3820,if your phone doesn't even fit,1
3821,wrong size wrong openings for any of the phones in the household will not buy from this seller,1
3822,have tried to hook up to my phone and peel off right away,1
3823,this is not what i got the one i received when i purchased my phone,1
3824,thankfully i was able to squeeze my phone in the pouch sealed it up and way i went,1
3825,5 minutes after it arrived i went to plug it in spelling doom for the case,1
3826,i followed the directions there is still a lot of work on the research and development side of things,1
3827,the tip has changed i have to touch each letter 2-3 times per week for the last 1,1
3828,the material is so thick and slick that i don't have a smooth touch,1
3829,very odd indeed and not what i was looking for a good quality screen protector,1
3830,too many wires to plug so for me to give it more than one star for interesting idea,1
3831,either way it's just a small tablet,1
3832,it took several messages where they asked for a picture of something that looked like glitter and it's even off centered,1
3833,the one i ordered was fake i was lucky enough to get it into pairing mode and reconnected,1
3834,it was also very very difficult to get off once it is snapped into place,1
3835,i will just by the recommended case for this phone but i truly now regret it,1
3836,i sent another message to amazon and they are conducting an investigation,1
3837,in landscape however you still can not use it on your phone it is half covered by the case,1
3838,so if you are charging you ipad you have to wait for oversea shipment but this has been the worst p,1
3839,i turned sync back on only to find that t-mobile has sent me a replacement product,1
3840,for those positive feedback comments out there you either don't have a problem with the charge pad itself,1
3841,im not saying this is a horrible implimentation of the bt standard,1
3842,final remarks i purchased this product because of the slim profile,1
3843,the call quality was poor right from the beginning and saved time and money,1
3844,this only charges the one that came with my phone in my business,1
3845,junk-broke in a matter of two weeks i would not recommend an item that can survive shipping too protect a phone,1
3846,guess i won't be ordering this again,1
3847,ive owned mine over a month and then all of the audio of the phone went out,1
3848,and what smartphone doesn't come with a little plastic piece to get the bubbles out of these ones,1
3849,i gave up and figured i'd try to blow it off but it would just stick to the screen and leaves lots of bubbles,1
3850,the side and top buttons also were very hard to push and set in too much on the phone,1
3851,i have e-mailed the seller and got no repsonse,1
3852,first thing i notice that the screen protector adds noise to the screen,1
3853,and here's what i did here it's going back,1
3854,problem is the plastic part becomes discolored within a few weeks horrible dont wwaste your money or time waithing for this thing,1
3855,they make the screen look really bad and don't trust this case at all,1
3856,even though it's one of the only options on the market for more the 5 months yet,1
3857,it wasn't the case but maybe i didn't plug it into your phone doesn't even fit the phone and was not deformed,1
3858,i see others are able to get the battery to work in the phone,1
3859,so unhappy with this product and the cheap covers i used to use the fosmon 3 for 3 screen covers for my mytouch phone,1
3860,you can never get them to insert close quite properly and one of my cellphones will not charge properly using this adapter,1
3861,being that a new iphone would cost 500 bucks i'm going to start looking for another one right now,1
3862,i wouldn't say this is the most minor of my complaints,1
3863,installed and first thing i notice that the screen protector is amazing,1
3864,with the hx550 i should be able to use your power button,1
3865,i took it to a local verizon where they told me it is your problem and hung up,1
3866,since the phone's gorilla glass is curved this cover does not stick very well not to mention it is outrageously overpriced,1
3867,i purchased a plastic one as well as i thought it would be better,1
3868,made very cheaply and broke the first time i've seen this particular design featured on several websites under different brand names,1
3869,not sure since i didn't want to waste your money note 3,1
3870,or contact the seller and hope they have some kind of electronic noise suppression,1
3871,this is not a galaxy note 3 sticker over the top of the case on the phone,1
3872,original post loved the phone we are on a t-bolt and it wouldn't stay on her phone,1
3873,the box it came in the plug from the cord stayed in my iphone,1
3874,the suction cup melted and doesn't stay well on the ipod 4,1
3875,what bothers me about this is that it's not even worth the hassle of returning,1
3876,i would not call this a slim fit case go with the elago g7,1
3877,so overall it is a good idea however there are several degrees of play in both movements,1
3878,also this case is not only cheap in price it is cheaply made do not waste your time and money,1
3879,i should have read more clearly that it is a li-polymer battery which is better than the nokia,1
3880,but you know it could just be the one i received is not that battery that is shown on amazon,1
3881,i called google support and they don't know where i live i am writing this review,1
3882,well amazon wouldn't let me glue anymore,1
3883,for eighty bucks i expected it would last a bit longer as to get my money back,1
3884,since the device has only one real button it's impossible to justify the price for what you get,1
3885,after 5 or 10 mintues it completely slides off and doesn't hold a charge and was faulty from the beginning,1
3886,being that i noticed this as soon as i snapped in on the phone,1
3887,the charger didn't fit my samsung s3,1
3888,it was dirt cheap so i didn't bother to return because it was so cute,1
3889,so you would have to use two hands,1
3890,they received them 12 days ago and i still have problem where all of a sudden people start to say hello,1
3891,was not what it was described when i tried to put the case on the front side,1
3892,it wont work with ios7 but if you have any charger that is fat at the end it will not fit,1
3893,i will likely buy another battery from a reputable manufacturer and will not use it again,1
3894,this means that if you press just a little bit of moisture during the packing process,1
3895,i corrected my mistake for the back and sides after about 4 weeks,1
3896,i recommend klearkare for the money and i promptly returned them,1
3897,it was very difficult to put on to the point you can't even use it for my phone,1
3898,honestly i'm not sure how much protection it really provides but it has to be the lowest quality case i have ever purchased,1
3899,it takes two batteries to get through the material into where the iphone is,1
3900,and most of the batteries do not deliver the same performance as the previous battery which prompted it's replacement,1
3901,it just makes me mad because i've seen cases for other phones but it will not charge,1
3902,i would have returned it but it took like a month to ship it to in china which will cost about 35,1
3903,i am surprised it didn't last long before cracking,1
3904,this case didn't fit over my screen protecter very well,1
3905,i bought this item a local retailer was happy cause i got it on i was very please at first,1
3906,i would most defiantly stay on the side of the phone to protect it,1
3907,your wan settings aren't remembered you have to reconnect it with a separate i d and you can't see what to tap,1
3908,the silicon part is so loose that the phone easily falls out of included belt clip,1
3909,i specifically bought this case because of its cool looks,1
3910,for a product that use regular batteries the battery door is the most difficult to apply that i've ever tried with any phone,1
3911,after reading all the rave reviews i saw for it,1
3912,a full case charge will transfer enough juice to charge an iphone 4 that has a 1 420 mah lithium polymer battery cell,1
3913,long and short of the story this product does not do what it was suppose to replace is probably lighter than this unit,1
3914,my review is accurate and i want it to have some sort of solar power aspect here you will be disappointed,1
3915,this battery came in a package without success,1
3916,i got this to replace battery on my iphone 3gs my battery would have been dead by 3 pm also,1
3917,hopefully the second one will work or i will be looking for another set elsewhere these are simply not that great,1
3918,these styli are nice at first but the build quality of this product i think that's horrible customer service,1
3919,you need an average cranium the sound is not quite loud enough the volume controls are very convenient to use,1
3920,unfortunately after 3 weeks the crack in the headband started after 2 months the first battery started to expand and bloat,1
3921,and the audio cuts out about 3-4 times and yes they have replied but no firm answer,1
3922,however when i went to use it and everything,1
3923,i installed it in my car and it blew the fuse on the car,1
3924,the title states that this is not useful for me,1
3925,after much reading i found that these screens are very difficult to wipe off,1
3926,this was not worth the money and it was in shipping longer then it worked on my car it wasn't fast at all,1
3927,this screen protector for about 3 weeks now and have used both screens,1
3928,they are quick to tell me that i sound like i am talking to my oversized wallet,1
3929,i returned and bought seidio 1750mah which leaves this one in the drawer and i'm never using it,1
3930,the case has enough slots for the buttons and the blue is darker than in the picture,1
3931,so the design is beautiful and the case looks great,1
3932,i have this cable for about two months of light use,1
3933,after first pairing with my samsung galaxy s4 at all,1
3934,all while the website was claiming that i wasn't constantly trying to readjust,1
3935,i don't like it and it actually drains the phones battery,1
3936,well first one i had a lot of lint on it,1
3937,that said even with the usb plugged in and the phone 8217s battery was at below 50 %,1
3938,after two unsuccessful attempts i finally got the product i was wearing it it just didnt work anymore,1
3939,the picture is also misleading since it shows the iphone with the included micro usb cable gave less than 400mah,1
3940,i have the belkin verve folio leather case for iphone 4 red silicone black,1
3941,heck you can even find 10 bluetooth headsets if you really want to buy this for a child,1
3942,incredibly bulky the clip broke within two weeks of placing it on my phone and looked at it it already had scratches all over it,1
3943,spigen customer service if you're listening i would love to be contacted or sent another one please,1
3944,i don't like this product because of the safety issue,1
3945,they are no the same cut as in the picture it's dull muted red and not shiny,1
3946,i went with a different brand than iloome,1
3947,look the look of this film is the worst i've ever used this has a very specific left and right side,1
3948,i put it together then it doesn't start or power on at all,1
3949,on top of that it didn't want to go through the hassle of removing my case,1
3950,i thought i was buying a new battery for it it still sucked,1
3951,i never got the product i wasn't quite sure how to fit them into my ears,1
3952,in fact it's hard to get out and the ends and l shaped,1
3953,the card they send you to smooth out the bubbles with the card they give you to do so,1
3954,i have had the case for about 7 or 8 weeks,1
3955,i tried a couple different slivers all had the same problem as noted in this post,1
3956,hubby said it probably blew the fuse and i should send it back or try sell it to get my phone number,1
3957,after reading some positive reviews i gave it a one star,1
3958,instead it's a cheap case but it is so slippery you will drop it just holding it,1
3959,im not trippin hard it was only 1 and that is about what it's worth,1
3960,the hard case i received with the black black case i purchased a black red and yellow poetic borderline bumper for my lg nexus 4,1
3961,the back of the epic is slightly curved so it will not add significant bulk to the phone,1
3962,maybe it's just the only time i have problem is with this headset and not the phones,1
3963,i tried it two nights in a row and they both died within 2 days,1
3964,the case does not fit the iphone 4s it was clearly fro iphone 4,1
3965,i use one of these then it's back to the hd for me,1
3966,i beg you not to waste your money on this junk product,1
3967,biggest piece ofs headphones buds whatever i have ever purchased and i always use the same shipping option,1
3968,not sure which models listed work and which don't but the fact that i had no service what so ever,1
3969,the mirror look was too dark for you to see clearly so i did not mind the month-long wait,1
3970,it will not protect your phone very well,1
3971,please trust me when i say that just learning how to use the mhl adapter 1,1
3972,it is very light blue and i did not want to risk it,1
3973,update 4 23 gus ultimately offered me a refund since the item could not be replaced,1
3974,although you can use this set because i did not get what i expected,1
3975,at that point i knew i had to buy another one but not from akron,1
3976,i wear reading glasses but this screen in the sun only good as a last resort for my galaxy s3,1
3977,this junk and almost ruined my sim and had to have it reset to orginal state,1
3978,the last thing i want is for it to be shipped from florida,1
3979,is still sits on the phone and is very difficult to assemble,1
3980,but when i travel to asia the phone did not fit the iphone5s even though it said that it did,1
3981,unfortunately the product i received is a black on the outside and the phone rests very well on it,1
3982,this cheap piece of quit working during it's first use on my trip from norcal to socal just using the gps,1
3983,if you read the reviews this seems to be designed to be worn for stereo music when you are working out,1
3984,i think i just got an email back saying i said i had ordered a box of replacement tips but still an annoying ommission,1
3985,discovered the hard way that you can not get an accurate charge each time,1
3986,the case protected all 4 corners of my phone are scratched up,1
3987,well it took a lot of force to pull the case out and noticed the rubber bumpers were dirty,1
3988,i paired this up with my samsung galaxy s4 and it doesn't hold my phone and to take it out,1
3989,i didn't try using this connection but it seems like the olephobic or whatever coating is so good on my iphone 5,1
3990,i waited 3 weeks for it to get under the screen,1
3991,the problem is the you cant access the quick screen,1
3992,case does not fit my phone unless i take the battery out this might work,1
3993,i thought it might have been a fluke but i ended up getting a bumper in a local store,1
3994,it's particularly annoying when trying to answer a call before the caller would hang up,1
3995,i have since applied for a refund and maybe even damage to my phone,1
3996,when i wrote the top part of the case and the phone,1
3997,the bottom flap just locks together to hold the phone at all i'm a little upset by that,1
3998,this was a total waste of time money,1
3999,i could have pooped on my phone and it had just about all features that android 2,1
4000,as others have said the cutout is wrong for the power button came off after i had put it on my phone,1
4001,i would have to press the charger in sideways to get it to line up with my front facing camera but,1
4002,the hard plastic will snap if you try to take the case off just to end the call,1
4003,addendum i wrote this review day 3 i would have had the chance to use it while it's charging,1
4004,the iphone fits tightly in the cover and the quality of the product was easy just called amazon and they were great,1
4005,dropped my phone and not only did the product arrive scratched and beaten up it didn't hold the phone anymore,1
4006,it gave me some error message-i just threw it away and bought an android,1
4007,does garmin have a patent on friction mounts that conform to the shape of the lines and the obvious problem,1
4008,using gps on my phone the first day i got it,1
4009,i am so disappointed and for the cost it's not worth saving a couple of bucks,1
4010,this maybe for an older model because it doesn't require internet service but satellite only,1
4011,this case offers little to no protection if you drop your phone are almost completely uncovered making it worthless in that regard,1
4012,things were great for about a month and then crumbles and falls off shortly thereafter,1
4013,also the unit got very hot after a few minutes i smelled smoke and immediately pulled it out,1
4014,now i'm left with a phone that doesn't fit the right way on my phone,1
4015,i went to the apple store for them to look at it too long much the same as glare on a glossy photo,1
4016,apple engineered the buttons on your phone to help position the screen protector,1
4017,it's velcro on one side and comes off easily,1
4018,i gave it one star but it doesn't not look the same as the item pictured but i actually liked that,1
4019,i like the size and portability of this is great however the very first time 4 different clips on the cover broke off immediately,1
4020,5 inches when i try to do anything,1
4021,i see why the price was so cheap it's not worth the money,1
4022,i'm waiting for a better box to come out i figured it was really good becuase there'svideos and people bragging about it,1
4023,texting will suddenly not allow you to make contact with the screen,1
4024,price it's pricy but if your iphone is dropped from any height,1
4025,update 7 1 powergen does not respond to any other samsung device,1
4026,i'm so upset as soon as i plugged it up,1
4027,i normally don't give bad reviews but have no choice on this one,1
4028,but long story short i'm glad this was cheap because i would of been more upset about the money,1
4029,i have an ultra and with no case on my iphone 3 so i definitely do not recommend this headset to anyone,1
4030,the stand does work good or i would give this a negative rating if i could,1
4031,they said they had to order parts and that it would like it would when i received it it was already broken,1
4032,that is really all i can say is that there is no noticeable improvement,1
4033,overall if i were to go to the store and pay for them to do it,1
4034,the device showed around 11 amps constant pull but i left it plugged in overnight and the phone only charged to 60 %,1
4035,the ball joint mechanism is really hard to answer your phone,1
4036,so when the phone is in working order so it is not the right one i am so upset,1
4037,in the bag is just the case and not glow does not matter how hard i tried,1
4038,i got it from gumball machine as soon as i tried to fit it in this band,1
4039,and i was right to begin with the reviews are great on the new one is slightly longer within a margin of manufacturing error,1
4040,no moisture spots developed between the inside of the plastic of the case is fine do not need these kind of products,1
4041,in my opinion the digitizer seemed too short but i'll never buy another sony ericsson product,1
4042,this screen protector bubbles as soon as you put this screen protector on it didn't work there,1
4043,see how that apple symbol on the back of the evo is nice fits well very functional,1
4044,the wall charger looked like it was in place and the sound is intermittent,1
4045,protector not cut to fit the screen properly,1
4046,the protector would not completely cover the back of the tv and pull on the cable over time,1
4047,hopefully someone else in my family can use it for hands-free calls,1
4048,it is pretty small and it feels extremely comfortable i wish it would work but turns out this is a very big inconvenience,1
4049,only thing that fits this product it's a possible fire hazard,1
4050,this phone case did not fit my samsung galaxy lll t-mobile phone,1
4051,several test calls later i found that if you use a screen cover,1
4052,phone doesn't even recognize the battery at all and i couldn't charge my phone more than 5 %,1
4053,the rings don't stick to the phone it was a waste of time and money waiting for it to come,1
4054,original review i bought this phone thinking it would be a good alternate for the name brand everyone knows for rugged cases case,1
4055,i'm afraid i must agree with those who consider it hyper-sensitive,1
4056,they get depleted with either the ipod or tablet so you can not easily get the google features back,1
4057,second attempt i put the phone in my pocket that much anymore and it still did not work,1
4058,for eighty bucks i expected it would last a bit longer as to get my money back,1
4059,i've tried this with many galsxy s3 phones and nothing it won't even fit and that's what it is,1
4060,with all the functions they have available there is only one piece which does not make sense,1
4061,one week later samsung sent my phone back in and off we went,1
4062,but the clasp was not directly on the phone at all its loose and my headphone port wasn't cut out,1
4063,i know this is cheap but i can't because it peels up the back,1
4064,i used my original battery and although it is not invisible i was not worried about that,1
4065,omg this has got to be the worst case ever why its hard to put on and get the bubbles out,1
4066,must be a very shoddy product if it can't charge a phone in a pocket,1
4067,it was frustrating to plug my phone in and never have more than 93 % after powering up,1
4068,pops off very easily which means it is delivering power just not enough,1
4069,disappointed at how cheap they are its not worth the money even if it was on the floor,1
4070,another phone that looked good at first but after 5 months of use it became pretty much useless,1
4071,upon buying my iphone 5 the only screen protector that is the standard level of difficult to apply,1
4072,i bought this for my at t samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket as advertised when i purchased it,1
4073,but other than that it fits but you have to expect that from something claiming to have four layers,1
4074,buy a reputed brand and make sure you never park your car in such a way that it would charge,1
4075,i went back to using the one that came with the phone charged about 4x as fast from the same dc outlet,1
4076,i would not mention this case to any of my emails which seems to be very poorly done,1
4077,plus it came from singapore which took a really long time to get to my house,1
4078,it is really just a piece of hard plastic case is the worst case,1
4079,i've bought and the other worked not at all,1
4080,this rom was a bare bones rom with limited functionality and it had a small speck of dust under it,1
4081,also the first time i dropped it on the ground once and it shaddered,1
4082,i used the battery consistently for a week and i'm not the human that samsung is designed for,1
4083,the unit seem only work within few paces of the phone and was disappointed but was only out a couple bucks,1
4084,the tiny little volume buttons made it hard to put in and take out your phone with one hand,1
4085,the frustration of trying to make it open i hate it big waste of money considering i can get a more or less comfortable fit,1
4086,i didn't feel like sending it back because its too much of a hasle,1
4087,i was expecting one like the one this one was going to be too useful for me,1
4088,i am always forgetting where i put my phone in the phone case slot it barely snaps shut,1
4089,i am sure it was advertized as beinng compatable when i purchased this item as it was a gift,1
4090,i should have known better you get what you pay for but in this case it is cheap cheap cheap,1
4091,shows all the finger prints and couldn't get it on perfectly with your fist try,1
4092,not good quality at all and it took a really long time to receive it and was excited to put it on my phone,1
4093,the pro fits awkwardly in it tight fit and the base does not sit flat and rolls around on the desk,1
4094,within 2 weeks of starting to use it it no longer worked after a few days,1
4095,is it really that hard to make a good excuse to deny 80 % of claims,1
4096,also notice in the picture the kickstand looks like it is seated all the way,1
4097,my phone popped up saying it wasn't compatible with this charging device,1
4098,i did wind up reordering the same phone from top10cell fulfilled by amazon and not sent from some other source,1
4099,was great while it worked for the htc inspire for about a month now,1
4100,the cord behind the neck is solid but as others have noted this charger broke off in my hand,1
4101,had to lay it on the screen for a month and it broke,1
4102,and therefore it goes back to the screeching,1
4103,well they should also tell you that it did not work but i really wanted it to fit,1
4104,never in my wildest dreams did i think something like this would kill the thing but it did,1
4105,review for gear 2 screen protector doesn't fit to iphone 53,1
4106,the only thing i was able to try the s5 for a few days now and ordered this screen protector immediately,1
4107,the manual is written in microscopic font i think it is a counterfeit of blackberry oem one,1
4108,easy installation the top of the case which i would never do,1
4109,my son wanted this so i got it replaced through the website,1
4110,i'm still looking for a case that's touchstone compatible,1
4111,sound system is horrible and it has not been in direct sunlight for 2 days and it is too hard to remove,1
4112,looking at the product page i don't even have an s3 anymore,1
4113,these protectors are not as clear as i like but you have to charge it this way is totally unsafe,1
4114,the side buttons i find actually much easier to find and push compared to the 510,1
4115,when you open the thing to attach it to a monopod then forget it,1
4116,honestly wont be buying another one less than a day,1
4117,bought this for my husband and one other,1
4118,i went to the website for a replacement and they want to charge you ipad or ipad2 as it will only charge one of them,1
4119,i've been through two of these cases over the last year,1
4120,then it started freezing so badly that the only way to stop that is to open my phone and close it,1
4121,this screen protector was so fragile to begin with i wouldn't have returned the item but it never arrived,1
4122,i loved the color combo of this case but mine has some defects,1
4123,the charger takes 2-3 days after i put this case on,1
4124,the yellow cable just sits at my desktop at work off to the side but you have have it waay off center,1
4125,it is hard to push and lose feedback,1
4126,1a and the battery pack power went down to 20 % and placed in case and enabled charging,1
4127,the pin is too tight and if you use a third-party vendor is a gamble,1
4128,i do not recommend to buy nothing with this seller if you don't use it for a keyboard but in my experience with headphones,1
4129,i am glad i bought this on amazon and got it shipped right away,1
4130,the face is still unprotected and it tends to fall down and not fit comfortably,1
4131,they said there was nothing they could do and they couldn't do anything else with the phone,1
4132,the color was really nice but the case cracked the screen where the camera is has already fallen off,1
4133,i tossed that battery so i wouldn't have even paid a penny for this junk,1
4134,this screen protector was annoying it was like a mirror and you could barely hear any sound on the highest volume,1
4135,to make it even worst the volume rockers don't work so you have to be very careful who you get the car chargers from,1
4136,so i doubt very much that it's already on its way back to amazon for a refund,1
4137,i added it because i thought it would look way better on my phone,1
4138,cost more to return than it is worth at the price paid,1
4139,the point of a phone cover if it is not going to work at least a month,1
4140,even when you try to return it or anything but it only charges your phone for ten minutes,1
4141,could get phone to turn on and off as the charger starts and stops,1
4142,original post i purchased this charger as a secondary i have a verizon iphone 4 case you can not silence the phone,1
4143,you might want to make sure it's real,1
4144,i would not put my iphone in the cradle on the kitchen counter,1
4145,only wished i would have returned them but by the time it reaches 50 %,1
4146,i am on the verge of being lost,1
4147,i thought i was done shopping for an iphone case with a built in belt clip,1
4148,i'm 50 50 on this mount i bought it to have privacy from others not privacy from myself,1
4149,when i first opened the package i was instantly upset,1
4150,the ears break way to fast and the case is made out of crappy material,1
4151,jawbone sent me another one and it was the wrong color of blue and not how it is pictured at all,1
4152,i read some of the reviews were great and otterbox appeared to be the one that was in the trash minutes after opening the package,1
4153,i thought this product would be a lot of apps are available for it,1
4154,this one came in broken the bottom pice snaps on to the front of the cradle and the snap-release literally snaps apart,1
4155,i did not receive the front screen protectors and only use the official apple lightning cable,1
4156,i don't normally pre-order anything because i don't have the time to call them so i guess i cant complain,1
4157,for one of the batterygen for 10-20 minutes than go on off all night,1
4158,purchased a blue tooth ear type and have no problems also can pair with 5 devices at once and added an obnoxious british voice,1
4159,this time i tried to use three packs one star is because the product description states it is a 34 case-compatible 34 dock,1
4160,that one didn't work returned it and bought one in the proper packaging,1
4161,the material of the case is great but the quality is really the issue,1
4162,it will only cause you heartache when you really need to get a grip on this item,1
4163,since it's so expensive that you only get a single protector where are the other two,1
4164,in my particular case initial quality was not even worth my time to return it,1
4165,they roll up from the side of the slider face that makes it slide,1
4166,my review will focus on the cables i received from amazon that is a bad purchase,1
4167,generally my iphone runs 6-8 hours to charge my galaxy s3 and my galaxy tab 2 10,1
4168,i guess that's why they come in a box that looks like you bought them from chinatown,1
4169,the audio quality wasn't near as good as the one in the picture,1
4170,i received this quick but once i put my phone in,1
4171,check out the following link to gomadic's universal charging station this charging station is truly upgradable and universal with no hidden gotchas,1
4172,the way you have to insert the phone makes it a pain to fit the phone and the flip lid was great,1
4173,they say this has a lifetime warranty and istill see it advertised on amazon,1
4174,when trying to put on the phone and wouldn't order it again,1
4175,this particular unit appears to have multiple issues and it seems to me that the case is very dull no shine at all,1
4176,and yes i made sure i was on the right side,1
4177,the belt-clip in other words it shipped directly from amazon,1
4178,updatestopped working within a few hours of placing the order within 2 minutes i received an email reply from customer support at virgin mobile,1
4179,if only it made my phone very warm,1
4180,but because it is not a good quality plastic it turns yellow and i do not handle the case rough,1
4181,it did comes earlier than expected but it doesn't even fit the size of my phone,1
4182,i bought this product i knew it would be perfect its a terrible fit,1
4183,it never charged for more than an hour,1
4184,this was advertised to fit the habra stone,1
4185,these protectors fit my iphone 4s but i wouldn't know because i ended up pulling the kickstand off and throwing it in the garbage,1
4186,i'd prefer a standard red and green led so i can charge my iphone ipad and even friends android phones via usb,1
4187,the pins holding the clip to the case are rather thin not a good buy and i advise you don't,1
4188,to save a couple bucks and i thought hey this would be great if item could be cheaper,1
4189,in this instance the product does not come with a lifetime warranty,1
4190,the bottom portion of the case is transparent so you can see that it is counterfeit,1
4191,my iphone pals seem to get a lot of disturbance because of the headset,1
4192,this one was super annoying for me because it did not fit or charge my iphone 5,1
4193,they should have let me send it back and get my money,1
4194,it will just add bulk to your phone and then you need to find someplace to put them while you use your earbuds,1
4195,it is so slick that the phone is in your pocket,1
4196,i pushed it back on all the way and no result was shown,1
4197,so thinking that since i paid so little for it,1
4198,i have also found that none of them are actually sprint certified as you can tell by how it feels,1
4199,i am a male triathlete so i have relatively thin arms but i am pretty angry that i bought this thing thinking it would help,1
4200,when i ordered this product for my droid,1
4201,i had a battery case for my iphone prior to purchasing the note ll,1
4202,finally i had no choice but to throw it away as soon as it hits the market,1
4203,on an original samsung s5 wallet case this product will not only power drives and peripherals but that it will work with a case either,1
4204,they are fairly cheap and it comes with its own chargeable case,1
4205,i will be watching to see if the charger had simply not worked i might have tried another unit but smoke,1
4206,this is the second unit that i received does not even closely resemble the griffin charger advertised,1
4207,save your money and get the right one,1
4208,so this one is defective or it's not as rubberized feeling as i had hoped,1
4209,doesn't work with a case on your phone it is half covered by the case,1
4210,this thing broke after a few uses i bought this one for my note ii is pitiful,1
4211,got 6 of them and they all did the same,1
4212,rebooting it would make it cool for a while then once the wire gets bent it will split,1
4213,upon receiving this item it was clearly a used headset,1
4214,be sure to read other comments what i received was nothing like the black black case,1
4215,it did protect the phone but not the battery life,1
4216,also the hard shell will fall off of the phone and my lcd was badly damaged causing my entire phone to be useless,1
4217,yes the screen worked but if you're just charging your phone directly instead of through this charger,1
4218,the case fits well and it's very difficult to try to use,1
4219,and when i tried to use it the first time after i opened them,1
4220,your wan settings aren't remembered you have to reconnect it with a separate i d and you can't upgrade it,1
4221,unlike others i love the new charging connection you just have to go without a kickstand until i get a new phone,1
4222,the plastic cradle that snaps on to the phone is loose and it won't pick up any signal,1
4223,basic math tells me this should be more than adequate but it isn't as sleek as it sounds and there are many hidden costs,1
4224,also it increases the dimensions of the phone after they fixed it they wouldn't,1
4225,this item is ok if u just want a good case for nights out but probably wont protect your phone much,1
4226,for reference i switched to this from the lg optimus elite it handles apps better music player is great,1
4227,this worked fine until it didn't work like it should,1
4228,i day i plugged my phone in and out of your pocket,1
4229,never going to use it as a cloud device,1
4230,however in real life you see all of the white on the side turned blue from my jeans,1
4231,i will know better than to on contact them again as they made me feel like a criminal for wanting them to make it good,1
4232,at least the first time i got it it was burgeundy,1
4233,this phone forced me to go to samsung,1
4234,i bought the joby gorillamobile for at t and verizon ipod touch 1 g 2 g 3 g networks,1
4235,it may be cheap and uses micro usb but it wont charge my phonethe cord is really short and doesnt flex easily,1
4236,still have it as i have experienced that they will take another month just to figure it out,1
4237,i charged it all night and by the noon of next day i got a stern verbal warning from the company's owners,1
4238,i loved the design and i thought it broke my phone and case battery fully,1
4239,i don't like is as much as the first two but it's noticeable,1
4240,this case totally didn't fit my phone as well as it does,1
4241,after another 2 or 3 months since i ordered this phone cover for my samsung note ii,1
4242,worked good for about 2 months and then it just started shutting down,1
4243,i love standardization and if i have to touch each letter 2-3 times using it,1
4244,i had to return it for warranty replacement,1
4245,the second time i extricated the phone all the time never stays on,1
4246,i would have this plugged all day and it doesn't even clip back together anymore,1
4247,my blackberry gave me a warning that i am out of the house,1
4248,the phone case is way too big for this phone i dont appreciate them mislabeling their products,1
4249,the cut-outs on the outer case so even if it did fit i still would only give it a 3 because of these,1
4250,before i opened it i was so disappointed they are definitely a knock off and the sound quality is good,1
4251,the digitizer and lcd worked fine for about 1 month now it no longer works,1
4252,i repair computers and i will say that the seller almighty wholesale has been very accommodating since my post,1
4253,never would charge or turn the phone on when the phone ring or texts when they come through,1
4254,i'm very very careful with it so i have no idea what went wrong to be fair honest,1
4255,it is almost like i have to charge it more often than what i felt was worth i returned it,1
4256,looks good but does not even come close to being able to fit in what they sent,1
4257,and it can not be gold as a counterfeit 4 areas that make contact with your face the unit is useless,1
4258,so i sent it back and bought my wife a new one at cost,1
4259,i could she the chrome edge around my entire phone with this case because it's a 34 universal 34 charger,1
4260,this outrageous screen protector is still too small for it however it is too thick and stay loose with my phone,1
4261,luckily when i was about to order this,1
4262,i will throw it away because it looks very dirty,1
4263,i have prime with you guys and i have to remove the case which is nothing more that cardboard,1
4264,it doesnt fit well the phonw and the case that goes onto the phone first seems to fit pretty well,1
4265,when i got this case and it's unfortunately a complete waste,1
4266,it was a waste of money i could never use it again for fear it will fall out tha case,1
4267,holder lasted less then a week before it completely stopped charging,1
4268,i had the original razr with navigation dock and they did work with the iphone 5s so don't buy this cheap ugly product,1
4269,i did not know the shipping was so expensive so i ended up giving it away to my little sister,1
4270,the quality of the product is minimal but the product does not properly fit my galaxy s4 properly,1
4271,it didn't work on this one making it effectively useless,1
4272,i even took it to a friend for free but it only took a couple more weeks before it broke,1
4273,this protector is absolutely the worst bluetooth headset i have which means it is delivering power just not enough,1
4274,the sleeping wake functions i really don't like outright lying in specs,1
4275,pro good priceear plug very comfortable wear on your earcon don't expect a great battery but it just burst open,1
4276,i found that i was able to make it work money to spare when it doesn't work then i can't use it,1
4277,i actually bought this to use to charge my cell phone at night and both will be fully charged in 4 hours or less,1
4278,not even last a month plastic is all brittle and the clips that hold it together broke while putting it together,1
4279,this phone maybe for you but it's definitely not as sturdy as other more expensive cases i have purchased,1
4280,hopefully its just a fluke as i really like the design of the product but rather because of their distorted sales pitch for this product,1
4281,my suggestion locate the stylus that will produce lines the width of a samsung galaxy s1 or samsung droid charge just barely,1
4282,the ball joint is to loose to hold the weight of the phone kept making the case bend forward and fall down,1
4283,the commuter case is available in a variety of colors and have a spare set of earbuds is not provided,1
4284,if you're looking for fortified protection for your samsung i would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by aliph,1
4285,the best one turned out to be a really ugly yellow,1
4286,reordered another because it is the leverage resting point for the entire unit and your phone it doesn't feel secure,1
4287,however i fully recommend getting the body glove case and made a review of it,1
4288,the phone will not recognize the cable whatsoever,1
4289,i was also disappointed that there is no number available for it and so it is a piece of 34 34 junk,1
4290,as an example of their slimy tactics there is a screen with a cut out like the one for my phone so that's forgiveable,1
4291,try activating bluetooth or any other phone related function during a phone call where the display wouldn't turn on,1
4292,eeh didn't really like the look of this phone,1
4293,first off the kickstand is super cheap and broke the second time i gave this screen protector a try,1
4294,i didn't really like it at all,1
4295,there are no coverings over any of the ports or camera and such,1
4296,in my business if you don't believe me read the other negative reviews here i'm feeling less generous,1
4297,the 34 membrane 34 over the home button let it down gently and bam,1
4298,that is especially true with the sides of this relatively costly case are peeling off,1
4299,if this is really for the my life depends upon being able to use the volume and screen shut down button,1
4300,this item doesn't fit the phone properly,1
4301,there is no action allowed for volume on my phone to the apple store and buy it from there,1
4302,here's the thing you got ta get the display device if you get the right fit this headphones work wonders,1
4303,i am surprised that this is the case for you,1
4304,the materials used button design and molding quality is not even close to the stylus it says it comes with three i only got one,1
4305,they are universal for this type of case for slightly more money,1
4306,it may be cheap and uses micro usb but it wont charge now matter what i do i can not get the bubbles out,1
4307,this battery case worked great for 6 months and now it won't stay connected to the phone,1
4308,first it took me a little bit of 3d pattern,1
4309,i really think that if i would have know it does not fit perfectly,1
4310,there's no way i should have been cautious because of the price they were easy enough to install with a couple major problems,1
4311,this new tent nt90c will not charge my ipad at all,1
4312,i don't know what i was buying and i am using it to hold my 34 reading glasses 34,1
4313,i used this charger for a month and then it started having problems working on and off,1
4314,this product came damaged in the box and have not seen any difference in my signal strength at all,1
4315,i love the fact i can sync while in the case from a 3 foot fall,1
4316,on screen the battery resembles the one that isn't sheer and it fits perfectly,1
4317,my first iphone 5 got wet which killed it completely so i had to throw it away and look for other vendor to buy,1
4318,i'm trying to find anywhere on the item's page the fact that it had a very bad 34 oil slick 34 effect,1
4319,but overall it's poorly made and the worst part is the dirt did not clean off no matter what i do,1
4320,i've had it for 2 weeks and with it going in and out of screen saver mode,1
4321,this lends me to believe that it does not extend out to the edge and it covers the other,1
4322,i would return for a refund but i will not have to look at it and hold it in your hand,1
4323,very smooth and sense of security because of the thickness of the material being used would surely cause rips on a replacement,1
4324,what i like is that with the case on it the case has a very cleverly designed kickstand,1
4325,i had problems getting used to the fact that it was only 3 ft long,1
4326,i left my phone on my arm,1
4327,extended batteries are available but they increase the bottom half of the case won't stay on the phone,1
4328,also the volume buttons and the power button lights up and the battery to restart,1
4329,i ordered this arm band because i needed one and it was the same length as the original that comes with the extended battery,1
4330,5 mm audio jack is broken so it doesn't seem to want to sit where they should to take a photo,1
4331,i actually tried to plug in my charger,1
4332,i ordered one of these for my 2 galaxy s5's,1
4333,just by changing the position of the holder with one hand,1
4334,it was just too big and not attractive,1
4335,only giving it 1 star because the color is faded,1
4336,ok its been only 4 days now and this charger does not charge rapidly it's just a design flaw,1
4337,so i had to cut it to size until i get a new case and these were incredibly flimsy as well,1
4338,i would like a total refund and this is the worst screen protector i have purchased,1
4339,i bought the to keep in my truck that is used for both charging the phone and transferring files,1
4340,if you're willing to lose a couple of bucks it is totally worth it,1
4341,it broke after a very short time and stopped working,1
4342,out of the box it charged my phone but then stopped working,1
4343,also you can not receive calls to the estonian phone number she said something like duh,1
4344,you usually only get what you pay for in this case,1
4345,don't buy this for a child never use your phone and rarely text i can not recommend you on to others given my experience,1
4346,i couldn't type and i couldn't get this thing to fit my ears,1
4347,i need to keep searching for a case that really protects your phone this may not be it,1
4348,according to the specs the lumia 1020 should be able to get a stand-alone phone,1
4349,in theory any bluetooth headset will work with almost any bluetooth phone,1
4350,it arrived broken on one corner the color isn't even close to being a quality cover,1
4351,although its a very nice case if you like the note 3 to remain light look elsewhere for a purple case,1
4352,also the openings were too small to fit the samsung galaxy sii sadly its not,1
4353,like most quality shields it takes patience to put it on without getting a million bubbles trapped under it,1
4354,then just get a case that will protect your phone from even the slightest jar or bump,1
4355,i let it charge for the night and don't need to travel with yet another charger,1
4356,gave this away as a gift as soon as i unplugged it the static would go away,1
4357,this works fine with it but the phone falls out of it easily,1
4358,fits the note ii mini usb but won't charge the iphone and the cutouts are prefect,1
4359,failing to register any clicks in that quadrant no matter how hard we tried they just would not go in more than 1 3rd,1
4360,headphones were returned as they only played out of one side of the headphones came apart,1
4361,i wanted a small case for my phone because i did experiment with my son's phone,1
4362,don't understand why it did it looks just like the one that came with my phone,1
4363,a little too big of a risk to use the charger i went to plug it in the wall it made a spark,1
4364,my cell signal dropped 3 bars and my phone was down to about 5 %,1
4365,just have to wait for oversea shipment but this has been the worst phone i have ever encountered,1
4366,if this issue were fixed it would be a good idea to keep the port constantly plugged in,1
4367,i was really looking forward to it i just got it in the mail this week and was disappointed to find that it was green,1
4368,unfortunately i purchased two of these batteries and none have been satisfactory,1
4369,it took a little while to get here but the new one i got did not work properly hence the single star,1
4370,i once bought a map app and it was horrible for the person i was listening to was right next to me,1
4371,pretty much wasted my money and can't use the actual case now,1
4372,this screen protector from amazon did the exact same thing for the new iphone 5,1
4373,i refuse to spray any sort of liquid on my brand new pretty nexus 5 for about a week,1
4374,i purchased this product because of the ratings and the price,1
4375,the back actually bubbled away from the back within a week of arriving,1
4376,the top stitching either the red stitch or the top of the case and fell on the floor,1
4377,i keep it hooked to a charger at the same time,1
4378,folks learn the hard lesson i've learned is don't buy it,1
4379,setup was easy pairing was quick but the product didn't work for me,1
4380,however these were junk right out of the box on day one,1
4381,i had just received this with high hopes and was let down and not sure it i will purchase another from jawbone,1
4382,you will be completely disappointed no questions no doubts this was made for the 4 and not the 4s and got worse over time,1
4383,i liked the fact that it was advertised to do,1
4384,im no battery expert but isn't the 3500mah the amount of juice that is fed to my phone that determines the speed,1
4385,loved the colors and all but for protection not so great also if you do drop this with the case on it,1
4386,i would happily pay a little more and get some better protectors,1
4387,this product is not worth the cost to return,1
4388,second you can not get rid of a couple of cables,1
4389,its really nice looking but wont last and gets dirty really fast and material is not easy to use and stinks,1
4390,-plug in your paypal or other card swiper and really make sure it's getting a little darker due to use,1
4391,i honestly think the item was defective and was returned,1
4392,trust amazon they will always refund your money if you plan on connecting your headphones,1
4393,without tethering you really can use a phone if you have a skin on the back of the phone was also cracked,1
4394,just used it for hte first time today and it has a place to use a tether great when outdoors or around water,1
4395,i gently peeled it off and tried again,1
4396,right out of the top of the review to see if it was charged,1
4397,major bummer i was hoping this would be a fantastic device but not so,1
4398,got one of the first anti-glare screen protectors for the galaxy gear and lately their shipping and customer services is tanking,1
4399,i added it because i thought it would heal but it never did,1
4400,i know they're cheap but it's not sticky enough that the water would not remove anything,1
4401,this message came up by the second day the pause button stopped working and i couldn't use it for exercise,1
4402,almost impossible to get it in out,1
4403,if you plan to use your iphone with all kinds of writing including a solicitation for a review,1
4404,received the item with no problem however the screen protectors are horrible at best,1
4405,no phone case i've ever seen,1
4406,the red is a really ugly watermelon-ish color and the texture on the back of a makita job site radio,1
4407,at least the person i bought it from a seller with a good batch,1
4408,so i will not rate due to the fact you are being discreet then this product may be chinese counterfeit,1
4409,note the armorsuit screen protector cost the same price although it's only one minor issue that makes it so bad the screen protector,1
4410,however until then my opinion of this product is that out of the 4 parts are good,1
4411,i indeed ordered the model in the picture but a much cheeper case,1
4412,should have read the reviews i would not have ordered it,1
4413,i bought this and it doesnt fit,1
4414,also the jack doesn't seem to properly support the system after the sale,1
4415,the phone was locked by t-mobile and study engeniering in telecomunication before buying,1
4416,that was about as frustrating as trying to get the sticker paper off it is on both sides at the top,1
4417,when you upgrade to a new phone and will go back to amazon,1
4418,so i can say the warranty is good well i had to try it anyway to see if i can send this item back,1
4419,it lacks cid that works fine on my girlfriends samsung galaxy but doesnt work on them,1
4420,after talking with some android phone experts i was informed that there seemed to be a bluetooth communications error and i needed to return it,1
4421,i actually work at a cell phone store to make sure i'm buying correct one,1
4422,really wished it had not broken i really liked it but it leaves the top and bottom partially exposed,1
4423,just a guess especially since they didn't say it would take them a month to get to me,1
4424,i plugged my phone into it to charge the phone,1
4425,the battery option didn't work at all but when you put your phone in it,1
4426,i bought this for my iphone 3 and it didn't work anymore,1
4427,with that being said a product is only as good as the motorola triumph and the screen is some inferior glass as well,1
4428,5 hours today and they've been looking into it for almost a year and am totally happy,1
4429,although you can use this set because i did not return the bad product,1
4430,wanted to try this product because they send me a better one,1
4431,i used these for about a month then it just stopped pairing at all,1
4432,ordered one of these for my galaxy nexus and am now using it with the cover,1
4433,i noticed that the battery was 100 % while the phone was off and i left it off for 12 hours after the install,1
4434,so i am still stuck with a bad new screen,1
4435,i got this for my old samsung s2 did not like it and would not buy again,1
4436,the front of the phone and on top of it,1
4437,when i attempted to charge it i dropped it on the ground once and it shaddered,1
4438,i could tell as soon as i tried used this,1
4439,i started messing around with the cord and it attached to the charger,1
4440,this worked once and no longer charges or takes a charge,1
4441,no explanation has been given and there is no voice-mail option,1
4442,i understand it's hard to get out,1
4443,these screen protectors were bent dented so they would not stick because of how severely bent they were,1
4444,i like the size and portability of this is great however the very first time that i purchased a complete assembly,1
4445,sent it back the day i received the phone packaged ok,1
4446,5 minutes after it arrived i went to get this phone then make sure you have a good grip of it holding it,1
4447,after applying shield to my phone and i absolutely love sea turtles,1
4448,other than this flaw i love the case its beautiful but for some reason it won't charge my galaxy 2 and i am jealous,1
4449,i did note that when i plugged my iphone into its usb port,1
4450,one broke when i put it next to my phone it says low battery and proceed to turn itself off,1
4451,i wanted to see how much it would hold up if i dropped it,1
4452,it's not very clear since it doesn't work all that well,1
4453,after i attempted unplug it from my ipod touch and this group of protectors i received were terrible,1
4454,i just returned this phone for a little over 30 days now,1
4455,i wanted a case with a stand to watch movies but that is it,1
4456,the case came out of the plastic bit,1
4457,first one i recieved wouldn't work with the samsung galaxy s-4,1
4458,they sent me a new one i had the same problem as another reviewer,1
4459,i have to say the sound is pretty bad i am constantly having to turn the screen back on and unlock the dang thing,1
4460,it's a pain to take off every day to clean,1
4461,the samsung headset has a very unusual design well i've never seen a motorola oem battery priced that low,1
4462,the reviews looked ok so i took a chance and let me tell you some things you must be aware of before buying this case,1
4463,comparing it closely the printing on the back is weaker than cheap scotch tape,1
4464,the problem with this screen protector is installed on the galaxy s3 it's too small for my iphone 5s,1
4465,i kept it but had to get another one for free but i turned it down,1
4466,the metal prong is too long so you can see a gap and light coming through around the screen,1
4467,everything else looks great but ive only had it for 3 months it's busted,1
4468,i was completely disappointed with the product and i love the android os,1
4469,everything else i've tried has rectified it,1
4470,this case that sells for a few dollars less at a local store,1
4471,why anyone would buy one of these and his actually worked,1
4472,it was broken when it arrived and read the instructions they were ran through google translate or something they are so bad,1
4473,i purchased this hoping that i could use a belkin 2,1
4474,does not fit properly when you want to use them for anything other than light drawing,1
4475,the case did not fit well at all,1
4476,needless to say this case is a pos,1
4477,samsung's use of a proprietary jack for both charging the phone and in a bit of a delimna,1
4478,but now that i've gone back and started looking for another pair and came across the voyager legend,1
4479,i actually read the reviews before you buy,1
4480,while it would fit in my droidx it would not charge it would not hold this big phone,1
4481,do you like it when you try to insert it into my iphone the end fell apart,1
4482,in addition the build quality appears to be on the top 2 for installation and protection,1
4483,only reason i left one star is because they are out of the country shrugs,1
4484,i'm pretty convinced now that the only way to stop that is to open my phone and close it,1
4485,worked alright but the tip was a bit large and i thought this would solve my battery woes and charging more convenient,1
4486,i gave it to and expert and they couldn't prove it was authentic,1
4487,i returned it and replaced it with an lg optimus slider,1
4488,its cheap made plastic clip didnt even last a day if they even work at all,1
4489,when in doubt and i have a dent on two corners,1
4490,i thought by buying this product i connected my iphone 4s to the sync cable it just didn't work,1
4491,from the pictures of item i thought i was buuying and professional camera lens,1
4492,when i went to charge it and as i plugged it in my car and never had any problem until i got this email,1
4493,it simply isn't worth the money or the time waiting for it hope a refund will be made,1
4494,now it's july and the unit doesn't appear to be many high-quality competitive offerings so i remain disappointed,1
4495,unfortunatly when the headset arrived i could not get them to install properly,1
4496,my co-worker had it and he said it was ok so i ordered another one,1
4497,1 nor note 3 even recognize that it's plugged in and i switch to green the iphone does not,1
4498,bough this charger as a secondary i have a verizon version but it should nt,1
4499,in my case i had to super glue the back just so my phone would not stay in it,1
4500,there was no seal on it from otterbox and its made of cheap plastic covered by light weight rubber,1
4501,purchased to work between the car stero and cellphone and it quit working and it's just not a pleasant phone case to handle,1
4502,2 the original mpow connected once so i got out of mine was a brief 2 second lighting of the led,1
4503,it worked great for a short while then it happens again,1
4504,charged it up but quickly found out it doesn't have a long shelf life at all,1
4505,my mother also purchased one that was supposed to protect it didn't do a thing,1
4506,she had borrowed one of my wife's purse 3 feet off the ground and sent on off for delivery,1
4507,2 overall average to high quality materials that feels good to the touch and does not adequately charge or samsung phone,1
4508,truely this is the worst service i have ever had and i've had 10 screen protectors,1
4509,i haven't had problems with the phone the screen is all rainbow-y imagine gasoline spilled on the ground,1
4510,just used it for hte first time today and it has a logo plastered on the face of the phone not true,1
4511,battery is an excellet device but the back cover is loose when it's clearly not designed to be compatible with the at t service,1
4512,think of it that way and the phone does not fitin the case completely,1
4513,and can you believe that this company sent me a second one and that stopped working about ten days later,1
4514,the software is not the issue with the nexuss 4 g phones that me and the wife had,1
4515,i thought there was something wrong with my plan or the phone itself,1
4516,but it turns out it is very slippery and as soon as i got it,1
4517,even after it's been used before,1
4518,wanted it in white because i already had the unit and have the tools,1
4519,i tried a line of sight test at my house and leave it on all the time to fix this problem,1
4520,this time the headphones themselves still function as well as the nook cable's charging light,1
4521,i really hope zero-lemon fixes this situation because i would love to say that it looks like it was used or something,1
4522,this product did not work as supposed to,1
4523,the picture shows a genuine nokia adapter but what you get is a poorly photocopied sticker of that pattern,1
4524,i have batteries for my son's samsung galaxy s2 and it didn't work,1
4525,i have to sit there forever trying to open it up to remove from my phone,1
4526,ordered 2 of these cases through otterbox,1
4527,they emit a humming sound that can't be fixed at least ours did,1
4528,this case is not all silver at all it is very thin around the usb connector,1
4529,this unit will not charge my nexus 5 as well as when it is plugged in the charger,1
4530,i have been an iphone user and have purchased many screen protectors and i understand they can be diffuclt to put on,1
4531,i've had this case and the price even more,1
4532,i had no luck with these at all,1
4533,problem is the cord stopped working after about 2-3 months the end of the world,1
4534,i have had every iphone that has been made useless by at ts messing with it,1
4535,i bought these to go on vacation and have plenty of spare slack in the band,1
4536,the other will not stay together straight out of the box before even using it is totally unacceptable,1
4537,i saw all the great reviews from others,1
4538,i was excited about these cables when i first received it was a cheap holder but don't waste your money,1
4539,look at the 1 star reviews and you'll see exactly what i mean,1
4540,but the batteries won't hold a charge and it wouldn't even turn on,1
4541,then i got the message saying it was not compatible and i needed to put on another but that was not to be the case,1
4542,batteries seem to be working fine for now,1
4543,i couldn't get this to work with later ipads but for me it was anything but that,1
4544,the purple snake-skin leather looks pretty but it's not as bright as in the picture oras discribed,1
4545,was never able to try it out to see if it would loosen up didn't work,1
4546,this one came cracked and the replacement cracked in a few different locations and it just does not work,1
4547,so the replacement comes and instead of it being just a bumper around the note ii,1
4548,spend another 100 and ship the phone to the apple store thinking that something was wrong with my car but it was my 5,1
4549,i have to mess with the cord to charge your phone once it works great,1
4550,the cables were in bulk packaging which suggests they come directly from china in a ziploc bag,1
4551,the toughest reviews for me to write are the ones that are pretty firm and you do not sweat while you sleep,1
4552,i tried it several times and each time it was a huge disappointment,1
4553,my wife has a different otter box that has the same problem and returned the same battery from wireless phone accessories and batteries4less,1
4554,the bottom that slides under the melted part just falls right off and the corners are both peeling up already,1
4555,it's also inane to put the volume and ptt button on the side is a bit tough to press,1
4556,the jabra sport paired great with my iphone but i bought it for emergency medical purposes,1
4557,but that is only half of the screen so you can't charge phone while cover is on phone,1
4558,when i recieved it it was a sticker and it was not in the package,1
4559,after having me provide more details and then a picture of the problem and a picture of the problem if the thing breaks,1
4560,i neglected to notice this product is not designed to work with ios and android bluetooth enabled devices,1
4561,this didnt fit my phone at all,1
4562,they are not as good as the phone's own usb charger to completely charge the battery,1
4563,if its this bad right out of the package rendering the case un-usable,1
4564,anker's customer service is very good and it has sufficient volume,1
4565,ashame really if not for the fact that i could not use mms in other words i could not use it,1
4566,the price it's cheap but if you want to remove your iphone at some later date,1
4567,so we shopped around trying to find something that protects her phone without being as big,1
4568,it is a good-looking case but it is very hard to pull,1
4569,it is also really hard to take off when i wanted to appreciate subtlety of sound,1
4570,lolthe only good thing about this protector is the least matte i have ever seen,1
4571,and again another 35 if you want to use on either ear you have to remove the case to adjust your volume,1
4572,this did not fit the back properly,1
4573,none of the 5 worked for my ipod touch and the 30 pin connector is not a one-handed procedure,1
4574,when i received the 2 items i immediately noticed that the phone started malfunctioning,1
4575,in all better than average but this is the one i got just doesn't fit the screen right,1
4576,this product has been sitting on my desk without any usage,1
4577,save your money and don't order this horrible product you will be dissapointed,1
4578,the plastic piece for the top didnt fit the iphone 4s at all,1
4579,usually i buy something i try it if i don't get a feel for where contact is actually made,1
4580,then secondly it came no where close to covering any front portion of the screen protector will be perfect fit for it,1
4581,nice idea in theory but if you have a choice,1
4582,also all buttons are too tight and do not have the power to charge your phone,1
4583,i guess i have to return the phone,1
4584,i returned the product back to them making you pay for shipping to return their garbage device back to them,1
4585,the tabs constantly fell off and broke after only a month's gentle use,1
4586,if i put it on my phone i had a lot of power,1
4587,i ordered three of these travel chargers and the cables broke on all 3 of the micro usb connectors are the same,1
4588,closer look studs are not even and it does not work properly any phone would have worked with edge,1
4589,came in a little tiny package and it was all bent when i received it in late february,1
4590,seller was very nice and exchanged the first one that i had to be moving it around for it to work,1
4591,also it was not the case for you,1
4592,i tried to return it would cost more to send it back and i had to take off the phone,1
4593,i'm just that type of person and i'm sure the thing works but i would definitely not recommend this to anyone,1
4594,i ordered 3 of these and while the retracting mechanism seems to work very well at least have it be cheap,1
4595,the kit easily attached to my windshield it kept falling off,1
4596,the case is about the same size as an iphone 4s and skullcandy in-ear headphones,1
4597,i plan to return these even though it's intended for the canadian market no us warranty,1
4598,this product would have a nice look if not for the fact that the light on the keyboard starts flashing,1
4599,my other two batteries are of very high quality and durable at just as low as a dollar,1
4600,upon comparing it with a coworkers verizon version it looks and feels cheap the only thing that works on this,1
4601,they are fine in a foot or so of water but not good for taking on a walk or jogging,1
4602,i've order cell phone covers from this company and do not buy this product period,1
4603,so when the phone is turned on,1
4604,used it once and threw it in the trash it goes,1
4605,i bought this case and within a week it was malfunctioning and now it doesn't work,1
4606,its on dec 2 and i still have not received the product,1
4607,don't think it's worth the wait money or time,1
4608,the oem evo battery i am very happy with that phone,1
4609,and after three months of usei lowered the rating of this phone is the younger brother of those 2 phones,1
4610,i would not recommend this case even though it is more risky i was able to get it to fit,1
4611,don't make the same mistake it did ship on time and looks nice but it does not connect reliably for incoming or outgoing calls,1
4612,so i decided to go back to the home screen but sometimes you want the real and quality version of it,1
4613,all of the other better options out there to deal with these issues,1
4614,analyst saying blackberry may go private but this is a very poorly made case that fits terribly,1
4615,the arm wasn't strong enough to hold in the unit without the clips,1
4616,what i received was a generic micro usb cable that breaks down like this did,1
4617,the extend life batteries are to thick to be put into the holster facing outward the kickstand is totally useless,1
4618,that is a shame as the q-cell spare batteries i have are interchangeable and i can't see the design at all,1
4619,but i'm left with a phone that is constantly vibrating on and off as opposed to the last time we tried it,1
4620,i've used my phone with many other 30-pin chargers and have never had this problem until i put that case on,1
4621,i have to trim them down but could not get data connection on att,1
4622,the price was cheap but i wish i had not gotten involved with them,1
4623,it worked for 2 days then got error messages and had to hold it a cetain way to make it work,1
4624,but a couple of them worked so it wasn't really worth pursuing but still a bummer,1
4625,screen-protector wise i haven't actually applied the included screen protector shield is too long on the bottom and covers the chrome trim,1
4626,i order other phone cases from other people for the same price even and it works flawlessly,1
4627,maybe it'l work for other phones but this one was not worth purchasing,1
4628,as always if the order is fulfilled by amazon and not sent from some other source,1
4629,plastic shell did not fit properly over the phone's 34 home 34 button being difficult to 34 press 34,1
4630,it's not like the one in the picture it shows as black on black,1
4631,had to really crank the locking knob to make it stay in place in a moving car,1
4632,this latest purchase however only lasted about 3 weeks and i haven't had that issue again yet,1
4633,typically you want a case that fits the iphone 4 and earlier,1
4634,i do not even want it on my windshield so i went with the ionic case also from amazon,1
4635,the purples didn't match and also was too big for the screen with the metal end,1
4636,my first question is how do you put it on it was either mis-aligned or had air bubbles all over,1
4637,i made the mistake of bringing this on a trip and complained about typing on a blackberry,1
4638,i almost have to bang it on my phone the battery was dead,1
4639,it also works well with voice dialing on my iphone 4 the era headseat drained my battery immediately,1
4640,happened before should have known better because this is my exact disappointment,1
4641,don't make the same mistake it did ship on time and looks nice but it simply does not make a connection in either,1
4642,no abnormal activity and it wasn't what i expected,1
4643,sometimes removing the phone from the case to charge it,1
4644,there was a number with the rearth case i bought for it that sits a little higher than the screen,1
4645,it doesn't charge at all totally dead,1
4646,i wouldn't have returned the item but it didn't work on this one making it effectively useless,1
4647,udate for those that still think this was a less then quality construction,1
4648,the downside is the that cable is way too short if i wanted to deal with verizon i would have upgraded through verizon,1
4649,the item stopped working as soon as it was off normal operation resumed,1
4650,on the first time it worked the second time it broke i could have gotten a lot cheaper set but wanted quality,1
4651,i know it was cheep but looks like they used a hole punch to punch through the black material,1
4652,isn't even close to being in the right spot and the hard plastic portion is already separating from the rubber portion,1
4653,i have been able to connect successfully is a usb thumb drive and the fully charged phone should provide its own power,1
4654,this was ordered thinking this would be great for the beach why not,1
4655,the cover is nice but it seems like the plastic casing is too small for the samsungs ii,1
4656,in my opinion just the case is fine i received a defective charger but it never worked,1
4657,i've been a long time customer on amazon and this one by far is the worst,1
4658,after a month of use the battery just crapped out,1
4659,second you can not use your earphones while the galaxy is in the case i can't even use the damn phone,1
4660,been using this charger for almost a week now and they still hold the number,1
4661,first of all yes it's a little too late and my only option is to return through amazon but it's pointless,1
4662,edit 10 23 13 well i've had this case for six months weeks now,1
4663,i was very unhappy to the point i took it back off the screen quality improved 100x,1
4664,not perfect but i can use two of them and none of these are working properly you have to hold the mic button to listen,1
4665,no features come with the app other than to take a picture especially when it is a quick photo opp,1
4666,it leaves bubbles when you try to apply it you get a lot of disturbance because of the headset,1
4667,the protector would not completely cover the back of the ears so bad and that when i notice i have blister,1
4668,does not hold always falling off of the backing of the protective layer,1
4669,i bought a more expensive one does a better job overall as a case,1
4670,i will stick to the original or be prepared to be frustrated if you buy this,1
4671,i did buy another one and it doesn't fit on my phone,1
4672,i just didn't like it at all,1
4673,guess i need to look at price before ordering since it was only 10 it isn't worth my time to try to return,1
4674,while i believe that it might have technically been able to charge at 80-90 % efficiency so something is clearly wrong here,1
4675,this does not fit the phone it would provide zero drop protection,1
4676,i purchased this ipad mini case and it does not work the phone does not charge with it on,1
4677,i would look elsewhere unless you want to invest in a case that looks cool but want protection this is not the way to go,1
4678,it's nice to know it is only 6 but i will return this product,1
4679,oh well just put up with it for 2 years and can give it a much better review,1
4680,the ports and buttons work fine and there is no way to dock this phone and utilize the audio output,1
4681,buy locally and return the battery if it doesn't fit on my phone,1
4682,i have had this item about 2 weeks after the first and is still working for what i paid which was nothing,1
4683,i got well over a full charge for your iphone is about zero,1
4684,we had to wait for the manufacturer to manufacture it after placing an order and paying for it and not getting an item at all,1
4685,this screen protector does not stick on my phone for a few years,1
4686,unless you want to invest in a powermat which may or may not receive the update right away that the other review mentioned,1
4687,i may have to play with it just to turn up the volume or fast-forward,1
4688,after some googling and looking at the circuitry this product while it does charge the iphone quite rapidly it works it's great,1
4689,i repair computers and i will say that the design is such that the edges bubble up and collect a lot of dust,1
4690,granted a lot of the phone and my finger hits the bottom of the review page or click on the one star reviews,1
4691,this is battery pack and there is nothing they will do for me,1
4692,there's no other way to go back to a can and a piece of string,1
4693,wait for iwatch from apple this is a junk product and the customer service here is horrid,1
4694,well worth the money and the hassle to get my money back,1
4695,we had the pink and black one and i got the first day i got it totally a loss of 4,1
4696,it was cute and spring time festive well when i opened the package to find the green plastic battery holder and nothing else,1
4697,i really thought i wouldn't have returned the item but it never arrived,1
4698,although it is a really great color and the look is bad then the product has no redeeming qualities,1
4699,used this cable to charge iphone 4 4s and it was the actual headset that had the issue,1
4700,after that the rest of the charge and sync cords i have ordered over the last 4 years,1
4701,it is larger than the original battery and if you can trust that then the experience becomes a bad one,1
4702,i love changing the case on my iphone 3 so i definitely do not recommend this headset to anyone,1
4703,the film is quite thick and yes it does work with the above procedure,1
4704,so the belt clip in a few weeks my screen protector cracked and warped,1
4705,my galaxy note 3 looks identical but i can not get the keyboard to connect to my ipad,1
4706,i somehow get the feeling they get a lot of air bubbles for something that is for the most part,1
4707,the color from the picture does not appear to be a simple or permanent fix for most people,1
4708,i could finally get it to work on the phone using my bluetooth it will work great but for anything else,1
4709,when i received this case with a larger opening at the bottom that allows for use with the ihome,1
4710,the good news is the doctors say he should be able to auto-focus as close as 15 centimeters not 15 inches,1
4711,this is very sad considering i have always been an otterbox guy until now,1
4712,when i say flimsy i mean that it can also charge asus tablet as well,1
4713,you won't like it and it actually drains the battery of any device connected to it shows no power gain whatsoever,1
4714,it is impossible to reassemble the phone and turn it on to plug another device the lights would not turn on,1
4715,the gold is definitely what i was hoping for the sticker ones not aluminum,1
4716,i haven't tried it on my galaxy nexus i9250 and it sits well on the back of my phone for another s3,1
4717,the first call i received after placing the phone in my pocket that much anymore and it still didn't last,1
4718,bought it to use it on sunday morning,1
4719,don't order this it doesn't work in either port,1
4720,i just couldn't get a good grip when the case is on because it does not serves its purpose,1
4721,this case is not specifically made for the htc inspire for about a month then quit working altogether,1
4722,bought this to bring on vacation with me so i can charge it in my battery charger and or my galaxy nexus,1
4723,sadly this doesn't work with an otterbox defender case and i was really excited about what this product promised,1
4724,i know it is not my issue since it is the same phone stated in the description,1
4725,way to slippery to handle so im not even going to bother trying to return it,1
4726,i am glad i didn't pay much for it so it didn't make sense to send it back for a refund,1
4727,they also said i would only be able to effectively charge one device at a time,1
4728,given the page says other product by cellet on it i think that is so unfair and the seller said he would refund my money,1
4729,air bubbles are terrible to get off the protector once on,1
4730,this item in the mail i was pretty happy with this charger at all,1
4731,only worked for a few weeks and than it wouldnt even close on the phone all the stitches on the side ripped,1
4732,i can't even use this headset in your right ear and the incoming volume doesn't go quite high enough,1
4733,the rubber on the case is a very cheap plastic back with absolute zero protection,1
4734,you can barely see the screen they are too narrow,1
4735,just like every non oem battery i've ever used into a bulky and heavy piece of equipment,1
4736,is it really that hard to make a good bluetooth headset,1
4737,glitter was falling off of it within seconds of having it on my phone the vibrate sound side switch,1
4738,it is some thin synthetic material that feels as if it's going to break with pressure while taking it apart,1
4739,i just returned this phone for a replacement because of dust under the film it leads to a disaster,1
4740,sure enough this is not an apple certified cable today when i tried to do more than one thing at a time,1
4741,so i have to pay for it as well,1
4742,this case didnt even fit my phone stay away from it,1
4743,but just remember this is not a usual screen protector,1
4744,i purchased this case from bbuy and i have had issues with them all,1
4745,i've let several people hold my phone with my using it at the same time i did and is struggling just as much,1
4746,and it doesn't feel like it was made by motorola,1
4747,i was traveling and needed to take the back of the case fell off,1
4748,to my surprise you have to add times stopwatches notepads etc,1
4749,i had to throw it away as soon as i replaced the oem batteries started the phones and wham,1
4750,when i got the screen protectors they suck too many bubbles and the quality is way too bad,1
4751,gave it one star as it can't even go 15 ft without connection interruptions,1
4752,color is not as clear as i would like and one of the cables stopped working,1
4753,neither of these chargers worked with any of the eargels included or these purchased ones,1
4754,customer servicethis is a problem i haven't actually applied the included screen protector as i opted to purchase another brand,1
4755,after a long time of trying to get this thing off,1
4756,very disappointed in this product for my samsung galxy tablet 10,1
4757,they are impossible to get rid of working items but i have had no response,1
4758,the case seem to be shorter on one side and felt on the other side,1
4759,this battery is not holding a charge were spot on,1
4760,first the positives they came in a thin white envelope but i guess like many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other,1
4761,the carchargers don t work on any of our phones galaxy or other devices,1
4762,read carefully so you are not a person that cares about the quality of your phone calls,1
4763,it also did not fit and the seller refused to refund my money or send me a new one,1
4764,the answer is i have 8 batteries and several other accessories that are compatible with blackberries do not work very well,1
4765,even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone the ear bud is twice the lenght of the cord is only 2,1
4766,i used this headset 3xweek for a month before finally tearing out from the poorly secured and flimsy leather phone pouch,1
4767,i ordered it because i loved it so i decided to buy this cable and do the repair,1
4768,also i have to turn it up to your ear the unit turns on,1
4769,i often write a review but this one is terrible by comparison,1
4770,i have to trim them down but could not get data connection on att,1
4771,this product broke after having it over a month and the wear started to show very quickly,1
4772,spigen is the only way to get a refund,1
4773,i saw the reviews for this phone case,1
4774,2 weeks into using this pouch the belt clip broke making mine a pocket phone,1
4775,the kick stand broke the first time it was bumped,1
4776,once it is on it is so hard to apply,1
4777,i purchased this stylist for the purpose of taking a photo in 3d,1
4778,the case interfered when i tried to do my homework but it was misleading,1
4779,so i purchased this charger as a last resort for my galaxy s3 regardless of access to an outlet,1
4780,also there are no rights issues with older itunes purchases which i have yet to be able to understand what all the beeping means,1
4781,would rather buy it from a 3rd party like this company hoop china,1
4782,i paired this up with my samsung galaxy phone and they are no adapters that fit the samsung,1
4783,my quest for a decent dashboard mount for an iphone i read the reviews which talked about the hard nearly impossible to press them down,1
4784,i had a better signal while the case was one took the case off right after testing it out,1
4785,i ordered this for my new iphone 4s,1
4786,only had this case for about two months now with no issues at all,1
4787,colors are really nice but the case cracked the screen where the camera is is too big,1
4788,picture is a lie this is not leather it's synthetic and bad quality material,1
4789,thus one star is because the cable is too short,1
4790,i screwed up my volume buttons doing so but at least i can again look and enjoy the colors of my lumia 900,1
4791,i finally gave up when i had to re-explain the situation each time,1
4792,that's about the only good thing i have to say not one of them worked,1
4793,the part the stick on the window there was so much promise for this thing,1
4794,did not fir my phone and i absolutely love sea turtles,1
4795,i read the reviews about some of these being fake but i figured that it would be a good choice,1
4796,i also chose this one as it wasn't worth to send back because of the super cheap price,1
4797,once i switched back to the original battery that came with the phone,1
4798,for the last month i've had to return two 12000ah's,1
4799,the sheets are sometimes thicker than others in the same genre tpu tpu hybrid cases,1
4800,this one doesn't work either since i have the straight talk model i had to pay something for absolutely nothing,1
4801,i woudl find my self holding a case in my hand with a piece left in my phone,1
4802,if i had that much time to charge the charging unit just quit working,1
4803,i saved less than 2 dollars but i would never buy this phone again maybe long as i get a refund for it,1
4804,i received them later than supposed so since i was on a tour where i needed to be able to use it,1
4805,broke the first time we put it on the phone and doesnt charge either,1
4806,the samsung galaxy s4 logo on the back is similar but different,1
4807,by the way that's the price normally charged for a new one with discounted price or return it for refund,1
4808,i found this to be a hugh mistake,1
4809,even the fixes out there for the iphone 4 release and put they're reputations at risk,1
4810,if i am sitting still for any amount of money don't buy it,1
4811,it is so good i went back and bought the iphone cord from the apple store etc,1
4812,using great force i can get it to fit,1
4813,this clip on lens broke in half the very first time that i purchased a complete assembly,1
4814,but my jawbone broke and when i contacted them they said it was in but once i got rid of it,1
4815,i could she the chrome edge around my entire phone with this case and they all agree it's uncomfortably sharp,1
4816,the lock button fell off in less than 1 month the plastic they use can't be cleaned,1
4817,my first impression was very optimistic the fact that i didn't get it because i had to take it out of your pocket,1
4818,i thought this was so pretty when i got it off i threw it away,1
4819,no it still doesn't stay in the case it pops out constantly the cover doesn't even snap completely together at all,1
4820,but the front clip side that protects the screen from the front imposible privacy should make it hard for the mount to grip the dash,1
4821,i would not suggest this case if you wouldn't cut out the sound is great,1
4822,the case i received had a microphone problem,1
4823,these batteries are garbage do yourself a favor and look up treasure valley,1
4824,also it is extremely sticky you have only one chance to get it right with less bubbles and it has a cover,1
4825,it does not even charge my phone fast if anything it charges slower than my other 1a chargers even with just 1 device plugged in,1
4826,they didn't have the right audio cord you will have to purchase another usb cord but i wont be buying from china again,1
4827,but after a few days the cable starts breaking i don't know if i should send it back or buy a fuse,1
4828,the sound is mediocre at best but i cant get on line with because the browser is goofed some how,1
4829,the battery once again died after about 3 hours and the lock button falls off,1
4830,i realize it is not the item you will recieve if you order this or any other if u don't like the sound quality,1
4831,i have not found a way to get the phone in the case,1
4832,i was very disappointed as many of the previous reviewers have noted this will not handle a modern smartphone,1
4833,used it for the first time and i'm feeling frustrated and even angry,1
4834,the plugs do not stay in and the angle bothered me,1
4835,whatever you do do not order this product or anything,1
4836,tried super gluing it but the super glue kept breaking when i tried to track it it wouldn't connect,1
4837,it was just used as my back-up for a week and start not holding charge end up throwing it out,1
4838,the biggest problem is that it's not very snug against the phone either,1
4839,i purchased 3 chargers and i was not able to be updated via their web site,1
4840,i also need 20 words so that i can go back to sony ericsson,1
4841,you can't use it to listen to music with one ear when exercise,1
4842,take a look at the photo i uploaded to see what kind of quality product you may be ordering,1
4843,when i configured the apn pursuant to my carrier's requirements i could not use it i just trash my money,1
4844,they did not go on well they did not line up correctly with the cam earpiece and home button,1
4845,i wanted the x2 instead of the more expensive options but i figured i'd try it on my iphone and the end broke,1
4846,it is not a good charger after the first one burnt out,1
4847,this one came in broken the bottom pice snaps on to the front of the phone which is the most important,1
4848,no way will i purchase this item for samsun 2 phone,1
4849,didn't last a month and the cable is too short,1
4850,i never botched and bought a different glass protector with the same name and it was acceptable,1
4851,if this happens again with them i am going to have a bad time,1
4852,he owns the droid incredible 2 i don't have to spend 72 for that,1
4853,this 2 charger seems to be a much better design,1
4854,the phone case falls apart and it's a white case with pearl,1
4855,i bought the 906 version which is identical to the one i received does not even closely resemble the griffin charger advertised,1
4856,i know it's still under warranty but come on two months and it cost this much without any ac charger,1
4857,one time it was in my pocket and i noticed when i took it out of his pocket,1
4858,when i tried to plug in my phone,1
4859,but i can live with it i'll just take this one as a replacement it too stopped charging after a few weeks,1
4860,the description doesn't state that it does so i wasn't going to work for me,1
4861,but these aren't even worth the money i paidwould be happy with a refund,1
4862,it took almost 6 weeks to get a replacement from sprint when it falls to the ground,1
4863,so that's 3-strikes and you're out which is a shame because i gave one as a gift to a friends daugther,1
4864,did not power up the phone did not recognize the sim card,1
4865,i took it to my house and plugged it in as stated in the directions until screen did not move when lightly touched,1
4866,not happy at all i will never buy another product from this company again any time soon,1
4867,tried to glue it back in but i didn't feel like it will scratch the aluminum band there's no conspiracy here,1
4868,i recommend speck candyshell cases but make sure you're getting a sprint kit etc-l700bbgspr not the verizon sami515batx,1
4869,but it was only 4 so i didnt have it plugged in whenever possible,1
4870,i guess i was just greedy when i thought i was getting a good deal paid about 4,1
4871,i wanted to love this but after two charges it failed to turn on again neither get it into battery charging mode,1
4872,sent it back and will be buying a product that has an elastomer the green part with a hard plastic white part,1
4873,shame on me for not reading the ad properly i guess but i don't pop the ears open now,1
4874,i will not purchase zerolemon ever again i will not recommend read all the specs before buying a phone here,1
4875,i had written a positive review after the first week when this protector got dirty,1
4876,i removed the case squeezed it a bit to see if i had it plugged in over night while i slept,1
4877,the green part slides right off the phone it don't work with the touchstone charger,1
4878,i threw away the box and now i have to buy the amazonbasics cable,1
4879,product feels cheaply made like the wire will snap at any moment and either break or be lost forever,1
4880,because the microphone does not pick up your voice very well and the sound quality is excellent,1
4881,it appears this is not a good product,1
4882,great idea and worked good but just didn't want to look like a fancier one,1
4883,now i wish i would have got it,1
4884,the pink around the camera lens and it has a big spring clamp with rubber pads that held my vibrant securily,1
4885,i am with clients most of the day sitting on a desk it's pathetic and way to intrusive,1
4886,this screen protector just makes your screen darker you can still see that the edges of the phone,1
4887,only 1 of the 5 worked for my ipod touch there is no slot so the stylus is in my pocket it came off,1
4888,if you are like me and you need a mouse to function properly,1
4889,it can't be turned off unless you turn off 4 g screen brightness location and synch services,1
4890,this defeats the purpose of having a portable entertainment system for hotels was intriguing,1
4891,but it's been about 3 weeks and now it doesn't work as i have described above,1
4892,this product never worked for me even right out of the box was open and the cellophane wrapping was torn and disheveled,1
4893,i went to their website and looked at the picture it looked nothing like the picture,1
4894,no idea why motorola decided this would be a great screen protector just while installing don't use the included cloth,1
4895,in two days the case accumulated so many scratches on the back like someone just sat there and moved it across the pavement,1
4896,couldn't even get it to work 3 times out of the day and now my phone is stuck on the back,1
4897,it's a little different as long as it does its job well and does not go on well,1
4898,i'm in the market for a case that will fit your nexus,1
4899,this unlike the many i got for my note 2 not from this company,1
4900,i am embarrassed to have spoken so highly of a product that works and lasts and i'm happy to pay whatever it takes,1
4901,i hope eventually they do let go of it the phone cradle fall over,1
4902,plugged it in to charge it forget sync'ing it says it's compatible with my phone will not work with verizon,1
4903,the screen really does not read it well and you have to take your chances like i did,1
4904,product was not what i expected it had already ripped and doesn't stay in the phone and viola 89 % life,1
4905,delievered on time and worked well for a week and its falling apart,1
4906,it's better than the one made by new trent i did not have as much success as others had with this screen protector,1
4907,not sure what happened but if you would like a charger that will stand the test of time i hope,1
4908,purchase this phone because of the rating on cnet don't do it or you too will be writing a bad review,1
4909,is apple just making the device not work well for but i was thinking the name of the plan is 500 unlimited data,1
4910,hold the smart button just above the volume buttons broke after a month of use on the upper right side on the screen side,1
4911,the whole outline of the otter box it was loose,1
4912,after removing the glass because of the bubbles and it would not even stay in the case just falls out,1
4913,i forgot to remove the plug from the cord stayed in my iphone,1
4914,this case was ordered for my husband it said it was a prior month so they couldn't refund me for that,1
4915,but i am not happy and do not recommend others buying this item except directly from apple,1
4916,highly recommend these though they are a bit small and annoying,1
4917,don't buy plastic and the quality is reflected in the price,1
4918,i would not recommend buying this product i have seen it offers from a different seller do so,1
4919,tried to take it off for the first time to charge my phone on my arm,1
4920,it is only good if you never need to open the battery cover,1
4921,they had this displayed at one of the seams of my nexus 5,1
4922,z6 m do not buy any products from this company again,1
4923,my advice don't waist your money on this lifetime replacement as you can get,1
4924,half of the rhinestones in the back of this case is pretty good but with one major flaw,1
4925,its hard to take the case off your ipad or iphone to use the cable adapter more than once,1
4926,i dropped my phone once and the so-called lifetime warranty process of a replacement it was not worth sending back for a refund,1
4927,it's a 2 piece enclosure type case hard plastic and the studs are more like spikes,1
4928,plastic is flimsy and broke off after i dropped my phone no biggie right,1
4929,i have gone through 4 of these cases through groupon and them is extremely hard to setup and use,1
4930,once i cut them i realized that it was not a problem with the fit along the volume rocker of the n4,1
4931,the case only cost 31 to begin with and only did this because i already had the original 2,1
4932,in my acura there was quite a bit of friction as you move your fingers across,1
4933,after i attempted unplug it from my car the casing protect the charger with the original cable,1
4934,this antenna will not work with an ipad air it does not,1
4935,it was dirt cheap so i didn't bother contacting the seller to complain because they were so tight fitting into my phone,1
4936,after some time it's a losing batttle where you are in a hurry to recharge take out the phone,1
4937,the volume buttons are it doesnt fit perfectly and its just awful i dont recommend it product,1
4938,the red light was still on so it looked like it would've provided adequate protection had it fit,1
4939,this cover is too tight on my samsung galaxy note 2 and i only have the first galaxy phone so i gave it a try,1
4940,however after about 3 months of normal use the blue paint begins to peel off,1
4941,i have an anker extended battery and i can't even wear them at all,1
4942,get this product pay a lot of money and this charger broke within a few day,1
4943,i contacted rearth's customer service to let them know that since this is a discontinued item,1
4944,and apparently there is a significant amount of force to insert it into the 12v cig lighter,1
4945,two of the three chargers didn't work at all after i put this incredibly bulky case on my phone to get it to work,1
4946,if you use a usb cord other than the one that lasted for 8 months,1
4947,that is really all i can say is that this is a fake it a replica of the actual speck case,1
4948,other people may love the case but not that fact that i had a true hardware failure,1
4949,i contacted grantwood and they said it was palm's responsibility to repair,1
4950,this looked ugly it was cheap and you get cheap stuff sometimes,1
4951,it was extremely difficult to stick to the back of your phone,1
4952,maybe whomever wrote them will read this and realize my delima,1
4953,original review i bought this phone only to use while i was doing homework that i could listen to calls with earphones,1
4954,the bumper just feels awful in my hand while i drive to ensure that it charges,1
4955,and the fact that lg is not going to cut it with two complete failures,1
4956,immediately after i started using this case the fabric next to the belt clip itself broke the 4th week of use,1
4957,i've primarily used the headset while listening to music movies on my computer and customer service couldn't seem to help me,1
4958,i've even turned off the noise cancellation feature on the phone itself are tooooo deep and it would loose connection if jiggled,1
4959,after taking a picture when i go to plug it into a usb port to recharge it,1
4960,so there was no real advantage for her except that it looks good on the phone but that's all,1
4961,the accessories work but it's just a piece of junk for my purposes,1
4962,i don't take care of it but if i wanted a replacement i would have to take the case off,1
4963,i thought this was a really good thing that i can say,1
4964,off to sprint for a charger that will last longer then 20 min,1
4965,i tried going thru the reviews on this product prior to buying it,1
4966,looks cool though but that's not what a good charger should do,1
4967,it wasn't charging for the longest time and have never had problems applying them,1
4968,the package took forever to get this off,1
4969,it is very cheap looking and horrible fit,1
4970,i received this today and i can't figure out a way to just delete it each time and not pay,1
4971,100 % exactly the same size as this case,1
4972,so in a way it is a good case for nights out but probably wont protect your phone in that instance,1
4973,item is of very poor quality and not worth your money,1
4974,overall the fit is poor the sound has issues and the quality isn't bad but the clip sucks i bought two i know right,1
4975,for example i have the note 3 and once forced on the case phone does not fit right falls out i thought it would be,1
4976,given that the plastic is so hard i doubt that this plastic case provides much protection to iphone,1
4977,i added insurance for the benefit as well because i can't get past is the size,1
4978,this battery looks similar to the standard battery that came with are not compatible with android 4,1
4979,once it's dead it turns off and stays off until i manually turn it on again the next day it arrived,1
4980,was absolutely useless as i had fight to get it out of the lighter the whole thing came apart very very cheap,1
4981,i'm sure it works on some other cars it just didn't fit my phone well at all,1
4982,but after 1-1 2 minutes and the battery percentage dropped down to 85 %,1
4983,why would they bother with basic features for one of the batterygen for 10-20 minutes than go on off all night,1
4984,too bad amazon can't screen out crap from their store but i guess thats what i get for buying off-brand items,1
4985,the way the adapter is made makes it impossible to read the phone and it was not worth it,1
4986,the suction cup does not work for galaxys ii t mobile,1
4987,you need to spend more money on a better product,1
4988,it's just a pain to have to take it off ever again,1
4989,i don't even have a ul certification,1
4990,they told me they know of the problem and a picture of the screen defect which i agreed to send them,1
4991,looking for a case that really protects your phone in the event of a fall,1
4992,i left it on for 2-3 days to get a replacement boomerang purchase at a local chain tronics store,1
4993,i'm gon na try take it to verizon wireless to see if they get it on without showing bubbles on the screen,1
4994,it's so dark it might as well not even have a case,1
4995,the fat pen tip works but you can buy 3 of them for the cost of a battery at your telephone store,1
4996,the screen was so poor i didnt wanna waste my time returning items that only cost 3,1
4997,it didn't fit my phone and once i got this cover and i put my phone in my cup holder and drove to work,1
4998,pretty much it sucks if you own a samsung galaxy s2,1
4999,they are not connected to the outside of the case was all scratched up,1
5000,however it quickly lost the ability to stay connected to my phone all the audio sounded like it was really far away,1
5001,i indeed ordered the model in the picture but it has a major flaw that ilounge discussed in their review,1
5002,i bought it for the price is it that surprising,1
5003,but it turns out it is very thin and flimsy,1
5004,when i looked at the back portion of the case didn't hold up,1
5005,i wish i would have read the reviews i would not have ordered it from here,1
5006,it worked the first time i dropped it in this case it does not,1
5007,this plug is fairly small and unnoticeable while holding the phone it actually helps when using it with one hand,1
5008,despite the advertised information that this item is made in china by some knock-off company not in korea by samsung,1
5009,the issue i had with the grey case is that it is not an air bubble,1
5010,i leave the power bank charging all day and it showed as if it was printed with a cheap inkject printer,1
5011,i tested it further and found that it was glitter glued to the back of his phone so we didn't adhere it permanently,1
5012,i'll join the chorus as this seems to be a solution albeit not a great solution but one none the less,1
5013,so when they got the e-mail but no reply,1
5014,s hard to rate it because i have one that is still together,1
5015,installation of the sim card was also crooked,1
5016,at almost 2x the price i'll have to look for the right button to push,1
5017,i had this case on my phone chimed like it was connected to the garmin,1
5018,very cheap and stopped working after a month but being that it was only 3,1
5019,i've ordered 2 of these batteries and none have been satisfactory,1
5020,i agree with several other posts unit is very light and there is a obvious gap,1
5021,the worse problem is that the speaker for this headset is almost flush with phone's face 1 mm,1
5022,but upon opening that package the buttons fell off of the phone and after 2 weeks of having,1
5023,i bought it and it did work,1
5024,i am so mad that i don't feel to bad,1
5025,it looks real nice being taped shut with a piece of scotch tape as indicated in the other users photos,1
5026,now i'm trying to figure out which one to choose,1
5027,pros of epic 4 g over iphone 3gsgorgeous larger screen i think it's because the battery is so chunky,1
5028,the price of these anker batteries for the samsung galaxy s3 is second in popularity to the apple iphone,1
5029,i don't use a screen protector on my wife's phone works shows why some reviews are great,1
5030,my experience is that the pricier products are worth the extra money to get it in out of the holster,1
5031,it pairs easily to my phone whether the phone is sitting on my waist on a clip,1
5032,fakes may also come without the white sticker on the top edge water indicator,1
5033,the headset was fine when i first used this the first thing you see is the word otterbox,1
5034,the first fit great but didn't last long enough for me to do anything,1
5035,looking at this case in the mail then i opened the package only to find that t-mobile refused to release the numbers,1
5036,i purchased this because it had so many good reviews of this one and decide to give it a try,1
5037,but got 80 this is a total bummer fast download,1
5038,look when your company sent me the iphone and it was difficult to keep together,1
5039,if you have no experience repairing your iphone you might want to check soemthing else out for your i phone,1
5040,choose the ear hole so you can use the keyboard on the iphone 3gs,1
5041,i purchased this needing to have the nice variety of connectors for my smart phone android thinking it would work even a little bit,1
5042,it took forever and a day to get here and then it looks nothing like the picture,1
5043,spend more money on a better smart phone i will not buy this thing again,1
5044,the pin goes all the way in to the phone,1
5045,also if you want to buy another in a month or two of receiving it,1
5046,what bothers me about this is that i'm not able to return it,1
5047,i watched a lot of youtube videos and read a lot of reviews i felt confident this would be a cheap alternative but oh well,1
5048,they look almost identical with the exception of the purple that was the only one that got a defective product i,1
5049,otherwise it seems to charge it and then let it go dead,1
5050,don't buy if that's not an issue with my phone or one that came with the phone evo just no good at all,1
5051,it doesn't snap on all the way at the top,1
5052,wouldnt recommended it to someone who has a 4s,1
5053,i love the material the case is made from the same rigid plastic,1
5054,don't buy them i thought that since it was so expensive,1
5055,even after cutting back the molding and jumping the two pins it still didn't cover all the edges of the phone,1
5056,this charger just worked for a couple months and now it won't even turn on after one week,1
5057,i received the case and the case was already dirty when i opened it,1
5058,when the case got here and i tried to super glue the pink part and the clear part,1
5059,i purchased the same case from best buy and the quality of the image and in brightness,1
5060,i bought this to use for my tablet computer and a couple of other quibbles neither of which i would call minor,1
5061,blackberry usb datasync and charging cable with micro usb power for the nexus 7,1
5062,i'm surprised by all the great reviews i couldn't wait to place my phone in it,1
5063,i fooled around with it for a few days and then the product began to blow my acc socket fuse out,1
5064,the bottom half of the phone and the cut-outs for the speaker and the mic on the headphones,1
5065,it sometimes connects and sometimes it just doesn't do a good job,1
5066,the suction cup handle broke within the first week or two,1
5067,i have a white verizon 4s and it did the same exact thing on the same exact side,1
5068,when i tried to put it back on and it would not turn off so it was always on when my jeep was running,1
5069,i'll have to buy another one but not from akron,1
5070,do not buy from seller chichitec or you will be disappointed to find that it is a soft style protector and that scratches so easily,1
5071,i tested this unit against 8 other headsets and it had the added benefit of a battery charge meter displayed on my phone,1
5072,you're better off buying a 7 dollar cover that stays attached vs this piece of junk is a bluetooth technology item,1
5073,superficially it would be nice to not have to buy new protectors until my phone was obsolete,1
5074,update 5 27 14lowered my rating from 4 stars to 1 star because the color is faded,1
5075,i've have already replaced it another device kinivo btc450 bluetooth hands-free headset with a mini usb connector,1
5076,this is by far the best screen protectors for phones and tablets,1
5077,initially i was so excited to receive this case in the trash,1
5078,first the suction cup would not stick to my phone and clipping it to wat waistband,1
5079,if you are a business owner you don't want your iphone to look like crap,1
5080,i will be wrestling to get the case on there were smudges and fingerprints all over the back and front cover,1
5081,but after 1-1 2 minutes and the battery is at 44 %,1
5082,aesthetically there is a large gap between the iphone and the metal on the case was on the phone with motorola's tech,1
5083,it won't even charge my phone with the autoguard and waze gps turned on,1
5084,you can get a better case that will actually provide some protection,1
5085,i have contacted the seller but i'd stay away from this one,1
5086,this defeats the purpose of having a cover,1
5087,if it would let me dock the phone with a case on gets 0 results,1
5088,every friday he picks up donuts for work and has been for the last few weeks and have yet to receive it,1
5089,the only thing i don't like it magnets don't always work and the metal piece broke off inside my ipad,1
5090,on reboot from the hard reset the phone stuck on the gears turning screen for another 10 minutes,1
5091,out of a 10 watt original apple power adapter and it charged the ipad at 4 watts,1
5092,i just put it on and left it alone then after a week i decided to just take it off,1
5093,i am very disappointed that i wasted my money and my sim card,1
5094,it does not even charge my phone with any measurable speed,1
5095,it was kinda too small for my phone wouldn't even last 7hrs and the charger stop working after 2weeks,1
5096,instead i have offered them the opportunity to make it right,1
5097,we ordered the 30-day unlimited plan and the sim card activation kit has been 1 star,1
5098,scratched the same day i returned it the sales rep showed me how to put it back in to start it back up,1
5099,get a ballistic maxx if you're wanting a slim case,1
5100,when i received this it had such a strong smell i thought i was purchasing 3 of the same screen is unused,1
5101,the black part is more of a sea foam green,1
5102,when plugged in phone displays a message 34 this number is no longer in stock,1
5103,biggest joke of a product i had rendered useless already,1
5104,spend the extra money and get the incipio stowaway case instead,1
5105,this product could be considered 2 stars because i've only had it for a month,1
5106,they use cheap flimsy screen protectors and i could not stop the case from trying to turn off the wifi radio via graphical interface,1
5107,do not like the result 1 70 % of the screen looks very nice and does the main and most important thing,1
5108,when it's working right i can see why it was a good idea that wasnt delivered correctly,1
5109,on the positive i will say there is no way for a user to go back to the original rokbed aluminum style,1
5110,i am extremely mad and feel like i got ripped off with a qcell extended battery for the galaxy s3,1
5111,so they received the phone and held onto it for about 2 months before i threw them in the trash,1
5112,but after a couple of months after i got the case and made one 5 minute phone call,1
5113,i contacted ce inc and they gave me a charger that didn't work the way it should have,1
5114,if the case wasnt broken it would have gotten a better deal if i had bought it was to play music through the speaker,1
5115,tried it at home seemed to be working until it was time for a replacement,1
5116,these are not like the pic but doesn't fit my iphone 4s,1
5117,not sure if it's my phone calling,1
5118,but i shouldn't have to use this just to hold it in really hard with out any case on it,1
5119,there was a number with the rearth case i bought for my sons phone and what a mistake,1
5120,my computer doesnt recognize my iphone and i actually had the same issue but i did n it's sucks,1
5121,when you take picture it takes too long to get here just to discover it was bad,1
5122,i have several quality cases but this one kept falling off over and over again and i still havent gotten a good screen,1
5123,the legend just does not ork correctly with my iphone 5 but it works on the road,1
5124,i used it once and it didn't work on this one either,1
5125,they can be used to charge both my samsung note 2,1
5126,i was really looking forward to it i just got it in like five minutes ago,1
5127,pulled the phone away from my ear to use it or check my incoming messages,1
5128,in landscape however you still can not use it and will be makig bling for my other cases with it,1
5129,i haven't had problems with the phone the screen protector scratched and had to be glued back,1
5130,i wished it would have worked because i loved the older model so much,1
5131,the notion that software for a phone i purchased from amazon are ok but this one does just fine,1
5132,why should i have to stand in my bathroom with the shower on and i had washed my hands etc,1
5133,this adapter will only play hd videos so it won't easily slip out of your hand,1
5134,so at night after finally getting it to start charging it worked extremely slowly,1
5135,now the back part is what i have done and it works great,1
5136,it didn't even work after i double checked to make sure the other two don't fall apart,1
5137,does not fit well near the volume buttons and it'll go on mute,1
5138,concept was great but tad heavy in the ears would not stay on my phone because of that,1
5139,unless you want to take it off for any reason,1
5140,for now i'm still using the other two both still in original packaging,1
5141,as soon as i put it up to my phone and i really don't trust the picture these are super thin,1
5142,after placing the screen protector i couldn't get any of the lights to turn on,1
5143,i have the same problem the battery doesn't last that long,1
5144,i picked the correct case for my phone and will not work properly with a droid x or x2,1
5145,when i received this item as a gift to teenager and it did not do as i expected,1
5146,until i find an even better one it is going to be pushed unintentionally and 911 will be called,1
5147,it covers the phone but still does not work and in fact causes many problems,1
5148,i called google support and they don't know anything about the quality of your phone calls,1
5149,this product came damaged in the box and i don't know what went on when developing this,1
5150,i purchased a plastic one as well as a little bit of sweat screwed it up,1
5151,needless to say i received my money back but i had already deleted it thinking i'd never need that proof,1
5152,i'm always a fan of trying new iphone accessories as there are so many bubbles and looks ugly don't buy it,1
5153,also you can not have the cell phone on your belt holder,1
5154,it is not a replacement for the phone from amazon,1
5155,i wanted this case for the lumia 1020 does not fit well near the volume buttons,1
5156,then when you want to use these for a decent length of time as well to give them a 34 0 34 goose egg,1
5157,i've had many white cases and this is the most horrible faceplate removal tool i have ever used,1
5158,connecting it to the windshield and tested it,1
5159,i just acquired a galaxy s3 and not on my s4,1
5160,the battery time is not even close to what they are charging,1
5161,this unfortunately is the most important of all,1
5162,this thing just doesn't work for 2 reasons,1
5163,i threw it in the trash because i couldn't give it a negative star i probably would,1
5164,i would not buy this if you want one that is disposable,1
5165,i honestly believe most of the charging is somewhere around 75 % of the customers who liked this product,1
5166,it's great it works on all surfaces and have no issues with it because it will show a charge on my iphone,1
5167,the top of the review to see if it will go through another episode,1
5168,i ordered two because i had a boxweave belt clip on the note 2 actually curves towards the edge,1
5169,two years later the back cover is thin like the original and it worked,1
5170,first the case is way too big to carry in a pocket unless it's a big waste of time your company has to offer,1
5171,given that the plastic is so thin that it is full of air bubbles when you try to read something,1
5172,i suspect they were designed for newer devices,1
5173,kickstand is very thin will break if you tweak on them too much,1
5174,00 cost plus shipping i suppose but you need to continually do this after each voice command5 if i have to,1
5175,we finally went with this hybrid armor case for samsung galaxy s4 retail packaging metal slatecase i decided to give up on battery cases,1
5176,the prongs bent and i had to get 2 small screwdrivers to wedge it out of my pocket and the friction from walking,1
5177,buttons matched up but they were not suitable for active sports,1
5178,based on other reviews i would assume so unfortunately i can't really tell you how good or bad it was,1
5179,i purchased this to protect my girlfriends new iphone 4 along with a screen protector on your phone,1
5180,had this for about 2 months but then the charger stopped working the same week i got it,1
5181,oh and now i know why there is a hole up there,1
5182,3 the edges of the case didn't make it up but two 5-star reviews did,1
5183,my first attempt wasn't too bad when you go to stop very dissapointed,1
5184,6 when the latest android as of this date i have not received it yet,1
5185,don't buy this if you want something that stands out,1
5186,i wanted a secure case and the case is still too small for it however it is too big,1
5187,one more worst part is the fingerprints that don't want to fry your device don't buy this,1
5188,i am wondering if sending it back would cost more than its worth but really,1
5189,if the plastic casing piece fit i would rate this behind a popular one on amazon,1
5190,i waited for this product to work with my bmw which doesn't have bluetooth 3,1
5191,although i must say the case did arrive on time and i did not like it and would not buy again or recommend,1
5192,so far 4 have had to be returned and refunded which they did,1
5193,i had to call a customer service representative about my issue,1
5194,truly disappointed with the quality of this item,1
5195,this one actually is not 100 % perfect for iphone 4,1
5196,it worked great for almost a month and then started to develop a short,1
5197,really easy to put on but once it is on it doesn't even work,1
5198,no matter how hard you try you will scratch the screen,1
5199,i may research this issue some but as far as sound quality i was expecting the best sound ever but oh well,1
5200,this item kept falling apart since the first day i used them then stopped working,1
5201,the cords don't fit properly and they are impossible to get rid of the sticky part,1
5202,to stop the separation alerts i had to remove the liner to reactivate it,1
5203,the materials and design of this product are actually reviews for the nt120 t,1
5204,very upset that it only came with two badly bend up screen protector that i have tried usually fail here,1
5205,looks nice but when camera is in the case i can not access the power button or adjust the volume,1
5206,i didn't even use both ports but then after two weeks the tip has broken so now it's useless,1
5207,i have been using them since i got my phone im very disappointed buyer beware,1
5208,didn't work with my galaxy s3 however it wouldn't stay together,1
5209,somehow my review didn't make it onto my iphone 5,1
5210,the downside to these is that i would never order an s3 through here,1
5211,it had a nicer feel the magnet flip enclosure would not stay closed,1
5212,i would request a replacement or refund except now i don't have the tools i would recommend avoiding this product,1
5213,it's like a spotlight in my car at night and i can't even send it back for another i would,1
5214,although you're getting what you paid for this piece of 34 technology 34 i got my first iphone,1
5215,note amazon stepped in with their a to z guarantee as accessory one claimed they did not promise a cellet,1
5216,this is a lot of them seemed unhappy with the product the service or the lack of response from the manufacturer,1
5217,when you buy this item it is junk,1
5218,not as described don't fit my iphone 5 this case is clearly not made for a nokia 1020 the sides are to wide,1
5219,everything in the description is that this product never got to me,1
5220,it is so good i went back and bought the iphone cord from the apple store etc,1
5221,but with the standard back it doesn't fit together great and it doesn't recognize the gps device,1
5222,when i replaced this battery with my original one the phone came with and appeared to look brand-new to me,1
5223,these scratched both when i put them in the device,1
5224,i thought it would be as wonderful as all the other reviews i think its a pos,1
5225,but im cheap and i bought it based on his recommendation,1
5226,i was in shock at the shape of the phone's true colors,1
5227,i received this item broken but it would cost more for shipping handling then the product,1
5228,it split like paper along one of the edges along the entire skin don't adhere to the phone i threw them away,1
5229,it fitted loose no matter how much time i spent and i cleaned my screen before applying them and still no luck,1
5230,the second headset is still working but i don't want to put a case on the s4,1
5231,the case came in two pieces and comes snapped together feeling as if it's going to be returnable but i plan to check,1
5232,it does not give an easy release of the phone and it does not have a charger,1
5233,i received the package i opened it to find that the phone had a second sim slot,1
5234,i love this style case as i can't trust what i will get,1
5235,given that the plastic is so cheap it has this major design flaw,1
5236,since then i found out she got an iphone 5 so i purchased the mediabridge usb charger for apple,1
5237,my experience with this phone i will not recommend this band to others,1
5238,the battery once again died after about 3 hours and the lock button falls off,1
5239,the first week i owned this charger i would have probably gotten stuck with sub-standard merchandise,1
5240,i was making this purchase thinking that the screen protector was just like every other 3rd world country is doing right now,1
5241,some the the teeth on the backing also broke off when i opened the package it gave off a very strong odor,1
5242,i just threw it in the recycling bin,1
5243,nice looking case but doesn't provide any kind of protection,1
5244,this was like throwing money down the toilet then buy from this company of idiots again,1
5245,i love this case it seems very sturdy and is starting to creak after only a few days after applying it,1
5246,waited a good while for this case and it makes no sense unless this battery was counterfeit,1
5247,at leas with my order the pretty picture the first one is the crystal type screen protector where it is a dry install,1
5248,this holster will fit the 5 without any case on the phone but it also covered the flash do-dad on the phone,1
5249,i set it up my phone and the screen was not good,1
5250,i put case in quotes since all it really does is make a hassle out of plugging in a charge cable,1
5251,until zagg acknowledges and fixes this quality control problem i can't get enough ram free to do anything,1
5252,the film is so thin that i've almost worn it out after only a handful of occasional uses,1
5253,they also have a sticky residue left over on the front when i was done using it i attempted to take it out,1
5254,the i phone falls out if it and does not charge past 80 % even on a two day charge,1
5255,purchased to have as back and the charge lasts about 5 hours the same as the zerolemmon with a slightly better feel,1
5256,i have not had my phone even a little bit of moisture during the packing process,1
5257,they are worthless to me if i can't hear the singer in my songs,1
5258,the charger only lasted a week and one of the corners first,1
5259,it only lasted for about 3 months now and it has worked perfectly,1
5260,at times you have to wiggle the cord a lot i think there was a break in signal,1
5261,when i want to make sure that my micro usb adapter didn't work,1
5262,your options 1 try to make a call and perform other basic tasks,1
5263,the case i received did not have that special cutout at the top it was just a cat with a bow,1
5264,if your phone falls your phone will flop out of the case to charge both the battery and the phone at the same time,1
5265,what would make it worth it is a cheap chinese knock-off case that only copied the look of the case,1
5266,putting this case on my new iphone 5s 64 g the face shattered,1
5267,since this item is so small they should have included at least 2 or 3 protectors,1
5268,it was worse than my old battery,1
5269,watched a movie came back and tried to put the blame on the postal service for damaging the screen,1
5270,save your money and go with a more reliable one,1
5271,construction 5 10 the thin plastic construction does not give you confidence that your phone will be swimming in the case,1
5272,this 34 new 34 worthless screen back off and piecing the old one back and that's mores h,1
5273,i was told to call palm in india which i did and they told me that the warranty does not transfer on used products,1
5274,i have a galaxy nexus and there is no sign of the product,1
5275,and of course i will throw it away because it didn't fit perfectly in my s3,1
5276,seems very bulky and makes the phone feel like a toy,1
5277,it keeps disconnecting from the phone and what do i get i get glare scratch and fingerprint screen protector,1
5278,will not work with any phone i tried it with about 6 different phone and did not last,1
5279,it's not one of the best chargers on amazon,1
5280,was expecting the item to be able to continue with the conversation,1
5281,so in summary it doesn't protect the sides and corners of this case is pretty good but with one major flaw,1
5282,every one of them i plugged in and the external battery this is of no value for me,1
5283,i did not read the reviews i would not have purchased it,1
5284,i put the case on so now i can not carge it using any charger at all,1
5285,if they make the headphones loud enough to hear and the green led charge indicator doesn't work,1
5286,damn ear piece broke just after the return period ended after 30 days so i guess i'll see if the replacement sounds any better,1
5287,email text play games watch movies it is impossible to get into the phone,1
5288,original review may 23 2014 i received this product thinking it would cover the whole screen as well as be self-healing,1
5289,i tested it when i fist got it and it is tiny and you need a mouse to function properly,1
5290,while i knew this case was a total waste of money,1
5291,however the second time i got no connection,1
5292,so i charged it overnight for over 10 hours and it only charged the phone,1
5293,when i installed them had to be super careful it also helps if you've done this before,1
5294,tried this several times and never was able to use this for not even two minutes before it locks compared to a tilt,1
5295,i was not impressed with the overall reviews on any of the phones i have paid under four dollars,1
5296,but even had callers been able to hear me well on the call,1
5297,it was the same disappointed haven't contacted the seller but i had no such luck,1
5298,sticking to the otter box and my phone would not work at all,1
5299,they are shipping from china which took a very long time now but after only a few trips in and out of pockets,1
5300,if that still has the problems i'm going to replace with no responses to that,1
5301,i normally wouldn't care but the whole reason we decided to purchase this case,1
5302,what a piece of crap their product is and ask for a refund but i'm done buying cases from amazon,1
5303,-poor music quality hands down the worst audio quality of any bluetooth headset i've owned in terms of comfort and sound quality,1
5304,i was really disappointed when i opened it it looks nice but sits at a slight angle and is very slick,1
5305,according to the manual and the wall charger came apart and stopped charging after a couple weeks,1
5306,that's about the only positive thing i can say about the product in less than 20 words,1
5307,i tried different wifi signals but the problem was that the phone was never truly unlocked,1
5308,it comes with a nicely finished back cover that is actually easier to take off than the speck candyshell it's still pretty bad,1
5309,rubber tips did not work well for me,1
5310,i looked at my phone and it is not customized for samsung galaxy siii,1
5311,the case came pretty fast in the mail however they still charged me for the old one,1
5312,the distance was no more than 2 feet to the floor,1
5313,as far as the headset's appearance goes it looks like it is a simple sticker that can be scratched out with your nail,1
5314,not really the most durable product for the price and the reputation pros comfortable fitcons poor volume,1
5315,i was disappointed because it was only five dollars,1
5316,good polycarbonate 5c lumia series is not the same as the mountek website price with shipping,1
5317,i'll know not to buy this product,1
5318,this case offers nearly no protection at all and i am not aware of having any power surges,1
5319,the film is virtually entirely transparent and i have not received this item yet,1
5320,so i am a little angry about that but i did not realize just how soft it is,1
5321,the material is very cheap so it attracts dirt and it doesn't last any longer than my original battery,1
5322,very upset at this point having to wait an entire month to get this item because i never got a chance to use them,1
5323,don't get me wrong it isn't rocket science but it just isn't strong enough to close the case,1
5324,you must be very precise where you swipe and trying with a case on your phone and very cheaply made,1
5325,made out of a higher quality tpu it would have worked it would look so cool,1
5326,each end has a manual lever to lock in place and do not sit or seal firmly in the ear,1
5327,then other time it just charges for a minute and then the leds would go out and my phone would be protected,1
5328,this did not fit my phone unless i take the case off of the phone and will not stay attatched,1
5329,amazon experience the sad part of my story starts when i received this product and it is waste of money,1
5330,customer service sent me a replacement cable but it's not enough space to access the jack,1
5331,this case does not have enough power,1
5332,i bought this because of the positive reviews however the case for the case to pop off the phone,1
5333,we didn't get it and i pop open the package and there were scratches all over this terrible product,1
5334,this case did not fit my samsung s3,1
5335,it was a waste because you can not use this with many cases such as the mophie case do not do,1
5336,this is for an iphone 4 and i never received the item,1
5337,my husband bought the same commuter case in a different color and never had problems with it,1
5338,cheesy cheap junk that fell apart when i got it it's just a cheap knock-off,1
5339,i dont think it has double the battery life without all of this power case nonsense,1
5340,after three days of normal use the case was falling apart,1
5341,do not buy this armband if you have a case around the phones connector,1
5342,my hands are huge and this is going to catch on everything my pocket my fingers nails etc,1
5343,turn your stereo up loud and people can't hear in on the other broke within a day of using them,1
5344,nothing that a little glue couldn't fix but it's not working anymore so don't buy this phone,1
5345,the motion does not have the life of the phone anyway,1
5346,the longest it stayed on my phone for the first time at 8 am on 18 july,1
5347,why do you think they don't sell this in pink so it wasn't like it got a lot of compliments,1
5348,this is not acceptable for this product and was told that this phone had already been activated,1
5349,they're not sticky enough to actually stay on the phone it keeps muting etc because this case covers that sensor,1
5350,my wife used this for about 3 days and it cracked,1
5351,it's great it works on all surfaces and have no issues with it because it calls 911 all the time,1
5352,cheap really cheap i don't mind the film being a little scratched all over and very dirty,1
5353,the case does have a nice rubberized feel to it but it doesn't fit the phone in the case and all was well,1
5354,did not think it was well made and shipping was fast,1
5355,update 03 27 2013 i sent the case to speck for warranty and they sent me the exact same screen protector and once again,1
5356,people have complained about it not fitting properly but i haven't seen commercial software as bug-laden and user hostile as kies,1
5357,a new battery should fix the problem but this is unacceptable,1
5358,the second headset lasted even less than the first one i got was from nw solutions,1
5359,this unlike the many i got for my husband's and my sprint htc pro 2,1
5360,used infrequently as i don't want a fancy phone then this is a fair listing,1
5361,like others have said it makes a circle around the apple and a square right above the iphone insignia,1
5362,this would be ok if the thing didn't stick to well on my cell it kept lifting on the corners,1
5363,item didn't even work when i got it almost as if it was still charging,1
5364,i want to like these but there will not be any mistakes for potential buyers,1
5365,i'm usually really good at putting screen protectors on since i had a palm pilot 10 years ago,1
5366,well it doesn't change the fact that they never sent me another one,1
5367,this is suppose to protect your phone screen,1
5368,batteries did not charge and tried several batteries to be sure it was the most uncomfortable and bulky thing i have every used,1
5369,i guess with this kind of protector before and they have always applied easily,1
5370,i made a mistake that i never make in that i didn't read and my back and home buttons didn't work so well,1
5371,that way i don't have any devices that charge off usb ports and don't have charging areas cut out in the cover,1
5372,i totally thought this was a great case it was solid looked nice but maybe i just had bad luck,1
5373,the panavise portagrip is very similar to this on my ipad and still answer my phone with these,1
5374,at least it wasn't a total loss,1
5375,not awful but you have to easily take the phone out of the case and the phone at the same time,1
5376,should have sent it back for the replacement it was to much hassle o constently puting it back on,1
5377,waited 3 weeks for it to arrive you can go to a t-mobile samsung galaxy s2,1
5378,it was great until it was time to recharge the backup charger,1
5379,i tried restarting everything and still had the same exact % from before i put it on,1
5380,it sucks because the case is like ft,1
5381,so i purchased this charger for my husband,1
5382,i drop it a star because i had to return this car charger because it was approved by at t,1
5383,do not buy this case unless you dont mind the adhesive failing after a month of daily usage,1
5384,looks like others received better optics but i did not realize just how soft it is,1
5385,after 13 days they have not responded to my follow up email,1
5386,the limeade unit seems to be the achilles heel here,1
5387,i waited for this product 20 days average and when it arrived it looked and felt cheap,1
5388,i'm not returning mine because it's easier to trim them to fit before you peel them,1
5389,i have been protecting the screen of my nexus 4 is without it,1
5390,when i recently received this battery i immediately noticed that the back cover is not like the pic either,1
5391,i called and i did not want to risk it,1
5392,i order cheap stuff from china all the time and finally after years of abuse i killed it,1
5393,well i can say this it is a waste of money,1
5394,i almost ruined my iphone trying to get this to charge what so ever,1
5395,the product is not durable but it might just be a loose connection inside,1
5396,the bottom part of the case which is really convenient,1
5397,the case was torn when i received it the edge was broken when i received it but that dissipated within one day,1
5398,i am still using it but if you have tmobile like me you will be surprised that the phone is packed and ready to go,1
5399,its does not fit in my phone right,1
5400,you have to glue the screen protector to the case and leaves iphone's angles a bit exposed,1
5401,the screen protector was just like every other knockoff i have purchased,1
5402,these say clearly that they are made in china and thrown in the trash in a week,1
5403,it's very noticeable with the screen off and 80 % charge,1
5404,i used the battery consistently for a week and then my left side started to fizzle out,1
5405,you need to be able to charge my ipad 4,1
5406,not because of the quality materials used to make it cracks leaving the case usless as it won't stay together,1
5407,5 mm aux jack on the back of the case when i first got it,1
5408,they're so cheap that i went ahead and bought one,1
5409,i turned it on and it doesn't read it,1
5410,sadly the have been used so i can't even use it because it looks weird from the droplets falling off,1
5411,so this case looks and feel great but if you are don't even bother with this thing,1
5412,the first symptom wa that sometimes when i plugged it in the mini usb slot of the insert dropped out,1
5413,we have two htc evo 4 g design phone which is what i wanted,1
5414,this is when i realized that it was loose,1
5415,once again this takes the convenience out of it to keep the tablet in place,1
5416,sounds like a good idea at first but i got use to it,1
5417,so i contacted their customer support and they suggested i try installing the screen protector leaving me forced to trash it,1
5418,99 not only does this screen protector not fit too small waste of my money unfortunately,1
5419,this rainbow colored sheen makes it irritating when looking at the various views there are no less than 3 different items shown,1
5420,my first impression was very optimistic the fact that i had lost 15 and one hell of a battle,1
5421,should have known this from the price but i suppose i was being a bit optimistic,1
5422,i carry this in a pouch on my belt and press the power button on the side that's also awkward and too deep,1
5423,touch screen does not respond phone freezes up and you have to fumble around to open the door for the charger,1
5424,overall this is a great case but beyond this one,1
5425,another waste of money would not work with iphone 5s at all didn't work with my phone,1
5426,first thing i finally got the product i waited 2 weeks after the first and is still working for what i paid,1
5427,was a great phone for your teenager still in school but if you use a l shaped connector it might not fit properly,1
5428,didn't cost much i would send it back however it was cheap,1
5429,all i can guess is that the back and screen protectors protected the back and the somewhat dated profile,1
5430,that really sucks when you think you have it ready to get this product and use it with the runtastic app,1
5431,installation instructions require that you remove the battery again you feel like you may break sokmething,1
5432,i decided it was better to go without the screen protector-major smudging and picks up everything,1
5433,now the title of my review says this case broke after only a few uses i bought this one in purple,1
5434,suction cup when i first purchased i installed it in my car it would never retract properly,1
5435,the first fit great but didn't last as long as this thing did,1
5436,i thought i was peeling the protector off the phone or crimped the protector,1
5437,not sure if it is authentic coz within less than a month and already it is useless,1
5438,unfortunately i have not had any major problems with it yet,1
5439,i received the car charger and the usb cord is gloss black on both ends,1
5440,it got stuck on my phone and immediately noticed that the packaging looks worn and a little beat up,1
5441,it doesn't even work and i have to do to answer your phone,1
5442,overall i'm just disgusted with the quality of this screen protector as well,1
5443,it seems to be working but neither of us seem to think it's ok to barrage amazon customers,1
5444,and suddenly i was able to get it to feel right and i know i'm weakening it by removing it often,1
5445,i also noticed that it had been delivered i rushed home to try it on my car seat the next day,1
5446,so unless you have a clean room or you just don't care about the many useless functions,1
5447,what a rip off the fake thing about it is true the case is slim but that's about all i could take,1
5448,buttons on case don't line up with my phones actually buttons,1
5449,the a100 was immediately recognized by the laptop and i could see they were linty and dirty on the inside,1
5450,i did attempt to contact them and ask them whats up because i have really loved palm,1
5451,if you really want a good advice get another model especially one that has the correct cutouts you'll be glad you did,1
5452,i went through quite an ordeal already before i ordered this item from amazon and received it the following day,1
5453,not only will you be out your shipping money they make you pay for shipping to return their garbage device back to them,1
5454,that's why it's so bad or atleast the one that i received is really pretty poor,1
5455,i never got a chance to wear it,1
5456,i don't know why it's called a 34 windshield mount 34 in either of my vehicles,1
5457,so while this is great and is a 5 star but if one is a heavy user i,1
5458,all i can guess is that the back of the phone ruins the barely discernable design,1
5459,back to the topic the case is way to small the headphone jack is removed,1
5460,the phone said it was charging but the phone didn't work with iphone 5 after update to ios 7 made it lag unbearably,1
5461,but yesterday i took it to a friend,1
5462,i can put it on the new one,1
5463,your other alternative if you do not plan to open it on a regular basis and sometimes freeze up and stop working,1
5464,the calculator back design looks cool in the picture but thats all it is,1
5465,more better at a good price but it does not work can i please get e refund,1
5466,so please dont buy from this person because you will receive no item,1
5467,come in the wrong phone size and not the same color as the phone so its hard to find and press without dislodging the unit,1
5468,when i would tap the screen it would become even more discolored,1
5469,next time i will have to pay for the postage to return,1
5470,the charger looks genuine and says samsung on it but it differs from my two oem batteries in the following ways 1,1
5471,however they just send one and incomplete because they offer tips for iphone 5 and it is not worth the length,1
5472,this worked for a few weeks then broke,1
5473,however it was still comfortable and has a great battery life and worked perfectly right up to the edge of the phone,1
5474,i was going to return it and get my money,1
5475,they sound no where as good and i am sure it was just this phone,1
5476,the product i received was indeed a samsung charger but came with a detachable usb to micro usb cable for charging docking,1
5477,and let me tell you that it is now charging wirelessly,1
5478,the first time out in the field it wouldn't work with the new update to ios,1
5479,plugging it in to a powered usb port and the second one is much worse than the stock battery,1
5480,when i installed them had to be super careful so i wouldn't suggest buying this if you actually want to talk on your phone,1
5481,the one i received from amazon does not match the quality that i was used to with anker,1
5482,it is possible that i had a true hardware failure,1
5483,random stress crack started forming in the bottom right corner seamed to be broke so it would not provide adequate shock absorbancy and drop protection,1
5484,going to try to figure out another way to fix it for now but certainly not the revolutionary mount i expected,1
5485,this screen protector was annoying it was like a mirror and you could barely hear out of all of them,1
5486,i did love it while it was on the right side doesn't close,1
5487,even after trying several different cords it wouldn't charge anything dead on arrival,1
5488,amazonbasics screen protector film for iphone 4s on two of my phones a droid global 2 and an lg would not work with my vents,1
5489,as noted when it was working the plug kept coming out because it wouldn't fit at all so disappointed,1
5490,i've gotten a few items from before and quality was good for the one time that it actually worked,1
5491,the rubber layer feels very cheap and scratches very easy,1
5492,i don't know if there is a chance you will get one that works well,1
5493,i felt that after 4 days of charging and testing that the battery had about 30 % left anyway i thought the battery was dead,1
5494,sometimes it would hold the battery in sideways,1
5495,all 3 of the screen protectors was deformed,1
5496,i think the buyer knows these things don't work and that was the end of my contract,1
5497,but for whatever reason and i can't seem to stay on,1
5498,this isn't even a supported phone there is no way to use your headphones while the phone is charged,1
5499,5 screen beware this case will not allow me to return it,1
5500,it is also very difficult to get off once it is on it feels very unnatural and cheap,1
5501,i'm going to keep them since it would cost more for shipping handling then the product,1
5502,but neither of my kids will like it,1
5503,after just 2 days of normal use the ear cover on the right side,1
5504,they wanted me to pay for shipping to have this shipped back for a refund but don't want to wait 15 minutes,1
5505,512 mb ram 8 gb of internal space while in reality you can't even include a cord,1
5506,pretty pink but otherwise a waste of money even if it was a few bucks,1
5507,i should have read more than the first few reviews and didn't look at additional pictures provided,1
5508,i could not get it on my phone,1
5509,several times i tried to fit it in,1
5510,i got this case because i work in a noisy environment,1
5511,also they are slightly too big for the iphone 5 not the iphone 4,1
5512,it's just one solid piece of plastic with some rhinestones glued to it i tell you i got 1,1
5513,i used it once after just using the screen protector on my 18 month old immaculate evo,1
5514,i'd previously had no problems with heating up the phone,1
5515,the back of the case fell off all the time and forgot about it,1
5516,due to the glossy rim around the top of the case and move it out of the box and none of them fit,1
5517,the unit looks like the real thing but it isn't,1
5518,there is no way to separate the protector from the phone and the case,1
5519,i have several issues with this iphone after using it for 2 days and the ipad was not charged 1 percent,1
5520,ended up not connecting to my samsung galaxy 3 and i got one for my daughter,1
5521,i know this sounds like a good product for phones though,1
5522,interferes with my radio when my phone is literally right next to it,1
5523,you guessed it the adapter doesn't work for my iphone or ipad,1
5524,-that screen i should point out that i found the level to which you can adjust the brightness within the phone's settings,1
5525,then once you have it in pairing mode to pair with multiple devices at the same timedoes not charge my phone,1
5526,it's pretty thin and of course it accepted rechargables with no modifications,1
5527,this battery charger is not as good i don't know where i ordered these from but horrible quality,1
5528,the front bezel cut out for the charger port area,1
5529,i am appalled at the lack of quality these sweatshop made covers have,1
5530,i'm ordering a different one from amazon and thought it was great for about a month and then began to get the ios7,1
5531,guess what i never received the screen covers,1
5532,you will need a micro sd card in the box with epic 4 g phone,1
5533,didn't last at all and i put it on the phone for a week,1
5534,i don't have wifi coverage and not to mention the haze and microripples that diminish screen clarity,1
5535,the ribs on the top half is so thin it slides in my pocket and taking it out,1
5536,if they send me a clear protector of a nexus 7 and not the one that i get doesn't work,1
5537,however after the fist few attempted phone calls i had to take it out of this junk,1
5538,i purchased this charger as a second charger for my blackberry tour,1
5539,mainly because a friend of mine has one of these screen protectors had no side 2 b tab,1
5540,cable didn't work it did not work when we received this,1
5541,it was pretty basic and didnt have a bluetoothe option for my phone,1
5542,definitely got what i paid for a cellet and am now annoyed that i didn't feel comfortable carrying this thing around,1
5543,however after opening it i found it to be incredibly inaccurate,1
5544,it is so ugly that i had to wait for up to 1 2 minutes for the phone to shipback to htc for repairs,1
5545,not easy to change case on the phone or you will never get a full-flush stick around the sides of your phone,1
5546,first the suction cup would not stay secure for more than 30 minutes it is too painful the sound has no fidelity,1
5547,i just dropped my phone while it was plugged in,1
5548,that basically made the device i received a one use item and as such i feel i have become very proficient in applying screen covers,1
5549,a device with dual core processor and gingerbread will be out in a couple of years just like other smartphones new software and operating system,1
5550,i've been trying to get one of the 4 so far and within 2 days it stopped working,1
5551,i'd pass and spend a little more and get service from a provider that speaks english,1
5552,i have one on net10 my nephew and his wife have 2 of these one for motorola android and one for samsung android,1
5553,as far as the phone is turned on,1
5554,maybe it'l work for other phones but this one is terrible by comparison,1
5555,overall this case does protect your phone and breaks after you drop your phone,1
5556,i bought another one from zero lemon and they told me how to take it off and throw it away,1
5557,do not buy this product if you're willing to put up with the bs,1
5558,i had to get a replacement treo,1
5559,it was so cheap that it would cost its price to return it and i get my money back,1
5560,it is way too tight a fit for droid 2 global,1
5561,so to sum up for a little over a week now,1
5562,the hard snap on case inside left black marks on the back of the head were missing and the charging block was not included,1
5563,i can not confirm if it is a galaxys ii it should fit,1
5564,last but def not least the blue coloring was coming off the review that was given was miss leading to me,1
5565,doesn't really work as a 34 windshield mount 34 if it doesn't protect,1
5566,it wouldn't even work if i held the unit in one orientation,1
5567,tj global listed this device as 34 new in box 34 and then try to use it i couldn't track it down,1
5568,no i would never recommend this product to anyone who has a clue as to what good quality really is,1
5569,i am trying to get them to send me a working one,1
5570,i tried to partially charge my iphone and i actually had to use pliers to get the piece out,1
5571,worse buy ever but i did buy it from att store and after using it for the last year,1
5572,i liked it so much that i bought a second phone because it was cheap and fell apart in my hand,1
5573,this cable worked for a few seconds and neither of them worked well,1
5574,the only ok things about this phone but there are also some really odd problems such as not being able to charge at all,1
5575,i could handle just having three buti went to plug it in the signal is very intermittent it's garbage more than 50 %,1
5576,and the corner cutout didn't seem to have any mention of this,1
5577,when talking on phone you can barely hear the person your talking too,1
5578,they sound no where as good and i am sure i could have made them myself,1
5579,2 hours later with perfect sunlight and my phone was sort of popping out,1
5580,with each one the persons on the other end told me they were having a hard time getting it out of the park,1
5581,this was probably my worst purchase i've made on amazon,1
5582,i originally did not want to stay on,1
5583,but you can tell it is not the first kit i bought,1
5584,when i was done and the protector doesn't even adhere to the phone,1
5585,they were loose and didn't hold up and the stand broke,1
5586,the clip that holds the phone in broke within 2 weeks with minimal use,1
5587,it may meet someone's needs but none of my phones iphone 4 and droid bionic ever charge,1
5588,i had the same issue with both of them the right ear that is attached to the mic stopped working,1
5589,do not buy these cells unless you want to be able to charge my phone at night,1
5590,the price was cheap but i was not getting service when i had the switch disengaged,1
5591,after realizing i had to keep reapplying it over and over again to get it to work,1
5592,i had great hopes for this product but i was able to speak with a representative,1
5593,missing pieces and the tray was so poorly designed that i would not spend 100 on this gadget,1
5594,nothing on the front and it didn't charge my ipod at all in fact,1
5595,i am a customer that used a product like this that most people have never used before it is severely lacking,1
5596,i got it because it wasn't working,1
5597,another ping against this product is that the belt clip is terrible,1
5598,this is awful it's not what i ordered and i dislike it,1
5599,my bed is two feet off the ground and sent on off for delivery,1
5600,this was the wornf case for my phone and is cheaply made,1
5601,i ordered multiple covers to protect my 4 iphones and i couldn't get this thing on straight or without smudging it,1
5602,my wife purchased this phone and it looks like its 2 years old,1
5603,this case is described as crystal clear but it has a major flaw that ilounge discussed in their review,1
5604,does not work for long it already has a growing 1 crack going up the back of the phone to work,1
5605,i have to say on the positive side the unit does seem to be working well and went on pretty easily,1
5606,i did not like this could not get the unit to hold together,1
5607,returned product as i wanted a longer cord to charge my phone if it were ever dropped,1
5608,i do not reccommend this product i am going to purchase a bubble free screen protector like i have on my ipad,1
5609,disappointed that product did not work on my phone it displays mp3 charge error when attached,1
5610,i tried turning it and the other dirty and broken i have never felt so ripped off before,1
5611,though when i got the product and i thought it would be sturdy but its just plastic,1
5612,i have one on net10 my nephew and his wife have 2 of these one for me and one for my dad,1
5613,but even if they are not using the original charger the battery charged more than when using this charger,1
5614,the home button has to be pressed really hard it's just more trouble than i want to go through the hassle,1
5615,i humored them as i'm a bit of a quality discrepency between the two virtually identical items,1
5616,files from the thumbdrive i plugged in showed up on the screen which means that the phone is in the case,1
5617,but i was quickly disappointed when i tried to push the air out of it but it appears that it could have been much better,1
5618,so i ordered a second one plugged it in to charge it it restarted normally,1
5619,don't waste your time and money and go for one that is better made,1
5620,and what made it even worse was they only gave me half the price of the competition,1
5621,it's really the perfect case for my note 3 but the seller send me the wrong one,1
5622,these things scratch so easily that you will not feel good about this case was the culprit,1
5623,more words they say i loved the case it look absolutely wonderful on my white iphone 4s,1
5624,and the corner cutout didn't seem to help in the car either but i don't care but some might,1
5625,the button for answering the phone did not fit inside the case after trying diligently,1
5626,hopefully its just a fluke as i really like the anker 2-usb high output charger,1
5627,this do not work well so we are probably going to go to the manufacturer to get that lifetime warranty,1
5628,3 megapizel camera so i had to change them very often,1
5629,only got to use it and it was clearly used,1
5630,the longest it stayed on my phone for more than an hour to charge it like 2 %,1
5631,when i received the item in a timely manner and the sender was terrific,1
5632,both of them would not fit in my honda crv vents,1
5633,spend more money on a better smart phone i will not buy from this seller,1
5634,i'm anal about bubbles under the screen so i threw this away after first use definitely avoid this one,1
5635,the case for the entirety of these 2 weeks and i didn't want to spend a lot of money for it,1
5636,great idea but too fragile and it just made it seem like my tablet was too heavy for it to handle,1
5637,one star and unfortunately beyond the point where i actually heard some cracking,1
5638,i suppose i should have known it was too good to be true it's too good to be true and it was,1
5639,and when i got it and tried to give it away to whoever,1
5640,second one charged and was static prone for about a week and then would not hold a charge as described by the manufacturer,1
5641,you have to glue the screen protector to the case and cheap free throw away accessories they include with it,1
5642,to me water and soap on a cellphone is not a very good fit for the apple cord,1
5643,i thought maybe i bought the wrong case so i tried it on two different iphone docks that have a 3,1
5644,this was good on firmness of the case but the other 2 stars i can not give a good rating on this one,1
5645,i am surprised with all the good reviews on here but i was disappointed,1
5646,first it doesn't feel natural and if you're smart throw it out immediately,1
5647,the glue that holds it on the screen this case would do much to protect my gs4,1
5648,the volume buttons on this case don't line up with the corresponding buttons on the phone,1
5649,it chared it to 35 % and then the battery inserted into the charger which is hard to find but when i received it,1
5650,and i mean to the point that i'm trying to make here,1
5651,and all makes and models will be the exact same phone only made of cheaper materials,1
5652,they said they would send another one it never came it was a used beat up bp6x that wasn't any where near fitting,1
5653,i really wanted to use this small solar panel because it is supposed to have 2 usb ports rated at 2,1
5654,people on the other end of the phone are a bunch of holes punched into the plastic unevenly,1
5655,i still have a lot of air bubbles for something that is like a smartphone in some ways this is the choice,1
5656,finally gave way and broke in less than a week and charged it 3 times,1
5657,thus you don't need to buy a cradle separately,1
5658,this stylus was used for two days and a small plastic broke off,1
5659,this morning i managed to fix the kickstand myself but only because i have to but it's worth not even half of one star,1
5660,not worth the money there are much better quality protectors out there,1
5661,like most people i decided to buy this one and get a spigen slim armor a much better case in both looks and protection,1
5662,5 hours and then put it in my front pocket,1
5663,for instance if i hook my phone up to it and it charged it to 50 % before the case said it was dead,1
5664,tried two of these from the seller and was quickly shipped a replacement no questions asked,1
5665,the silence ringer switch in this case is a poor excuse for a case i would recommend,1
5666,i'm just that type of person and i'm sure the thing works but i would definitely not buy it,1
5667,just want a battery that is too small for a galaxys iii,1
5668,this is a dull thick beast of a non-powered usb port on your computer,1
5669,this otterbox defender is not the color you will receive,1
5670,the opening on the case was broken so i returned it,1
5671,anyway i was able to get this battery to work,1
5672,this one is cheap quality and not worth the price or time,1
5673,conclusion it was better than nothing worked for voice calls most of the time but suck for web browsing games or typing,1
5674,i purchased these thinking they were going to come apart or start separating after a few months,1
5675,i ended up having to throw them away as they didn't fit my droid,1
5676,alas after only having this case for a friend who couldn't afford to replace his damaged one,1
5677,not gon na bother to return because it was so cute but it got lost in the mail but it doesn't work at all,1
5678,i guess i get what i paid for,1
5679,it is nothing bad and i am not affiliated with treasure valley in any way shape or form,1
5680,i used the car charger for my samsung galaxy player 3,1
5681,if the plastic casing piece fit i would rate this behind a popular one on amazon,1
5682,i wanted to keep the plastic from the factory that won't come off from the film protector on both of them and nothing worked,1
5683,positive side is that it is a snn5880 which would work fine with the iphone 4s,1
5684,it worked okay for about a month then quit working altogether,1
5685,i got this product it was broken into two piece,1
5686,charging not supported on this device when i plug in the power cable and the usb input did not work,1
5687,it bends and is so weak that it's not compatible with my phone,1
5688,thinking about returning this but it was cheap enough just to keep it as a stand to watch movies but that is it,1
5689,i ordered this case for a week or two and the sound was pretty good even though they are expensive,1
5690,next i tried to use it the charge was completely gone,1
5691,at this point i've been through a number of headsets,1
5692,the note 3 is impossible to get out every air bubble,1
5693,your other alternative if you do not have extra parts available you will be without a phone while i am asleep here time difference,1
5694,i guess i was just greedy when i thought i was done shopping for an iphone case,1
5695,shipping was ok but the pins was not at all what i pictured i'd be getting,1
5696,this aint the one for my phone,1
5697,however the plastic case cracked when i removed my phone from the usb port,1
5698,two things make me recommend not buying this armband if you have an iphone 4s 64 gig phone thing,1
5699,it was not necessarily easy to install and super clear almost invisible,1
5700,mine arrived with pearls at the top and covers too much of the bottom,1
5701,the screen part was popped out before i even stuck my real sim card in,1
5702,both cases had the same problems as i did and install without any problem,1
5703,the audio lagged so many times even after a full charge completely defeating the purpose of the case,1
5704,the battery has samsung branding and says it is a rim blackberry but it will not typically be a new one,1
5705,another waste of money would not work with all bose head phone and there is no rubber on the corners,1
5706,i was constantly changing batteries to get the phone off the phone back in package and returned,1
5707,i would have given them a 5 star review for something i cant really say fit,1
5708,i do not recommend it to protect your phone not put it in more danger,1
5709,unfortunately a plastic tab on the inner case and use a pull tab,1
5710,i paid too much for this kit but i couldn't get the band to stay secure on my arm,1
5711,i regret my purchase of this battery case based on the reviews i purchased this stylus,1
5712,i've tried but i can't say you will get a prompt response,1
5713,mine didn't come with a high-power wall charger that comes with the full neo hybrid case,1
5714,another thing is the nearly month in waiting for the battery with dots underneath to appear and dead phone,1
5715,i got this from my iphone five but that's it,1
5716,update december 10 2013 i lowered my rating from 4 stars to 1 but i'm on my third one in a week,1
5717,wav files meaning i can't use it but it's good to know and the picture on the case is chipping,1
5718,i don't care what the guy does i'll never buy from you again the right that,1
5719,the good the product is but once i get the case will let you know,1
5720,it's too bad because this looks stylish and seems to have serious hardware no software fixes issues,1
5721,thank god it's cheap and that's the difference,1
5722,when i found it i knew it would last me about 20 hrs with light usage which i thought was very strange,1
5723,well if you are willing to take your chances like i did,1
5724,also what's worse is the warranty 90 days and you have to pull on the cord,1
5725,i ordered three of them and the result are the same,1
5726,not sure on the cause but this plug caused a lot of static and that i sound all scratchy all the time,1
5727,don't waste your time and money and buy another case,1
5728,moreover the ear bud is twice the lenght of the cord is so short on his charger,1
5729,let me go over why i hate this phone so much that it sucks the life out of the lovely iphone retina display,1
5730,i personally think there is a place for a product like this on a daily basis i,1
5731,with both devices i have the same problem i had,1
5732,it is so ugly that i had to wait over a month to get shipped,1
5733,very thin cheap plastic one star only because the green part of the case not the typical screen protector film,1
5734,i have a black one and it's fine and can't even tell it's on the heavy side,1
5735,the sound and device was okay until it stopped working less than 3 weeks,1
5736,buy it thinking it was original samsung but left very disappointed to see that the micro usb cord would not click in,1
5737,for those who did not listened to me you might as well try to tape your phone to your belt it is fine,1
5738,but the problem came when i used siri to make a phone call is awkward because of how it fits,1
5739,very hard to put onto phone exactly without getting all the bubbles out and the ones that i could get with the zerolemon,1
5740,i ordered the otterbox commuter instead it has rubber on the corners to absorb that highly stressful corner fall,1
5741,i ordered these because i don't know what had happened,1
5742,i would never purchase anything like this again or tell someone to buy i was very very disappointed,1
5743,the down side is you get only one screen protector for almost 3 times the cost of a single otterbox and still get similar protection,1
5744,this isn't the size of the case and other obvious quality defects this case looks and fits so great that im thrilled,1
5745,to boxing it up to send it back by the seller told me to just keep it and realize you made a big mistake,1
5746,the charging circuit for the plus does not work however i can charge my iphone ipad and even friends android phones via usb,1
5747,most of them were on the cheap side in some areas,1
5748,i'm not sure how long it takes to dry 8 to 24 hours,1
5749,however i noticed in the 3rd day that it no longer reads voice text messages back to you before sending,1
5750,as usual should have listened to the other reviews,1
5751,i will not buy a mobile device unless otterbox makes a case for it to corral the charger and unit in one place,1
5752,i got my old iphone out it still had 28 % it charged it to 50 % before the case's battery is depleted,1
5753,it also doesn't feel very protective like if i drop it because usually rubber does most of the protection,1
5754,it is also a poor fitting connection to the phone on the opposite side of one plug,1
5755,but i guess i will have to use the phone it doesn't feel like anything is on the phone,1
5756,i will never recommend this product to friends and family members who has ipads,1
5757,this case was very flimsy the pieces did not fit well and the back case not staying on,1
5758,i could immediately after putting it on it was either mis-aligned or had air bubbles all over the screen,1
5759,this case will not stay on my phone,1
5760,however when i ordered it and then a week and a half when major bugs started showing up,1
5761,after realizing i had to keep the side of my head with its finger in my ear,1
5762,as a result you either have broken fingernails or have to find a box and travel to the ups store,1
5763,i wish i had more hands so i can give one to him for his phone as well,1
5764,you have to carefully line up the pins with the contacts because there are no instructions and it isn't going to protect my phone,1
5765,be prepared for the device to turn on and off as the charger starts and stops,1
5766,adapter itself didnt even work on an iphone 5s,1
5767,doesn't fit at t i747 samsung s3 with extended battery and i can't hear you any better,1
5768,no apology or attempt to correctissue even though i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone,1
5769,remember this mat only supports lg nokia and blackberry out of the box the battery functioned like a phone that i had been doing,1
5770,the seller leaves a piece of paper superglued onto plastic,1
5771,don't waste your money you can buy it for between 16 and 20 depending upon the color,1
5772,seriously how could it be the same size of bb screen,1
5773,after less than a month of purchase my husband use it for a keyboard but in my experience with this thing since then,1
5774,the cord burnt out after only one use this product died,1
5775,after reading more positive than negative reviews for this product and was told that the call quality sounded worse on the recipient's end,1
5776,it's all over the front of the charger but again i wish i didn't order a replacement and i sent mine back,1
5777,i ended up having to order a new bike over the phone,1
5778,after stating i had removed the lock over and over again to get it to work,1
5779,i am not about to use it on my dock station for music,1
5780,i will take the time to re-rate the case when it's on not satisfied at all,1
5781,the wall charger does not work with iphone 5s,1
5782,try another brand for a couple of bucks and it's not that hard to repair,1
5783,this had a rubbery feel and grip to the screen that i didn't get it because i really only needed it for camping trips,1
5784,the description says that it works with the iphone 5 until they upgraded the os last year,1
5785,i'm so upset and pissed off please don't buy if you have t mobile model,1
5786,when i chose this juice pack i was hoping it would be more convenient to view the screen while charging,1
5787,this is a good setup but it wasn't an iphone 5 cover,1
5788,overall if you're looking for an inexpensive and reliable option,1
5789,the next case i bought lasted barely over a year and my new griffen bumper has been awesome,1
5790,i've been listening to music and no voice call,1
5791,once i finally recieved the case it was designed to fit giants apparently,1
5792,customer service is not awful but it is a weak battery,1
5793,i sent the case to speck for warranty and they sent me the wrong part twice,1
5794,you are not able to play music with for some reason it's stopped charging my iphone as well,1
5795,as the title says this is my first bad on amazon,1
5796,don't waste your money it will not fit into joby's own larger gorillapod or any other tripod,1
5797,had to buy an genuine apple cord for a few extra dollars for ones i know will work,1
5798,it provided no protection for my phone but it clearly states that this is not a clean l7,1
5799,then you need to go through the trouble of returning it,1
5800,i bought this to use in my office as i have my phone jailbroken and i can see no practical purpose to ever use one,1
5801,i will likely buy another battery from a different vendor to see if that would make some them more stable with no joy,1
5802,they broke after two weeks of use and the phone easily slides off,1
5803,this product is totally far from what it is advertised to work with my htc one x and its backup a samsung infuse 4 g,1
5804,first of all unless everything is absolutely perfect the defender case does not fit and is a bit too big,1
5805,most of these cheap items are what you pay for 34 and i still got ripped off,1
5806,otherwise in my opinion it is a not the samsung charger,1
5807,get what you pay for but out of the 3 of mine got messed up,1
5808,it is cute but when i tried to get it replaced by verizon told to contact motorola,1
5809,installed and first thing i notice is that the rubber is too soft to protect a delicate device,1
5810,although it was a good value though i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone,1
5811,i ordered 5 things for my galaxy 3 and it was not in the package,1
5812,the speaker cable did not fit right inside of my ears they kept falling out on her too,1
5813,edit ordered another one from the same company but this one is just 2 months old,1
5814,i had other case just like this one was not it,1
5815,applied this anyway and 2 weeks later i finally got a different bluetooth that actually has some quality in it's build,1
5816,worked for a day or so of use leaving sharp edges,1
5817,it provided extended life for a few days here's my update,1
5818,take my advice and keep scrolling pass this or you will be charge after you quit using your phone plan,1
5819,i uploaded some pics so you can see it is cheaply made,1
5820,i received the car charger and the wall charger came apart and stopped charging after a few weeks of minimal use,1
5821,they can say oh i only wore them 3 times or something like that 62 62 62 dont like disclaimers 62 62 62,1
5822,i bought this for iphone 4 and 4s but it keeps coming off of the base and it is now much better,1
5823,the cord didnt even work on an iphone 5s,1
5824,i wound up just re-using the stock battery and a portable battery pack charger which is amazingly compact for such a powerful charger,1
5825,2 wasted in the trash it would cost me more in return shipping than i would get back,1
5826,my first impression of this unit was that it was a small dollar amount,1
5827,the wings were in the way and presses buttons and the tripod legs are just dancing below the ballhead,1
5828,unfortunately the charging carrying case is the only positive thing i can say is that this is a piece of garbage,1
5829,it's a cheap case i used it for less than a week has a few dings in it,1
5830,bought this for a note 3 and my phone doesnt except a charge or dock to a computer any longer,1
5831,this seems like the only viable option so i gave it a 1 star the seller should say this is the international version 3 g,1
5832,i purchased this case from bbuy and i have had issues with them all,1
5833,it left many bubbles and i ended up sending it right back,1
5834,i imagine it was putting too much pressure on the buttons when sliding the case over the sides to snap on off,1
5835,the original bubble went away but it already after less than a week the clear back was so scratched up,1
5836,2 oshas auto brightnessthe bad internal memory is not enough and it just kept shutting the phone down,1
5837,i think they are old used batteries that may have a larger capacity than the stock battery did,1
5838,update i really wish that i had read more of the reviews and found a few others who mention the same problem,1
5839,the first one was so bad it wouldnt stay on,1
5840,there is no problem to this phone and all samsung phones as well as powering other devices at the same timedoes not charge my phone,1
5841,the s-4 is just a little too snug in the pouch,1
5842,not sure if this is a result of the thinner glass,1
5843,i have a protector that is very similar to the bubble issues and images that many others have experienced this as well,1
5844,so today i gave it another chance however as i predicted it's not good with sweatpants or scrubs,1
5845,0 cable with this that came with my android and not even one of them worked which only lasted 2 days,1
5846,but for the samsung exhibit ii this is a bad charger it does not,1
5847,also the jack doesn't seem to properly support the system after the sale,1
5848,once you put the phone on the dock nor on my original charger,1
5849,it doesn't fit at all on my htc evo but i couldn't hear them,1
5850,something about these after market ones that don't work long if at all,1
5851,i broke down and paid far more money to get used to this for months and finally dumped it,1
5852,if i had that much time to charge the case and phone separately which should not be the case,1
5853,my girlfriend and i have a large smartphone,1
5854,there were already minor scratches on the inner side of the case is messed up on the sides now,1
5855,the quality of the printing of some of the basic black silicone cases being sold at the store,1
5856,its ripped after the second time it broke i could have gotten a lot cheaper set but wanted quality,1
5857,let's see how it goes but if it continues to go unchecked,1
5858,it's super cheap but it should last a lot longer than this crap,1
5859,contacted samsung who informed us that since the phone was new it was at the introductory price almost 300,1
5860,the case covers the buttons on the side are so hard to unlatch,1
5861,they don't stick well and no matter how much i tried to get it off the site,1
5862,the construction of the band is not adjustable big design flaw,1
5863,do not buy this knock off piece of junk next time i will buy a cheap one as there is less to lose,1
5864,most of the reviewers here have no clue that this is the fake one and not a real casemate,1
5865,if i could give it 5 stars however the cables i received from amazon specifically from the seller donops,1
5866,battery life is okay but there are plenty of better options for charging your s4,1
5867,i decided it was better to go without the screen protector-major smudging and picks up everything,1
5868,i don't understand how you could have the case off the fount part will break to where you can no longer use it,1
5869,didn't no it was made this way thought it would protect my phone if it's standing straight up i have the htcone m8,1
5870,we then tried to pair it to my galaxy 3 phone cases,1
5871,also the prongs are very thin so it tends to stick to the phone that well and the button on the side,1
5872,i was very disappointed that the manufacturer didn't care to check and make sure the case is very stylish but it just doesn't,1
5873,long story short i'm glad this was cheap because i would of been more upset about the money wasted,1
5874,i liked this case cuz i could set my note3 up on it and my conversationis now projected into the whole room,1
5875,i'm always on the make for a new one and will try again,1
5876,really liked that it was a microscope so i put it on the charger it does not,1
5877,i had many for my iphone 4s but when i received phone calls no one could hear me well,1
5878,then you are left with a small gap at the top,1
5879,net10 will not answer so the card is useless i followed the instructions carefully and read the list of features as well,1
5880,battery life was terrible and the way they were designed they do not stay in and although colorful color does not get the job done,1
5881,just because it didn't fit my phone as well it immediately pulls the sticky pad off of the dashboard,1
5882,i will give these to any one whos needs a charger,1
5883,we did watch the youtube videos before started changing it didn't help because i couldn't see the screen well,1
5884,i emailed for a return but threw away the box and now i have to find a fedex location to mail the defective case,1
5885,i wanted this earpiece to be great i got it with prime i'll return the two i have when those arrive,1
5886,if i didn't buy my bluetooth at amazon but this is the worst i have every used,1
5887,this item never worked for me even right out of the package it was folded in half with tire marks all over it,1
5888,there is no reason for me to buy another device,1
5889,large ear piece did not fit in the phone at all and the 34 luminous 34 part came out because it's rubber,1
5890,the waste of money is monumental when it comes to connecting your phone to your tv,1
5891,in this instance the product does not charge the tablet,1
5892,if they will sell copies place it in the dock allowing it to charge while docked,1
5893,a second one worked for about 3 weeks now and have used both screens,1
5894,when i installed them had to be super careful so i wouldn't accidentally use it and damage the phone,1
5895,as many have noted this product just does not deliver what it promises,1
5896,i received my case and immediately put it on my iphone and the oem evo battery would have been dead by 2 pm,1
5897,example is the samsung galaxy captivate and its sister device in europe and asia occurred when the last generation of samsung galaxy devices galaxy s,1
5898,i think the best way to do business especially when you have a case around the phones connector,1
5899,it installs beautifully on a clean screen but it is so slippery you can't hold it,1
5900,i tried airing it out and the time when i bought it i put it on my iphone 4s it damaged my sleep wake button,1
5901,you can tell from the cheapness of the product and will make you ship the product back to them,1
5902,the indicator lights go on when i plug it in directly to my computer,1
5903,i'm always a fan of trying new iphone accessories as there are so many options and most of them are bad,1
5904,this cable was only able to use the camera on the back of the case,1
5905,review for gear 2 screen protector doesn't even adhere to the phone,1
5906,now i didn't get the job done,1
5907,update 05 31 2013 the batter was ok for the first day and fell inlove hours went by and i encountered a problem,1
5908,i've had slim fit cases on other phones and get the same problem,1
5909,the point of a phone cover if it is not plugged into an electrical socket which defeats the purpose,1
5910,as for the phone it will charge with a car charger not very convenient for how we typically charge,1
5911,it des not charge or work with my samsung galaxy tab 3 7 i have,1
5912,however i was buying this to connect my speakers to my tv,1
5913,i'm wondering now that the phone is on your hip or in your hand,1
5914,i also couldn't hear as well as i see fit,1
5915,another plus was the seller they gave me another date to wait for it to get here from overseas,1
5916,5 mm jackit is a big difference between red and pink,1
5917,after using this case for a few weeks then broke,1
5918,generally my iphone runs 6-8 hours to charge my galaxy note 3 and makes phone flash on and off,1
5919,i ordered these and found them to be snug and comfortable and the sound is night and day,1
5920,personally using this cover feels like i am talking from a diving helmet,1
5921,well that was until today 11 19 i dropped my phone and it did not charge more than one line,1
5922,i sent it back and bitched about but it was cheap and fell apart within 12 hours of having it,1
5923,the case itself seems to not work well with the phone sensors camera etc,1
5924,it only works holding your phone in your pocket or rub off on your clothing,1
5925,other people may love the case but not budge it in the slightest,1
5926,this item is a complete piece of garbage but it's also not worth returning for the price,1
5927,i thought i would be able to be charged while in the phone,1
5928,this is showing three pieces and that is what i have noticed in the first week,1
5929,i bought this phone for my little sister,1
5930,i contacted the seller and they issued me a refund so at least that was good on their part,1
5931,inexpensive can turn out to be a piece of junk,1
5932,i tried several time to get this and it just didn't give me the precision i was looking for,1
5933,i assured them the new phone had somehow malfunctioned in a manner that helped retain the position of the earpiece in the ear,1
5934,these do not work in my car could not get it on phone at all,1
5935,its a rapid charger for my samsung galaxy and both of them are broken with light use,1
5936,it turns out that i had a lemon,1
5937,i tried them in a car charger but got in just incase,1
5938,there's no way i'd recommend this case to any one because its a pice of s,1
5939,would have really like a new one but i won't be ordering from this selling again,1
5940,after reading all the rave reviews i had heard about the company's products before this experience,1
5941,and within four miles of highway driving the volume just won't cut it,1
5942,while i know this is a stupid idea,1
5943,my package came from ebay and i ordered from amazon and that didn't seem to have enough grip,1
5944,others may like this case but i was very disappointed that i didn't get the rebate so 23 for a pretty bad bluetooth,1
5945,so i purchased this charger as a last resort however it doesnt work at all i guess you get what you pay for sometimes,1
5946,i liked the fact that it only comes with one of the side prongs out,1
5947,i was disappointed and threw it on the shelf not worth sending back,1
5948,so i need a case that won't slip out of my hand when picking it up,1
5949,first if all they broke and i've only used it 2 times,1
5950,i've foxed sonny iphones and this is the worst screen protector that i've ever made,1
5951,so the design is beautiful and the case looks great its useless,1
5952,bottom line was that it was heavily scratched,1
5953,i wanted a little bit of 3d pattern,1
5954,i use it all the time i have it out and looking at it i won't even consider the other docks samsung has available,1
5955,i did not even attempt to use this when i got it installed it didn't seem automatic after the initial pairings,1
5956,in fact its screen is very sensitive i don't wish for it to be this poor quality of a device,1
5957,keep pressing the buttons for a few seconds and then stops,1
5958,i will not buy it againi will not recommend to order from this place,1
5959,this latch broke off as i tried to remove it and get a different unit,1
5960,the item doesn't match the white color of the galaxys iii is a terrible phone,1
5961,it included a card bit to use as a paperweight or a doorstop,1
5962,the fm receiver isn't advertised as included with the phone but it beats the purpose of having a bluetooth radio and cellphone,1
5963,this is a good case for the money,1
5964,oh yeah plugged it in and i had to pay return postage,1
5965,had other slim fit cases by this company for my iphone and none of them behave like that,1
5966,so that was already a minus to me not to mention the phone is just crap compared to the iphone,1
5967,huge markdown at costco looks like this device is not supported it took about a month for me to receive it,1
5968,so far i have not found a way to get to a text message,1
5969,it's shoddily made the plastic on the top half is so thin it felt like a piece of paper superglued onto plastic,1
5970,and what do you know only one of them worked to an acceptable level of bluetooth music,1
5971,doesn't stay on the phone i have they were a little undersized,1
5972,i purchased this item as a gift as i did not get the same product,1
5973,i used them for four 2 hour workouts and out of the car with this on my hip it broke,1
5974,but yeah don't waste your money overpriced and it broke after 2 months,1
5975,all inside seemed fine except the instruction manual as well as the conversation you are trying to access some website,1
5976,i ordered this item because i never got a chance to wear it,1
5977,update 3 31 14 i received 2 chargers from belkin to replace the ones that weren't being opened and others did,1
5978,the buttons on the side do not line up on the back the image is cut off on one side,1
5979,there is no texture on this case as it takes away the quality of the screen cover,1
5980,never got this one either it would be nice for one thumb to be able to charge my phone,1
5981,it did charge my cell phone while driving,1
5982,i know there was a problem with android's bluetooth 3,1
5983,hubby and i tried to charge my original battery in several subtle ways,1
5984,tablets from other manufacturers incorporate a standard hdmi output which is a much better case in both looks and protection,1
5985,i dont like how cheap this is not worth money will never use,1
5986,the leather like exterior is beautiful and the product is 100 % useless,1
5987,the captivate is for the at t samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket,1
5988,the case does not line up with the phone as previously mentioned,1
5989,i would have given maybe 3 stars but after my experience with this product was a big disappointment,1
5990,what gets me is that i put the 2nd screen protector on and it leaves a 2 mm gap around the whole phone,1
5991,this didnt even look like the screw,1
5992,the main issue is all 6 have been cut differently none of them are identical to one another as far as cuts go,1
5993,99 not only does this screen protector not fit too small waste of my money,1
5994,the buds were so close in size the i could barely tell the difference from all windows up and driver passenger window down,1
5995,i'm sure that it's too late to request a refund,1
5996,not what i wanted but it's so flimsy and cheap,1
5997,on top of that when i tried to take it off which were the steps that i had been doing,1
5998,at first the charge was holding well but after a month the same thing happened to him,1
5999,well amazon you can start here bargain cell which is one of the worst phone cases i've ever owned,1
6000,the design quickly became dirty and i was unable to use this wonderful feature,1
6001,both fring and skype periodically just stop working you have to remove the battery and case bottom to charge,1
6002,i don't know if skinomi will send me another one can you send me the right unit,1
6003,for 15 i would say that this product just does not fit,1
6004,the picture shows purple and when i got it i was excited but after opening it i immediately was disappointed,1
6005,i thought that given the cost this would be the same quality of protection and was extremely dissapointed,1
6006,this is the worst product i have ever bought on amazon,1
6007,second thing i noticed was the battery life of the original battery which it is definitely not,1
6008,i wanted the mesh for the extended life based on other reviews i would assume so unfortunately i can't change my original review,1
6009,i had this case for less than 30 days that felt like a life time,1
6010,i was intermittently using my phone at the att store because it would not fit,1
6011,i really wanted to like this product especially because i have been doing it for a while before coming back to update,1
6012,of course when it rings it can not be cleaned without taking unit apart,1
6013,a few weeks after getting the item i found it to be for lack of a better word cheesy in construction,1
6014,i also tried it on two separate cell phones and it did not work,1
6015,48 on amazonbelkin verve folio leather case and love it,1
6016,i had many for my iphone 4s but when i received it today,1
6017,but that headset wouldn't charge so i decided to buy this cable and do the repair,1
6018,i tried a line of sight test at my house and leave it on all the time if it just served its primary function,1
6019,i've come across a few people with the same case that is shown in the picture,1
6020,please complete the form and send it back the postage wasn't worth it buy something else,1
6021,so of course you have to remove the case every time you want to put a case on sucks but what can you do,1
6022,it has been almost a week but the case is not worth the money,1
6023,i emailed them and they replaced it in the meantime i suggest you look elsewhere,1
6024,it makes no sense and could run my phone but you are not going to get it registered so i have wasted my money,1
6025,i loved the look of this bumper and at the low price it is probably not worth my time to return it,1
6026,i ended up just buying a speck candyshell case and the lip on the bezel,1
6027,if you have arms on the skinnier size i would save your money guys and not buy this,1
6028,we bought this hoping it would protect my phone if it's standing straight up i have the htcone m8,1
6029,tried the case within a week of arriving,1
6030,when it still didn't fit i could not get these to apply properly without getting tons of air pockets,1
6031,waited a month for it to be any more durable than a no-name brand,1
6032,i purchased it in black for my son but used just 5 days and break,1
6033,after putting it on it was either mis-aligned or had air bubbles all over the screen no matter hard i tried,1
6034,worst mistake in buying a case for my galaxy s2 got it to connect but it won't stay on the dash board in place,1
6035,cracked and broken after less than a week just getting into a car,1
6036,overall i can't recommend it no matter how cheap this is mine lasted hardly a month before it came apart,1
6037,it is a little older lcd screen but it was one of the most secure designs i've seen for such a holster,1
6038,there are still a few air bubbles that can't be fixed at least ours did,1
6039,the entire case is also very cheap plastic,1
6040,by september the qi charging was so finicky that i couldn't expect too much at this price point,1
6041,i am currently using my original battery and although it is not invisible i was not worried about that,1
6042,the only way i knew how to get it on my phone it jamed the lock button,1
6043,this case did not work right out of the box the phone doesn't even raise it one percent,1
6044,this case was very flimsy the pieces did not fit well and the back case is too thick,1
6045,my blackberry gave me a warning that i am out of luck,1
6046,go ahead and buy this product if you want to use these w an arm band,1
6047,i had a usb micro charger but i couldn't use it ever since,1
6048,i could barely get my credit cards in this wristlet,1
6049,the sound doesn't have any richness and the bass is majorly lacking when using this unit,1
6050,when removing the home button and the front camera assembly with proximity sensor to the new screen,1
6051,they are fine in a foot or so of water but not good for taking on a walk or jogging,1
6052,doesn't fit well and just won't work with even a slim rubber case on the phone but that's all,1
6053,some app features are just not available since you can't turn that one once you're in a tunnel or something,1
6054,get a ballistic maxx if you're wanting a slim case,1
6055,it will not fit through the hole in the screen protector itself covered the entire screen,1
6056,after researching it i learned that the magnet in this case was the first bodyglove product that i have bought online,1
6057,but my screen protector was dirty from the start i followed all the directions and did exactly as outlined yet it started to peel,1
6058,it plugged in perfectly but i had to use alcohol to get it off,1
6059,the bottom of the screen required multiple hard presses and i could no longer obtain good quality bl-5c's that i finally gave up,1
6060,first thought it was cute but has only used it once and now it doesn't even show up under the bluetooth,1
6061,i messaged lifeproof about the issue and they said that while they could fix it and get all of your money back imo,1
6062,the usb part that goes into your phone,1
6063,i tried to cancel the order within a few hours of life at the end of my shift,1
6064,i bought this on line i think it was a waist of my money,1
6065,no matter how many times my phone fell out of my ear all the time,1
6066,i also bought their case but it was terrible and couldnt connect it,1
6067,it won't stay on my phone like it's made of cheap plastic,1
6068,that way you can get a refund if it fails,1
6069,i just didn't like the way it sits on the ear,1
6070,i had to constantly take it apart and re-seating the ribbon cables to no avail,1
6071,they sent a br56 which is supposed to be a samsung oem 5 ft cable,1
6072,it's small the signal and sound are good and the headphone cutout is especially large,1
6073,the third one almost worked but the edges refuse to stick even though it's a year old and a little glitchy,1
6074,the issue with the battery is that the leads are on the opposite side of the unit that is moving around,1
6075,plugged in charger and it still won't charge just maintain,1
6076,imho the film material zagg uses is the best out there but will do for basic smartphone,1
6077,thanks for nothing which is what i should have thought was oh my god this phone is horrible,1
6078,i spent some time to try to return it and use my old otter box instead,1
6079,2 from this company and do not buy anything from them again,1
6080,i liked the way this one looked in the picture but thats all im very dissapointed,1
6081,too thin i doubt this can protect my phone from a drop very this with no cushion,1
6082,absolutely the worst customer service i've ever experienced on amazon,1
6083,they're honestly just sitting in a shelf as i went back to the gym and sure enough once i worked up a sweat,1
6084,in short these things must have some kind of warranty otherwise it's a great fit and 2 it has a 2 year warranty,1
6085,i emailed lenmar to request their opinion and not surprisingly didn't get a hint of a charge for over 2 hours,1
6086,i also noticed that the metallic shield did not cover the corners of my jawline by the case,1
6087,i tried it with and i tried it a couple of time till it broke,1
6088,extended batteries are available but they increase the bottom half of the case it tears easily is ripped and the glue has many bulge spots,1
6089,however after a few test runs i found that it worked well with a cell phone that should tell you something,1
6090,putting this case on just one time scratched the metal sides of my iphone are showing i'm not happy money badly spent,1
6091,now i've got a galaxy s2 and it does not fit the iphone 4s,1
6092,please don't buy unless you want to be very disappointed,1
6093,no glitter except for a picture of the problem if the thing breaks,1
6094,who would buy an expensive case just to put baby powder in between the case and the idea,1
6095,please use a regular screen protector and have a friend or a local store that worked much better,1
6096,nothing that a little glue couldn't fix but it's not worth the return shipping cost for a refund,1
6097,really all i want is a screen protector that has a cut-out for the home button,1
6098,the pink is more of a bag than a case for your phone to be charged wirelessly by resting on a powermat,1
6099,the limeade burst l50x2 m does not provide a quick charge it takes about 30 seconds to actually show up in the conversation,1
6100,it did not work as i wanted,1
6101,edit i was told to send it back to the bumper,1
6102,nowhere as long as the phone's screen pauses and stops during calls,1
6103,5 connector does not fit my phone at all,1
6104,i paid 25 for it thinking it was dirt but it was not hard to change to us eastern time zone,1
6105,screen will definitely crack if the phone falls on the ground or floor or in the water,1
6106,it kinda looks 3d in a way only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been awesome,1
6107,had to buy an genuine apple cord for a few extra dollars and buy a real one,1
6108,another note is that it it's hard to imagine that the case is very cheaply made,1
6109,this adapter will only play hd videos so it won't look like my phone is shedding skin like a sunburn,1
6110,however i have to say on this piece of junk just fell apart,1
6111,i did not buy from a 3rd party like this company hoop china,1
6112,it's a screen protector and its already falling off,1
6113,i give one star for both batteries i purchased because they hold a charge and it wouldn't charge any longer,1
6114,but it came all folded it guess someone heavy was on top of it which leaves gunk on the lens cover,1
6115,it's poorly made and it looks cheap nothing like the picture it is hideously ugly,1
6116,however this product which is supposed to make it work right,1
6117,they claim it is only a matter of time before you have issues,1
6118,this is a cute case i got that,1
6119,the case is difficult to get around to edges while trying to put it in the direct sun for around an hour,1
6120,i made sure this was compatible with my phone will not work well with my phone case,1
6121,many times i had it cranked to the max and barley heard a sound,1
6122,bottom line don't buy any generic phone,1
6123,i've had it on my phone and it worked okay until i installed a wireless system in my home,1
6124,needless to say the adapter doesn't work for 2 reasons,1
6125,this case does not fit perfectly anyways,1
6126,looks exactly like described in the picture but received the standard 3,1
6127,i think the ones at the at t store for much more money,1
6128,the reason i really wanted to like this product for the full body,1
6129,cheap barely fits the phone hard to get on and the device can not be charged via the usb cable,1
6130,they came out defected i had to return it for warranty replacement,1
6131,i won't leave this on my phone for about 5 minutes but then the phone should reboot,1
6132,this means it is not even enough to keep the phone off of surfaces to disperse heat,1
6133,these were troublesome to put on and did not live up to the described performance,1
6134,the sound is not the best too loose on my phone plus feels cheap,1
6135,i purchased this cord because i needed a replacement battery so i went to the p,1
6136,i've had this case for less than 1 that were better quality than this case,1
6137,i hate this i though i was getting the same great speck quality,1
6138,first i write a lot of reviews i felt confident this would be a cheaper alternative but alas tis not,1
6139,if you review this product it says that it works with iphone 5 5s and ipad and it is incompatible wow,1
6140,i knew exactly what i was looking for this wallet for a while now,1
6141,upon reciept of this case i noticed the back of the phone ummm why,1
6142,i'm not hard on my phone or ipad they are virtually useless,1
6143,i bought this as a second charger for my ipad 2 expecting it to be amazing,1
6144,i got it in the mail without breaking,1
6145,i can always use this cable with your 2 amp charger it doesn't allow a pass through charge as soon as you start sweating,1
6146,it's also too loose to maintain any connection whatsoever,1
6147,i returned this product because it does not fit in the phone at all,1
6148,the next time i try to remove it,1
6149,my son got this product and it wasn't that bad even though it was annoying,1
6150,the case works well as a battery backup but it is very frustrating to be talking on the phone,1
6151,they did not fit the note 3 phone,1
6152,i returned it and got a different brand i guess,1
6153,i've used my phone with many other 30-pin chargers and have never had a reason to complain about their protectors,1
6154,i cant comment on the product as i had added a skinit picture on the phone and it does not serve too small,1
6155,2 i wanted to be able to swipe unlock it and it is now january 14th and they have shorted out and stopped working,1
6156,there is a little shine on the case but the flap will not close because the magnets do not meet,1
6157,it is similar but not the same as the zerolemmon with a slightly better feel,1
6158,this case came on time but the phone would occasionally get the hiccups when i tried to get rid of it,1
6159,i wanted to use this in the car vents is also a tricky proposition,1
6160,after just 2 days of normal use the case was falling apart,1
6161,the cable quality is ok and the sound is very staticky on both ends,1
6162,so if you got it for a work trip in europe,1
6163,the case does nothing to protect the iphone it turns a sleek and thin device into a bulky and heavy piece of equipment,1
6164,useless didn't like it and i'm not happy at all with the spigen-ultra crystal bull,1
6165,this protector has bad cuts around the home button lacks adhesion and the surface looks terrible,1
6166,can't ding the company for that since i don't have cable or satellite just ota antenna,1
6167,and i have to say on this product,1
6168,this item sucks bad it doesn't do its job,1
6169,i guess i got what i paid for this merchandise but i never received a response,1
6170,it is just made too thin for the flexibility required to insert the phone makes it a pain to get the phone on,1
6171,i'm one of those early adopter types that have to have the phone at a sharp angle so the light reflects off the case,1
6172,i did not buy from a 3rd party like this company hoop china,1
6173,it is very difficult to apply and after becoming frustrated i removed it and threw it away,1
6174,i just happened to run into a jabra stone i purchased a while ago and just not got around to typing up this review,1
6175,at this point it is not to be used for stand along charger,1
6176,contacted samsung and was informed that this is a terrible product and the entire thing is wrong,1
6177,they contacted me within 24 hours and a week later nothing,1
6178,the fit was good and i feel it would damage my samsung galaxy s3 shows that it is charging for about 10 seconds,1
6179,i think it would show off the phone a little bit around the camera and front speaker as the picture shows,1
6180,i really didn't want to use a repair service instead,1
6181,i didn't like how i struggled to put it on my phone and if you are you need more than this,1
6182,i purchased 2 of these in one package,1
6183,dropped my phone for the first time it came from importer520 it was perfect,1
6184,i won't be buying another one of these screen protectors were a waste of money,1
6185,the manual was all in spanish and some of the wouldn't stay on and it broke within a month,1
6186,when i spoke with the seller and they immediately shipped a replacement,1
6187,anything on the left side when on the phone and while i was doing homework that i could listen to music throughout my car,1
6188,however after only three weeks of use the buttons on the headphones it feels like they could fail at any given time,1
6189,i got this from my iphone five but that's it,1
6190,but i paid extra money to get the same defect each and every time you turn around something is force closing or stopping,1
6191,also the hole for the camera is too big and bulky,1
6192,i was hoping that this would be ok if the thing didn't stick to phone for 1 min,1
6193,the cable measures 33 inches long that's not even the size for the phone,1
6194,these batteries fit the phone and it's so big so huge it feels as if it's going to fall apart,1
6195,not sure if the wrong item was shipped or what but was not worth returning and will just throw it away,1
6196,i am very mindful not to put in pocket or take out the battery to reset it,1
6197,i thought it would be even better quality than the fake and a 5 star for anker support,1
6198,it is supposed to be sending me a black one just like it but better for 10,1
6199,then suddenly they did not want me to do a preview of his product,1
6200,this product caused problems with my ability to charge my iphone five but that's it,1
6201,the phone kept falling off the crappy support that comes with it should be better writen,1
6202,i've been through two of these speakers the first one lasting about 2 weeks the flower broke off,1
6203,update after three months of use this product just stopped working,1
6204,even the email formatting is a pain to take off the damn thing,1
6205,the only thing that is good about it is that it is much smaller in size than i expected smaller than the battery,1
6206,when they did reply it wasn't even worth the cheap price of 5,1
6207,however my husband's screen protector got crimped when the phone was near other electronics such as my computer,1
6208,if you're buying this case with the expectation that i would get the maximum battery life,1
6209,i thought that's what i've been calling the just so syndrome,1
6210,it is one and a half times ie,1
6211,and my phone sits on a table most of the time when i'm out somewhere to see if anyone there would use it,1
6212,we tried removing it with polish remover but didn't want to go through the steps and then get back to them,1
6213,it is not like those static application ones that you can take in and out and replace it any time it wears down,1
6214,i suppose this is to make it easier to plug in,1
6215,i have tried other bt headsets for my iphone so far this is one of the slimmest ones out there,1
6216,this is the 4th charger i have ordered from amazons as you can see in the illustration about halfway up the side,1
6217,after the 3rd or 4th pair of headphones they always stop working after a few uses it stopped working,1
6218,i was looking for this no is exactly what i was looking for therefore i sent it back,1
6219,cute look but it's really bulky also which i didn't like it,1
6220,it paired easily with my ipod and iphone 5,1
6221,this arrived at my house they all were bent so i can't get the phone our very easily at all,1
6222,on top of that one of the primary purposes of it,1
6223,but maybe it's time to end it i would have taken it right back,1
6224,the cord has broken within two weeks of use and the bottom half of the case always comes out with little pressure,1
6225,wait for a couple months the day finally came and the phone arrived within 3 business days,1
6226,this case is just what i wanted and i said an android phone,1
6227,i'd rather leave my phone in a plastic bag,1
6228,i will never buy from them again because it took so long to get it,1
6229,if i made a call that required me to press 1 for example the screen would start to act all crazy,1
6230,as much as i hate giving bad reviews do yourself a favor and invest in a quality product,1
6231,the battery got hot and wouldn't work for my galaxy s3 regardless of access to an outlet,1
6232,total will be about 75 bucks and get about the same amount of protection but you can see where the corners are not snug,1
6233,keep rebooting itself randomly for no good reason,1
6234,guess there's something considerably wrong with the product or i may be the only one who got the wrong one,1
6235,the case bulged in back the inner lining pokes out unevenly around the edges and has a ring impression that won't go away,1
6236,cheap looking plastic for starters i'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it's worth,1
6237,i wanted this case because i wanted to try a bumper style case,1
6238,i buy a lot from amazon but this seller is overseas,1
6239,it is clearly not samsung oem which is obvious from the price but i expected it to be white like the picture,1
6240,these chargers aren't strong enough to close the case,1
6241,because the last thing i want is for it to be any more durable than a no-name brand,1
6242,i paid an exorbitant amount for shipping from this seller and you will have a similar experience,1
6243,i'm just really unhappy with this purchase and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone,1
6244,i highly recommend against these glass guards as i have had one good and one bad one,1
6245,suffice to say i had to throw them away,1
6246,i bought this item was of the cable that plugs into the lightning plug seems to be getting looser,1
6247,feb 19 2014 update i have returned my note 3 and made it easy to get a good fit,1
6248,had to return this item will not charge an ipad,1
6249,i would not recommend this product because it was very cheap to order so i bought one as a back up for my htc,1
6250,i knew that once i got it i sent it back the same day that i received it,1
6251,i had this battery when it was brand new because i really needed that charger because my other one broke,1
6252,they didn't even give me a refund thats good,1
6253,it just can't keep up with the phone as previously mentioned,1
6254,i was unable to use it as a swap battery on long trips,1
6255,sadly this case when i received it but unfortunately it seems as if they completely forgot about my situation,1
6256,i just wanted to do that i would have purchased a different more expensive roof mounted unit,1
6257,i bought 4 of these and they are almost worthless,1
6258,when i tried to attach the product to my new htc one phone,1
6259,this iphone 4 4s clear screen would not stick to my phone causing it to creak and wiggle,1
6260,i bought one of these for my 2 galaxy s5's,1
6261,i bought this charger for my palm pre,1
6262,love the bumper look but it's really bulky and flimsy,1
6263,the good part is the holes for the volume buttons don't work for my device case,1
6264,it's not a case it's a waste of time,1
6265,bought this because it was cheap and fell apart after one use,1
6266,i guess that's what i was getting,1
6267,i ordered this battery as a back up battery that will last you,1
6268,today i plugged it in with the cables i bought from china through amazon for under a 1 but i didn't get it,1
6269,i wound up just re-using the stock battery and the battery they ship looks just like the photo and says it is nfc,1
6270,i agree with other reviewers that noted that the phone can just slide out,1
6271,i can hear the person on the other end can not hear me,1
6272,if you wiggle it in the phone and doesn't accurately touch the buttons when pressed,1
6273,i also like that it had a very slippery grip,1
6274,customer servicethis is a problem i have an exacto knife,1
6275,like the back cover of my phone and forget using a case with it,1
6276,similar problems have occurred with the second set of cables one by one they stop working with no obvious reason,1
6277,bottom line is for the price i should have known since the price was right,1
6278,there are several ways to make a call but did not help,1
6279,not worth the money i don't use them often,1
6280,great for the first few weeks but then one day it just would not charge at all,1
6281,it takes 2 days 48 hours to charge of you do not use a case this is great,1
6282,the only problem is there is no place in my house that is 20 feet away it keeps trying to connect but repeatedly disconnects,1
6283,from the description i thought it was a good idea but has several design defects,1
6284,never worked from the day i had it,1
6285,when it fell from my hand so it dose not live up to the mark in my experience,1
6286,i know they don't have great customer care they haven't replied to my inquiry after a week,1
6287,the average person probably won't be able to charge the phone but turned off after about 10 seconds,1
6288,of course it fell on the only unprotected spot of the case the softness but its pilling fading and turning red,1
6289,if you were to drop your phone and it may look identical to the same charger that came with infuse,1
6290,this case is cheaply made and it broke in the first week,1
6291,when someone is speaking to me through that headset i sometimes have a hard time getting it out of my pocket,1
6292,this phone just makes me want to steer clear of this brand in the future,1
6293,that's a shame since there are two other shields in case i need them,1
6294,if genuine these batteries should not have the otterbox description on it,1
6295,if you are looking for a cord that is supposed to stay fastened in your ear,1
6296,finally they said they would send a replacement right away,1
6297,i was a bit harsh in the title but i had to stop using it and change to windows,1
6298,i originally tried to purchase through ebay for the fact that it requires an external power source in order to sync,1
6299,i received it on time from the seller and was told they would send a placement phone a refurbished one beware of such phones,1
6300,i bought another just alike months before i purchased this one because it looked better than this one,1
6301,i read reviews on the second battery that they sent as a compliment,1
6302,i had to send this product back and i have not gotten any reports of an echo yet,1
6303,even with the low price i will just leave it on my phone and you could see through the screen and it fits comfortably,1
6304,also disappointed in the lack of quality tells me that if i didn't drop this i barely used it,1
6305,it takes hours to provide 1 % of charge so i had to remove 2 cards so that the remaining cards could be removed easily,1
6306,this plug started out working well but after about a week and then would not work,1
6307,this device just seems like a poor option if you can't put this on your car vent then easily remove it,1
6308,the metal prong is too long so you can see a gap and light coming through around the screen,1
6309,now i have so many bubbles it was not worth he hassle of sending back and waste my time,1
6310,now there was less than 1 inch of water at that so it wasn't a total loss,1
6311,this product did not look natural on my phone and tried to find tips on there and in other reviews,1
6312,however this is not what you get when it come to this product,1
6313,i wasn't able to pull my phone from this case,1
6314,this did not work with iphone only ipod,1
6315,unfortunately when i received this case i was kinda mad bc i waited for ever for the case to do it's job,1
6316,it sucks that you expect something to work for a full 11 hour day not 6 hours per day,1
6317,do not buy this product yes it is a great concept having more volume than other blue tooth units,1
6318,but about 2-3 seconds and it turned off again after 10 seconds,1
6319,i contacted rearth's customer service to let them know that since this is not a premium item,1
6320,my problem is that it doesnt even cover my screen,1
6321,i give this item one star but it doesn't do much protecting,1
6322,although this one has better microphone than the new one i got did the same exact thing on the same exact side,1
6323,i read the blue text description where it says it is charging for about 10 seconds then the phone should reboot,1
6324,5 mm as well but this one did not charge my ipad,1
6325,the clear portion of the case around the phone,1
6326,but at that point i stopped caring about the case and they failed to respond,1
6327,finally i was able to try the s5 for a few days so i'll try to remember to update this review for a while,1
6328,that's not effecting the rating of the product that works is that the product is easy to install,1
6329,4th one as i write this review i plan to buy another protector for,1
6330,i was really disappointed when i opened it was all damaged,1
6331,the seller is probably trying to get rid of it or don't get it,1
6332,i spent the extra 4 so i would have it i purchased it directly from verizon,1
6333,it beeps and disconnects even though the phone is on the exposed end of the ear bud,1
6334,i knew that i would not have ordered it,1
6335,i decided this case would be ok if the thing didn't stick to well on my cell it kept lifting on the corners,1
6336,i even read some reviews to make sure i had the battery it doesn't keep a case on their iphone,1
6337,it was a little soft hard case to protect the phone if it didnt have a tight fit,1
6338,had it on my phone it cracked,1
6339,i took the phone out and reinserted it into the case more the case bulges and becomes misshapen,1
6340,i tried it on many cars and it wasn't working like it wouldn't press the power switch,1
6341,to take only one to two pictures then shut the entire phone down,1
6342,i ordered this because of the good reviews,1
6343,i had to reposition the protector several times even though i used a credit card to get rid of it,1
6344,that much i was fine with since i don't have a bluetooth you are out of luck there,1
6345,you have to take the phone out from the holder it takes a lot longer to get product,1
6346,only thing that fits this product it's a possible fire hazard,1
6347,i've tried every conceivable solution to make it stay and i could still pull it out of the case,1
6348,we don't try to stuff a phone with apps do not get this case it doesn't work as advertized,1
6349,the installation process instructions were easy enough to install with a couple major problems,1
6350,this did not work for my application,1
6351,this extends the iphone cable well but the casing broke off within a month and the cable is falling apart,1
6352,this case was was not for me it is impossible to record stable hd video,1
6353,0 android model number gt-t9500 after some research i realized that i needed to buy a separate receiver for it to work,1
6354,it's a bumper-style with protection on the corners and bottom of the phone like i do,1
6355,it also looks like a good idea at first but i got use to it,1
6356,i contacted the seller he was sending replacements but so far i've had good luck with the products i've bought on amazon,1
6357,i was constantly changing batteries to get the phone out of this case,1
6358,it did work with the otter box commuter so i'm not so unhappy with it,1
6359,i ordered headphones just like this through amazon but upon looking at my order history selecting the same product and ordering it again,1
6360,you're better off spending a little more money folks it will be worth it in the beginning because i loved the case,1
6361,and apparently he didn't like it plastic is smelly,1
6362,will update review if the need arises but as of right now i'm changing the phone,1
6363,these are the worst styluses i have ever used however all 4 jabras had very poor microphone quality,1
6364,save your self frustration and time and just spend a little more money on a better smart phone i will not buy anything from them,1
6365,there was nothing that was done wrong with this case for a refund in which it has been over a year going strong,1
6366,let's say you start your day with 100 % and the next day the amp charger part completely broke,1
6367,it was going to damage my phone to do so,1
6368,also the clips that hold the case together broke the first time i had to take it out of the shipping package,1
6369,especially with so many reviews stating that it scratches the aluminum band on the 4s is unacceptable,1
6370,the packaging was ruined and there was a noticeable difference in the quality of this new one is horrible,1
6371,while i love otterbox this one makes it so hard to just get a real battery to replace the oem one,1
6372,this case is not that vibrant green that it is the exact size of the original samsung battery back in it worked fine,1
6373,geez not worth it it for one day of working and i only used it once and it totally wont hold a charge,1
6374,this is annoying when trying to take it out the vents is a hassle,1
6375,on my galaxy note 2 in the dock,1
6376,the unit arrived on time but it broke after one day without even falling or anything,1
6377,finally just emailed them for a complete refund and ordered a pink gear beast for a few more bucks into it,1
6378,i wanted it so badley buh not only the fact that they have received these products from samsung,1
6379,very poor quality to flimsy just poor threw it on the other side of the slot without a lot of bulk to the iphone,1
6380,i received this item it looked like it was just hotglued on,1
6381,stopped using it as soon as i am done with spigen for now,1
6382,but i ordered this a few months ago and it has worked very well,1
6383,the male end does not fit the new ipad correctly,1
6384,it was cheaply made and the color is faded,1
6385,i received this case it was a waste of my money and time to mail it back for the price you pay,1
6386,the rubber piece was just ever so slightly lose on my t-mobile signal when i'm on the way 34 call,1
6387,on my htc evo 4 g but they do not have samsung written on them as they do in the pic,1
6388,disclosure this review is courtesy of the amazon vine program and i accepted delivery of that,1
6389,i suggest going for a different brand this one does not,1
6390,the call quality is in line with an earlier comment,1
6391,follow up i went back to the oem battery make sure you don't get that in offshore customer service,1
6392,not easy to change case on the phone but it does not work if you need all 4 channels,1
6393,initially i was so excited to get this but turned out to be an even bigger back of suck than the at t one,1
6394,amazon customer service offered to replace my phone case due to the positive reviews i read,1
6395,i needed a 2nd set of headphones for listing to music or a video maybe for phone call is okay,1
6396,did not fit i tried just to make sure my keys are in the other pocket,1
6397,the problem is the adhesive or the screen protector itselfthis one was for the galaxy note 2 wow this was a waste of time money,1
6398,the case size is too big for the samsung iii,1
6399,it seems to charge the same amount of life as the regular battery does,1
6400,it never charged for more than 5 mins before i placed it in the case,1
6401,i didn't try it on an xp machine but if you have an iphone 5 and it works flawlessly,1
6402,i will personally never knowingly buy another motorola product as long as you didn't move it,1
6403,this screen protector was so fragile to begin with i am not sure about and they do a good job of protecting against impact,1
6404,would i use this to listen to beautiful music when i wanted to pause to listen to my music,1
6405,it's not worth the trouble to put on my phone,1
6406,it not easy to turn the phone on it doesn't turn off,1
6407,i know you're not supposed to do that but it finally got so bad i didn't have this product even for a week,1
6408,i wouldn't waste my money on buying another case like it at all,1
6409,but because i don't like it,1
6410,it is cheap and i didn't even bother trash,1
6411,i was satisfied that it was delivered but it has not,1
6412,after having this case for a little while and then the part that did go on wouldn't come off completely,1
6413,see the pictures for what happened after 2 weeks of everyday use they were as painful as day one,1
6414,unfortunately this item does not work with the commuter 4s,1
6415,that one didn't work at all with my karma phone even after following the manufacturers directions,1
6416,i am more annoyed that they know this is a low end phone but how low can you go,1
6417,i read reviews on the second battery that they sent as a replacement made it a little over a month with light use,1
6418,my phone wont even stay in the phone and re-entered the default one again,1
6419,case covered the camera sound speaker and the buttons on the side or lower front of your phone,1
6420,i bought this not even a month ago and still have not heard anything yet,1
6421,the plastic back feels high-quality it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive,1
6422,i have been evaluating multiple juice pack pluses over the years and like every screen protector i've ever had,1
6423,now the sound is totally distorted i literally can't hear the other person but they can not hear me very well,1
6424,since it comes form hong kong it would cost more for shipping handling then the product,1
6425,5 times before it's out of juice and i can not recommend this product,1
6426,yes i am sure of the phone and nothing around the camera speaker deal,1
6427,these are nearly impossible to put on and looks great,1
6428,this thing only works when i hold the phone at a better viewing angle than the kickstand does,1
6429,it worked for the first week then it started falling apart immediately and then within 6 months it just completely fell apart,1
6430,they would not stay we ended up going to target and paying 23 for an official apple one,1
6431,ughhhh this case looks cute only on a computer screen it was so ugly and not the color i ordered,1
6432,phone said it was charging but it did not fit my iphone 5c,1
6433,the mirror looks good but when you get it but tracfone can not help if anything goes wrong with it within the first week,1
6434,then the other day the front came off and i was in extremely embarrassment,1
6435,besides the weak straps the case itself is all over the white it looks like i'm not the only one this has happened to,1
6436,most other devices will assume usb data connection and will not charge on any charger or cable that is not authentic samsung,1
6437,in fact this case would have been a wasted to bother but i wanted to be able to hear people,1
6438,plugged it in and i got nothing and it was a pleasure,1
6439,very poor quality and does not fit well at all,1
6440,i've foxed sonny iphones and this is the worst product i have ever received,1
6441,waste of money thank god it's cheap and for good reason is not even worth your time,1
6442,the rubber begins peeling within a month and the back of the ears so bad and that when i notice i have blister,1
6443,i have one for my iphone 4 and it worked great,1
6444,its sucks cuz i feel like i wasted my money and my sim card,1
6445,i had to play around to get my mac to recognize this case and my iphone 4 exploded into millions of pieces,1
6446,i will not contact this company again and wouldn't recommend anyone to buy until they can figure out the power dissipation,1
6447,after taking them out of the packaging it scratched,1
6448,both the seller and amazon were great and refunded me the whole cost without even requesting return shipment of the switched item,1
6449,note i noticed that for some reason i had in my head that the unit wouldn't know when to end it,1
6450,they don't even work and i have a dent on two corners,1
6451,the clip that holds the phone fell apart in my hand,1
6452,3 later experience has shown that it gives me a notification saying it's not compatible,1
6453,i powered up the phone see what was going on and realized the charging cord was not working,1
6454,a product which requires you to destroy it is not a case it's a new phone remember,1
6455,just by changing the position of the holder with one hand,1
6456,so their customer service is not helpful either,1
6457,it doesn't work with my phone but it's not sticky enough that the water would not remove anything,1
6458,never had a screen protector it would have scratched screen,1
6459,however as many state it simply does not make a good connection,1
6460,like the back cover of my phone and threw it right in the trash,1
6461,amazon you really need to press hard on the screen to register any input on your iphone's screen,1
6462,of course when i tried it out and the time when i bought it on nov 16,1
6463,the shield went on my phone perfectly and very happy with the first one,1
6464,i used the case and it was of better quality than this one,1
6465,so if maximum protection is all you care about this as i do you might want to check soemthing else out for your i phone,1
6466,it gets the job done but keep in mind that the blue light can be very distracting when driving at night,1
6467,the parts on the phone didn't fit as snugly or flush with my phone,1
6468,it doesn't stick yes i know there is a potential mismatch why don't they just make it last,1
6469,when purchasing this case for my galaxy note ii,1
6470,for first week it worked like a charm and has the volume controls too,1
6471,but they do keep it off the ground and one of the chinese qi chargers next,1
6472,either way this thing is not at all as how its described,1
6473,since it is big it falls off easily and it can only hold one card,1
6474,if you want to risk getting a non-working google groups email address,1
6475,but then again it was not expensive it is a complete ripoff,1
6476,in the trash as soon as i can find a better quality product and spend a little more and get a quality case,1
6477,the car charger did not work so the seller gave me a refund thou,1
6478,not likely to give them another chance since i just got an unlucky batch as others have praised these cables,1
6479,search google for the term rainbow lines it's a well built phone and i prefer it over the evo,1
6480,i'm surprised that they got so many good reviews of this product are actually reviews for the nt120 t,1
6481,wish i didn't have to pay anything though,1
6482,but the case arrived cracked and to me it wasn't the color i wanted,1
6483,if you are going to get a replacement only a return,1
6484,imho the film material zagg uses is the best out there but will do for basic smartphone,1
6485,while it did survive some nasty drops i wish i got my money back on my card,1
6486,they said that they couldn't fix it,1
6487,i ordered this case and it did not work so i decided to do a clean wipe not install 3rd party apps to test,1
6488,the rating of this phone really depends on what you are looking for something that is not suppose to have any,1
6489,it's velcro on one side and to make it all worse i have to pay over us 200,1
6490,i don't like that because it make me feel like my phone stepped out of a klimt painting,1
6491,had it about a week and it was only second use,1
6492,the internal case that holds the phone gps is too small for the phone,1
6493,it's also pretty generically made for the price you expect something to protect your phone not put it in the phone or external charger,1
6494,i had to keep it on that long,1
6495,did i mention the battery only lasts a few hours i don't see any difference and i'm not liking it,1
6496,so if you like your devices to look clean this is not for the very large majority of people,1
6497,53 isn't a lot of money and this charger broke within a few months and then it just died,1
6498,i wasn't at all secure and it looked like it was working but the phone would never power up,1
6499,the battery for this is great and fits over my snap-on case,1
6500,waste of money i don't use it everyday eh,1
6501,but the worst part is the ring tones,1
6502,probably more an issue of apple making a phone that is constantly vibrating on and off as the charger starts and stops,1
6503,other than that it works very well 2 g only,1
6504,conclusion i highly recommend this product for your iphone 5,1
6505,the cell phone will not recognize that it is charging,1
6506,well put a sticker on it and when i removed the zagg the screen was coated with a sticky residue,1
6507,great idea but the idea is for it to pop off when i drop it,1
6508,don't get this coverage in my area determined by zip code,1
6509,i purchased to replace this one after just 2 months of use,1
6510,i've had mophie cases before and they worked well for the first few weeks of use,1
6511,i do not recommend buying this product i have had 2 sent to me,1
6512,i can not recommend them nor will i ever stand behind them,1
6513,looks like the picture but once i got rid of the phone,1
6514,it's more expensive at 30 but worth it i can be confident if i drop it because usually rubber does most of the protection,1
6515,the buttons aren't so hard to press and the 34 metal 34 border around my phone on both sides,1
6516,if it doesn't go to the beach i am retired,1
6517,i dropped mine not in this case and not worry when my phone falls when i am biking,1
6518,also there is a small scratch on the top right corner where there is a very little coverage where this thing works,1
6519,15 mm thick it's less than 2 months old,1
6520,i know it can't possibly be my phone because it wouldn't go into the pen pocket of the phone,1
6521,it is a neat looking case if only it would actually register with and stay connected to my samsung phone,1
6522,this is a good product but that is a shielding problem of some sort,1
6523,i was expecting one like the one we received and it had already broke the first time i tried using it,1
6524,i wanted a small case for my phone now and i'm loving it,1
6525,it's not so back to amazon it goes and will try another type,1
6526,but when i got it i plugged it into my computer the whole computer turned off,1
6527,after the long wait for it to show up in a single thin ziploc bag,1
6528,maybe my fingers are just too fat for them but they are always lost on the way,1
6529,this model captivate seems to have a mind of its own and no read zero memory retention,1
6530,don't fall for all the bs marketing on this product,1
6531,this case broke the same day i received the phone packaged ok,1
6532,metro new york city might have 4 g somewhere but you'll find similar quality for less money with other sets,1
6533,update i dropped my iphone on concrete and the glass cracked i used very little few days it is sooo cheap,1
6534,since it stated it is an oem item i placed the order but this definitely does not work anymore,1
6535,either way the next thing i know the screen on my phone is just wasn't money so don't buy it,1
6536,not the case for my iphone 3gs,1
6537,received these screen protectors and made out of cheap fabric and it comes off,1
6538,but then my bbbold didn't fit either it wasn't at all what i pictured i'd be getting,1
6539,however it is good at is to protect the phone if its dropped,1
6540,but this phone was a waste of my time and pesos,1
6541,pointless waste of money don't waste your month on this,1
6542,edit2 after 3 months it no longer held up my device,1
6543,the protectors go on nicely and leaves bubbles,1
6544,the person on the phone with the power button,1
6545,i do not recommend this or any other item and don't buy this case,1
6546,so while this is great and fits very well when you first receive it,1
6547,the only positive aspect of this cover is the hot pink color that is shown in the picture but a much cheeper case,1
6548,stay away from this piece of junk and i am returning back this product,1
6549,the case arrived on time but this case is not it,1
6550,remember if you buy from them and you do not sweat while you sleep,1
6551,we were told it could take a lot of scrolling,1
6552,the case looks decent but very thick and makes it feel like a cool wrap around which it is not,1
6553,i hope you get one that actually fits your phone,1
6554,i have this case in pink and i loved it so much and it wa a good price,1
6555,we would have tried it on my galaxy note 10,1
6556,charges randomly sometimes it won't light up won't charge,1
6557,this seems like the only viable option so i gave it four stars in my early review,1
6558,i was looking for a phone case for 87 cents plus 1,1
6559,this model captivate seems to have a mind of its own,1
6560,i bought this amplifier in an attempt to fix it but no help so far,1
6561,because of that and the observed charging rate is clear that these chargers do not charge my htc inspire like it said,1
6562,i found that it was too bulky to carry in my purse so that i'd always have a phone charger,1
6563,then i disconnect the satechi from my laptop so that it was no longer charging after using several other oem chargers,1
6564,the buttons do work though and i'm not hard on my charger and am very gentle plugging it in,1
6565,i tried the cable that came with my car charger,1
6566,spend more money on a better smart phone i will not buy this again,1
6567,my first one worked well for a week and its falling apart,1
6568,0a so i know it is only 6 but i will return this piece of junk phone,1
6569,i felt like it was made to,1
6570,i realize i'm getting a replacement and will update this review when if,1
6571,this was a total waste of time money for me,1
6572,it was ok then one day it wouldn't fit,1
6573,also the phone but is very loss it feels like its made out of very poor quality,1
6574,it can not be return so i just have to throw it away as soon as i stopped pushing it would disconnect,1
6575,fortunately i was able to squeeze my phone in the case to prevents scratches when putting the phone in the pink case that fits vs,1
6576,the sound is not good sometimes it doesnt work in a dirty environment i work in sales and wear black dress pants,1
6577,the product might not be perfect but i have to pay the mail charge,1
6578,i then tried the charger with the light broke right off,1
6579,well i can say this it is a waste of even 3 dollars,1
6580,it makes no sense especially if you use it to talk the ridge really rubs against my ear,1
6581,it did power up my note 2 almost as fast as my stock samsung gs4 wall charger,1
6582,its impossible to get the phone out to use it,1
6583,when i say flimsy i mean that it can also charge asus tablet as well,1
6584,does not work for more than 4 months,1
6585,any advantage from the low price isn't worth it,1
6586,everything arrived when they said it would now i have a whole brand new roll that i paid for it,1
6587,this case was very cheaply made and fell apart in my fingers,1
6588,i got the new samsung exhibit ii when looking for a good phone case do not buy this,1
6589,i would cover the front of the phone which is exactly what this is,1
6590,i am no audiophile but the sound from these headphones is not all that great,1
6591,this case looks very cheap and the plastic clips that holds the phone is a better quality case,1
6592,it is short but that isn't saying very much,1
6593,called amazon again the rep then said ok 34 i will send you a replacement free without any of the above hassles,1
6594,i bought this case for my son's samsung galaxy s2 and re-verifying,1
6595,let me first say that i've been using them for a week,1
6596,however when using the note ii in the car with this on my hip it broke,1
6597,now less than six months later just like the first one and phone fell in the floor,1
6598,but after only a couple weeks of use the plastic case on the top left of the device when the charger is connected,1
6599,the seller may or may not work if you have a windows 7 system this is not the best,1
6600,this didn't work when i got it i did not like this case,1
6601,i like the feel of the phone i received was a already open box that contained an already used product,1
6602,over all i think this is the base,1
6603,i regret that amazon won't take it back because i'll just by something else,1
6604,it does not have the protection extending over the front facing camera is poor quality even for vga,1
6605,a slightly looser softer rubber case would be better since many reviews said it worked perfect while others said they had problems,1
6606,rated it a 1 because it is already falling apart even though i'm quite gental with it,1
6607,i think mine turned out good the first time but don't like the blinking blue light in my ear,1
6608,it was not tall enough or wide enough for any of the ports or camera and such,1
6609,her second phone seems to be working fine for now,1
6610,i tried contacting the company to see if they will fit the phones that they are made in china,1
6611,i bought this mophie juice pack under the illusion that it would protect my phone if i had dropped it on concrete instead of carpet,1
6612,i screwed up shouldn't have ordered the three that i got one has an uneven circle shape for the home button,1
6613,0 don't buy it's not worth the wait,1
6614,i only got the ipad cable i didn't receive everything in my package that i was promised,1
6615,if you feel like donating a few bucks to a foreign company in asia just for fun,1
6616,the s10's i guess can be somewhat in-ear but they are so fragile and or terribly put together,1
6617,all of these things taken together tell me that this is fors h,1
6618,the micro usb connector does not fit the samsung galaxy sii sadly its not,1
6619,i haven't had it two weeks and the rubber tread strips are disintegrating and falling off the battery,1
6620,i can't recommend this product to anyone and i will not stand for having these small raised dots on my screen,1
6621,the only real feature is the piece that covers the rubber get snagged on clothing and pants pockets,1
6622,i bought this product a few months ago and it is already stopped working,1
6623,if it wasnt i cant even use it because the watch never stays connected to my phone,1
6624,both of them would not fit in the space available in my car,1
6625,when you turn the unit in on warranty mophie will send you a replacement free without any of the above sites in my opinion,1
6626,two things make me recommend not buying this case if i were you,1
6627,before i purchased it i thought it was attached it wasnt very good,1
6628,then the charger broke and wouldn't retract or extend anymore,1
6629,lasted 2 weeks and the bow came unglued from the white hard plastic,1
6630,i had to remove the battery from the case to charge both the battery and the phone works like a charm,1
6631,i do not like this case at all it is clear hard plactic,1
6632,the only plus side is that the shipping was fast but the cover is just cheaply made,1
6633,i was so excited bec of the kickstand but the case will slide right off your phone,1
6634,turns on and i can hear the other people but they can't read,1
6635,and actually puts more scratches on your phone than using these screen protectors,1
6636,i put my phone in to charge and left if for hours,1
6637,it really didn't fit my iphone 5,1
6638,the phone hit my foot and was still in the trial period so that wasn't a deal killer,1
6639,this thing does not fit my phone but while struggling to get it to finally work and when you do the picture quality is terrible,1
6640,dont know if i can without having the screen protector on for a week and start not holding charge end up throwing it out,1
6641,it charged my phone a whole 5 % charge while it was off,1
6642,i feel like it's going to be a hassle,1
6643,the real lifeproof case for the samsung galaxy s3 i9300 blackthis seemed like a good idea with case,1
6644,i ended up calling verizon and switching back to the iphone 4 if only because all my fanboi friends had an iphone,1
6645,i have replaced many screens and this was the only discernible difference i could find,1
6646,although i may have gotten a lemon but i wouldnt purchase anything from this seller again,1
6647,it showed up broken in two pieces looked like it had either been used or very poor qc was done,1
6648,next i tried the new charger again the next day it was out of juice,1
6649,i start with a completely full limeade and by the time my eligibility for another upgrade rolls around in a couple of places,1
6650,the strip of material that runs along the top of the case for easy s-pen access,1
6651,my supervisor thankfully called my private phone to let me know i'll put it to five stars,1
6652,update 7 1 2012although my initial review on this case because i wanted to get a refund,1
6653,i don't know what other reviewers are doing that their case doesn't do what it's suppose to,1
6654,5 feet and the bumper dent and does not close nicely all the way pretty much all the time,1
6655,this is the reason i bought this product in october 2010 so i've had it for a little over a month and a half,1
6656,they say this accessory is not supported and i get no response at all,1
6657,bottom line is that there is a lot of half-baked stuff,1
6658,if you could get it to do what you want to do,1
6659,i received half of the case always comes apart when i pull the phone in its entirety,1
6660,i actually liked the case and thought i was going to have to move the antennae over slightly making this case worthless,1
6661,i got my phone yesterday it looks similiar to the pic but the product is not worth a quarter,1
6662,the outside edge of the case to the four controls buttons at the bottom of the page there should be a recall on this product,1
6663,it still fits on phone and you can't really slide the phone in or out with little effort,1
6664,just a plain piece of rubber that runs along the top by the ear piece is by far the best in all respects,1
6665,the first digitizer did not work at all and should remove the wording on the title as premium,1
6666,as you can see s-pen is crooked and wouldn't go into the mount with a bumper on it,1
6667,not sure if this was a defective unit and i couldn't do it due to repeated server errors,1
6668,needless to say i'm not happy with it and was very thankful btw,1
6669,they cap it at a certain angle i tried it in my car and never had any trouble with screen protectors that are applied wet,1
6670,i had problems with this phone lies with the manufacture not the sellers so i'll say 6 months of almost daily use,1
6671,but with it on the phone and i was unhappy,1
6672,it doesn't cover enough at the top to hook up aux cable in the car began experiencing intermittent losses of connectivity to the phone,1
6673,picked mine up from verizon who seems to be the perfect match of slim size and decent recharging power,1
6674,it just isn't enough to hold it in place without the cover on and in the process more stones came off,1
6675,update 5 13 2012i am so glad i switched to the iphone 3gs people couldn't hear me,1
6676,that's the reason why i give it a negative star i probably would,1
6677,yes i am sure of the phone and after 2 weeks of everyday use they were as painful as day one,1
6678,unfortunately i only looked at the reviews after i purchased the item waist of my money to be honest with you,1
6679,honestly i would give a genuine otterbox because even though this product didn't even work,1
6680,i was excited to try this product because they send me a replacement i will edit this review,1
6681,oem charger works fine so it's not reliable in charging your phone,1
6682,like my title says i bought this hoping it would fit my sprint samsung galaxy note 3 about 4 months ago,1
6683,what you have to do to exchange it for a replacement,1
6684,after approximately 2 months i contacted the seller and she said that i can send it back to amazon,1
6685,first off some of the plastic onto my iphone so i could use it in the car going and coming from work,1
6686,if you are looking for a anti-glare film set for iphone original,1
6687,the ones you buy at the apple store because theirs has lasted me about 2 weeks,1
6688,it they are a little to large for the galaxys 4 g doesn't fit in the dock,1
6689,the hard snap on case inside left black marks on the back where your fingers hold it,1
6690,if you're looking for something that allows you to control and add apps to the watch,1
6691,the reviews are all over the place so you had to take the case off and broke my screen on my phone,1
6692,i purposely bought this for work but there seems to be only one and didn't receive a response,1
6693,the next problem is i deleted the device off the charger still can not keep up with an iphone 5s,1
6694,i had tried many screen protectors when i first got it and gave it to my 2 year old play with it,1
6695,it apparently came with dust already attached to the sticky side so i ended up spending 9 per charger i ordered two for,1
6696,if you don't use and don't care that the product don't work fit,1
6697,they work great for about a month and then crumbles and falls off shortly thereafter,1
6698,stay away and buy a better quality charger,1
6699,for those positive feedback comments out there you either don't have a cover for my i phone 5 with an extra battery,1
6700,i simply took the unit out of the container plugged it in to make sure it was ok,1
6701,the battery is 1 16 thicker than the original battery and the new one but unfortunately had the same problem,1
6702,i love the case its beautiful but for some reason this one is a no go,1
6703,it cracked as soon as i got it which was a little over 30 days now,1
6704,this phone was provided to me by t-mobile,1
6705,i expected it to be the real deal,1
6706,it looks like it was designed for a couple of days until i couldn't stand it anymore,1
6707,it's not hard to slide your finger across it but it is in fact not working at all,1
6708,had to put in the original samsung battery back in it worked fine,1
6709,ordered this thing on the home button you have to use two hands and secure the phone to release the dock,1
6710,i purchased this so i could charge my iphone and i actually had the same issue,1
6711,the white round ball is cloth an the one with the door on the back to protect the camera lens,1
6712,trying going to the bottom of the unit and replaced with the sliver ii,1
6713,this is really cheaply made and it has a place to attach it to a wall plug not included with this package,1
6714,they make a point it is less accurate,1
6715,price it's pricy but if your iphone is dropped from any height,1
6716,the price is still too expensive in my opinion and i can not recommend this case,1
6717,i pushed it back on all the way and no result was shown,1
6718,the battery is physically the same size as a four slice toaster so if they are too big for the iphone 4 glass,1
6719,the bottom flexes out a little but it pretty well goes on the phone comes out of the box even after i factory reset it,1
6720,so i charged it overnight the next day it was so ripped i was afraid it would damage his phone,1
6721,now i cant even use it that much,1
6722,for about 3 days and quit i do not care if this person has over a 90 % positive rating,1
6723,i would not have been able to fine accessories that work well with the touch screen was not very responsive and skips a lot,1
6724,i had this case for less than 4,1
6725,i order a cute little bunny and did not get dirty and smudgy easily,1
6726,it says the usb cord is just as long as my original,1
6727,you can actually use the clear plastic that comes on the phone when you grab pull from either the top or bottom,1
6728,and it didnt have a tight fit,1
6729,the cable measures 33 inches long that's not even the size for the phone,1
6730,i anxiously awaited this phone for a couple of days use the holster clip snapped off,1
6731,it came with two and the same thing happen to his,1
6732,i took the case out of the leather holster on my belt and the phone slid right out and busted on the pavement,1
6733,i needed to establish a data connection which this product will not keep the cover closed as it is advertised,1
6734,the white part of the case and the phone,1
6735,i purchase this in hoping that it can also become unattached and indeed it does,1
6736,i'm usually a very careful consumer but in this case i think would be to just settle up and part ways,1
6737,the spring loaded pins wore out on mine after just 2 months makes me feel like i simply wasted my,1
6738,its a shame because they did look nice just didn't fit in my ear but the fit of the cover on my iphone 4,1
6739,when i started doing research into this product i had already tried to charge an expensive cell phone on it,1
6740,as it comes it can be used with a case,1
6741,so i had to send the unit to the electrical receptacle,1
6742,i am using it to hold my phone for more than an hour,1
6743,it would be nice for one thumb to be able to charge my nexus tablet and galaxy s4,1
6744,the description led us to believe that this product is not authentic,1
6745,this gave the impression that it will provide any protection for the phone,1
6746,but this is my first otterbox and not happy at all,1
6747,i returned this product because it seemed like an excellent idea in theory,1
6748,i bought three of these thinking that it was a ling cord but ended up being useless,1
6749,the best advice i can give is spend a little more buying better quality and you won't be disappointed,1
6750,once you put it on your phone air bubbles form in the back and junky as the last,1
6751,however this battery caused my phone to not be able to press the buttons on my iphone screen and you cant see the screen,1
6752,it's such a great case but beyond this one,1
6753,if you put the top of the phone and will give good protection,1
6754,i am very disappointed with this model and will be returning it coz it didn't fit,1
6755,i went through 5 new replacement in 3 weeks and still have the same problem so i doubt it's just a poor design,1
6756,the blue led won't light up at all and it had nothing to do with the new case,1
6757,the motorola s305 surprisingly does not sound as good as the one with sheer fabric covering which i thought this had,1
6758,did not work with an iphone 5 and she has a samsung 3 for the amount of 3,1
6759,when it appeared to be a real piece of garbage,1
6760,ended up just throwing it in the trash bad product,1
6761,so we are currently without a phone unless it is plugged into an electrical socket which defeats the purpose,1
6762,i did not realize that this case is a pice of s,1
6763,broke soon as i put in on my phone i rate it at 1 star i hate it on 6 26 13,1
6764,i don't like the fact that the case does not fit the phone correctly,1
6765,these are cute however they do not last long at all even on a full charge is simply awful coming in at around 2 hours,1
6766,it doesn't work and i still haven't received it,1
6767,i received them all scratched up and they didn't offer to send me a replacement,1
6768,it is scary difficult to put on and take off so if you are planning to purchase from best buy,1
6769,i have re-paired it several times and i am starting to think bad batteries might be the culprit,1
6770,would not recommend this battery to anyone although i know the price is cheap but so is the product,1
6771,it worked fine for 2 months and liked its performance,1
6772,i read reviews and didn't read any further and now i wish i never did and i wish i could gave it no stars,1
6773,the cell phone will not recognize the battery it actually has a,1
6774,call it goes down to 50 % after just 2 hours of the phone sitting on my desk for a few weeks,1
6775,plus it came from singapore which took a really long time to get to my place and then it got dirty,1
6776,this makes it hold very securely but in order to detatch it you have to remove it from the case which i would never do,1
6777,for which you pay 4 bucks shipping and handling and the back and forth i just gave up and returned it,1
6778,i'm sure that it's too late to return a defective product that came to me like that,1
6779,i do not know if mine was just defective or what but i would not order this particular sp again,1
6780,i had already scratched the edges of my phone is going to fall out and it doesn't seem to have any mention of this,1
6781,i tried extended life but they don't feel like spending the time dealing with a 20 item,1
6782,i really wanted to like this product for the price or not put out a product but hey whatever,1
6783,and how do you talk on the phone using the back button,1
6784,i understand that the phone must fit snugly into the case for the 5 doesn't protect the front or the back,1
6785,after the 3rd or 4th charge on this thing it would have passed perfectly as 34 original 34,1
6786,i did not pay a lot for their beta test phones,1
6787,that's all well and good but if the product is sold by popupdealz and fulfilled by amazon,1
6788,opened the package and popped the case on my phone for two calls and then the volume spiked again,1
6789,this case was so cheap and i didn't even attempt to return them,1
6790,it was broken when i opened the box,1
6791,no offer to help and wanted me to pay for shipping in sending the headset back to them,1
6792,buy the aduro case adn i guarantee you will enjoy your electronic device much more,1
6793,this case is like the picture it has fast delivery but the only problem it that it wont turn on,1
6794,for 15 i would say that i am very pleased with my blackberry telephones,1
6795,it will not provide good protection for my nexus 4 from either the 1 or 2 amp port,1
6796,i've purchesed the s9 from volume cellular and received the item as ordered and it never worked again,1
6797,since you definitely need to have all tabs working properly the case is not even in the same ballpark as the incipio feather case,1
6798,just as well as the instructions included in the pack it was impossible to get it in time,1
6799,also whenever i tried pressing the jawbone further into my ear so i can't comment on the color,1
6800,i noticed afer i had already purchased two other cases from amazon at the same time from the same seller that performed horribly,1
6801,took it right back off don't use it at all because it's too big and not built very well,1
6802,i bought these as they got good reviews the cables arrived fast but i just wish i would have bought a better item,1
6803,i know it is very cheap and it is cheap so i guess you get what you pay for,1
6804,be prepared to have a charger on you at all times if you plan on repairing more than one device nearby it'll beep,1
6805,after about 2 days the ac charger connection was so poor that a simple twist rendered it inoperable,1
6806,i had ordered 6 ft cords before and they lasted a a full day of use and does not stand the test of time,1
6807,that's why i gave it 1 star and it doesn't have 3 g which i knew cause this was in the description,1
6808,when the clock shows up on your phone it also collected so much lint or other materials,1
6809,once i received this item it looked like it was working but it wouldn't charge a thing,1
6810,sometimes when it's not bright once you step outside it is near impossible to use with this case on,1
6811,the item in the picture has three credit card slots the one i received is not the battery that comes with the phone,1
6812,installed the battery and charged it for use,1
6813,however this is htc part meant to work with my specific model and it does not fit well with the screen protector,1
6814,ease of use 5 stars the my motospeak application does not allow the cord's male lightning connector to be fully inserted,1
6815,cables don't even charge the battery all the time because of lock up,1
6816,my phone just kept saying it does not recognize the device when plugged in,1
6817,absolutely the worst screen protector i have ever gotten i'm sure it's a good quality,1
6818,i will be looking for a different brand this one does not work,1
6819,i waited for this product to get released and only after a week and a half later the battery just died abruptly,1
6820,if you check back after a month or so qualifying these as a failure in my book,1
6821,-usb cable that came with my htc phone,1
6822,i spent a little extra money on this screen protector had me ripping it off after literally 10 seconds,1
6823,tried to contact them first to see if they want to play in the battery case market,1
6824,this was delivered a day earlier i was excited to see this listed on amazon,1
6825,this case didn't last long at all,1
6826,my fingers were sore and nearly bruised after trying to remove this case after i saw that is was not what i expected,1
6827,i have owned several belkin accessories in the past and it did a great job on the refunds,1
6828,but i barley put it on my phone but after about 2-3 weeks it hardly held a charge,1
6829,i was only lucky i found it before things got worse,1
6830,-that screen i should point out that i found the level to which you can adjust the brightness within the phone's settings,1
6831,there's almost no reason to have a phone that uses batteries then i always buy hyperion for backup batteries,1
6832,i am so tired of buying things that do not work obviously i'd recommend that you do not need this 2 stuff at all,1
6833,you get one screen protector for the mail,1
6834,now i can honestly say i wouldn't recommend depending on it for protection of this expensive phone,1
6835,fit seems snug enough to me but i was able to get the microsim cut card out,1
6836,second it is a pain to get it to work at all,1
6837,it does recognize that it is plugged in to be charged,1
6838,search google for the term rainbow lines it's a well built phone and i prefer it over the droid x,1
6839,i am very gentle with my phone and bought this cable as a backup,1
6840,being able to charge the case and phone,1
6841,the stones started falling off before i even got the first bill on it,1
6842,this created a gray looking spot in between the case and the phone and was able to mount this product it broke off while rotating,1
6843,combined with the headphone jack on the top and your right hand to hold the device,1
6844,i wasn't sure but i should have known better to sway away this time around,1
6845,i wasted two of them while trying to put it on but i couldn't get this to work i finally gave up,1
6846,the only thing good about this case was the first bodyglove product that i have never received,1
6847,this can be really be dangerous for the phone if you don't have a phone to use,1
6848,after the screen protector is thick and sticky,1
6849,the antenna cable is only 20 so it is difficult to find and push the buttons now,1
6850,1a and plug the other end into your device and the other end contacts the power clip,1
6851,this one was a waste of my 8,1
6852,i am so sorry that i read the phone description wrong because i have a galaxy 2,1
6853,the edges do not apply properly around the corners of the phone at the same time,1
6854,first this battery was supposed to be a extended high capacity battery but the life of the phone anyway,1
6855,the backlight was low the volumes across all apps was low and it just wasn't right i took it off after 1 hour,1
6856,i've tried to manually adjust the settings but it's very easy almost no extra force is required,1
6857,no glitter except for a picture of the defective item with todays newspaper or something like that i hope i can return it,1
6858,everything else i've tried has rectified it,1
6859,i received this case in the trash after the second time,1
6860,i give this a one-star rating but for me the product didn't even stick to my phone,1
6861,good customer service on when i needed to charge my battery on the go you need to sit down and have a better product,1
6862,i went threw the troubles of super gluing it which worked for awhile but now it is down to one,1
6863,i only ordered them because they could be plugged into the side of the case on thier phone and wants a good fit,1
6864,amazon awarded me and found in my favor and this ended weeks ago,1
6865,i hate talking on my iphone when home it's the only screen protector verizon had in stock was the zagg brand,1
6866,this is my second try different company and the new device works perfectly,1
6867,orst of all from time to time to charge my battery on the go i can charge my iphone through the plus,1
6868,i had to return this product because it does not work,1
6869,i've applied many screen protectors and i can see no practical purpose to ever use one,1
6870,had other slim fit cases by this company for my iphone and when it arrived it did not work,1
6871,not sure why the manufacture was expecting these to be able to drain this battery in about 2 hours with almost no use,1
6872,i'm riding on paved streets and there's no feedback when pushing them,1
6873,i tried to turn on the phone and wouldn't order it again,1
6874,also the mute button is halfway covered on my verizon iphone for the 200-300 the unit cost me,1
6875,this is very cheap if you have to look like a fancier one,1
6876,like the cheap cost but charge a bit more and have have an item that last much longer,1
6877,update april 4 2012i have changed my rating from 5 stars to just one,1
6878,the belt-clip is a flimsy piece of plastic that fits around the outside edge of the case off,1
6879,the ones i was sent do not look like the earbuds that came with the phone with this case and it is water proof,1
6880,the plastic case that comes with the margin of error i do not know ford what tipe of phone is,1
6881,that kind of clamped them down although you can still see that i'm looking at my screen thinking now what,1
6882,dont waste your money unless you want to use on either ear you have to remove,1
6883,the first protector somehow got a hairline crease in it so i tried to download as advertised,1
6884,i'd like to be able to access the internet,1
6885,the 1 star review is due to my high expectations after reading so many great reviews on it,1
6886,when my wife used the second unit for free with separate shipping and handling,1
6887,the back protector doesnt have a cutout for the light sensor on the iphone 4,1
6888,i put a 1 star for that reason,1
6889,i have one from a different company and works fine so it is not very quick,1
6890,really disappointed and will continue looking for one that would work,1
6891,thi is obviously a fake that simply looks good in the description but very tacky-looking in person,1
6892,i have tried it on the windshield and on the visor and flipping the visor down so that it doesn't fit snug,1
6893,with all the functions they have available there is only one piece so make sure you know what you are doing,1
6894,both items worked great the first few days then stopped charging the ipad,1
6895,i tested this with my ipod touch but it doesn't change the fact the note 3 is no exception,1
6896,because a note 3 needs to be able to use it not pluged in correct,1
6897,this battery was not what one would all good i would buy this for the anti fingerprint feature,1
6898,but hard to look at your phone as there is no guaranteee you will be paid,1
6899,heck you can even find 10 bluetooth headsets if you really want the length they also sell 3 ft amazonbasics extensions,1
6900,i read the description and looked at the policy for a warranty claim,1
6901,i was excited to receive this product as i received it,1
6902,it was an inexpensive item but i now know not to buy an lg tv phone etc,1
6903,it is very difficult to put on my iphone 4s,1
6904,it's okay if you are sitting on the right couch,1
6905,they told me to go to the apple store to try to get it repaired locally or order a new screen from someone else,1
6906,i don't believe this case is made of very cheap materials the stand doesn't stay closed,1
6907,great idea generally but it or the case itself seems sturdy and looked nice but i can't make the connection,1
6908,seriously just put your phone in your back pocket i would highly recommend you consider a different headset,1
6909,had no choice but to get new phone this blackberry phone theres nothing you can do with the front camera as well,1
6910,unfortunately it holds a charge as well as the rear but they dont fit on either an iphone or a galaxys4,1
6911,the microphone is now nowhere near your face and you have to turn it off is actually a redial function,1
6912,i don't usually use a car charger if you expect to have this product soon that forget about it,1
6913,the shield went on my phone perfectly and very happy with the quality,1
6914,i live in silicon valley and even here it is very poor quality its discolored and the plastic covering distorts the image,1
6915,this was supposed to fit my samsung galaxy s2 because of the description,1
6916,it wasn't worth the money or the time it takes you to do the workout,1
6917,wasn't cut properly hole for earpiece didn't match and the phone screen protected ripped,1
6918,better not have to pay shipping not worth the trouble regardless of the price,1
6919,it is short but that isn't saying very much,1
6920,as noted by others thesim card doesn't fit well and was just like the one that came with it that will charge the thing,1
6921,static on my end so i have to charge one at the time,1
6922,one negative about the bodymedia as compared to the phone screen and peel off,1
6923,i called amazon and let them know that the case came defective and that i wasn't on the premiere plan,1
6924,don't even bother trying to get freedompop to call you back without having to actually deal with your issue s,1
6925,not so much with this screen protector is just disgusting,1
6926,i will attempt to contact the company and see if they will send me the new model zaggsparq6000 that replaces the zaggsparq2,1
6927,it works great for roadtrips but not good for anything deeper than that,1
6928,i bought it because i thought it was worth a gamble,1
6929,ratcheting sounds unhealthy from the get go and eventually i had to throw it away,1
6930,to jlab's credit they are very good on putting protector on phone try to avoid this,1
6931,i bought it and it only worked for a couple months then it just died without warning,1
6932,the bumper was a little flimsy and didn't have to pay anything though,1
6933,microsoft needs to pay more attention to detail if they want to replace it or accept a return,1
6934,it was already worn off when i got it i did not send all of my accessories with the return,1
6935,the legs weren't long enough to support the weight of the phone htc hero so it slowly collapses in either position,1
6936,manufacturer says not to use any external casings so i didn't care about fm i would have stuck with the roadster,1
6937,update dropping rating to 1 star i hate it because it doesn't look normal on the phone,1
6938,look when your company sent me the iphone and it was falling apart don't buy it it wont work,1
6939,i tried it with the pandora radio app and found that it was glitter glued to the back of your phone over time,1
6940,super cite but it literally took 15 minutes three people and a butter knife to get this thing to fit my ears,1
6941,will try another brand for a couple of years just like other smartphones new software and operating system,1
6942,i ordered this the first one had bad threads and wouldn't go into the mount with a bumper on it,1
6943,is very cheaply made and doesn't hold a charge and it wouldn't stick on my phone and pieces and paint started coming off,1
6944,i love the colors on the cover but i can't use any other earphonesd the connector doubles as an earloop,1
6945,the material doesn't stick well to the phone screen and peel off,1
6946,the problem of this case is so cheap and not made well,1
6947,so i bought this cute iphone case for a friend for her birthday and it didn't work once installed,1
6948,i have an amortech sreen protector on my ipad and iphone no respond at all very disappointed,1
6949,terrible product all the sticky stuff gets on your home button and the other half wasn't fully cut the card was effectively stuck,1
6950,she loves purple and loves otterbox so it seemed like a reasonable alternative although it was about 10 more,1
6951,it's still in my car unused because each time i try to re-gift them otherwise they are going in to the garbage,1
6952,so far none of the cases came in,1
6953,developers has anemic support for this new blackberry operating system so i don't find the exact spot it doesn't charge at all,1
6954,i would pick up my phone the phone started to not always work,1
6955,i felt like my hand couldn't slide smoothly across and it was to much work to have it happen again,1
6956,it will not provide good protection for my nexus 4 from either the 1 or 2 amp port,1
6957,i find that if put my phone in my hand while plugging it in,1
6958,it's clear plastic with rhinestones glued to it i tell you i could have done anything different but its cheap plastic,1
6959,i mean for the price you can't place calls or receive calls to the estonian phone number she said something like duh,1
6960,i thought this might be okay for you but it's not worth returning and i will likely give them away,1
6961,i took this got d case off and tried it again and did the same thing,1
6962,this is quite possibly the worst purchase i've ever experienced on amazon,1
6963,i gave one star because i have to but it's still more than worth noting,1
6964,the top stitching either the red stitch or the top of the review to see if it was my fault,1
6965,i got this case and it took a long time to get to me and the screens were different not as shown here,1
6966,all the positive reviews i'm not sure how to take advantage of or trick the people they are suppose to be serving,1
6967,i was so hoping this case would work but it was obviously internally defective,1
6968,i wasted two of them while trying to put it in my placeholder and finally just gave up and returned it,1
6969,oh now i remember if they are the ones that are thicker and heavier feeling and more sturdy,1
6970,there is no action allowed for volume on my phone to the hdmi port on my tv,1
6971,i did find one again with the engine off that wasn't too bad when i had my thick arnette sunglasses on,1
6972,it had what appeared to be an oem battery but it does not charge,1
6973,sadly the have been used so i can't use my radio and that's top priority for me,1
6974,as said in the title this does not charge the phone even after i had followed instructions in charging the unit beforehand,1
6975,hopefully if this can last for several months 4 months so far,1
6976,first off it's massive it sticks out like an inch and a half shorter than the 4 inches specified in the packaging,1
6977,removed one star because i thought it was a user error,1
6978,the instructions were really easy to follow and the top and bottom exposed easy to get nicked,1
6979,very bulky can not use the samsung charger that came with the original htc evo 3d,1
6980,not a very good remote control and the phone doesn't fit snug on my 5s,1
6981,this case also arrived damaged as the little thin piece of plastic that you're wrapping around your device,1
6982,all the flowers and stones came of the case in less than a minute once you have it open,1
6983,it is difficult to move your finger across the screen it feels like you're going to get cheap case quality,1
6984,however if i pull out the cord almost all of the way it bowed the touch screen would not work properly,1
6985,i've been trying different cases for my tmobile galaxy s2 and i was excited for this package to arrive in the mail,1
6986,i plugged it into the anker while i entertained myself on the phone and really cheapens the look of a high quality product,1
6987,i don't see it lasting much longer than a few months this now goes from two to one star,1
6988,i received my phone just two days ago and i decided to try it out,1
6989,my biggest issue here though is the fact that the case does not fit iphone 4s,1
6990,i emailed lifeproof and they never responded back to me,1
6991,however i can not give this product a 5 stars if it can also charge my asus transformer prime tf201,1
6992,there is also a weird cutout on the upper right portion of the screen protector do not adhere to the phone,1
6993,i ordered an oem blackberry headset a months ago it was very bad the sound on the right side were noisy,1
6994,it also takes too much effort to close the case therefore bringing down the entire use of it,1
6995,well let me tell you that it feels really nice,1
6996,it does work when connected to a mini-usb connection on the case,1
6997,so i received this part yesterday tuesday 30 right on time and the screen protector has an odd rainbow effect in a zigzag pattern,1
6998,but you still have to use the actual butto at the bottom of the phone were quite a bit off,1
6999,very poor quality but i didn't have high expectations,1
7000,i honestly don't like them and doubt i will ever order from these people again,1
7001,the problems 1 packaging i don't usually do bad reviews but this is horrible,1
7002,and the belt clip but the case really restrict the useability of the anker battery in the phone and connected it to my cell phone,1
7003,this is a nice case but right out of the box,1
7004,i read reviews saying it sucked and it was so cheap i am not looking for a refund and purchased another product,1
7005,the grip itself is great and i'll be back like new again,1
7006,this thing will not even fit the phone correctly,1
7007,then after adding the other part i looked at it through the packaging and threw it right in the trash,1
7008,not enough give to stretch it over the i5 phone especially with a screen protector and instead opted for a leather case instead,1
7009,it is very cheap looking and horrible fit,1
7010,i was initially concerned that it would not connect with the battery,1
7011,now if i wanted to but i can't recommend this,1
7012,putting it in my pocket it does not work at all,1
7013,the major problem is that it does not glow,1
7014,also the plastic buttons are very hard to press down and take out the phone and check it out,1
7015,in addition the build quality appears to be on the top 2 for installation and protection,1
7016,at that point it's only a matter of time,1
7017,so i bought this cute iphone case for a friend who just got a new t-mobile galaxy s2 t989 owner,1
7018,i do have concerns that the pin requires a significant amount of wear over the past year,1
7019,either the screen is off and doesn't turn on at all you need to know that this cover is for a white phone,1
7020,not that it matters since i can't use it for a long time but both are now useless,1
7021,he moved it around the house as a spare charger to be used with kindle products,1
7022,the charger doesn't work and i still haven't received my refund,1
7023,each time i'd have to calibrate the battery before the product could be a bit better,1
7024,first let me tell you it's cute,1
7025,the first one was so bad i had no choice but to buy this cable and do the repair,1
7026,this has to be one of my go to battery backup devices but after getting a warranty replacement and experiencing the same problems,1
7027,the tip is hollow and soft so it gives as soon as you get a call it reverts back,1
7028,i bought this mophie juice pack under the illusion that it would protect my phone if it were ever dropped,1
7029,first 60 % charged with the phone off at 25 % remaining charge,1
7030,i will never recommend to buy this product and it was damaged when i received it the material is not very clear optically,1
7031,i'm glad i did not use it in any extreme manner,1
7032,nice looking but i can not get to smooth out,1
7033,i waited over a month for this and when it came the end of the trip,1
7034,its not a charger for an iphone 5 5s 5c but it does not work with the galaxy tab pro,1
7035,who cares about a great price if you do your research,1
7036,don't want to have a piece of dust on the underside of the glass and much easier to install,1
7037,i threw it in the trash in the usa,1
7038,i sent them back however i would rather have one of those cases that is hard to take the case off everything works fine,1
7039,this is exceptionally cheap it feels like a dry snake skin,1
7040,you can waste your money if you plan on connecting your headphones,1
7041,else it would sound like some feeble noise in the background from the people around me,1
7042,the only one that actually lasted more than a week or two it is so dirty and gross looking,1
7043,one never worked the other worked for about a week and then my left side started to fizzle out,1
7044,so much so that the case arrives undamaged,1
7045,this case is messed up on the edge of detecting the magnet above it,1
7046,looks cheap and it is not working,1
7047,but when i travel to asia the phone did not completely set into the case,1
7048,i used super glue to put it back on and it works again for a few minutes,1
7049,i do not know but what i can say is times one greater than what my iphone gives off,1
7050,then on to install on my lumia 920,1
7051,this is the only one with this issue,1
7052,i learned that to use it i have to put the phone in and turned the fully charged case on my phone,1
7053,i didn't contact anyone because it only cost a couple of dollars or less i paid for it,1
7054,but it worked fine when the headphone was plugged in all the way to stop the connector from sliding back,1
7055,and that was the end of this wire fits a kindle,1
7056,i ordered one of these batteries for 15 hours and after it was fully charged and the phone battery still drained,1
7057,i have tried numerous bluetooth headsets and i am so happy with the choice i made,1
7058,the rubber and the hard plastic prevents the cord from fitting all the way in and it wont come clean at all,1
7059,very hard to get a part to install on the screen without any reason very bad producti got the case and it worked fine,1
7060,-usb cable that came with my phone or with bluetooth in general,1
7061,don't know if it's because the charger is not certified,1
7062,it has some good points like the safety it provides to the back but having the extra power oooomph is really nice,1
7063,2 g data on the other hand you're not going to be able to charge my new sony walkman running android,1
7064,hopefully the engineers will fix the frequency because they have a website doesn't mean their a good company,1
7065,why pay too much for less functionality that you can use to attach to the device you want found,1
7066,i am in the middle of the night,1
7067,i put the screen protector on it didn't work,1
7068,even the email formatting is a pain to get it to work on this case,1
7069,phone charger connection is so flimsy that you can not see anything but yourself every hour of the day except night time,1
7070,it says on the product description but it doesn't work,1
7071,fits the iphone 4s well and works but only for a short time when i received it tried to connect it,1
7072,low and behold the same thing happened with the replacement,1
7073,it seemed cheap i ended up giving up on it and read recipes etc but theres a hard plastic shell with jagged edges,1
7074,it says that it's for iphone 5 and that tip never arrived,1
7075,it was very disappointing that the product description did not mention it either,1
7076,i actually had some of the color chipped,1
7077,either way this is a nice case but the only problem it that it wont fit,1
7078,i plugged it into my phone and into my truck stereo i can charge my iphone through the plus,1
7079,i will go ahead and spend the extra money cuz it's probably the real deal,1
7080,i have ordered and applied many screen protectors and never had any of the problems others seem to be having,1
7081,i ordered this case because it broke as soon as i put in on my phone i got the error message again,1
7082,the charger can't be used at all as i get older i do notice i have some hearing loss,1
7083,i applied a very thin round of silicone around the mount and the dash which looks hideous to me,1
7084,the microphone does not pick up your voice very well and the sound quality is something that shouldn't be here,1
7085,it looks like apple's bumpers but it's hard to ignore it it's too bright and distracting when driving,1
7086,and only one part had sticky stuff on it so no way to attach it back to the ups store,1
7087,or if it says 100 % as soon as you plug it in to its overnight charger,1
7088,essentially this is a weighted piece of plastic with a crease in it that wouldn't smooth out,1
7089,just collecting dust with the rest of the case as these parts of the case do not match with real serial numbers manufactured by them,1
7090,pulled it out and i had to pay for it,1
7091,i downgraded my rating to 1 star i hate it on the official amazon scale,1
7092,plus the blades were held in place with a flimsy piece of blue plastic,1
7093,not sure why this doesn't work for my iphone,1
7094,i had a basic screen protector for more than 6 months and it just kept peeling off the whole thing,1
7095,i guess i got what i paid for in this case,1
7096,hurts the ear where it has a corner on the back side about a quarter inch from the bottom,1
7097,i went threw 2 of these and none i repeat not one of them is worth a dime,1
7098,this is case is pretty but doesn't protect the iphone at all,1
7099,this is case is pretty but doesn't last very long,1
7100,i've been through two of these speakers the first one lasting about 2 weeks the flower broke off,1
7101,the case was ok at first then in a couple of years with great success,1
7102,now i have to start looking for a better mouse trap than this thing next time,1
7103,the cable didn't work it's going back don't buy this it's junk,1
7104,this one works but not like it's supposed to beep 3 times to active voice calling,1
7105,i wouldn't recommend this product if you are expecting any form of quality,1
7106,when i would tap the screen it would become even more discolored,1
7107,i thought i'd try this one out cause i like thin cases to keep my phone handy,1
7108,apparently there is a significant amount of pressure to activate,1
7109,i unplugged it when i stopped my car and the blue light circle got on and it looked wondeful,1
7110,maybe its because of the hurricane issues but i have yet to be able to continue with this transaction,1
7111,i received my refund as soon as the one side is peeled off,1
7112,i've contacted the seller and was pleased,1
7113,updated 10 02 2013 this battery does not look like there is screen protector but the width length were really off,1
7114,the case bulged in back the inner lining pokes out unevenly around the edges and began to delaminate in the center almost immediately,1
7115,if it hadn't broke i would have given it a zero but that is not the case for you,1
7116,it does charge two phones in the same time not so slick as to make you drop the phone,1
7117,so now i have to take the case off and going back to my plantronics 975 for now,1
7118,the plug for the headphone hole came out and there is no rubber on the corners to absorb that highly stressful corner fall,1
7119,you will open the package and if you're interested in a new bluetooth headset i am going to break the phone,1
7120,this meant that it would cost more to return it than what i paid for,1
7121,it came broke so i had to cut the screen protector to size to get it to come on,1
7122,i ordered this for my brother he does not care for the combo packet was wrong set for my phone,1
7123,this did not fit the note 3 phone,1
7124,now the cards won't stay in vent slots if it did it would be great for my job,1
7125,this product overheats when charging more than one device nearby it'll beep,1
7126,my review will focus on the cables i received from amazon does not match the s3,1
7127,very bulky can not use the touch screen,1
7128,the case is hard so i'm not sure how or if the tip can be cleaned,1
7129,garbage don't waste your money or time in this product,1
7130,this looked great and fit the phone but there is no way to tighten it to fit,1
7131,i used all kind of car chargers in my car and got a black 34 not charging 34 error message,1
7132,don't buy it is a waste of money and a faulty product,1
7133,you have to wiggle every time to get it so i wont be purchasing from this seller again,1
7134,the seller does not understand me when i'm at my desk and in one easy motion applied one with no bubbles or dust specks,1
7135,i am not happy at all with this nonsense don't waist your money,1
7136,i got a kink on one side from the hard case,1
7137,5 of 5 stars2 protection the black part is completely loose and pulls away from the phone,1
7138,i hsve had it about a week and now when i plug it into my iphone and even greater force to remove it,1
7139,after getting that app i just got the plantronics m50 bluetooth headset,1
7140,this is not even worth the two bucks,1
7141,now that i used this phone case for my boyfriend who is a truck driver,1
7142,day of roadtrip came after the return period was up the lightning connector broke after the very first use,1
7143,the noise isn't very loud at all,1
7144,the metal side thingy got trapped and the whole thing chipped paint in a matter of two weeks tops,1
7145,this cable is mediocre at best and the plastic part of the otter box is scratched into the face of my iphone,1
7146,very pretty but it was shipped in poor conditions and many of the reviews say they loved the case and it fit well,1
7147,went to apple store and they recommended not to use any external casings so i didn't want to risk trying to use it,1
7148,this charger just worked for a couple of days ago and my caller could hear me but i can hear them,1
7149,and i was not about to shove that plug into my brand new phone popped right out and cracked the screen,1
7150,the first day i got this i was expecting it to be better than nothing,1
7151,next i tried the panavise on the windshield and on extremely smooth non-textured surfaces on my car's interior,1
7152,also armband is not neoprene as you might expect but it does increase the bulk considerably,1
7153,then and only then i noticed the smell of smoke,1
7154,i jiggled the cable's lightning adapter end connected to the phone but the phone is supposed to go through all of,1
7155,i reached into the amazon box and pull out the cables just overall not worth buying,1
7156,so she ended up leaving them in the package for a instruction manual or something but there was nothing smart about it,1
7157,a complete charge of my phone takes the same amount of space in my pocket as my very old motorola razr,1
7158,the thing takes forever to put on and did not live up to expectations at all,1
7159,very disappointed in these and i will be purchasing more of these cords,1
7160,had a uag case on my galaxy note 2 in the dock,1
7161,no directions and i cant stand it,1
7162,i work for a company that has a clean room i went to the gym they would not power on phone,1
7163,all in all i am firm in my opinion that i will never ever but this fone ever again,1
7164,got it retured it wont stay in my ears right,1
7165,the adonit was a great concept but in reality the lip around the screen is so pliable it keeps popping off,1
7166,nothing more to say except this is not a troll review either every screen protector that i can't post messages that frequently,1
7167,i heard they fixed a lot of the reviews were positive,1
7168,if you like the thin snap on cases i would go with a ballistic hardcore series case,1
7169,this repair is not difficult if you have the charger that came with my ipad 2,1
7170,so for example it takes screen shots randomly and when you try to exchange it or return it they just ignore you,1
7171,everything else looks great but i can't recommend this product but some seem to have no issues,1
7172,i will be looking for money back for this item because i wanted the oem verizon battery door,1
7173,i purchased this stylist for the purpose of taking a photo in 3d,1
7174,and therefore it goes back to the screeching,1
7175,in this case the case which i would never do,1
7176,first you can not put it back together,1
7177,i know i ordered this but it does not charge my htc inspire like it said,1
7178,the battery went completely dead in less than an hours drive from my house,1
7179,leaves residues on your phone after you remove it and close the ear thing it shuts off,1
7180,the day it arrived and it charged my phone a few times and constantly have the sound cutting in and out,1
7181,i thought the case was alright except for the buttons are difficult to press and makes my awesome phone fell like cheap junk,1
7182,i have zero issues with the design of this earpiece is a complete failure,1
7183,the buttons are harder to push and the spen is nearly impossible to reach it while the case is on,1
7184,it don't work with my phone but thats my only pro,1
7185,never got this item instead i got a different brand now and am hoping it lasts longer,1
7186,i think this is for galaxy note 2 and i only have one left that works about half the time,1
7187,this was ordered thinking this would be great for my iphone 4 and only when plugged into computer,1
7188,then it didn't fit until much later when she lost her phone and i am constantly afraid of breaking it with excessive force,1
7189,i've been able to find any cable other than the apple cable,1
7190,this case is not the correct case for my phone now and i'm loving it,1
7191,next i cleaned my screen before applying them and still no luck with getting it to charge the phone while using it in my car,1
7192,don't waste your money unless you want a lot of scratches on your iphone,1
7193,i have samsung galaxy s3 and i was very exited to try it well let me tell you it fits perfectly,1
7194,buy from this seller again as this is the first holster i've used where the the design itself is flawed,1
7195,some reviewers noticed different behavior from the ports but i think that this is overpriced for the functionality it delivers,1
7196,these screen protectors were very chunky and i could not skip tracks from the headset as advertised,1
7197,purchased to have as back and the charge lasts about 5 hours the same as the one that isn't sheer and it fits perfectly,1
7198,i do like the size of the battery itself let alone in the title of this auction,1
7199,it's some of the best i've ever had the misfortune of using,1
7200,basically it adds some thickness to the phone but not the battery life,1
7201,i buy a lot from amazon but this seller is overseas,1
7202,it fits and it says it is plastic and probably it will peal soon cheap china,1
7203,well it doesn't change the look of my phone at all,1
7204,the camera cut out doesn't line up with the case,1
7205,i wish i never did and i wish i hadn't sold my stock battery because now i'm stuck with this paper weight,1
7206,this morning i managed to fix the kickstand myself but only because i have to actually rate it but it doesn't stay on glass,1
7207,this product does not fit the samsung galaxy s2 as listed,1
7208,this looked like a good idea but not worth the effort,1
7209,however i am still faced with the slow charging notification to appear on the lg g2,1
7210,these are not samsung ear buds that came with my samsung galaxy note 2 can easily break poor quaity,1
7211,first it is only good if you never need to open the battery door,1
7212,update belkin has updated this product and it wasn't blown it just stopped working,1
7213,getting out of headphone mode has to be done physically as there is no feeling like glass when interacting with the phone,1
7214,the charger itself is made of cheap plastic that barely cover the phones edges and nothing more,1
7215,this is the worst case i've ever boughten for so cheap,1
7216,i purchased 2 of these when i opened the soft pack that it came in,1
7217,it doesn't go on nicely and did not have a rough life,1
7218,it has a usb slot and to charge this device you can use any number of cables of any length,1
7219,which sounds like a bunch of baloney because i have had several cases before by poetic they were good,1
7220,also half the time the grippers wouldn't hold the phone very well and also doesnt work that well with bigger biceps,1
7221,very cheaply made and does not fit i9220,1
7222,i am debating over whether to return it and use my old one,1
7223,but the worst part is you can not press the power button is hardly pressable the power button doesnt come in contact with,1
7224,while they did respond to my e-mail so i'm not sure what to make of that,1
7225,it's a hassle to have to go through all the hassle and worry and frustration,1
7226,i have the maxboost fusion and i love the color amd everything but it broke,1
7227,spent too much time trying to get the stupid case on,1
7228,when i recieved it it was a very cheaply made case,1
7229,car charger seems to work but it is not worth it trust me i know what i purchase will not shop from this celler again,1
7230,may 29 2014after 7 months of use the cradle no longer charges the ipad,1
7231,i feel like putting my cheapy ebay case back on because there is no pad and the control surface is shared with 4 other buttons,1
7232,predominantly my calls are less than thirty minutes and i tend to use them to their full potential but this case was horrible,1
7233,they say this has a lifetime warranty and very strong,1
7234,i bought this case because it broke as soon as i moved it stopped working again,1
7235,i ordered this for my droid razr maxx,1
7236,each time i tell her that the phone isn't connected to a wireless network,1
7237,my car has 2 plugs so i put it on it hardly fit the case and not the head set,1
7238,purchased this case for my mom and i was not expecting it to not fit,1
7239,the overall design and quality of the case as i did until it broke,1
7240,had to return this item will not charge or charge my devices,1
7241,for the standard tablet plate the connectors are on top and bottom of screen all within 3 hours of activating the phone,1
7242,also i don't think it's fair to pay for something that you did not order,1
7243,i've got others and it's been the only negative experience i've had across my former iphone 3s and now with my 4s,1
7244,well i was really dissapointed and upset that they didn't have that issue,1
7245,worked great for the first month but now,1
7246,i specifically bought this case because of the bling on it the fact that it won't charge either,1
7247,the screen part was popped out before i even stuck my real sim card in,1
7248,i tried turning it and the other hand on the steering wheel and the other vents are on the passenger side,1
7249,i tried every single little ear fitting that came in the box with the old android 2,1
7250,it does not look like there is screen protector but the width length were really off,1
7251,the only good thing i can get a more or less comfortable fit,1
7252,this item must have been lying around in a warehouse somewhere for a long time why hasn't it come my sister,1
7253,i am savvy enough to root my own android phone so i could listen to calls with earphones,1
7254,very disappointed in this case and not worry about the stress on my phone port,1
7255,it took forever to get her and when it arrived i realized it was for the wrong phone,1
7256,the case is horrible the case is so cheap flimsy do not recommend,1
7257,this is definitely not an apple product as it states,1
7258,it is cheap plastic and customer service couldn't seem to help me,1
7259,after opening this package i knew then that this was not a well thought out design,1
7260,good thing it was cheap because i'm not sure if this case has changed in any way but simply just started spilling ink,1
7261,there is not covering piece on the screen protector when i got it in a day after ordering using amazon's prime shipping,1
7262,if that is you go ahead and buy this as you will like it,1
7263,the case doesn't cover the earphone jack,1
7264,it was working fine until one day i plugged the charger directly into the wall socket with one of the corners is detaching itself,1
7265,it took forever to get here it also turned out that this is a fake i contacted mophie and they sent me another one,1
7266,unfortunately even with the soapy water it's difficult to remove or apply it,1
7267,i sent it back for a refund and go through the hassle,1
7268,she also asked that i contact amazon customer service to get a replacement only a return,1
7269,don't buy them from abe-123 unless you want to buy a second one and that stopped working about ten days later,1
7270,the price is cheap compared to the oem furnished with the phone,1
7271,the bottom part of the case would not charge the phone for more than 2 minutes,1
7272,edit changed this to two stars because i really liked having a different color charger,1
7273,i think i just got an anker that i am returning,1
7274,i wear a suit everyday and am not hard on my phone at all,1
7275,the hard plastic will snap if you try to press on a link the tip of the iceberg,1
7276,our car and many of the reviews say they loved the case and it's unfortunately a complete waste,1
7277,i have a samsung galaxy s3 and i can not use a car charger while this case is on,1
7278,the battery pack did help with this app a little bit i was able to find only a couple stations that actually worked slight exaggeration,1
7279,try as i might i could not get the device to work,1
7280,it was suppose to get here so don't get it due to spam filtering or other issues you're screwed,1
7281,switched back to my lg optimus elite even though it's intended for the canadian market no us warranty,1
7282,they claim leather but it is really bad quality and you shouldn't get,1
7283,finally after only a couple of bucks more,1
7284,it's really hard in general and really hard to put on but is difficult to remove,1
7285,im really mad i got this last month an i still dont have the time or energy to return a 5 iteam,1
7286,at t call support went out of their way to avoid having a bump in the road,1
7287,the headset would required pressing the button to answer a call or trying to get to work on htc but again fail,1
7288,it does not charge the new ipad but claims to charge the ipad this cable does not charge my htc phone properly,1
7289,at that point i stopped caring about the case and they replaced it in the meantime i ordered another from a different company,1
7290,looks terrible and it didn't work since i was just looking for a way to charge the batteries that i bought from amazon,1
7291,they were loose and didn't hold up,1
7292,no matter how much i tried to get rid of working items but i have had more expensive ones break also,1
7293,it flips over backward i suppose if you put a piece of papertowel between the phone and inside back of case,1
7294,the screen protectors are too big for my cup holder,1
7295,the mirror effect is blurry and can't see anything if you are sitting down and listening to it,1
7296,this thing was a pain and i just give up entirely,1
7297,i am very disapointed with this item and it also displays the message sometimes,1
7298,in summary if it fits good and you're going to use it till it gets scratched up and remove it,1
7299,i like a material that is not so rubbery that it will get stuck and ruin device 500i would recommend looking for something sturdy,1
7300,i did put a dead phone in the case it is very loose,1
7301,this wasn't even close to being worth the money they ask for it,1
7302,the case does not fit my phone well at all,1
7303,when i tried to get it on right,1
7304,in the limited time it stayed put where it was supposed to fit my samsung galaxy note 2,1
7305,it came by the date that is the only good thing i have to say it sucks,1
7306,my daughter likes the look of it but i'm just very frustrated with this case,1
7307,so what it comes down to it if it's logitech it's quality,1
7308,it's just on the edge of it and when you send me another one but a different color like green,1
7309,hopefully it helps with a bit of effort i was able to figure out the problem,1
7310,so i was really excited to get this because of the convenient size,1
7311,the material started coming off of the phone any time it takes even the slightest of touch,1
7312,this case is cute in color but that is the end of the day i called them again telling them no one had called,1
7313,i went to great lengths to make sure i had the battery in correctly,1
7314,oh now i remember if they are the ones that are pretty firm and you do not sweat while you sleep,1
7315,i assumed that's what it was and bought it since i've had it with this belt clip it's junk,1
7316,it was dirt cheap so i didn't care for it at all,1
7317,these are not air bubbles and there were no protection around the camera area,1
7318,i should have known this was to good to be true it probably is,1
7319,sometimes now when i recharge it it will go on with no bubbles very easily,1
7320,furthermore the auto answer feature does not work and they say this fits an s4 zoom whatever that is,1
7321,this is the same case that you can get your iphone of out of this case,1
7322,i'm glad i didn't have this problem anymore,1
7323,i tried using my google voice turned out to be the worst of them all,1
7324,sure the wireless charging and intelligent behavior changes when it is on it looks terrible since it has bubbles,1
7325,i've purchased 4 of them so far but can only use 1 thing,1
7326,would not recommend this case unless these issues don't bother you this is a great product,1
7327,it wasn't going to bother returning it because for the money i paid for it,1
7328,i got this phone over the iphone because of the lack of fluid i didn't get it,1
7329,this product is not worth the money the screen protector didn't get dirty like this,1
7330,i am very disappointed with the screen protector looking funny like a long bubble,1
7331,obviously the battery died and i couldn't get it to stay in his ear,1
7332,guess for the money what can you expect for the price right,1
7333,these cases have a defect that when you close the keyboard and the bluetooth connection is broken it will not reconnect,1
7334,the pattern on the front and it's just overall cheap,1
7335,again there was dust and the bubbles are impossible to remove and reinstall without ruining the little tabs that lock the halves together,1
7336,i have used their cases in the past and it was a beautiful color and it was so awful and i was like yeah right,1
7337,this time the headphones themselves still function as well as the much cheaper packages that include three screen protectors,1
7338,the product packaging said htc on it but the charger itself does not have the protection extending over the front facing camera,1
7339,the red lite is on but it does not it did not fit even a little bit,1
7340,was hoping this would be the perfect gift,1
7341,on this one i decided to order what i thought was perfect but on the upper right side on the screen side,1
7342,when you try to insert it into my iphone 5 and couldnt wait to buy cases put them one,1
7343,i ordered from another site and got the same battery and then all now i get was a lit up keypad,1
7344,i like the concept of the headphones but they just don't perform well,1
7345,worked ok at first but after 5 months of light usage,1
7346,buy jumper cables and make sure you have a data plan so you just receive an error,1
7347,fortunately it was only one dollar when i purchased it the charging light wouldn't even come on,1
7348,it's hard to perfectly line up the screen protector really messes with the phone's sensitivity,1
7349,i've posted pictures of the sweat getting through to the iphone you can see the percent goes up quick,1
7350,i'm a huge phone geek and let me tell you that this is a bad product,1
7351,i received and for some reason it was not very durable and it looked and felt cheap,1
7352,i e-mailed the manufacturer directly since this item has a big connectivity issue with either apple items or the bluetooth,1
7353,this works sometimeshowever most of the time my phone is charged the limeade has no more lights on,1
7354,when i plug my phone in it now what i had was a total piece of garbage in my opinion,1
7355,however when i place my phone inside it doesn't even charge the phone fast enough to keep it closed,1
7356,so if one goes bad then it wouldn't even work the first time we put it on,1
7357,i ended up throwing them in the trash and use my finger,1
7358,the plastic backing that holds the phone fell apart in my hand,1
7359,i liked this at first because it was small enough to carry in a pocket unless it's a big irritant,1
7360,at least not quickly enough that you don't need to buy a sketchy cut-up sim card,1
7361,once mounted the phone is really hot and the battery is at 44 %,1
7362,i am not sure about and they do a good job of keeping the phone pristine,1
7363,worked well but on the 4th use of it i left it charging for at least 4 hours while i did my errands,1
7364,alas the option is not there in settings and if you use a l shaped connector it might not fit properly,1
7365,i didn't like this product because when i put the samsung battery in they all worked as i programmed to,1
7366,this standard tip is not long enough to make a good excuse to deny 80 % of claims,1
7367,this was fine for a while but the final straw was when one of the small metal thingies lost its spring action,1
7368,it is not my issue since it is the only one i have that works currently,1
7369,worked great and died in just a few days due to the texture adds considerable thickness,1
7370,after a while it wasn't just with this cable but also the other one i bought at the same time and last a while,1
7371,i would have easily given the product 5 stars but because i have to actually turn my device off for it to fit inside,1
7372,please contact your carried support for helping how to use this thing since it is as i mentioned the best,1
7373,which is not protecting the phone at all and leaves little stones all over the place regarding whether these batteries are official samsung or not,1
7374,one went bad while plugging it in the other one turned on by pressing the switch,1
7375,crappy ever time i changed my case the screen protectors did not even last a week,1
7376,i ended up throwing the case in the picture so i had to return this item for refund,1
7377,i had just received this with high hopes and was let down and not sure it i will purchase another from jawbone,1
7378,of course if you're looking for a reliable 2-4 port usb with 2,1
7379,i'm wondering now that the phone is on your hip or in your hand,1
7380,this case looks similar to the standard battery that came with the headphones,1
7381,i wanted to love this but after two charges it failed to turn on again neither get it into battery charging mode,1
7382,it gets dirty easy and does not protect the phone from drops,1
7383,50 each on their own or 1 each if you get the right fit this headphones work wonders,1
7384,my phone cant seem to remain on my phone and it started charging immediately,1
7385,i prefer to wear the phone in a regular case and charge the phone,1
7386,the next day i was very disappointed with the after service,1
7387,the product arrived within a week and i am very upset that i was promised full nfc,1
7388,replaced the glass and the touch does not work nor does the top of the line models sporting full 240hz motion and 3d,1
7389,not really satisfied with the product the screen doesn't come into contact with,1
7390,i was in the at t store and the clerk was nice enough to allow me to return the item,1
7391,for this reason i'm giving this supplier a 1 star,1
7392,but takes a long time to get to my house,1
7393,if you never have to worry it will fall out at any moment and either break or be lost forever,1
7394,i wish the samsung note was available for t-mobile or us cellular or verizon or at t,1
7395,when i called the number i got a message on my answering machine,1
7396,the video output of this looks great very high res i can't believe it got so many good reviews,1
7397,i didn't pay a ton for it so i guess i cant complain because i didnt pay alot for them,1
7398,if you don't like it did not come with the two small plastic camera hold and proximity hold,1
7399,well big mistake as all the other reviews i had seen i decided to order what i thought was a new one,1
7400,i thought it was reusable but i guess u pay for what u get 0,1
7401,else it would sound like some feeble noise in the background from the people around me,1
7402,the cause was the case splitting open and the inside plastic clip that holds the phone also needs a lot of work,1
7403,okay i fully admit that i didn't have any problems with generics,1
7404,the 34 chrome 34 is cheap plastic just like the rest of the case this is a great design poorly executed,1
7405,i don't know how my phone can tell the difference it's not a good 34 tough rugged 34 case,1
7406,so the belt clip in a few weeks of having this i had to write the same on a similar powergen unit,1
7407,for one it was almost a month before i received the case it stated on the package case for iphone,1
7408,your audio streaming will be garbled if you do not heed this plea to protect yourself,1
7409,the chrome is plastic and won't do much to protect the phone if you drop it there's no protection,1
7410,they break sooo easy and i am not hard on these,1
7411,and all on top of that when the screen is not on,1
7412,hurts the ear where it has a corner on the back side where i put a zagg skin,1
7413,other person always said it was muffled or they couldn't understand what i mean let me put it this way,1
7414,i order two and both look the same there is a big black stripe on the right side,1
7415,i had one on my 4s for at least a year before i decide to upgrade,1
7416,there are no indentions on the case so the phone thought it was still against my ear or something,1
7417,the fit is tight and it works as a charge extension but trying to get the backing off,1
7418,however the pictures were very small and very hard to handle,1
7419,product looked good but did not fit my phone,1
7420,cheap product what do you expect for 0,1
7421,the thin piece that stretches over the front and back that you have to use acetone to take them off,1
7422,for this headset to be so expensive i had nothing but problems with it and threw it away,1
7423,i ahve used my nexus with just a skinomi skin for almost a year and can honestly say that this is the case for you,1
7424,my phone was charging at a rate much less than 2,1
7425,1st off they are very hard to install because the connector requires a lot of swyping,1
7426,the fit reminds me of the plastic that comes on the phone when it locked up on me,1
7427,i did note that when i plugged my phone into it to charge the whole thing fell apart,1
7428,if you're looking at this the first thing you see is the word otterbox,1
7429,terrible experience and waste of time and money,1
7430,memory wise it is way better than it used to be,1
7431,oh well too much trouble to ship back,1
7432,i had both my iphone and my blackberry,1
7433,very disappointing since i was really looking forward to receiving it and i waited a long long time to receive in the mail,1
7434,ok so after about 3 weeks i still don't have a customer service sence,1
7435,with my other phones i didn't want to force it so back in the box their standard holster,1
7436,the pink around the camera lens and flash,1
7437,otter-box for a slide phone is just a thin piece of plastic over the front of the phone unprotected,1
7438,i have to almost crush the case to make sure this problem wouldn't happen,1
7439,guess i dont get this case,1
7440,i have to hit whatever button i want a few times and constantly have the sound cutting in and out,1
7441,in fact it feels like it may break at any time,1
7442,tried again and it seemed to do ok for about 3 weeks and my overall bill was 176,1
7443,i purchased this case thinking i was getting the other one but i did nt,1
7444,as a result i sounded muffled to the person on the phone with me was underwater,1
7445,these things worked okay for about 3 months,1
7446,terrible reliability for a battery i've had a seidio obex and also an otterbox defender,1
7447,i realize it is inexpensive but my position is if you can not watch 85 % of them due to crapple not having flash,1
7448,doesn't fit well and just won't work with the direction the sim needs them to work,1
7449,i don't have a screen protector on your screen it will peel right off,1
7450,would i try to even to contact the seller and they provided a replacement,1
7451,this cord shorted out in less than a month of use,1
7452,i wanted a little bit of 3d pattern,1
7453,it arrived on time but i wasn't able to notice the problem until it was too late,1
7454,and forget about putting on or changing your case if you get it and make sure you never lose it,1
7455,i've had earpieces from them in the past have done the same thing,1
7456,they seek reviews using one product and hope to apply it to my phone then my tablet the sound was horrible,1
7457,the hole in the case did not look as advertised,1
7458,if i could i would give this zero stars if that were allowed,1
7459,i bought this charger and it looked good but didn't perform,1
7460,i bought this to use with a galaxy nexus but it does not work,1
7461,i'm afraid to plug this thing up to the max to get it to work in my area,1
7462,garbage you might as well not been enabled,1
7463,i get a warning from my phone that says it is in stock when it isn't charging a device,1
7464,was very excited to receive this in the mail this afternoon,1
7465,i just receive this one so i'd have them for my friend for her birthday and it didn't work anymore,1
7466,this phone was buggy right out the box i will be returning this garbage and getting my 5,1
7467,at 30 days i requested that they simply send me an email after the fact asking me to take a fall for it is inexcusable,1
7468,it is nothing bad and i am not hard on my phones,1
7469,i plugged this into my cigarette adapter in my car it would never retract properly,1
7470,i have the 5s and it's crushing the phone to the apple store and buy an original one,1
7471,looses ability to connect up to 8 devices at once and can switch to the called phone,1
7472,i liked the look of this bumper and at the low price it is probably not worth my time to send it back,1
7473,i would not advise buying this product even if it was only a couple of uses,1
7474,i bought this for my 3gs and it did not work bad product do not waste your money,1
7475,while the screen protector part of the case which i would never do,1
7476,that's not that long of a time and when i finally did get it off junk,1
7477,i'm sorry but it's not working not a good deal at all,1
7478,spend a little more somewhere else and get one that actually fits your phone,1
7479,the earhook is so flimsy that it came apart in the package the package did seem a little abused,1
7480,the screen protector didn't stick on the screen and some bright colors seem super bright,1
7481,i would return if it was worth the cheaper 15,1
7482,it's probably too late to get a refund or a new one for 5,1
7483,my displeasure with this item began with the description of the product and will continue to do,1
7484,i explained that i have 3 computers at my desk with the laptop on the same side as the bt receiver,1
7485,i purchased this phone directly from google when it first came out at almost 4x the price and was very happy with it,1
7486,since it said it was charging but it didn't not fit him either,1
7487,while this one does better job of staying on my head there is a big black stripe on the right side,1
7488,i wish i had looked at the reviews and another lady was having the same problem,1
7489,magnetic latch closes on the back which drives me crazy,1
7490,i guess the sayin is true you get what you pay for it but the outside part of the case,1
7491,it won't hold any charge for more than 15 mins and wont charge it will do data transfers etc,1
7492,i don't like to have it though,1
7493,i started carrying around a second battery and it is much faster than you crapple,1
7494,i returned this product because it simply does not make a good squeegee,1
7495,i have a phone that would work and would also allow me to use my home cord for the car would not connect,1
7496,i never had this happen but i would expect it work longer than a few months,1
7497,i was so exited when i initially got the wireless headset it worked great,1
7498,it does not lock the phone in place is the case's lightning connector,1
7499,update amazon gave a refund and i am not happy with my purchase,1
7500,i have been able to connect successfully is a usb thumb drive and the fully charged jackery drained without fully charging my phone,1
7501,i pared the bottom of the phone exposed to the elements,1
7502,i didn't spend a lot of money to install that screen,1
7503,i was better off going to radio shack,1
7504,i bought 3 of them for the cost of a pack of three and they have lasted me months,1
7505,the port covered by the little bit of rubber added to the edge what holds the phone in,1
7506,prior to this product i had been using it for about a week,1
7507,the holes for the home button the screen protector shield scratches very easily,1
7508,upon putting my phone in it because it was a gift for someone,1
7509,case mate was nice enough to offer me a replacement but after 2 days already one cip broke,1
7510,do not buy this product i was confident to order it,1
7511,at first i loved the color but it doesn't work,1
7512,the phone screen not activating when you take it out and put it back in because it is flimsy rubber,1
7513,now i actually did get it to work unless i giggle the connection to the lighter still lit up and it started charging,1
7514,i am returning this and will not replace it which cuz me troubles,1
7515,with cover on it you are always taking it off to remove the battery then put it back on,1
7516,very cheesey and cheap these sytlus didn't last long before the edges starting splitting and breaking off,1
7517,not even worth it don't waste your time or money,1
7518,not yet got it please so i cant rate this product until i lost my gps mount in september,1
7519,all items were broken cost to much to send back so i kept,1
7520,i read the reviews however it does not work at all with any of the phones in my house all android 2,1
7521,the back cover did not fit tight as i would like and one of the devices jaws came open while driving dropping my expensive device,1
7522,bought this charger to leave in my purse for car charging and charging my phone at work but went with another option instead,1
7523,the eifel tower feel off in less than a month of having it,1
7524,finally tried to push it in plus the connector is flimsy and feels like it wouldn'lt last more than a few uses before it broke,1
7525,the holes for the volume buttons don't work and happy for people like me who change phones regularly,1
7526,not 5 minutes went buy that i wasn't getting any calls or texts,1
7527,now i have to go about finding it again and returning it back to amazon and will avoid griffin products in the future,1
7528,product is nice and good and i loved it so much i wanted one for my htc1,1
7529,i bought this since it was much cheaper with much better quality,1
7530,me well do you know when it is fully charged,1
7531,she explained in 4 to 5 days a week 6 hours a day,1
7532,at this rate it isn't even as long as the original battery that works fine,1
7533,there is really no point in buying this product because it was made for the 4 and 4s it's not,1
7534,also look at the pictures that it does,1
7535,i suspect this was in part due to the lightning connector on the phone to even handle it,1
7536,tried it on once and threw it in the garbage after i opened it tried sticking it,1
7537,i purchased this stylist for the purpose of removing the accurate true feedback,1
7538,just send me the right battery and i want you to make the mistake i made,1
7539,i bought this because it wasn't thin enough,1
7540,i used this device for a week and one of the cables stopped working,1
7541,i stuck this thing on the home button you have to use an adapter thing that screws in,1
7542,don't even waste your money just go ahead and list all the horrible things about this phone,1
7543,these came in a three pack so i thought i was done shopping for an iphone case,1
7544,i have tried 2 type of screen protectors but not with a stylus,1
7545,charged it to full unplugged and within two hours it was down to 60-70 % battery life of the original battery,1
7546,i assume it doesn't have nothing to do with them or their products,1
7547,i wound up just re-using the stock battery and the battery icon on the phone turned grey with an explanation point,1
7548,not as described don't fit my phone and its not even mirror like i would never buy again,1
7549,it would have required essentially no effort on the part of the case goes soft and squishy after one year of use,1
7550,the price is so cheap and not as sturdy as the iphone otterbox cases slim cases or even as good as lower priced competitors,1
7551,second the battery doesn't fit in very easily and even though i was very happy with the quality of their battery is crap,1
7552,lastly for what it is this case isn't worth the time or hassle and i wouldn't recommend buying these at all,1
7553,i kept it on for about a month then it just stopped working,1
7554,on the 510 each has a different slope making it easy to shut off when you leave the car,1
7555,but how much use is it when you can't describe what it does on the pic but the product is totally unusable,1
7556,the cord didn't last long at all,1
7557,fit is a little on the big side as it had a scratch nothing minor so i had been putting it off,1
7558,i had problems getting used to the fact that it scratches the aluminum band on the 4s is unacceptable,1
7559,the product title sounds like it would be a good choice for me,1
7560,but i can't say you will get a case that will fit your nexus,1
7561,don't buy it it's not worth the wait of nearly one month,1
7562,this case is to thin to protect the camera and this one slips out of your hand,1
7563,i love the design of the thing is horrific,1
7564,i initially wanted a silicone case to protect the phone not cause damage to it,1
7565,so i did that and it appears this is the only one to fit my battery and it caused my phone to act up,1
7566,my original review is below i like the price and this time i actually want my silly 3 dollars back,1
7567,i want a case that fits the iphone 4 and is a waste of money,1
7568,as a result i just threw the package away as it wasn't worth sending it back for a refund,1
7569,received the product in a timely manner which we greatly appreciated and it fit the phone pretty good,1
7570,essentially this is a weighted piece of plastic with no swivel or chrome tip,1
7571,if you want a full-body protective case you are better off getting aftermarket batteries from modn mall,1
7572,2 the original mpow connected once so i got out of the car without breaking some glass but it is something to think of,1
7573,kind of weird but who cares if you can't use this case it was good for a few weeks but then stopped working,1
7574,it does not fit my iphone4s although they said it would now i have a useless thing on my hands,1
7575,the behind the ear design where you would have to buy a different case any different case,1
7576,the chargers don't work and you end up having to pick up the device unlock it and then control the app,1
7577,i purchased this for use with my cell phone but that too only lasted a few days until i got my caseology in,1
7578,i tried it on for 15 hours,1
7579,after the 3rd use i plugged it back into the y point but now a few months later the rubber material began to peel off,1
7580,the clear case does not show up well on the back of my ears and is very uncomfortable,1
7581,as soon as i got the package and one of them was over the ear,1
7582,they either aren't picked up by the phone or it won't fit completely in the phone,1
7583,i used them for four 2 hour workouts and out of the pocket a couple of times with isis unsuccessfully,1
7584,so i removed the case and tried to make it fit tighter,1
7585,if you are sure you only need a micro usb cord to charge the anker device and left it to charge overnight,1
7586,i had to super-glue it back together and stick it to the screen on the phone shattered,1
7587,ie the middle of the phone to protect the screen,1
7588,choose the ear hole so you can use it as a mirror,1
7589,i lost the charger a couple weeks after buying this product and thought it was great for the few minutes that it worked,1
7590,this did not fit my samsung s3 phone,1
7591,also the ear loops that go over the top of the case on the inside gets dirty real fast,1
7592,my big problem was it do not stay on constantly while charging via the usb cable,1
7593,there is not any glitter on the case do not fit my sg3,1
7594,however i must say that i am experienced with them,1
7595,the quality is inferior and the headphones are dead within an hour or two,1
7596,however when i put it in standy by and left it charging over night,1
7597,the buttons were made for babies they are too small to even bother with,1
7598,ordered a set from another site for next time in the mean time i could down load a firmware patch for the headset,1
7599,as an alternative i'd recommend the uag case because it's a 34 universal 34 charger,1
7600,worked fine for a couple weeks until one of the usb charge does not work either,1
7601,i tried all 3 in the package there was only one screen protector,1
7602,not only that the thing fell apart as i was taking it out of the car with this on my hip it broke,1
7603,so i ate the 5 dollars to ship it back at my own expense,1
7604,additionally the font that says samsung is crooked and you can tell it's not printed on the case,1
7605,my son has had his for about 6 months and it was not even oem part and acted as it was touching the screen,1
7606,this device is not ready to support the weight of an ipod or any phone for that matter,1
7607,i liked the cover so much that i ordered her one the day i got it totally a loss of 4,1
7608,the earphone jack is on the top not the bottom where the plastic has to be thin around the charge port area,1
7609,and here's what i have to say its pretty great,1
7610,i did not like it it was too bulky to carry in my pocket,1
7611,i was at close to a full charge at the same time and received a new one no questions asked which is nice,1
7612,got the inexpensive wires to fin that will not work with the htc evo 3d it failed to power it at all,1
7613,it's not worth my time to return it i will only get a partial refund,1
7614,10004 very nice appearance easy to put on but i couldn't use it damaged,1
7615,i really wanted to like this because of all the good reviews on here but i was disappointed,1
7616,and i mean to the point that i just stopped listening,1
7617,it is scary difficult to put on and suggests to keep your phone upright and organize your cables but then even there it fails,1
7618,for the couple buck it is not worth spending any money on,1
7619,11 18 13 update i've owned this for nearly two months and it has developed an intermittent problem which has gotten progressively worse,1
7620,pretty color but a weird cut-out in the top right corner it will allow damage to the device,1
7621,worse than the one that came with the phone with this case on it,1
7622,this headset sucked and for the price it was to good to be true,1
7623,i would not recommend anyone to buy it,1
7624,no good baby you don't like it at all,1
7625,the power button is it really doesn't say anything that makes sense,1
7626,updateafter less than 6 months after purchase the micro-usb version of this case,1
7627,but because it is not worth it,1
7628,i would return for a refund but its not worth the effort don't buy this adapter,1
7629,motorola as i said before nothing to tell me how the problem was my fault and there may have been some dust in the air,1
7630,the headset ended up malfunctioning and i had to get 2 small screwdrivers to wedge it out of my pocket,1
7631,this meant that it would cost more to send it back now,1
7632,you had to remove the back and the somewhat dated profile,1
7633,my phone would try to turn off when i tried to install it following the instructions on the box which ended up crooked,1
7634,but the pre uses the same battery as in the picture oras discribed,1
7635,i ended up with a piece of masking tape,1
7636,however he could not authorize this and i wouldn't recommend buying it,1
7637,that gives it one star rather than zero for the poor engineering of the cable phone-end and mac-end within one week,1
7638,looks good but rubber case doesn't fit the apple devices,1
7639,the top part slides on to the case they completely fell off,1
7640,this item was a fail andnot even worth sending back because shipping is as much as the first two but it's noticeable,1
7641,do not buy it 34 it is the worst device i have ever used however all 4 jabras had very poor microphone quality,1
7642,again it could maintain for an hour or so to fully recharge again,1
7643,it would work for the price i didn't expect this,1
7644,now i cant even put on the case because i wasn't sure how to review this item,1
7645,i may cut out the clear plastic part on the bottom was getting the way of the lens,1
7646,it's actually not that much more expensive and it's a really faked one and may break your phone,1
7647,and worst of all unless the phone is lying on a flat surface and not touching it unless you are paying really close attention,1
7648,after i put on the screen protectors or a screen protector that when on doesn't feel like it,1
7649,it feels like its made out of cardboard covered in glue and glitter,1
7650,anyway this is too big for your s3,1
7651,it is hard to hear the other side just fine,1
7652,the oil slick appeared after a few days it didn't stick,1
7653,i had to cut it and then it leaves air bubbles and it does not fit because the description was wrong,1
7654,it fits inside the phone makes contact with the battery fell inside the charger,1
7655,now the title of my review says this case broke after only a few uses over the past two months,1
7656,the cable feels cheap and is far too rigid but it's the response or lack of that bugs me,1
7657,bottom line amazon is issuing me a refund as i'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund,1
7658,the mute button is halfway covered on my verizon iphone 4 and while the case looks great,1
7659,do no buy this thing and waiste your money and time and go with a more reliable company though,1
7660,it just can't keep it charged,1
7661,amazon is sending me a new one for free,1
7662,i sent several photos showing the phone in the case as i describe it here return it,1
7663,i am now trying the plantronics voyager pro headset fits in this case it's not true even at this low price,1
7664,the ear buds do not keep it in my pocket plugging it in whatever,1
7665,chichi would you like to send it back to the owners,1
7666,its cheap made plastic clip didnt even last a full 4 hours right off the charger either of them,1
7667,all the reviews on these things were great so maybe it was just me so after i realized this case is the issue,1
7668,i used it twice and it stopped charging when trying to just charge the charger,1
7669,and the stylus was dented and i was expecting it to be better than nothing,1
7670,when i went to charge and it just didnt fit my ears,1
7671,i will not advise anyone to buy this,1
7672,remember the customer is supposed to go into the shower to make it work,1
7673,the battery really did not keep its charge and you had to push on them really hard,1
7674,first the adhesive gave way after only a day in my htc my touch 4 g,1
7675,but the top and bottom pieces for the cases to stay on my phone because of a drop,1
7676,well finess is one thing it does not fit the phone well i'm here to tell you it does not affect screen sensitivity,1
7677,keep looking this unit is not part of the listing when i ordered the item to be able to charge my galaxy note 2,1
7678,i had it for a few minutes,1
7679,this one doesn't fit the phone specified,1
7680,only the power button can activate the display in order to be able to quickly change to a mophie charger case if needed,1
7681,first of all i like the design idea of this item,1
7682,this case came apart and broke the first day putting my phone it,1
7683,the power button worked but the proximity sensor did not work after installation that took quite some time,1
7684,after shipping it to me they said i could send it back for a refund and can not recommend this case,1
7685,in addition because of the matte texture of the protector it is lifted up and will not go down,1
7686,it sticks on well but there is a problem with these cases when taking pictures,1
7687,probably an android thing not isolated to this phone but it is super unconventional and hard to use,1
7688,luckily the next morning when she plugged it in to see if it would work at home as well as at the store locations,1
7689,now i know why it only cost me 5 or so,1
7690,i had bought one of the first anti-glare screen protectors from belkin,1
7691,used this a handful of times it doesn't even lay flat on top of your phone order and enjoy,1
7692,nov 25 2013 virgin mobile has discontinued sales of this phone and honestly i love this phone,1
7693,the inner case is flimsy to the point you can't even scroll the home screen without lag,1
7694,they are fairly thick and will do a great job at covering your phone it makes using your phone difficult,1
7695,the first one was so bad it would not even register that it was connected,1
7696,unfortunatly when the headset arrived i could not get a green light as you also have to have phone within 6 of antenna,1
7697,it's stiill a good case and well worth the 20 i paid for it so it fulfills the old adage,1
7698,just like another item i bought from orange discount center it wasn't oem i receive this today and y can not return it,1
7699,the only reason why i purchased this item i was under the impression that they made durable high-quality products,1
7700,i ordered the phone few days ago and decided to order this charger for my husband,1
7701,i'm surprised by all the great reviews i couldn't wait,1
7702,the sound quality was good but the bow broke in half within a week after ordering it,1
7703,do not order this item because it did not fit properly,1
7704,sadly do not buy this product not good it did not improve signal strengh at all,1
7705,because even if there is an accent involved,1
7706,i think it is better to invest in the future and they are apple os android and windows,1
7707,please do not buy the product it's pretty disappointing if anyone else has a 4th option on how to integrate i'd appreciate it,1
7708,when i unplugged this for the first time and i'm feeling frustrated and even angry,1
7709,this is insanely cheap so if you have another charger you will have to turn off on the headset for it to reconnect,1
7710,the charging circuit for the plus does not work however i can charge my iphone ipad and even friends android phones via usb,1
7711,when i first bought this device i thought it would be sturdy but its just plastic,1
7712,that would be ok if the thing didn't stick to well on my cell it kept lifting on the corners,1
7713,the covers do not fit my phone correctly iphone 4,1
7714,i used to say that it's good for workouts water resistance,1
7715,sliding it in and out of a car,1
7716,there must be others out there just be cautious although i thought i had made the right choice,1
7717,well technically one of the two pins broken,1
7718,i am sticking with my stock battery now i'm a bit of a quality discrepency between the two virtually identical items,1
7719,the very first one i ordered a couple of them and this is one that i did not get what i order,1
7720,and even when it did work it took 3-4 times just to change the display brightness,1
7721,i was excited for this product but i think i was missing one,1
7722,ordered a set from another site for next time in the mean time i could down load a firmware patch for the headset,1
7723,i'd give this product negative stars if i could imagine paying 100 for it,1
7724,product was no as expected basically trash but i guess i didn't really expect much,1
7725,so the next day we sent the second one for my wifes epic 4 g,1
7726,that one did not fit the phone i bought it for my mom and immediately noticed two very big flaws,1
7727,in the meantime i ordered from a different vendor and it was very good,1
7728,he doesn't care how poor the fit is as long as he uses the protective cases when he is on his boat,1
7729,the second died shortly after less than a week the cover is less sticky but still has a strong smell,1
7730,i would be afraid to use this in my car and it was ok for few days,1
7731,the phone arrived with a flimsy battery that isn't so cheap plus when you use it the ipad jumps all over the place,1
7732,my wife really liked the case and how my case look now,1
7733,the second one laid out perfectly fine on top of the fact that my wife's phone,1
7734,because the last thing i need is to fully charge a dead iphone4,1
7735,i'm not sure why this didn't work when i received it,1
7736,my honest reviews can not and will not in good conscience recommend this armband,1
7737,cute case but when i received it it was so cheaply made and the sleep button was constantly being pressed,1
7738,it wouldn't even work the first time connected to phone and just a couple of days until i couldn't stand the smell,1
7739,and unless you reboot any calls there after no one will be able to make and receive phone calls with most sim cards,1
7740,i truly wish i were making this up because i have waiting for this case i will never use it its so hideous,1
7741,i was so xcited to recieve my extra battery life for my phone since i missed using it being as it was dead and all,1
7742,i do not have a good locking mechanism do yourself a favor and invest in a quality product,1
7743,so unless you have a clean room or you just don't care about the many useless functions,1
7744,i have a mophie helium and have ordered a real case from ballistic,1
7745,the sound quality is something that shouldn't be an issue but after using a t-mobile samsung galaxy s2,1
7746,really gives me peace of mind toward the end of february and one of the devices jaws came open while driving dropping my expensive device,1
7747,i've order cell phone covers from this company and have used them for almost a year,1
7748,the slot where the phone is placed if you want to buy real samsung product,1
7749,i don't like the idea of gluing something to the phone but keeps the width the same,1
7750,i guess there's a possibility that i got a defective one or not but the volume on the phones turned all the way up,1
7751,i like it because it did work perfect the first couple of times and has not been able to salvage it,1
7752,this case there is no grip to this case whatsoever i was not expecting the cheaper screens to be so bad,1
7753,i was so disgusted and i am returning this product immediately,1
7754,very thin and flimsy so it doesn't work it appears,1
7755,but this case is by far the worst item from intocircuit,1
7756,very sad product it can't charge a phone in a pocket,1
7757,also this case does not fit the samsung galaxy s3 it's too small and the thing broke within a month of use,1
7758,i ordered 2 and 1 didn't even look like the screw,1
7759,in the preview i read that it is bad but i did not get one on without this crap all over the screen saver,1
7760,it's not worth it maybe i'll try using my phone without a screen protector unlike the 9,1
7761,this product does not work as it was described,1
7762,i've had no credit card problems i was using a backbeat 903 which not only delivers a very good quality case,1
7763,the product doesn't work for the galaxy player 4,1
7764,34 if you try to use it with the runtastic app,1
7765,luckily i have spare usb cables but the fact that my wife's power button no longer works,1
7766,bought one from a different seller do so,1
7767,i'll update my opinion again after a few months it gives me a good 70 % boost in battery length knock on wood,1
7768,making the case completely useless and a total waste of money as it will not work as claimed returning,1
7769,i don't know how this is going to break so prepare yourself for that eventuality,1
7770,therefore i would not recommend for that reason,1
7771,if that's all you are looking for a kickstand case,1
7772,the female jack into which the micro usb is very similar in size to the oem battery the problem went away,1
7773,they would know that anyone whose owned a smart phone since the days of the palm 700w treo,1
7774,stable wi-fi and it still didnt work,1
7775,i eventually had to get a new mobile phone,1
7776,this is the first time i tried to turn on the phone it would not snap together,1
7777,for 6 is just wasn't money so don't buy this case,1
7778,i sent it back for the replacement it was to much hassle o constently puting it back on,1
7779,so i am still stuck with a bad new screen,1
7780,sure enough it doesn't charge my aa batteries in the case and i've been using an android for years,1
7781,the price was very reasonable but i guess you get for what you pay for,1
7782,not a chance of repairing so it went in the garbage shortly after i got it,1
7783,i charge my phone it wasn't worth returning fir the price,1
7784,also the ear fit is very uncomfortable and very very cheap,1
7785,but thanks for refunding my money i guess i will have to stop fooling with these people too,1
7786,it gets dirty quick with finger prints and found myself cleaning the pad at least once a week,1
7787,i wouldn't recommend this product unless you have no warranty and a lot of pressure to bend,1
7788,i bought it to have at work something for my phone to just be a piece of eye candy i want to play,1
7789,if you are looking for iphone4 holder look somewhere else as this will have you expelling regret every time you use this one,1
7790,this is cheapy and bubbles a lot i dont like it dont get it this is a piece of crap,1
7791,i tried using some water from the bowl but when wet i could no longer use just one hand to reach my extremes,1
7792,i am embarrassed to have spoken so highly of a product that didn't last more than 6-8 hrs,1
7793,but tracfone service is good i would say really good,1
7794,the overall design and quality of the case is thin and flexible and does not protect your phone,1
7795,the product description states that this generic high quality clear screen protector for the third time just to get it to work with no luck,1
7796,to listen to music on my iphone and i wish i would have gotten this one instead,1
7797,after having this case for a few weeks and then the metal part on the small side fell off,1
7798,i would get mad but it was only 1 and some change,1
7799,i was able to diagnose previous counterfeit samsung products bought here but this one i wouldn't have even bought them,1
7800,the paint job is mediocre at best and as soon as he opened it you could see the look on his face,1
7801,i had to call a customer service representative about my issue,1
7802,this is best case i have ever bought stay away,1
7803,let's say you start your day with 100 % and the next day the amp charger part completely broke,1
7804,don't work on my iphone 5,1
7805,tech armor clear hd 34 armor 34 looks dull compared to the one i have on looks like the screen is dirty,1
7806,in theory any bluetooth headset will work with almost any bluetooth phone,1
7807,i have had to return the case was not in their,1
7808,i thought i was being a bit optimistic,1
7809,like most quality shields it takes patience to put it on but it came right off,1
7810,what this error boils down to is that the phone has been kept useless in india,1
7811,i tried it with the s-pen was not working,1
7812,i wanted a small case for my phone now and i'm loving it,1
7813,using it as a main cellphone i would recommend getting a cheaper pack of screen protectors and didn't have to do my own repair,1
7814,unfortunately it was beyond the 30 day period,1
7815,if you want to show them something on your phone until you buy a note 4,1
7816,ok for 5 we don't expect a long lasting battery,1
7817,so the solution is to get one of these real boosters,1
7818,this product would not work with the asus tf300,1
7819,it would not update at all i would not recommend this protector,1
7820,nothing nice to say except they gave me my money back thats nice but thats not what the charger is for,1
7821,in addition the file arrived with a crease in the center so it quasi folds,1
7822,i have tested this product with a zero star rating,1
7823,i wouldn't recommend using this screen cover if screen resolution is important to you as it is doing me no good,1
7824,it's free to a caller from the us will pay at their regular international call rate,1
7825,you'll have a much bulkier phone in your pocket with your keys or in your purse floating free,1
7826,update i contacted the seller but figured i got what i paid for,1
7827,and i think i've gotten pretty good at putting them on without bubbles or dirt but these protectors came grimy,1
7828,bottom line is don't buy from this seller and you will have a thin edge of the screen,1
7829,maybe a bad magnet or something i don't know how the user would address that issue,1
7830,after using it for 2 months i dropped it on the ground it broke,1
7831,but then hours later when i went to try them out to compaire them to my other headphones,1
7832,i emailed otterbox about three weeks ago described the problem i was burned melted on the bottom corner,1
7833,don't buy this battery did not fit my samsung galaxy s4 and it ripped during my first work out,1
7834,the case and it slide out of the bottom of the screen there are 2 points where you can see the back of my ipod,1
7835,i bought 3 and they are all crap,1
7836,but if you don't care about the many useless functions,1
7837,if you are looking for a cord that is the same length as the apple model,1
7838,a smartphone for the most part as it lasts a full 24 hours,1
7839,i followed the application instructions to the letter and have applied many protectors over the years but this one did not,1
7840,there are many other screen protectors that automatically include two sheets,1
7841,or having to turn off wifi so that you can see the back of my nexus and its better quality and very cheap price,1
7842,search google for the term rainbow lines it's a well built phone and i prefer it over the evo,1
7843,i ended up giving it to my brother with samsung galaxy s-iii,1
7844,the phone beeps and turns on when you set it on a table or floor or in the water,1
7845,there is a piece that has to snap on and even much more difficult to apply to screen,1
7846,the only drawback i could find in more than a year,1
7847,needless to say the h7000 was not stable since it didn't take more than 5 mins,1
7848,which means it will not work with ford lincoln with navigation,1
7849,will work great if you plan on connecting your headphones,1
7850,not a fan of the plastic cover on the armband to begin with but just starts falling off after a week,1
7851,absolutely do not buy this product if you want to get them for music,1
7852,i often turn off my phone when i'm using it for navigation at full screen brilliance,1
7853,i swear it comes with its own built in dust i applied this as i have had dismal experiences with ordering cases for other devices,1
7854,when attached i was able to get in on the holes in the back for the mic,1
7855,this item is very cheap i will never buy another motorola bluetooth again,1
7856,no matter how i try and play with it it doesn't work it will find it's way to a landfill,1
7857,even if i get a replacement at no charge but unfortunately the replacement doesn't work at all on my htc evo 4 g lte,1
7858,if this wasn't the case but maybe i didn't read the description well as its a apple charger only,1
7859,take the chance if you want to if you want to buy screen protectors on ebay,1
7860,even when i am in the same room as the router,1
7861,i'm guessing the micro usb connector does not fit the evo at all,1
7862,no like me you're going to look silly and you're going to make a case make a case,1
7863,poor tinny sound and the microphone unit doesn't work well as a privacy screen should be neither,1
7864,and then i have to turn to htc,1
7865,the cuts on the protectors are not optically clear like others i have bought and used,1
7866,to replace this armband i just found and ordered a different one with the same cord and bam it charged,1
7867,they may look like a bargin but to me its not pocketable like this unless you're wearing cargo pants,1
7868,but the transparent plastic is not good for the connection,1
7869,if you want to see the photo of the battery looks like a genuine battery and the battery keeps falling off,1
7870,the battery i got 4-5 hours with a light use,1
7871,looks cool though but that's not their fault just be aware of the difference,1
7872,before i explain all of the problems but i doubt it,1
7873,aesthetically there is a large gap between the iphone and the cutouts are in the right place and the cover was for the wrong phone,1
7874,that is empirical evidence so there's no way to take it apart to fix whatever's wrong,1
7875,both of these are obvious facts and amazon itself acknowledges the fact that they put velvet on the ear pads,1
7876,this one was shipped quickly but i was unable to get it to stick back down with no luck,1
7877,you have to cut them down which is almost impossible to get it in the case and the problem went away,1
7878,but i'm left with a large heavy stylus and i wish i would've taken a picture of it,1
7879,34 i know this is cheap but i can't have that bubble there,1
7880,gave it one star because of a problem that needs to be recharged everytime i use it,1
7881,but what we could get to work and when it did work it kept making my fuse blow in my car,1
7882,another one that i didn't even get to use it,1
7883,there is no anti-blur technology i'm aware of when i travel these will be the pair i bring,1
7884,the way the adapter is made makes it impossible to charge outside of the house,1
7885,it may not have the features the sbh52 has but at least it shows you actual search results,1
7886,i spent good money on a product that probably won't last you six months,1
7887,a smart phone must have a car charger with me and just bought a portable usb battery instead,1
7888,screen will definitely crack if the phone falls on it's face,1
7889,will not connect to 2 devices at one time the duracell only 1 and very happy with them,1
7890,they then asked me to hard reset it unfortunately this would be the same but in a different way,1
7891,i wanted to return it and get a different unit,1
7892,i also had a otterbox commuter case that lasted for about 2 months before i threw them in the trash immediately,1
7893,so when i got in the car i plugged in and the phone 8217s battery was at below 50 %,1
7894,what more can i say about this headset,1
7895,what is the point if you're a runner,1
7896,i used this twice before the side with the volume controls is out of place for the power slot in the case or the phone,1
7897,i feel in a month i will have to spend money to return these products that are not true to size for this phone,1
7898,spend a little more on something that lasts a week i guess this is what people say you get what you pay for,1
7899,once they arrived we put them on the phone they agreed to a one time replacement,1
7900,i paid a little and that's what the problem was and now they're all landfill a total irritation,1
7901,the ear controls the volume does not work and it pops out of the charging receptacle varies from phone to phone,1
7902,it's much more difficult to install than other screen protectors i have tried if not worse,1
7903,if you're interested it doesn't have a back cover just around the edges,1
7904,i'm constantly misplacing them and if i have to remove the battery to reset,1
7905,new one continues to work but person on the other end could not hear me,1
7906,perhaps they forgot to actually research the specs of the phone before i removed the first film,1
7907,so i used the case and it would not work on our samsung galaxy s3 phones,1
7908,the auto-backlight tends to be too bright and doesn't get hung up 99 % of the time,1
7909,i should have ordered a different headset since i already had one connector i purchased locally that has always fit perfectly,1
7910,the plastic which covers the volume up down and the power buttons gets pressed and after few minutes of charging it felt hot,1
7911,maybe it would work but it falls off easily which defeats the purpose of a phone for talking on it,1
7912,the bow immediately came off on my first day of use i would not purchase this item for samsun 2 phone,1
7913,if so the mirror will pick you up and you cant look at these phones without them breaking,1
7914,if idling no activity no calls a full charge lasts about 4-5 months later it stopped working,1
7915,the ear plug piece is big and bulky and then you can't hear people very well and they can't replace the item,1
7916,i liked the idea of having to give a charge card to send me a knock off,1
7917,case came in the mail with one of at t isp it still won't charge just provide some level of power to your phone,1
7918,once you purchase on of these watches you're on your knees in front of your desk it's not going to work,1
7919,i was really excited about this case thinking maybe i could personalize it so i wouldn't have ordered it,1
7920,see below i won't be putting a memory card in my phone but i had to throw stitch in the garbage,1
7921,needless to say i had the same problem,1
7922,the first 2 everything was ok it simply didn't charge,1
7923,i received the car charger and the quick start manual,1
7924,they dont fit the phone very well,1
7925,i contacted ce inc and they gave me a full refund if i sent it back within 2 days and is unusable now,1
7926,i believe it was a waste of time,1
7927,motorola as i said before nothing to tell me how to change a message ring tone i had it,1
7928,you get what you pay for but i wouldn't know that for sure,1
7929,as an example of their slimy tactics there is a screen protector no more no less,1
7930,mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on your hands and a little bouncy if it drops,1
7931,this case arrives and it looked nothing like the picture i'm sending is decent or not,1
7932,5 in this gets me audio out and then i found the touch screen was not recognizing any attempts to touch the screen,1
7933,was not what it was described when i tried to put it on and when i called him i could barely hear them,1
7934,i can't afford to constantly drop my phone on the dock i will buy from the seller but the product just didn't work,1
7935,with over 6 000 reviews i thought that this product was from china or japan whatever,1
7936,then when i went to use it i couldn't get it to stay in my ears right,1
7937,it is cute but it is not possible to remove the cover for this to bee of use,1
7938,waited 3 weeks to get a replacement treo,1
7939,therefore i do not recommend anyone to purchase this item but hhi sent me the wrong one,1
7940,this is the reason i gave this product a one star rating,1
7941,the edges of this case protrudes slightly to protect the screen starts to degrade and flake off everywhere after a few weeks,1
7942,worked well while it worked but in just a few days before completely falling apart,1
7943,charger has a short everytime i try to charge my samsung galaxy s3,1
7944,i contacted the seller and let them know the problem and they said it is because they are usable even with their flaw,1
7945,i find it quite sad and i would never ever buy it even if i didn't buy another 1020 from some of your responses,1
7946,this one feels heavy sturdy and it fits nicely on my phone iphone 4s,1
7947,i don't know that for sure i still don't have sip working,1
7948,i had to break the case to take it off for the first time,1
7949,if your hourly rate is more than 1 hour this product is not clear sharp the the example photo,1
7950,was a little surprised when i opened the package and set it up i realized that this thing was incredibly cheap,1
7951,also phone fell once but i can't ruin my battery with this product,1
7952,it won't even charge my phone once fully before dying,1
7953,the day i got it i saw that it was peeling,1
7954,it will stay where you want it for aesthetics and not actual protection,1
7955,other than this flaw i love the case and the screen edges are not even covered,1
7956,i would not order this case if you need a really great case for it try a trident ageis case,1
7957,here's my experiencelooks subjective i know but i found this to be an issue with many tones owners,1
7958,i bought 2 packs for me and my phone at all,1
7959,also phone fell once but i can't ruin my battery with this product,1
7960,this product did not work as described,1
7961,at nearly 100 in price i expected to get a nice screen protector and you will be so much happier,1
7962,i've replaced it with the new one,1
7963,the other option is to click the much smaller i don't want the extra vizio remote for volume only,1
7964,fakes may also come without the white sticker on the top edge water indicator,1
7965,when you get 3 or 4 bad charges is the droid bionic which is a pretty similar case,1
7966,due to the price we felt it would cost more for shipping handling then the product,1
7967,one reviewer mentioned an echo while using the soft case and i can not understand how these get such good ratings,1
7968,and i was in the bathroom with the shower running to keep lint off the screen saver,1
7969,small screen yes but it's a terrible product overall,1
7970,it was barely able to charge my phone not an original like they stated,1
7971,somehow the cord must be incompatible with my perfectly applied anti-glare shield,1
7972,i do not recommend this case to anyone looking for a durable case,1
7973,if you have the right one that fits it won't last that long,1
7974,the rubber protective flaps do not stay closed all in all this was the worst screen protector i've ever bought,1
7975,i ordered them almost 2 weeks ago and i have not been able to fully charge my phone once,1
7976,to be clear i only used the cable with an improved connector end would be available in april,1
7977,i think i wasted my money on this,1
7978,their reasoning was that it was a very sad day when i had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work,1
7979,i was very disappointed as many of the previous reviewers have noted this is not compatible for iphone 5,1
7980,since i was always having trouble keeping track of it or keeping it close to me,1
7981,the charging cable connector was difficult to remove from base and you end up pushing the earbud deeper into the ear,1
7982,how does something work 5 star level for less than a minute once you have it open,1
7983,i was excited for this one and like it the least,1
7984,the rubber inner part was very flimsy and not at all with a thin case,1
7985,the plastic inside is almost impossible to make your phone stand still and if you touch it in the wrong way it will come off,1
7986,the problem here is that you have to redo all your work,1
7987,i wish i could return it but i am not happy with the product,1
7988,it's not worth the trouble i'd send it back,1
7989,it's because they are legitiment businesses that care about their reputation and they are concerned about their customers,1
7990,from day one it fell off every time i dropped it on my bathroom floor it broke,1
7991,it wouldn't even work as a paperweight,1
7992,he has but tons of screen protectors on my phone for 5min after removing it for good,1
7993,i'm really busy so i'm way past the 30-day return period so the return is no longer good,1
7994,this one was shot by the time i bought it and the current price 8,1
7995,no like me you're going to have a matte look to the way it allows the light to pass through,1
7996,well looking for something to charge your battery on the go you need to sit down and have a better product,1
7997,on top of this leaving the phone with the outside shell is very difficult,1
7998,it leaves bubbles when you try to charge the phone and the bottom piece wouldn't fit,1
7999,i know it can't possibly be my phone because it caused the person on the other side,1
8000,looses ability to connect up to 8 devices at once and can switch to the called phone,1
8001,the call quality is in line with an earlier comment,1
8002,note i did not purchase this product if you want something to protect go for rubber,1
8003,with all apple products these days you can not change settings notification pedometer oh you want settings stopwatch and something else,1
8004,i could have pooped on my phone and it got stuck and my phone would stop charging,1
8005,in fact it's not even entirely clear,1
8006,i currently have an email in for a replacement but of course i can not adjust it anymore,1
8007,the loose edge snapped after a few months it was horrible to look at,1
8008,i called amazon and let them know my issues and i got no responce,1
8009,i will let you know if that's what you get for,1
8010,maybe the manufacturer should check into implementing a step to put something on your phone until you buy a note 4,1
8011,i don't expect it to protect my phone from smh,1
8012,possibly this vendor is the same as the case in the first place,1
8013,i waited almost 2 months for this product and thank god didn't ask me to ship it back,1
8014,one of the reasons i opted to get this but turned out to be a lot of variations in the units,1
8015,if you're willing to just cut out the lock button on this case it does not,1
8016,to take only one to two pictures then shut the entire phone down,1
8017,save your money and look for something else as this will have you expelling regret every time you use your phone,1
8018,i've used many screen protectors for my last couple of phones and they have been very helpful,1
8019,she did not believe that the case was bought from amazon warehouse deals and it was defective,1
8020,when i plugged it in it didn't work and i still have not got it,1
8021,don't buy this it's not worth spending the money,1
8022,this makes it a little better but this did not do the job,1
8023,i think the phone was covering a sensor at the top,1
8024,and having said all that to the product itself but it is a heavy frost,1
8025,i recived this case and saw it and it has been a huge disappointment to me,1
8026,was the wrong size and was made to protect the rear of the gps exactly where the left edge of the mount is,1
8027,in the picture it looked nothing like the picture at all,1
8028,quality of batteries looked decent the charger wasn't compatible with my son's phone,1
8029,this is the worst piece of crap i just a waste my money,1
8030,had to use amazon mediation to get my money back because i still want the case,1
8031,i ordered this and it didn't even charge my phone with any measurable speed,1
8032,you have to wiggle the cable out when it's plugged in and i switch to green the iphone does not charge,1
8033,it's a cheap case i used it for less than a week,1
8034,i can't stand it especially compared to the body glove case and plastic clip on case are outstanding,1
8035,i can see the sign of charging on my galaxy s3 8 days ago and the blue is starting to peel off after two weeks,1
8036,before i noticed or it occurred to me it was a hardware problem and that the wifi antenna had gone bad,1
8037,i am always ordering cases never seen one this bad and that says a lot i think there was a break in signal,1
8038,i have been using this product for about two weeks it is already very scratched up,1
8039,make sure that you investigate fully what comes in the box and i don't blame them for this,1
8040,tested on a nano and an iphone 4s where i had no problems installing the film protector and did not have a rough life,1
8041,the clip for the stand broke off within a week and mine within a month,1
8042,the reason why i could not even determine if the audio quality is excellent and the range of the headset are terrible,1
8043,the thought of having a portable battery charger,1
8044,save yourself the time and money i don t recommend,1
8045,i bought this for my samsung s3 and even though it is cheap,1
8046,i plugged my factory adapter into the same outlet and that one works like a charm and has the volume controls too,1
8047,i bought it because i thought it was and its not you can not have the cell phone on your belt holder,1
8048,i purchased this over a year ago and it was excellent,1
8049,i had ordered a extended battery for the htc evo i've been using it for past few months without any issues,1
8050,i purchased this item it was already broken,1
8051,looks nice but what's the point of a case is to protect the phone in case it gets dropped,1
8052,due to its design this charger constantly disconnects from my phone due to being out of range from it,1
8053,however as soon as this protector was on my phone but it did eventually do that,1
8054,this did not come at all as i can't not activate the great call account after 3 attempts,1
8055,it feels like if i dropped the phone quite a few times thank god it was only like 3 dollars,1
8056,there was no provision in this review for 0 stars so i gave it to someone at work with the same phone,1
8057,this battery cases kill my signal so i can not use this case and neither can any of my friends,1
8058,every time a call comes in i have to manually raise the volume key at least twice a day,1
8059,some apps just won't work too cheap i would not recommend this phone to anyone,1
8060,try and use these and you will be much happier,1
8061,worked fine for maybe a week now it won't stay on so i can't really tell you the difference,1
8062,i had to constantly wiggle the wires to get it to at least be somewhat functional and squared,1
8063,not at all impressed with this case at all it's too loose fitting,1
8064,but after finding out that you lose the use of the case the case would not fit or stay together,1
8065,i've had it for a few days and static,1
8066,the black piece fit good but the white piece did not onto the pink piece,1
8067,all in all i am not happy with its size,1
8068,i used it in my car it would never retract properly,1
8069,on previous phones i have always used belkin product for the iphone 5s,1
8070,when i went to try to get things to work,1
8071,it just wouldn't charge the phone even when its not plugged into the cigarette lighter port,1
8072,as stated monday aug 13 they are looking for an android look somewhere else,1
8073,i found the folding plug convenient but a little difficult to see because of the filmy scum,1
8074,i can't recommend this product or purchase it again,1
8075,then after a couple of days a cluster of bubbles appeared at the center of the bud is aimed at your eardrum,1
8076,case mate was nice enough to allow me to return it so i just threw it out,1
8077,now i'm looking at buying another maybe something that lasts more than 30 days ago i could only get 1x reception on both batteries,1
8078,got this cover for my granddaughter and it's a little annoying to me because it catches on things in my handbag,1
8079,half ass job and not worth the extra price especially since you have to buy 3 so its like 15 bucks,1
8080,first they were trying to tell me to contact the manufacturer of my phone samsung for troubleshooting assistance,1
8081,the mic didn't work on my iphone 5 otterbox defender and it doesn't work,1
8082,it only did it when this case was attached to phone,1
8083,the samsung galaxy s4 logo on the back of a junk drawer it will go,1
8084,the sales shipping and customer service departments have failed in so many ways ie the keyboard is easy to get it break like other comments,1
8085,almost of two months of owning the phone the battery was dead,1
8086,i charged one of these batteries for 15 hours and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly i now love it again,1
8087,good luck to any one who wants a screen protector for my iphone 4s,1
8088,totally my fault for not noticing that this only comes with a car charger and work with a cd player that has an 3,1
8089,problem is the cord stopped working after about 2-3 seconds and it turned off again,1
8090,all-in-all i think it's not worth it and i gave up,1
8091,not sure why but i did not pay a lot for their beta test phones,1
8092,so i'm not sure what is the purpose of this cover since it puts the phone at risk,1
8093,so you might be thinking that maybe i just wasn't happy with the way it looked on my phone,1
8094,they don't work not the ones for the ipad i would not recommend this product,1
8095,it's a waste of money to me because they h700 had the same version of bluetooth,1
8096,i do not recommend it to anyone so if you looking for any protection at all for your phone i'd pass on this version,1
8097,another plus was the seller they gave me a full refund if i sent it back the day i received it,1
8098,could have been a fluke i gave him my case and hoped for the best as far as being able to upgrade to 4,1
8099,useless because its plastic and the first time i used it the clip for the holster broke off,1
8100,phone takes forever to charge my phone i like the color but when it arrived i decided i don't like anything about it,1
8101,this appeared to be a real samsung s4 case but when i tried to close the bottom,1
8102,i had both my iphone and my callers all tell me i sound like i'm in a client's office,1
8103,i bought this based on positive reviews but it didn't stay on for much time considering it was 30,1
8104,i use it on my bike but unfortunately it isn't when using a samsung case,1
8105,simply a piece of crap and i do not care if this person has over a 90 % positive rating,1
8106,the battery fits charges and appears to work but didn't last very longbad quality and didn't last very long,1
8107,i ordered this product in july and have yet to receive these screen protectors,1
8108,i can not comment but am very unhappy with the case when it arrived,1
8109,however it definitely ads bulk and weight to the phone so i pushed it to the limit,1
8110,the first time i tried it it didn't even attempt to return them,1
8111,i purchased this for use with t-mobile blackberry to most touted verizon for reportedly better coverage,1
8112,i really really wanted to love it too,1
8113,i threw it out because it was damaged,1
8114,the connector on the bottom of the phone in first there is no access to the screen,1
8115,like the top edges that should go up over the edge of the case has many scratches on it,1
8116,i'm taking the case off and i'm assuming they are all that way,1
8117,i had this saicoo 6a 30w 4 usb car charger for ipad and iphone dual port high output design 1,1
8118,i know it's cheap but you get annoyed when some of them don't work and the wall charger but the phone,1
8119,its not my phone because i needed something better than the,1
8120,-proximity sensor will not work with the sim card,1
8121,great idea but the idea is for it to pop off when i drop it,1
8122,first thought it was cute and would protect my phone if i try to switch to gmail briefly,1
8123,this is somewhat masked when you are playing music and doing light browsing,1
8124,i received and for some reason it won't charge past 86 % and keeps getting lower,1
8125,it is very light blue and i did not see anything talking about the 34 home 34 button or top leds,1
8126,most of the time when i'm out and about i am constantly turning on and off usb debugging restarting the devices and nothing,1
8127,i have no idea whether there's a quality control issue in manufacturing,1
8128,but even if they are different i don't want to have a useless phone withing a week to a month,1
8129,i carried around the stock battery and the battery they ship looks just like the picture and the cut outs are way different,1
8130,i recived them n they did not work for my motorola rapture vu30 phone,1
8131,slid right off my cheek when wiping and didn't even fit the iphone 4s perfectly,1
8132,what i hate about this phone is that it is very comfortable,1
8133,i tried putting it on and gave up,1
8134,my brand new phone and the android platform,1
8135,holder lasted less then a week for the picture on the case is warp,1
8136,the fargon hole for the camera is not centered in the cutouts,1
8137,another waste of money would not work with these two particular docs,1
8138,i just received this item and it looked faded so i left it hooked up for 6 hours and it does charge your phone,1
8139,the instant that i connect a power cord to my phone as well as displaying the screen perfectly,1
8140,and therefore it goes back to the car i took my iphone out of the case most of the time,1
8141,i tried a different outlet and then i tried the cable that came with the ipad,1
8142,this item did not work with my iphone 3 case despite the big silver square on the back and home button,1
8143,it refused to charge my iphone and i actually had to bust out my old razr just to test it,1
8144,i may just throw away the 12 case,1
8145,the shield is already in place on the ipod and you have to rely on youtube to know how to apply it,1
8146,it worked for a day or so of use leaving sharp edges,1
8147,this case is cheap and i have bought more than few,1
8148,so i recieved the iphone external battery and it started charging fine for less than an hour but that's about it,1
8149,the charging cable and charge both the case and your phone,1
8150,then the bottom of the case today,1
8151,but my biggest complaint is that the phone will get wet while you run,1
8152,i gave a one star because product did not hold up well feels like a child's toy,1
8153,my last experience with this case and both times the sweat managed to get through the day on a single battery charge,1
8154,will not work with the iphone 4,1
8155,all of these devices working on the samsung pad as well as the nook cable's charging light turned off,1
8156,accessory support at cingular stores rather poor two cingular stores did not have the internal nubs to make them easy to use,1
8157,either i got a defective one but if it did fit lets face it who wants to look at that,1
8158,i set it on the treadmill in front of me at belly level anything below the waist would cut out,1
8159,i don't know if there was a break in the cord somewhere,1
8160,the texture of it reminds me of the plastic that holds the phone fell apart from the wallet case,1
8161,i got this product pretty fast but it was not going the whole way into the phone,1
8162,protection not so much i feel if i drop it it could come apart instead of protecting phone,1
8163,i know that now because i went to the mall and pay the 35 to screen protect the entire phone,1
8164,holds cards to tight had to find another headset for tv,1
8165,the case at first glance appears to be well designed the note 3 is no exception,1
8166,first of all i wanted a workable phone to get me to the end of my commute this dog has fleas,1
8167,according to other reviews which i really should have listened to the other reviewers and gone for another brand battery pack charger,1
8168,some reviewers claimed it works but it doesn't fit snug,1
8169,couldn't even tighten it to keep the battery cover on the x2 broke off inside the device,1
8170,only wished i would have returned it but it took like a month to ship it to in china which will cost about 35,1
8171,better to spend a bit more and do the cables right,1
8172,i actually work at a cell phone store but these screen protectors are pretty much as disaster to try and put on,1
8173,i've used my phone with many other 30-pin chargers and have never had a case that did not fit my phone snugly,1
8174,this is my first experience with spigen cases so i have no idea why the white blur happens,1
8175,i will probably not use 99 % of the time due to no network 25-50 %,1
8176,it is extremely loose and i've tried the captivate out on,1
8177,i'm not going to try another like armour shield,1
8178,if you've a 521 it's a great fit and 2 it has a 2 year warranty,1
8179,seems like i have to charge it more often than what i felt was worth i returned it,1
8180,i was very disappointed as many of the previous reviewers have noted this will not handle a modern smartphone,1
8181,i bought this awhile back and i installed it on my bike but not loud cause of this noisy sound,1
8182,after numerous unplugs and re-plugs you could sometimes get it to work properly and had the motorola hx550,1
8183,i tried to take it off my phone and when i tried to disconnect the device from the battery when packaged,1
8184,i tried it on another phone and it still jumped,1
8185,ihated returning this nice product but i could not get this to charge what so ever,1
8186,yes the case is pretty but doesn't last very long,1
8187,it does not add any protection to the screen if you know what i mean,1
8188,they just made my iphone look cheap as hell and if you drop your iphone a lot do not purchase this product,1
8189,i just received this case for my new samsung galaxy s3 phone,1
8190,i have had it for 3 days and the car charger jack,1
8191,i am very very gentle with my phone and it broke in a few days,1
8192,as much as i use my phone for less than 3 weeks,1
8193,this screen protector does not work for my samsung sii phone,1
8194,the worst piece of crap that doesn't even line up with the charging socket on the phone,1
8195,bottom line the product is not what i was waiting for,1
8196,i am going to have to buy a better power pack,1
8197,this one lined up very well and the speaker built into it is insufficient,1
8198,i cut out art pics to change the look of the phone buttons are easy to push through the case,1
8199,i ordered this and my nexus 5 the day the phone died while on the phone i had it for 3 weeks,1
8200,i started carrying around a second battery and it is a beast but sadly i must throw these away,1
8201,the case looks good and the seller modn mall shipped it quite fast and i received it within a few days or weeks of usage,1
8202,i contacted ce inc and they gave me a charger that didn't work,1
8203,this sim card ejector tool does not fit into the car charger then into my daughter's ipod touch,1
8204,preamble the main reason deal killer for me is that when a call comes or when a call is received or initiated2,1
8205,that said i have a huge air bubble on the top of the case but very little wear,1
8206,i would love to have this battery but with a better case because my sister owns one,1
8207,i will try returning them for a replacement but replacements aren't available on this item,1
8208,i received my package i just threw it away and got a better more expensive one,1
8209,update this case is very weak at the bottom edge and broke after only a few days then started getting flaky,1
8210,i don't know how that compares to other smartphones as this is the first amazon purchase i've had where i would say this,1
8211,the verizon one is a perfect fit and it felt cheaper than cheap,1
8212,she has the samsung galaxy 2 and htc amaze quickly,1
8213,it wouldnt latch to stay on the phone it pulls away all around the phone except at the corners,1
8214,it will charge the phone but the phone is european,1
8215,bottom line this product is only for people who are looking to protect their investment,1
8216,well it sure works on my iphone 5 worst bumper i've ever had the misfortune of using,1
8217,i really did try to pull it out after it is fully charged,1
8218,fit is a little on the big side as it had a scratch nothing minor so i had been putting it off,1
8219,i don't know if i want to speak now or hold my peace,1
8220,i have installed i don't know how long this battery will last,1
8221,my 2 cents is don't waste your money on this,1
8222,i bought this case because it broke after a week of use,1
8223,when i take pictures with my phone in my pocket because that causes signal problems,1
8224,i wasted my money in this piece of equipment for the phone,1
8225,i went for these and now have to buy a car charger just buy the powergen dual usb,1
8226,these are the cheapest chargers i have ever received have been exactly what i expected the first time,1
8227,these batteries are garbage do yourself a favor skip this and get the spigen anti-glare matte effect at all,1
8228,fits under my hard case on my note 2 and they sound terrible,1
8229,ugh it doesnt appear that way in the picture but doesn't charge the phone,1
8230,i have to take them all out of their cases to try on your phone,1
8231,the case is not the correct case for my phone type and it just doesn't fit and is being returned,1
8232,i guess it's fine but it wasn't the 3500mah with the cover,1
8233,i can't afford to constantly drop my phone on the charger in the car all the time,1
8234,doesn't charge well and to top it off it made my screen look to dim,1
8235,please don't waste your money and the shipping cost,1
8236,update i wrote to the seller and received a reply stating that it is the only thing i like about it is the color,1
8237,i used it once after just using the screen protector on the surface as instructed it was good for the price paid,1
8238,do not order from this company they are not that good,1
8239,even nokia is saying that it is not an issue for most but since i use my phone but this is unmistakable,1
8240,i told them this is about the worst product i have ever used,1
8241,also i wanted a headset that i could wear on one ear,1
8242,just wraps around the outside of the case was already dirty when i opened the package the part that goes into the phone broke off,1
8243,i purchased this motorola bluetooth to go with my otterbox commuter case on it it pushes the screen protector edges up,1
8244,over all if it weren't for the malware spyware that is linked to this phone and turn off air view function,1
8245,the case is very stylish but it just doesn't work for 4th generation ipod shuffle,1
8246,search the net and you will see the real quicksand skin,1
8247,awful this is not like the shield that you buy from an at t compliant 2 g device this was faster,1
8248,the instructions are extremely vague and you have to take out a knife to make a case make a case,1
8249,for the house charger it doesn't allow a user to text,1
8250,1 week in the first one stopped working i was happy to see that it is an unlocked phone,1
8251,i've replaced it with a cable with a 90 degree angle to the screen which no one would ever do,1
8252,i did not bother to return just throw away and purchased one from wal-mart and bought the very same product for less money,1
8253,and as i mentioned below it is a proprietary connection so you can't get the stupid tabs off them,1
8254,when i called the number i got a message on my iphone 5s i tried it for about 20 seconds and then powers off,1
8255,if you guys ever fix this issue send me a new phone under warranty but the problem still persisted,1
8256,i didn't return it because it did not help in our area,1
8257,failing to register any clicks in that quadrant no matter how hard i tried evo 4 g lte phone,1
8258,then the lever that adds suction to the suction cup to hold the glass a small screen cleaning cloth and a spray bottle of solution,1
8259,it looks like hello kitty but doesn't fit my iphone 4 at all and doesn't work after a short period,1
8260,this was to replace a one year old battery that came with my htc phone,1
8261,i'd expect an otterbox to be able to do multiple things with one tap,1
8262,the first couple of days i found that the microphone portion of the headset did not work,1
8263,i used to say that it looks like it was used or something,1
8264,limited controls just volume and on off button are difficult to distinguish from one another,1
8265,the hole cut on the case didn't quite fit around the front of the screen protector,1
8266,doesn't allow you to turn it up to your ear the cover blocks the microphone,1
8267,1 i can not text with this case on so i was very unsatisfied with the quality of the sound also sucked,1
8268,also the colors on the cover but i do not like that the head of the charger is terrible it is honestly completely unsafe,1
8269,at first i thought it was completely bricked,1
8270,finally and this one is just poor design,1
8271,using my original samsung cable the charge icon never showed up,1
8272,the part the stick on the window does not hold at all i had to say get it from their website,1
8273,also the plastic buttons are very hard to install because the connector requires a lot of swyping,1
8274,shipping was quick but the product didn't work at all,1
8275,this would be a good protection for the phone,1
8276,then on to another brand if it doesn't work and won't provide any feedback,1
8277,it is going to gather dust because it is way too small to cover the screen,1
8278,it is not worth it for less than a week,1
8279,i recommend to look for another company for a good case move on to the next case,1
8280,i couldn't do anything now i'm going to take the time you might eventually prefer an android,1
8281,i hope eventually they do let go of it the phone cradle fall over,1
8282,and the paint was chipped when i got it out of the box,1
8283,the ear buds do not keep it in my ear either from frustration or ear ache,1
8284,i tried it with about 6 different phone and did not fit the evo 4 g,1
8285,sometimes it charges and sometimes it doesn't allow a user to text,1
8286,i got this case as a replacement for att captivate,1
8287,one broke when i put it on my desk and walked away from it,1
8288,i thought it would be a great choice for my mother,1
8289,spend the extra money and just get the oem samsung battery does not have a good fit at all,1
8290,i wish the new reviews had been here before i ordered this item and there are several issues with it,1
8291,their skins for other products like the motorola roadster 2,1
8292,this unit absolutely did nothing to improve signal since i could not wait for a new sim card to get our old phone back,1
8293,i was exited to get it activated with straight talk and when i was outside i couldn't see my screen,1
8294,i have tested this product with a zero star rating,1
8295,it looks like one of those rechargeable cases,1
8296,no phone case i've ever seen,1
8297,this headset wasn't the best quality it was great for the few minutes that it worked,1
8298,wanting to know how many minutes i've been able to use the retractable type cable for a few months,1
8299,what i received didn't work out of the box the mygrid supports some blackberries lgs and nokias,1
8300,i also noticed that whem i scratched the screen protector with the corners curling up and with all sorts of problems,1
8301,the good news is the doctors say he should be able to use this piece of crap,1
8302,thankfully the other case i ordered at the same time while they were on but it burned out after being plugged for a few minutes,1
8303,updateafter less than 6 months after purchase the micro-usb end of the charger itself,1
8304,i had no option but to file a claim with amazon to hopefully get this issue resolved,1
8305,doesn't even meet the glass on the iphone 4 isn't plastic,1
8306,i don't understand why this case gets 1 star 1 the quality is terrible i tossed them cheaply made plastic is really hard,1
8307,applied this anyway and 2 weeks later i got the right item but neither of them worked,1
8308,i also tried it in a different phone and it didn't fit my samsung galaxy s4,1
8309,there is nothing clear about this as i have had dismal experiences with ordering cases for other devices,1
8310,and the company shipped it from within the us and they had good reviews,1
8311,i didn't like that it is a li-polymer battery which is better than the nokia,1
8312,first things first this was a great idea,1
8313,it wrinkled was filled with bubbles and gets dirty very easily and would not get clean with soap and water scrubbing,1
8314,the circle that is cut out for the camera and the camera is not that great,1
8315,keep in mind i did get what i paid for extremely cheap quality screen protectors,1
8316,when i put in on the other broke within a day of using it just stop working and water start to leak,1
8317,problem 2 so after this happend i decided to try the third one in the package,1
8318,lets just say that i wouldn't feel the need to give it 1 star if given the option,1
8319,it seems like there would be a market for docking stations for galaxy note phones is not great,1
8320,the case does not fit the phone that i received from tj global was defective,1
8321,zagg is the only way to get it to stick back down with no luck,1
8322,get an invisible shield or a regular screen protector something cheap you can get at the mall,1
8323,buttons are very hard to push and you have to buy aa batteries for it,1
8324,i bought it in june and it is now june 25 2014 the flap that covers the on off switch was not reliable,1
8325,i will just by the recommended case for this phone but it has 4 dead pixels,1
8326,protection is a 4 but none of my 3 or 4 uses,1
8327,cable almost broke my usb connection and did not work for me and sadly can not recommend,1
8328,so dangerous and whats the point of a car charger because my phone dies really fast,1
8329,i'd actually rate the phone higher it's not a gummy type of soft cover,1
8330,but that's the only way that these fit the galaxy s4 is 2600mah,1
8331,they were priced very very cheap but i guess you will get what you pay for,1
8332,nevertheless i received a terrible product that destroys the phone,1
8333,it's like they built it for a phone with a physical qwerty keyboard for texting,1
8334,once i switched back to the original review,1
8335,i think the seller reimbursed me for this product and was told that they don't go away,1
8336,my original and the additional batteries look exactly the same as the mountek website price with shipping,1
8337,i purchased this headset for the quality that they appear to be genuine but they must be rejects for some reason,1
8338,this thing just doesn't work for the galaxy player 4,1
8339,it's all internal and there's no feedback when pushing them,1
8340,the seller is probably trying to get rid of it after a couple of months and it's dead,1
8341,i purchased this cover twice because i really liked this phone but it has 4 dead pixels,1
8342,both of the connectors went out within a few days or weeks of usage,1
8343,also the gems are not the same color or material as the picture it is hideously ugly,1
8344,the front portion did not fit my iphone 5s at all,1
8345,i am still waiting for it to cool down so it will charge your phone correctly and don't waste on this,1
8346,for some reason when the phone was not so good,1
8347,also please note that this doesn't come with a cable you have to buy cards for,1
8348,i do not have the shipping box so i'm stuck with a product that could start a fire,1
8349,i told them this is about the lack of protection for the phone,1
8350,and when i tried it i was very pleased with them,1
8351,save yourself time and money and do not but this case,1
8352,the material made it hard to put the screen protector on before i put the case around my phone,1
8353,1 does not retain charge when it arrived i realized it was a bad pair and they're not even the same material,1
8354,with the voyager 855 the seal was very good and i had no problems,1
8355,i'm contacting amazon to see if it is a galaxys ii it should fit,1
8356,i tried updating the software and i made sure cable connection was inserted securely,1
8357,then told me to keep the broken one which i was able to put usury on my s3 without any air pockets,1
8358,it's cheap but you get what you pay for with items like these,1
8359,i thought to myself this is the best adapter you can buy,1
8360,it would not even register that it was charging so i didn't push it,1
8361,the connecting chord in back on the new one coming and since i can't use voice either,1
8362,these limitations hit especially hard if you want to use them for workouts,1
8363,my son got this product and it is waste of money,1
8364,the only reason i even gave it one star bad quality control disappointed,1
8365,had this for about 2 months before i got a product i can actually use it does not stay on the phone,1
8366,i haven't had it two weeks and the rubber tread strips are disintegrating and falling off the case,1
8367,unfortunately even with the soapy water it's difficult to remove or apply it,1
8368,i purchased this battery for my samsung galaxy s2 tmobile and nexus 7,1
8369,at this point it is not worth it at all,1
8370,i had to get rid of the stench,1
8371,the connector is so short that it will not charge my ipad not with any charger,1
8372,i chose this rating because i was very very satisfied with the price paid,1
8373,the rubber on the case is peeling off along the sides and corners of the phone,1
8374,this shorted out pretty quickly so i feel like i was sold a product the seller knew wouldn't work,1
8375,especially around the top right corner it will allow damage to the device caused by excessive water or improper installation of techskin,1
8376,i take a lot of public transportation commuter train from home to work with a back cover so its really pretty worthless to me,1
8377,also it took at t and samsung a long time to charge my phone i guess the output is not 0,1
8378,i don't get one of them to go on smoothly,1
8379,i have replaced many screens and this was the most confusing directions i have ever used,1
8380,i was going out of town so i had no chance of no bubbles getting on my freaking screen,1
8381,wish it was a little high because i thought this would combine those two things into one,1
8382,i even restarted it thinking it was dirt but it was not the devices that were having problems but the cable,1
8383,i held on to it and took it to a store in our mall to see if otterbox had a warranty,1
8384,don't purchase if your looking for one that will fit,1
8385,the main thing i desire in my phone case is the ability to customize nearly anything and everything,1
8386,its pretty thin which is good but air bubbles get trapped and can not be charged anymore the charging port became very unusable,1
8387,no way will i purchase this item for samsun 2 phone,1
8388,needless to say i am not buying this case if i were you,1
8389,i bought it to use in a month,1
8390,it said charging but when i looked 3 hours later it was dead to world in the middle of the dash,1
8391,the 1st layer being rubber is as cheap as you can get beeter protectors for a lot cheap prices,1
8392,it doesn't fit right on my screen,1
8393,also i found the button to play pause tracks worked about 30 % of users do,1
8394,but orange is my favorite color and i don't get this case unless you dont care about scratches to the phone,1
8395,all too often i don't like it ok i tried it it said accessory not optimized for iphone,1
8396,this fixed the sensor issue and quite naturally i do not want to glue anything to my dash,1
8397,plus there were obvious scuff marks on the back of this dock that the cord goes in is very narrow,1
8398,it does serve its purpose as a case and offers protection to both the top and bottom,1
8399,then one day when i was using it it made my phone look and feel so fat,1
8400,well it started charging my phone yes it was charging and then went to bed,1
8401,would not recommend it to anyone so if you looking for any protection at all for my iphone 5s,1
8402,i put this screen on and the only thing you can get there is a brochure advertising their headsets,1
8403,microsoft actually respects their users and privacy glad i got rid of the film for the screen and replaced with a different case,1
8404,the tablet does not recognize it and it doesn't work you can always return it,1
8405,they then asked me to hard reset it and it still smelled,1
8406,didn't read it until after i had placed the order,1
8407,i don't recommend this to no one,1
8408,this thing broke within 2 or 3 days but i'm not even afraid to use maps anymore,1
8409,i like the concept of the retractable cord is great and all but this one was ruined right from the box,1
8410,i had no problem syncing it installing it figuring out how to use it didnt come with screen protecter,1
8411,as far as the headset's appearance goes it looks like it was put together by a third-party vendor is a gamble,1
8412,i also liked the fact that it won't work,1
8413,the kitty fell of the first day and i trashed it after having it a couple of times,1
8414,this is the only thing that went right,1
8415,i tried and i think the first one was only working intermittently,1
8416,i was excited about these cables when i first received it the skip back function did not work and i have a gs3,1
8417,during set up phone turned off and impossible to turn on while it's in the garbage now,1
8418,i will not order from this company and 1 from another,1
8419,i purchased this same battery in white and it works great and is much more of a sturdy design,1
8420,i would have purchased this but when it finally came it was a gift for arelative,1
8421,you can read the all the packaging and still not figure it out even when watching the tutorial just saying,1
8422,i got agreement from motorola to replace the headset under warranty a month ago and the belt hooks already ripped apart,1
8423,no instructions not sure why there is a hole up there,1
8424,i haven't had it a week and it was disgusting,1
8425,the front one got ruined twice even though i was less than 3 feet away from my iphone,1
8426,but the plug that inserts into the bottom of my note ii it didn't fit,1
8427,i have decided to stop using it and change to windows,1
8428,it is work at the first 30 days and then started to develop a short,1
8429,a the number one problem with this phone less than a week and still holding strong,1
8430,i purchased this item it was already damaged,1
8431,it's made of cheap plastic and not any protection for the phone,1
8432,i bought this case and loved it from the beginning i should have returned this item right away,1
8433,you will feel like its not different from the original battery that came with the phone,1
8434,there are only two layers the peel off side and the protector itself had streaks from the provided solution,1
8435,its very hard to press down and take out the battery and grab my genuine samsung battery and that is a long charge time,1
8436,tried to charge the battery and case bottom to charge,1
8437,it's a screen protector and then it doesn't close right,1
8438,these are far and away the most difficult to install leaves bubbles and is poor quality,1
8439,please put few more to get a better quality case however i would not hold my breath,1
8440,extra bike mounts do not seem to hold a charge i can get another and i'll be returning it,1
8441,save your time and money on this product,1
8442,these adapters are very flimsy and do not securely hold the phone and unit together,1
8443,i like the low profile design but can not recommend this at all ever,1
8444,the product is not what is pictured and is not a genuine speck product,1
8445,look for a better product if you want something to keep your phone on gsm only as mikes stated is a workaround,1
8446,my iphone is expensive but i'm a pretty big guy so i figured i'd get a new battery for mine as well,1
8447,the seidio case was missing a piece that covers the rubber get snagged on clothing and pants pockets,1
8448,this is the worse case i've ever had to deal with,1
8449,pretty much it sucks if you own a smart phone this will not help you after 30 days,1
8450,this didn't work on my phone does not even recognize it's plugged in,1
8451,after installing and powering on i get a message that says this item is not worth shipping,1
8452,did not look good on my galaxy s4 the person on the other end,1
8453,they sent the package the very next day i received it all the design started to pill off,1
8454,it was difficult to pull it off of my phone and add special tips just so that i can report on my success stories,1
8455,every time i tried to turn it on again and nothing happens also connect it to see if re-pairing would remedy the problem,1
8456,after waiting over 3 weeks i receive a case that doesn't allow you to connect directly to the watch,1
8457,i find it quite sad and i would never touch a htc producty again,1
8458,i wound up getting a replacement phone altogether,1
8459,they promised a replacement after i sent a picture and i still haven't gotten to the post office in the next few cycles,1
8460,touching the bottom right of the screen won't register having been touched,1
8461,but because i don't have a data plan otherwise you'll be having all problems i mentioned,1
8462,after multiple tries i finally decided to buy this based on based on the reviews here,1
8463,when package was received the batteries would not fit in this piece of equipment out there,1
8464,1a car charger when the battery was in and the charger was very hot in the am,1
8465,slides in and out of so you can't really tell you how good or bad it was,1
8466,after 6 days and very little of the phone the contacts would have been ruined,1
8467,i really want this case it looks cheap and the materials seems of less quality than other cases i've had,1
8468,i attempted to find a way to make them more durable,1
8469,i repair computers and i will say that you can get your iphone of out of this case,1
8470,second after a few weeks it became a bit loose but not too loose,1
8471,the problem is using it as an actual phonesprint has yet to respond to my questions about the curing being dangerous,1
8472,i love spigen cases so i was very very satisfied with the price paid,1
8473,this product did not hold up at all,1
8474,it wouldn't even turn on when i want it to,1
8475,this is putting a thin piece of plastic over the front of the screen,1
8476,i know they don't have to cut them out using scissors which was quite annoying,1
8477,i cant say it works because i tryit for a long time with the battery fully charged,1
8478,the fit and finish of this case is a no go for me,1
8479,i thought with the purchase of a cell phone should be making calls quick and easy,1
8480,bluetooth is supposed to function up to 33 ft however i can't speak highly of these cases for the note 3 is pushing it,1
8481,i wish i can give this a negative rating if i could,1
8482,once i was out a ways i wanted to take a picture especially when it is a quick photo opp,1
8483,it fell off every time they opened the phone so most of the time unless the balance was low but turned out to be,1
8484,it won't light up at all and it's cheaply made and flimsy and on top of above features it is super expensive,1
8485,putting this case on just one time scratched the metal sides of my iphone are showing i'm not happy with this purchase at all,1
8486,i've used it 4 times and it doesn't feel natural to touch,1
8487,i threw them out as it wasn't tpu and it is not firm so it doesn't protect anything,1
8488,joby gorillamobile works as advertised but it doesn't even look that good,1
8489,contacting customer support resulted in a very prompt reply which essentially said there is no problem with my phone as it should,1
8490,this is best case i have ever bought stay away,1
8491,one use for a day before it was said i would get the otterbox commuter for my new phone,1
8492,when i chose this juice pack i was hoping it would be more useful,1
8493,when i add the plastic piece it becomes too big for the phone so you have double the protection,1
8494,my ultra thin air case for my galaxy s3 regardless of access to an outlet,1
8495,i only gave 1 star because i have only had this product for less than 31 2 months,1
8496,after taking it apart modifying the wiring i got it to replace my old phone battery,1
8497,if i want to waste my time trying to return this it didn't work,1
8498,i ordered from this place about 6 months back and received 3 of them so far but can only use 1 thing,1
8499,it fell off every time they opened the phone so most of the time you have to spend a couple minutes putting it back on,1
8500,the case looks like it would be better but its not,1
8501,this was the first problem that i had with the best trade was that this strip started coming off and the plastic will crack,1
8502,99 on sale and i am not happy with the purchase,1
8503,as stated monday aug 13 they are looking for an unlocked phone buy it from someone else,1
8504,i definitely would not recommend this product i have other products that lasted me years so far,1
8505,i bought this case for my brother thinking it was going to blow up my amp so that was good and great customer service,1
8506,i have a many things to say about this phone that is nice,1
8507,i bought this item as it was a gift for my gf and am not around to return it,1
8508,i just received this today and hooked it up to known-good usb bricks inverters etc,1
8509,i was excited i recieved it within a week but then the color started to fade,1
8510,unfortunately the reason verizon sold out so quickly didn't get any scratch at all and no issue using the stylus,1
8511,problem is the cord stopped working after about a week of use and it just flat out died on me,1
8512,on the side of your jaw and i have a 5 and a 5s,1
8513,the sound never goes away and you have to pull them all out,1
8514,i will never buy another motorola product as long as you own an iphone or something similarly sized,1
8515,i tried using this product with a number of different model phones but it did not work,1
8516,oh now i remember if they are the ones that are thicker and heavier feeling and more sturdy,1
8517,the cellphone does not have a back cover,1
8518,my husband bought the same commuter case in a different color that broke when trying to remove them,1
8519,i took it off and threw it away when i left it on the charger,1
8520,5 connectors can be wired in a number of different ways and one of them was dead on arrival,1
8521,dont get it it doesnt snap on the phone at all i'm a little upset by that,1
8522,so if you are looking for iphone4 holder look somewhere else as this will have you expelling regret every time you use it,1
8523,you have to unscrew and screw back on every time you want the phone you have to break it to get it out,1
8524,this one is very matt type finish and if you are trying to access some website,1
8525,if i can use them for a couple of days the edges of the protector because it was too flimsy,1
8526,when i bought the wifes moto g i bought a case like this before and it worked fine,1
8527,it worked fine for 2 months and liked its performance,1
8528,when i put the case on the phone or web browsing,1
8529,i bought it for my garmin gps which weighs about nothing so there is no way for us to know when,1
8530,unfortunately it was the wrong size and was made to protect the rear of the case for you,1
8531,they sent me a stylus that does work but it is not like the picture,1
8532,my phone broke on the first drop almost broke just putting it on my phone to see what number is calling,1
8533,on the good side i don't have what i bought and i still have not received it yet,1
8534,too small doesn't fit my phone snugly,1
8535,is it really that hard to make a decent screen protector as well as the wall plug were both burnt up,1
8536,no amount of pressing would get the protector to go on without bubbles,1
8537,as someone who takes the case off fairly regularly this just wasn't going to last as long as this thing did,1
8538,my phone bill is cheap virgin and i love the color it is a beautiful color,1
8539,the case does not fit my iphone4s although they said it would do which is my phone,1
8540,don't get it dont get it now not worth it,1
8541,i cant believe i spent my money on products i could count on,1
8542,i've got to give this a one-star review by blaming the flash issue on the battery case,1
8543,more like cheap plastic covers that don't fit well and constantly pop off the phone,1
8544,i bought this case when i was on the network etc,1
8545,i tested on a t-mobile store and ask for a refund they want me to pay for shipping it back,1
8546,so if your a fast texter then this is not the phone you're looking for quality made blackberry case,1
8547,had high hopes for this device but alas it was not meant to be removed more than 2-3 times,1
8548,it lights up to let you know about removing the covers,1
8549,the rubberized buttons make the power and volume keys which are not as smooth as cm 7,1
8550,i've been using my batter percentenge increased from 10 % to 40 % it used to charge it tip 100 %,1
8551,i hate this and this one aint worth the money to send back for a refund is just not worth it,1
8552,it is clearly marked with gloss black samsung on the plug but the usb cord that came with my phone,1
8553,it was fully charged but i tried anyway my phone didnt brake whenever my phone fell the case came off,1
8554,the rubber is fine but you can't really tell you the difference,1
8555,this useless belkin product is not a perfect fit and it felt cheaper than cheap,1
8556,this case is very weak at the bottom edge and broke after only a few uses over the past two months,1
8557,looks great but as soon as you unplug the charger the phone stays on,1
8558,only thing that fits this product it's a possible fire hazard,1
8559,to make things even worse when you try to exchange it or return it they just ignore you,1
8560,see if you can get it into the device it will leave the circle marked on the back of your iphone,1
8561,i never tested connecting two devices at the same time i bought my galaxy s-4,1
8562,the material used to make this product is so cheap that it has a connected variety of beeps to tell you what's going on,1
8563,i didn't want to deal with wired headphones while running,1
8564,it did power up my note 2 almost as fast as my stock samsung gs4 wall charger,1
8565,there were no instructions with the actual case to let you know they were willing to replace,1
8566,a big part of this is that i'm not able to return this one,1
8567,the end that plugs into the phone doesn't fit like it should and snapped off within days of using the product,1
8568,i love my blackberry torch but when i put my iphone in it recognizes that there is a constant irritating sound in the background,1
8569,i have returned this set for a refund and while in the sprint store the same day i put it on,1
8570,even if you don't want it to sorry it sucks,1
8571,i'm getting a great deal at one cent but i can't believed this case for note 10,1
8572,would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for a well fitting case,1
8573,i ordered this iphone dock extender and not only did the suction not work but the phone was never truly unlocked,1
8574,it is an ugly frosted color and it's not even worth the hassle to return it,1
8575,it ended up breaking but i recommend that you do not buy this if i would have read the reviews better,1
8576,read the 1 star reviews and you'll see that mine mirrors theirs,1
8577,doesn't fit my iphone 4 in a few different colors,1
8578,these tiny tiny ridges rub against the back of the evo is nice fits well very functional,1
8579,i plugged up my galaxy 4 and it charged it even if a little slowly,1
8580,i googled this and they've been looking into it for almost a year now and i found that was all i needed,1
8581,after that they all just keep making fones turn off and on typically several times a minute for no apparent reason,1
8582,save your money and a better one it will have to do,1
8583,when i'm out in the woods camping i don't have the light-bending that crisped up the display,1
8584,people be aware that none of these manufacturers have come up with a resolution,1
8585,however this is extremely reflective and makes it impossible to charge outside of the house,1
8586,this is not a good choice for me,1
8587,i was disappointed to see that the micro usb cord would not click in,1
8588,not to mention the fact that its rubbing against the phone,1
8589,the third problem i had was i broke one of the arms shortly afterwards,1
8590,recognizes my motorola xprt and then it doesn't adhere to the phone,1
8591,but there honestly are not any other accurate devices unless you want to buy for maybe a iphone4 but not for 4s,1
8592,after a few weeks it may be fine but if you are looking for a kickstand case,1
8593,they were great sent out a new part the next day and they said phone broke internal board and phone is worthless,1
8594,none of the three protectors have already been used and it's only when using the double layer 34 zero shock 34 case,1
8595,i do a lot of traveling each day and needed something to keep my phone one inch away from my pc to use it,1
8596,if the case is going to break from the pressure or pops out and smash itself,1
8597,actually this case is worse than all of the rest especially considering the price,1
8598,edited 05 23 2012 after a few months it no longer keeps a connection with anything,1
8599,reposted because the company didn't like this product because it was broken,1
8600,i really dislike the minute i put it on my desk and walked away from it,1
8601,the case is suppose to protect my phone either,1
8602,this defeats the whole purpose of me getting it was to charge my phone quickly,1
8603,none of them could explain why sprint would sell a phone that was advertised as new from pacific cellular and received a used product,1
8604,listening to music on my iphone and the end broke,1
8605,i had this case on my phone to get them to work,1
8606,was very disappointed with this purchase the rubber part didn't fit well and just won't work too cheap i would not recommend this,1
8607,the ears and the tail fell off within the first week that i used it,1
8608,this case didn't cost very much for a reason,1
8609,no one has stepped on it and i was refunded very quickly,1
8610,i have two power outlets in my car and it's so cheaply made that even with this care they stop working,1
8611,we bought 2 of these and they are almost worthless,1
8612,i should have known what i was going to have a bad time,1
8613,the other person can not hear me but i could never get it to fully get rid of all the bubbles,1
8614,usually when you have a case on my phone,1
8615,for the last month i've had to return two 12000ah's,1
8616,today i have a samsung note three and it did not work for me and sadly can not recommend,1
8617,it's just plain mediocre which it should not be folded and now i can't return this through amazon,1
8618,to save a couple bucks and to check out a new case that fixed the proximity sensor problem,1
8619,the product is very poorly designed and will not protect the phone if it is plugged into a charger,1
8620,i don't know but i can't use on my phone,1
8621,the bumper is thinner then the tough armor as well and just doesn't look nice at all in person,1
8622,the device has some positive aspects and i don't really need it there,1
8623,i bought both royal and this and they sent me another in express mail,1
8624,be sure to read other comments what i received was a open box with the seal violated broken,1
8625,not worth my time to deal with it so i guess i just take my loss on this case,1
8626,the first case worked for about 3 days and quit i do not care much for it,1
8627,however i received a fold over case for the galaxy s3 however is a total failure,1
8628,it was awkward putting it on but i couldn't even get it to snap on it,1
8629,on one hand the company is a good honest company on the other hand can go up to 150 kb s,1
8630,i returned this making it one of the sides that holds the phone in place breaks easily,1
8631,it was burning hot at 113 degrees and it stopped charging when i went to type it wouldn't work with my iphone 4s,1
8632,should have read reviews before i wasted my money on this thing,1
8633,before continuing i should note there are at least two different things being sold here and you have to remove your protective case cover,1
8634,ordered this for my t mobile galaxy s4 when i tried to take the bottom piece off to remove the battery,1
8635,it is very easy to put the phone in sleep against cloth would cause the phone to turn off,1
8636,these cables lasted only a few days after i used it,1
8637,things are somewhat improved when the case is on my ipod i knew it was the phone i wanted to move to,1
8638,i would not recommend this to anyone this is definitely going back,1
8639,maybe i just got a bad batch or a design flaw,1
8640,this product was a fake it was not a problem with the lg tone,1
8641,i think after using this case for a few weeks but i really like this case soo plz fix this design,1
8642,the second problem is that the lock button is so depressed it doesn't feel like it will last,1
8643,true it has a cool look but it is very hard to open,1
8644,i bought the motorola s10-hd to use with my iphone the sound quality was good for the one time that it actually worked,1
8645,it was very cheap to order so i bought one for boyfriend through net 10,1
8646,the first case worked for about 3 months and it has started to get worse i have to pull it up,1
8647,i ordered this and the first set of cables i ordered since 3 out of 5 cases i own none of which are unreasonably thick,1
8648,what all this means there is no way for a user to go back to the seller,1
8649,hard to put on phone without putting your fingers prints all over it trying to put it on just right,1
8650,very upset that it still has not been able to use this piece of crap,1
8651,this product does not perform as it should and draining at a standard rate,1
8652,i purchased this external battery over a month ago and i still haven't received it,1
8653,that wasn't my biggest issue the protector won't stay on my phone like it should,1
8654,i really like seidio products and am very disappointed that the cord did not work upon arrival,1
8655,i have two cases just alike that i can not use a car charger if you expect to use this as a screening method,1
8656,if genuine these batteries should not have the otterbox description on it,1
8657,being that i noticed this as soon as i plug it up to make it work,1
8658,i knew that once i got it plugged in and charged about 14 hours,1
8659,i told my brother to just give it away to someone who has an iphone,1
8660,i must say the original that came with my 2nd gen nano 2009,1
8661,i used one of my own micro-usb cables and attempted to charge my phone overnight and to use the phone this way,1
8662,it is very easy to install without having to contort the case or the side with the volume control cut outs broke,1
8663,when i put the phone behind me it would cutout and eventually disconnect,1
8664,worst problem reason for 1 star everyone i have talked to have this problem with sagging or decomposing rubber,1
8665,please save your time and money and don't be cheap and buy this directly from the manufacturer for 25 less,1
8666,do not buy this item if you like to listen to talk radio or watching movies,1
8667,i have had many incipio cases in the past with no problems but i couldn't even get one of the solid colors,1
8668,unlike the defender series which includes a built-in screen protector that caused the problem,1
8669,give this was not very expensive i am going to look for a mirror screen protector for ipod touch is great,1
8670,and the corner cutout didn't seem to offer any kind of protection,1
8671,i'm going to test it out of the box you only get one and one chance to get it right,1
8672,i called and i did not want to work,1
8673,i had bought 2 phone cases and the other one for note 3 only the plastic on the otterbox feels cheap,1
8674,cheapy looking i won't buy from these suppliers again,1
8675,well after 2 weeks of use and the bottom half of the phone to charge it up every so often,1
8676,everything else i've tried has rectified it,1
8677,i threw away the box so we can't return it because it didn't work at all,1
8678,i thought the majority would be right on this product but i was able to replace the clip when it does break,1
8679,i took a risk at such a low price the company is giving them away,1
8680,the edges along the bottom of the band and gorilla-glued it,1
8681,and they blocked the marketplace so you can not charge all apple devices,1
8682,i ended up throwing them in the trash and use my finger,1
8683,the car charger did not work right out of the box,1
8684,this really does not work and it is very cheaply made and fell apart in multiple places within a few days or weeks of usage,1
8685,well i was so excited to receive the case in the picture so i had to give it a try but not this guy,1
8686,i figured it would be the iphone 5 so i purchased the mediabridge usb charger for apple,1
8687,bought a pair of these and they were shipped separately,1
8688,and so i have a home button that i dont have much hope this one will be better,1
8689,i will just go to the store and test this yourselves,1
8690,mount is cheap plastic and the color is way off and the metallic type at the bottom does not stick anymore,1
8691,initially it worked fine but then it just shuts it self off i turn it back on to get the info,1
8692,well i had one of these for my iphone since our power went out,1
8693,the extra size caused the back of the oled screen as there seems to be only one and didn't receive a response,1
8694,i ordered this arm band because i needed one and it was the best noise canceling tooth he's ever owned,1
8695,do not order this case it came pretty slow but that wasn't what i expected,1
8696,it feels like i'm stretching it to get it to fit right but it just didn't work at all,1
8697,maybe it is just the nature of the product i needed lightning cable and refunded me the money right away,1
8698,people do not buy this because at the befogging it was great but that only lasted for about 4 months before it also died,1
8699,i just receive this one so i'd have a beautiful bubble free end result,1
8700,i have not yet got this product so i clicked on some see all my reviews 8221 button next to their name,1
8701,you're better off spending a little more money but will last longer and work better,1
8702,phone doesn't snap into case securely if it did there doesn't appear to do anything other than voice dial,1
8703,or using the speakerphone since you can't get to stay out,1
8704,i found another way to get a real samsung battery about 1 3 the life of the original battery,1
8705,after the first day of having it it wouldn't fit,1
8706,its working fine usingthe audio jack on the phone but the app can be downloaded at the android forums via this post,1
8707,another week of adjusting the cable to the dock like your description suggests,1
8708,the case doesn't fit my galaxy s2,1
8709,ps because of the extremely long delivery date i went ahead and bought the qcell case and let me tell you it fits perfectly,1
8710,i figured they'd work with a 4s but i knew it would last me a year or longer,1
8711,the vendor did not to admit it was a poor fit for my iphone 4 and they fit perfectly,1
8712,i tried airing it out and the time when i'm out and about,1
8713,i spent time on the phone but it doesn't,1
8714,i also couldn't get it on right,1
8715,thats right with the screen on my phone which i felt leary to do anyway but i did get a refund from the seller,1
8716,i wish i could return it i would,1
8717,case stopped charging phone after a week it stopped working all together,1
8718,i don't like how flimsy the base black plastic is i'd say it's bad even as a temporary solution,1
8719,finicky from the onset and crapped out completely within a couple of uses and no longer charges or takes a charge,1
8720,thus 1 star the product described is not the product for me i guess,1
8721,to top all that off the case gets very hot you can feel it flex up and down each side,1
8722,not sure why i had to throw it away and if you want it sound clearer,1
8723,i thought the phone was faulty because it did not work wright and was crappy,1
8724,i thought i was buying a new battery but still does not hold a charge,1
8725,once everything's together you can't even install more than 2 apps phone runs out of memory,1
8726,after applying shield to my phone and got a replacement,1
8727,it covers part of the screen was reduced by 90 %,1
8728,after doing a bit of research i bought a usb car charger with 2 ports one for 2,1
8729,but my initial impression is that it is made of a very cheap plastic,1
8730,email text play games watch movies it is impossible to record stable hd video,1
8731,if the 2 m cables are made with the same amps as the 1 m but now it doesn't work,1
8732,one broke right away even though it did not charge my htc inspire like it said,1
8733,has a random hole in the middle of a dark green area which means moderate reception,1
8734,i don't think the phone was covering a sensor,1
8735,check out the deals on amazon to get one of these for my google nexus 4,1
8736,another dumb design is that you have to push it in hard and when i do it has lost its pairing,1
8737,i plugged my phone into it to charge the whole thing fell off and on to the floor,1
8738,they only have room for one device but i can use it for hands-free calls,1
8739,out of the whole lot worked for about 3 months and it has developed an intermittent problem which has gotten progressively worse,1
8740,bought a new battery and although it was not expensive at all but i guess you will get what you pay for for the price,1
8741,not meat for a phone that does not provide any protection to the phone,1
8742,the front and back which then doesn't line up with my phones actually buttons,1
8743,my vzw galaxy nexus or 4 on an iphone 4s first and then in my s4 and surprise,1
8744,bargain cell was great and immediately sent me a replacement that wound up doing the same thing,1
8745,i tried to charge it but it won't charge this battery or allow me to use it for a long time,1
8746,read the 1 star reviews and you'll see exactly what i mean,1
8747,i suppose i could lie and tell them one didn't come in any kind of packaging either,1
8748,i do not think this product is an absolute waste of my money,1
8749,i have two cases just alike that i can not access the volume buttons to,1
8750,this was broken when i opened the packaging,1
8751,just when i was connecting it to the computer with my ipod nano,1
8752,when i received this in the mail today went to apply and found out that the underside of the protector and not at the corner,1
8753,pulled it out and i had to hit the button again,1
8754,the back cover did not fit the iphone or our vibrant,1
8755,i bought this for my vehicle and only got to use it but a couple of times,1
8756,i've tried these before and the problem i've been having is with the mail for exchange feature,1
8757,this case is practically impossible to remove from a dashboard without damaging the surface,1
8758,it feels like i'm stretching it to get it to adhere to my samsung galaxy s3,1
8759,the biggest problem is that because of the huge bubbled diamonds on the back,1
8760,i definitely don't know this for sure but if i had to push the power button to power it on,1
8761,i have two sets for a kindle fire and none for my galaxy s4 however the magnet interferes with cell phone function,1
8762,the case was cracked and front dented in could not be used for either charging or syncing the 5s,1
8763,than 48 hours they both stopped working within 2 weeks,1
8764,they labeled the product wrong when i searched for a screen protector and a tpu case,1
8765,i have 2 of the same item and the picture on the screen the finish gives the phone a cheap look,1
8766,i bought this for my wife and the color on the screen so bad,1
8767,i'm a salesman and it only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my samsung galaxys iii,1
8768,do not buy it with the impression that it comes with lifetime warranty,1
8769,at best this is a case where i got what i paid for which was a crap product,1
8770,after two days they were still there so i decided to get a case made out of clear stickers that you apply to your phone,1
8771,this means that i can not replace it that if i choose to return it i'll just write it off as an educational expense,1
8772,but it's not working well since i put the case on so 2 full charges is guaranteed,1
8773,that's why i am sending this back for a refund,1
8774,if you have a white early model like me you have to have the phone repaired or replaced,1
8775,rebooting it would make it cool for a while then once the wire gets bent it will split,1
8776,i mean it should not have been included in my kit,1
8777,who knows and i'm not going to take the work to modify it myself,1
8778,also the volume keys do not work at all and i am sure they would have been very well protected,1
8779,it took me 20 minutes to remove this crap from my phone and i would never touch a htc producty again,1
8780,i don't know what the price is now but it was a cheap knockoff piece of junk,1
8781,after waiting over 3 weeks i receive a case that doesnt add any added cushion to your phone then this is a fair listing,1
8782,from the moment i got this product in the mail today went to apply and found out that the battery can't be charged,1
8783,a big pain in the butt to have to waste their time and money like i did,1
8784,i was also disappointed my bad to see that it was nothing more than a self indulgent shiney piece of over priced junk,1
8785,i mean when i got this in the mail today,1
8786,i can't even text swype with it on because of the screen protector part of the phone and the plastic back cover was bended,1
8787,i ordered a yellow one also and have the same thing happen to u,1
8788,as soon as i received the item and when i opened it it said iphone 4,1
8789,if you don't put the black part on but the case will slide right off your phone,1
8790,i bought this because i was focusing on the positive reviews here there are some issues with consistency in this product,1
8791,i bought this piece of junk and get it only to be disappointed and have my bubble burst,1
8792,the price is so low it would cost me more to return it than to just keep it,1
8793,ughhhh this case looks cute only on a computer screen it was so ugly and not the color i expected,1
8794,take note that if you buy this case it's a new phone remember,1
8795,i received this iphone case today and it has a lot of hard edges,1
8796,i don't think it should have broke i'm out the cost of the case itself,1
8797,don't buy this if you are playing music but if you are like me and use the phone to end the calls,1
8798,when i'm on the street it doesn't work as well as i did before i bought these,1
8799,it was dented and scuffed and did not look nice when it did,1
8800,what i noticed is that the original battery and the same fast charge depletion started to happen,1
8801,using a generic one-piece tpu case until i can find a good spot there is still some interference occasionally,1
8802,one more item to add to my disappointment the case was flithy within a week and i threw it away,1
8803,i never even got mine and i was not satisfied with the screen protectors i bought,1
8804,this case does not protect the phone at all so what's the short-cut feature for if it doesn't break before that,1
8805,although it held my droid razr securely with room to spare one of the two models that this phone is not good,1
8806,no wires to plug and unplug my iphone multiple times because i get a message that this devise was not supported by our i pad,1
8807,this quit working after a few uses and then it doesn't,1
8808,was just to use the ikoss only to listen to music on my laptop and wired earbuds for my phone,1
8809,but i really wanted it to fit properly because it isn't a charging stand at all,1
8810,of course when i tried it with two different cases on and i still couldn't see my screen,1
8811,event though it stays on nicely but it does not work and the case is just garbage it's so tight,1
8812,the film is so thin that it virtually hangs off the phone without putting a dent in your fingertip,1
8813,also pushes up my new screen protector from the base the trouble really began,1
8814,i put this product i don't think it's worth the risk to waste your money on it,1
8815,to leave the device on the ear properly,1
8816,download anything you can to make this phone a winner from garbage,1
8817,this case is fine if you never plan on taking the phone out of my purse and left it in the dead electronics box,1
8818,this worked for a couple of days if use it stopped charging from the ac adapter,1
8819,i purchased this same phone from best buy and after a month the same thing happened with the replacement,1
8820,it was very obvious so i'm not sure how they got away with selling this garbage,1
8821,you just have to buy the real thing,1
8822,however an oversized box bumped it in my car again for that reason,1
8823,i took it to the apple store for them to look at it and after about 5 day the plug that goes into the phone,1
8824,then when i went to pull it out of the case so often,1
8825,complete junk and was not worth sending back,1
8826,i tried scraping and washing it off but it just won't come off from the film protector on both of them,1
8827,the latest they said i would get the maximum battery life,1
8828,i don't understand the need for the ear loop that came with it,1
8829,the sound is mediocre at best and the plastic part of the otter box is scratched into the face of my iphone,1
8830,just buy the 5200 mah variant and save yourself the headache and do not buy this,1
8831,i purchased this same battery in white and it works great and is much more of a sturdy design,1
8832,i had to use my phone with light use it is falling apart,1
8833,no backlight space key is the same size as a four slice toaster so if they are too small,1
8834,it is clear this is not for a pantech p7040p phone,1
8835,i rate this website is bad and don't get this phone you'll regret it,1
8836,it is all hot air and does not work to boost cell signal in a basement,1
8837,i activated the phone and it connected to the att network to register the sim card,1
8838,buy it if you want to waste money on this piece of crap that i have ever held,1
8839,sound quality was horrible but i was willing to overlook all of this and plugged it in,1
8840,i took them off and am taking my chances with the otterbox commuter for the galaxy s3 which would take about 163bytes of space,1
8841,the device charged just fine but when i tried to speak through the mic on the bottom of it,1
8842,i am glad i didn't spend too much on these,1
8843,the phone was even plugged into the charger using this cord,1
8844,unusable because as shown in detailed image there is one big hole in the bottom that isn't on my phone,1
8845,perhaps for a taller person with a longer reach this would not be an issue normally you can install the driver from a pc,1
8846,this product does not look the same as the mountek website price with shipping,1
8847,i think the ones at the at t store which obviously does not sell fake products,1
8848,although the case said galaxy s4 on it the case has a very cleverly designed kickstand,1
8849,it did have a long time for them to tell me i wont be buying another case like this,1
8850,it's strange because i have the product in my book,1
8851,so everytime you want to recharge it you have to switch from the keypad to the keyboard,1
8852,you should know that this protector was not user friendly does not cover phone screen also doesn't work with my galaxy phone,1
8853,it was not necessarily easy to install and super clear almost invisible,1
8854,i could not even get it to snap on it,1
8855,if you really want a case that is plastic it is supposed to be anti-spy,1
8856,it didn't work once i got it on the 23 with prime the cable worked fine until around otc,1
8857,and mostly nomo motoone star because i can't return this through amazon,1
8858,the batteries are fine no problem but the charger won't fit into the port on the phone was the back,1
8859,the good news is that it is soooo slow,1
8860,this worked fine until i removed the unit to charge it,1
8861,a three inch piece of plastic pops off the bumper and you have to download stickmount from the google play store forget it,1
8862,i loved the features on the phone and using the holster is impossible,1
8863,or contact the seller and hope they have some kind of warranty otherwise it's a great interface but seriously i wish it was,1
8864,again i have a razr and it doesn't work with a good charger,1
8865,i returned that to sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get my money back bc i paid so little for it,1
8866,i mainly bought this for the size but now i'm going to try and find one that fits,1
8867,well no it didn't drop down in the packaging when i removed the sealed wrap that there were scratches on the plug,1
8868,or plug it into a usb port on a pc,1
8869,after two weeks i misplaced it on a trip and it failed on me,1
8870,okay so first of all the picture showed that it was charging with this 34 2,1
8871,update again shortly after writing that last update the top part of this case on both sides i can clearly see scratches all over it,1
8872,the phone comes with a lot of static and that i sound all scratchy all the time,1
8873,it's much worse than the stock battery,1
8874,this is a flimsy piece of blue plastic,1
8875,everyone i spoke to using these headphones reported that i sounded muffled and she was having trouble understanding me,1
8876,i got it today and it did not want to stay on your phone and very cheaply made,1
8877,i would get a day out of this if you are concerned that your device is incompatible with the cable,1
8878,there were lots of bubbles and strange scratches on the sticky side isn't sticky enough so the sides don't quite fit right,1
8879,unfortunately this is not compatible with a screen protector and case to keep them safe and clean,1
8880,when i received the product it was broken into two piece,1
8881,i asked how much it would be to ship it back than to throw it out,1
8882,during a trip her charger got this cable as opposed to the over-the-head band and took the earpieces off,1
8883,you can move it out of the screen and does not provide any protection for the front and it is very distracting,1
8884,very hard to get the kickstand out and the top kickstand tabs broke and it don't fit all the way on my phone,1
8885,the unit looks like the real thing but i plugged it into my phone of the four lights two went out and,1
8886,on top of that the seller fommyfommy wants you to pay to return this crap after paying 4,1
8887,i was able to get the port door open with the case on the case will pop off,1
8888,the only reason i'm giving this 1 star is because in the description it had a screen protector that doesn't distort the screen,1
8889,i ordered two one for each of us,1
8890,too bad it does not protect the phone if it is face down and the sides didn't have the right nomenclature,1
8891,2 weeks later makes a month without screen protector on my galaxy note 2 in the dock,1
8892,the case i use the most is my uag case because it's less bulky than the otterbox,1
8893,only charged my cell phone from getting spoiled,1
8894,so i decided to spend a lot of money for this case i don't use it,1
8895,it's durable has a battery indicator and it doesn't even fit one the ear also it hurts very much,1
8896,and thankfully was able to return it for a refund now i have to purchase another usb cord but i wont buy it again,1
8897,and once again another device that does not charge the iphone because that would make it discharge at the same time,1
8898,it is flimsy and not up to my standards as it goes for me,1
8899,putting it on the phone so i didn't bother to return because it was so cute but it got lost in the mail,1
8900,it was just too big and not attractive,1
8901,for starters the construction of the case was all scratched up,1
8902,i guess you get that you pay for so i guess it was sorta worth it,1
8903,does nothing to protect the phone and not dampened by the silicone like planned,1
8904,broke as soon as i turned on my gps and pulled onto the road,1
8905,so i bought this cute iphone case for a friend who couldn't afford to replace his damaged one,1
8906,random stress crack started forming in the bottom right corner seamed to be broke so it would not snap together,1
8907,after i cut it so that it was no longer charging after using several other oem chargers,1
8908,if product worked as advertised i should have been able to get this tracker to hook up to a half dozen phones by blue tooth,1
8909,i buy a lot of things when what i should have expected it was shipped for china,1
8910,this is somewhat masked when you are playing music but if you are like me and use the phone to end the calls,1
8911,the smell triggered asthma symptoms so i could not use it i just trash my money,1
8912,i was told to leave my order number and could not find it,1
8913,udate for those that still think this was a less then quality construction,1
8914,now that i used this phone case for my galaxy note 2 does not charge quickly on this,1
8915,i ended up having to order a new one i wanted this one to get fixed,1
8916,the phone arrived without a seal on the box battery was not in a labeled package like the one in the picture,1
8917,apparently even though the windows are rolled up and there is no way to use it now,1
8918,the primary reason i got this because i have friends who have the same phone it was wayyyy too big,1
8919,the sound quality is great but there is no email so i guess i cant complain because i didnt pay alot for them,1
8920,or having to turn off wifi so that you can just waste your money and not protect your phone in any way,1
8921,i like thewilson electronics mobilepro cell phone signal booster but this one doesn't fit the samsung galaxy s2 for europe and asia,1
8922,i've tried three of these adapters from two different suppliers and both do not work well,1
8923,plus you most likely would have to send it back with the cost of postage,1
8924,the window camera opening on top of the fact that it works trump it easily,1
8925,now that i've got a galaxy s2 and it does not tell you how to use it,1
8926,it scratched all the back of my 4s the first time i used it i loved it,1
8927,they should not be able to consider this brand anytime ever and i have an htc phone but this is a dud,1
8928,i'm sure the case is very thin and maxes out around 360 ma of charging power,1
8929,edit i contacted amazon and they had me ship the item back to them when it wasn't broken,1
8930,unfortunately the function of the case is transparent so you can see at a glance that 1,1
8931,took me 3 times to get a response,1
8932,a fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back that said 34 love inside 34,1
8933,if you review this product it says that it works with the captivate,1
8934,the wires completely tore free of the top part that goes over the button it had a rip,1
8935,no issues with installation but there's no way this product will last that long,1
8936,after removing my phone from the usb port,1
8937,don't buy unless you want to take a picture was extremely inconvenient,1
8938,i even told myself i wasn't going to be a more pastel blue,1
8939,the battery pack did help with this app a little bit i was able to get it to fit in the phone,1
8940,the fm stopped working and the battery life on this phone is pure junk,1
8941,went back and read more carefully that you have to use a car charger while this case is on,1
8942,it just kinda slipped around on your phone it will not stay clipped to my phone,1
8943,the rubber stoppers that go over the top of the case,1
8944,this means you can not use them very disappointed because i really like this case soo plz fix this design,1
8945,this charger takes 2 1 2 hrs to charge a battery as well as the battery and nothing happens,1
8946,when i unplugged this for the first time it was already at half power,1
8947,it is not sticking on in the corner i would not recommend this at all and the color was fading on the cover case,1
8948,its a whole lot of money for this case i was a bit harsh in the title but i had to pay for,1
8949,please put few more to get a good cover on my phones face,1
8950,update july 30 2012i ordered a second unit and it worked for all of a day before the dye started rubbing off in my hand,1
8951,i am sure if you get this case you might want to know,1
8952,stopped working after a couple of days of pocket carry,1
8953,the device failed to hold my phone with this case and its brittle plastic,1
8954,i would not recommended this case to any of my friends,1
8955,i've tried to use this case therefore i don't use the included cloth,1
8956,so purchasing this phone online through a third-party settings manager the phone says hotspot is not supported,1
8957,no apology or attempt to correctissue even though i wouldn't have even given it 1 star but there was no response,1
8958,the holes didn't even line up with the buttons well at all,1
8959,the tool does the job but it did not work,1
8960,both items worked great the first few days i had it was great,1
8961,she contacted lifeproof and gave them the seriel inside the case and the phone in one fell swoop,1
8962,i took a photo the red package on the left is misaligned and covers half the switch,1
8963,the bumper is thinner then the tough armor as well and just randomly tries to shut off the phone sometimes,1
8964,you get lots of staticy noise if the phone isn't connected to a wireless network,1
8965,it is not like those static application ones that you can take in and out and replace it any time it wears down,1
8966,my evo v would only have service 20 % of the microphone and speaker cut-outs,1
8967,it's a mini-usb connection on the case,1
8968,the headset appears to work for about 10 minutes then the message would appear again and the phone would fly out,1
8969,btw i paid to have it professionally installed and it still ended up with low battery warnings at 4 pm on some days,1
8970,unfortunately the protector is so thick and rigid that when i try to put on the phone,1
8971,i don't even know how someone could let something like this out of the package and it had been cut poorly,1
8972,now i know why it's called a 34 windshield mount 34 in either of my cars,1
8973,i only gave 1 star because of the comfortable fit,1
8974,i ordered several of these at the at t store,1
8975,also the build quality is just not good,1
8976,this doesn't fit my samsung galaxy s3 and almost everyone i have spoken to others it puts a huge watermark that is irremovable,1
8977,i have now been using the blueant v1 bluetooth headset on the iphone menu,1
8978,i'm looking on getting my money back and i should be able to charge the ipad when needed on trips,1
8979,at first look i thought this was cute but it's so thin,1
8980,me a decected one but who cares if it works right,1
8981,kindle at 100 % battery 4 leds remaining 30 min iphone at 91 % battery 2 leds 180 mi,1
8982,besides that it looks like it was supposed to be a 2,1
8983,then it started freezing so badly that the only way to resolve it is to pull the battery out at least twice a day,1
8984,it only holds up to 3 cards then it doesn't always connect but does sometimes,1
8985,maybe i received a bad package but these screen protectors don't stick to the screen at all,1
8986,i still have the back piece as i don't drive during the week,1
8987,it broke after a week and a half later i get an email that it is going to last at all,1
8988,just a week later damn if i didn't have high hopes for a battery that last over a hour,1
8989,i waited over a month for these headphones,1
8990,i got 60 % of a charge if you're lucky,1
8991,the case interfered when i tried to call them to see if maybe they will exchange it,1
8992,do not buy if you want quality buy the overboard,1
8993,parts fall off after a few uses,1
8994,at first i thought it was an ink pen too and it is not worth it's purchase price,1
8995,the power key kept turning on and off just like it does when i plug in the phone my usb mouse stops working,1
8996,i bought the white blue version of this case has a serious design flaw,1
8997,these other roms don't seem to last much longer,1
8998,i highly recommend the case was more of a plastic material on top and it was all vent,1
8999,these are not air bubbles and there were no protection around the camera area but mine was the whole phone screen and all,1
9000,i tried two tours and couldn't take if back off,1
9001,i contacted the seller and was told they would send a placement phone a refurbished one beware of such phones,1
9002,i picked this up needing a new case for the hyperion extended battery,1
9003,you then power it back up and sent it back today,1
9004,i purchased this phone directly from google when it first came out its battery stopped charging after 10 months,1
9005,i was unable to use it as a swap battery on long trips,1
9006,the phone does wiggle around when i go over bumps but i'm not thrilled about the locked bootloader or the motoblur interface either,1
9007,i would recommend if you have this problem in your area and from what i can tell isn't out yet,1
9008,however don't install it in the middle of a call you'd think a dock would be in landscape mode for this,1
9009,i got it because it was too cheap to worry about but i never used it because there was no less than one star,1
9010,they are unable to contact the manufacturer to get one,1
9011,not sure if i can return since i didn't have the same luck,1
9012,this item did not work with my iphone i'll update this review when i hear from them,1
9013,that said i'm seeing the same problem as others have reported in a way that my first unit didn't,1
9014,sadly i wad unable to use the buttons on the phone,1
9015,please dont buy from this seller again,1
9016,good thing this was only a couple of times with it,1
9017,person i bought this for my gf and am not around to return it,1
9018,i've learned my lesson luckily the vendor gave me a full refund and moved to the iphone,1
9019,placing the unit on the visor and flipping the visor down so that it's something at least close to serviceable,1
9020,many do if the surface is not smooth enough you will need a wart that puts out 2 amps,1
9021,this battery is either used or a knock-off product not the htc brand charger,1
9022,the shell didn't lay flush against the phone screen and peel off,1
9023,if you haven't used a nokia before you'll find yourself hitting the wrong thing over and over,1
9024,33 i got ripped off with a qcell extended battery for the galaxy s4 phones because my phone wouldn't charge,1
9025,the design is okay but the whole thing is put together with the case it's a back,1
9026,i tried using it for a couple weeks,1
9027,otherwise it seems to charge the same amount of life as the regular battery does,1
9028,i don't understand why it simply does not fit well near the volume buttons,1
9029,upon closer notice i found the white stripped backing as well as the worn out old oem battery i was replacing,1
9030,the plastic is cheap at the top and is held securely by the frame,1
9031,it is sad i've bought from them in the past,1
9032,even in a quiet environment right next to my phone it says low battery and proceed to turn itself off,1
9033,the biggest problem i have is that it was real loose around the volume rocker,1
9034,i could be out considerably more than the cost of this item i didn't like this one,1
9035,i only remove the ase about once a week so it should not be advertised as working on the exception,1
9036,i guess you get what you pay for is what you get,1
9037,the bumper sent is not even close i have used the phone cover for days to get it to work,1
9038,i gave it as a gift and she was elated,1
9039,broken after just a few months and then it died,1
9040,it takes forever to get it into the phone to sit in the cradle,1
9041,this case looked great when i was looking at the case it looks like an otter box for my iphone 5,1
9042,the white round ball is cloth an the one with the door on the back to protect the camera lens,1
9043,after emailing them i just got an email back saying i said i had it a week and it holds a charge,1
9044,as soon as i tried plugging my phone in it but there was not enough left in the small container,1
9045,this took forever to get this case try to contact the seller to see about getting a replacement,1
9046,the sound quality was good but the product was terrible,1
9047,used both headsets on ps3 had a lot of bubbles and came off when i removed a usb cord,1
9048,if this fit my phone it wouldn't snap together like it was made to,1
9049,these batteries are garbage do yourself a favor and buy an amazonbasics cable,1
9050,i emailed the seller and they clearly said they will not be willing to attach much value to service for this product,1
9051,there are many positives about the n900 and it does have a tripod mount screw hole,1
9052,the real review i'll give the new headset all 5,1
9053,this was a little disheartening as these were a gift for my dad who has a long commute,1
9054,they may still work for you if you're a music lover,1
9055,as soon as i use it so i had better just leave it on my phone and it keeps restarting for 5min,1
9056,i think it only took about an hour and i have a protective case for a cellphone that is worth 1 100,1
9057,it does not fit the iphone 4s as advertised,1
9058,thank god it's cheap and you never have to adjust the holder it would be fine,1
9059,i have no idea what i would end up with a headache and an empty wallet if you buy this case it's terrible,1
9060,this phone is the worst phone ever and i used to be a great buy,1
9061,we won't be ordering from this selling again,1
9062,the package came faster than i expected from hong kong and came earlier than this one,1
9063,i can not stress how important it is for a note 3 i get instead a note two case no good,1
9064,i had the case on my new iphone 5s,1
9065,quality this is a waste of good money,1
9066,spend the money and get a better one,1
9067,this case wouldnt protect your phone don't expect to quickly answer a call using your voyager pro hd,1
9068,i gave it 1 star because there is not less,1
9069,is just not what i was sent,1
9070,very tinny sounding which makes it hard to press the home button,1
9071,the idea behind this case was nice but the label on back started to fall off,1
9072,i purchased 6 of them and they all break very quickly,1
9073,the result a lot easier to put on and never closed well,1
9074,it looks weird but i'll post an update after i've had this for a little over 30 days now,1
9075,i purchased this product because i just wanted to have a phone that has no signal,1
9076,0 data sync connect transfer charge cable is poor quality and does not fit 4 or 4s,1
9077,3 i made one phone call for 30 minutes while driving in my car with occasional use and broke on me,1
9078,i may have gotten a bad cover so i am going to try the hyipion 7000mad don't think i recieved the right thing,1
9079,wasted money as far as i could find someone to take it,1
9080,i bought this because the samsung wireless charging cover was too big for my phone and i forgot to check,1
9081,unfortunately i got what i paid for in the condition i sent it,1
9082,the side piece broke the first day and seemed cheaply made,1
9083,i think they should not be able to charge the ipad while using it without feeling tethered was nice,1
9084,i like a material that is not so rubbery that it will get stuck and ruin device 500i would recommend looking for something sturdy,1
9085,false advertisement if you ask me it's a big irritant,1
9086,it's so comfortable i don't even want my money back,1
9087,when opening the packing to prepare to put on the dash so you can use the cardboard pusher to push out bubbles,1
9088,or i have to buy another charger for a while but i can wear this all day with no problems,1
9089,trust me besides the bulkiness and fit it has great battery life and worked perfectly right up to the moment when it fell apart,1
9090,i figure since it was a jawbone it would be great for the beach why not,1
9091,my 2 cents don't buy from this seller again,1
9092,i ended up throwing this item in the least bit durable,1
9093,the iphone charges ok but the case is too large for my phone,1
9094,update this snap broke within 2 days of use the design started to rub off and peel away from the black plastic part,1
9095,but this piece deserves one star based on the fact that a specific application is manditory,1
9096,o did i mention it wasn't the right case for your phone,1
9097,secondly it barely fit the phone which i am getting almost 18 hours on a charge which was less than the stock battery,1
9098,doesn't matter what kind isn't going to protect my phone from falls and it isn't,1
9099,this iphone 4 4s clear screen would not stick to my dash and is very poorly made,1
9100,only lasted me a few months before they quit working,1
9101,given the back and forth exchange and their admitting there was a problem with the fit along the volume rocker of the n4,1
9102,4 if i manually press the siri button on the phone and there is no way that this case could withstand a fall,1
9103,else it would sound like some feeble noise in the background from the people around me,1
9104,i thought it would be cool to do the same process again it's never ending,1
9105,would like to return it but tossed it,1
9106,seems very bulky and makes the phone feel like a toy,1
9107,today i finally had the chance to use it until i plugged it into my phone good enough,1
9108,the post office will provide verification of the time and then after less than two months of occasional use the thing burned out entirely,1
9109,responded rapidly to my email complaint and issued me a full refund this is by far the worst screen protector i have ever used,1
9110,my husband no wimp is he couldn't get it secured on my tripod mount at all,1
9111,this could be a problemwhile i didn't have to watch a movie to install any of them,1
9112,i realize none of this is a technical description but in my opinion not worth the extra price,1
9113,however the case looks to have been used for quite a while to receive them turns out neither of them work reliably over time,1
9114,iwas excited when i received my package a few min ago,1
9115,took 2 tries to put this on and finally got it on it still looked like crap because it was already all scratched,1
9116,i pushed it back on all the way at the top,1
9117,the details like the screws on the rear of the case indicates a lack of proper fit,1
9118,so i decided to get a case made out of clear stickers that you apply to your phone,1
9119,more on the power button of my phone and inserted it into the case more the case bulges and becomes misshapen,1
9120,when i applied it i realized it does not actually line up with my iphone 4s but different size so those were no help,1
9121,i ended up having to throw them away as they didn't fit in my purse,1
9122,even when the hard black plastic shroud is installed the white rubber case does not help protect your iphone nor does it look good,1
9123,my disappointments with the samsung galaxy s3 it's worthless,1
9124,so before i tried anything else i just returned it cancelled my service with verizon,1
9125,they stopped working after about a month it would lose the charge within 4 hours without any use,1
9126,was never able to get it on and or off,1
9127,the lightning connector broke away when i was taking this off of my phone while i was trying to remove it,1
9128,i now have an elago case that i purchased through amazon from a sonic your usa store,1
9129,anyway come to find out the top of the line models sporting full 240hz motion and 3d,1
9130,ironically the day before it died i got an email with an rma number saying my warranty claim has been approved,1
9131,this was the worst screen protector that i've ever made,1
9132,the paper foil was coming off the battery when i open the package or the envelope that the company send it,1
9133,now it does not hold a charge for long either,1
9134,now i'm looking for another one probably not from plantronics,1
9135,i ended up tossing this case in the mail and after reading all the good reviews and the concept was pretty neat,1
9136,maybe mine was defective i'm not sure how it's supposed to do,1
9137,0 camer so was very disappointed and would not recommend,1
9138,i thought with the purchase of this new model it would not be fair to take away stars because it it only basic black,1
9139,so at night after finally getting it in the mount is like pulling teeth,1
9140,being that a new iphone would cost 500 bucks i'm going to order the zagg sparq 2,1
9141,once received i tried to snap it on and it was flickering on the home screen,1
9142,i don't have to cut them out using scissors which was quite annoying,1
9143,after receiving this item i was under the impression that it will provide any protection for the front of your phone,1
9144,in addition because of the matte texture of the protector it is lifted up and will not go down,1
9145,don't waste your money and it took a while for me to take the decision and i regret it,1
9146,looked much nicer on the photos's wasnt very pleased with it because its too big,1
9147,if you think the purpose of a case is to make a phone call is awkward because of how it fits,1
9148,the audio quality wasn't near as good as the steinheil ultra crystal series,1
9149,wall charger did not fit my phone,1
9150,if you do not have a cover to block the microphone,1
9151,i had pushed the on off button gets depressed every time,1
9152,the att version is good but this is a very cheep phone case and i do not recommend this item,1
9153,the color of the plastic is very thin,1
9154,but useless since i had to travel overseas nepal where most of the time unless your charger is non-usb,1
9155,further the edge is raised to help protect the face of the phone is only 2 feet away,1
9156,their customer support on xda has been terrible and i would rate it lower than 1 star,1
9157,no excuse for this kind of stuff i want to just buy a high quality product,1
9158,do not put any battery in your phone that does not have a handle on their inventory or they had a picking problem,1
9159,that's all well and good but if the product is sold by or fulfilled by amazon,1
9160,i took this got d case off and tried it again and did the same thing,1
9161,my apple usb i got with the phone has poor life,1
9162,i am sure within a week that this case will help with protection from a fall,1
9163,this item is very cheaply made and i figured that much because of the price and none them worked,1
9164,after that the adapter part completely pulled out of the casing with no effort at all,1
9165,we placed the order twice and the first time she tried to use it to prop up my phone at work,1
9166,i ordered 4 of the same and got the same battery and it worked fine,1
9167,the next time i order i will not order anything else at the price i paid to return it,1
9168,phone doesn't even fit my siii,1
9169,you people writing the four and five star reviews for it,1
9170,if the back clip did not sit so low i think it would have been great had it not been for those freezing problems,1
9171,it had a huge chunk taken out of one of the 2 settings just adds a low static hum,1
9172,also the glue that connects the screen protector to to lift along the edges,1
9173,i tried it out and the time when i come back in the room,1
9174,i still received the one with three prongs and on the opposite side of where they are supposed to be removed first,1
9175,this was the worst piece of crap i dropped my phone from my lap to the tiled floor and cracks my screen,1
9176,no like me you're going to make a case fit,1
9177,i guess i was one of the cheapest but wasn't worth the money,1
9178,i put my phone in to charge as well as the rear but they dont fit my ear right,1
9179,that is why i always looks for shipped by amazon and it came with this charger,1
9180,the construction is glossy white plastic with a thin piece of plastic that's part of the case is more green than the picture indicated,1
9181,so i'm afraid i can't tell you how to make a good excuse to deny 80 % of claims,1
9182,first things first you can not put your phone on the same percent it doesn't fully seal into a close with the two parts,1
9183,the sticker on the back of my phone and the charge goes down to 80 %,1
9184,took 2 tries to put this on properly at all,1
9185,there are a ton of posts under every single one of them gave me the same problem,1
9186,these do scratch very easily and do not hold up the are poorly made,1
9187,spend more and go with a clear version,1
9188,this is no different than the ones i tried to replace but they won't stick well at all after being washed,1
9189,have a school event that lasts all day and doesn't get hung up 99 % of the time,1
9190,i also can't return it because it was only glued together,1
9191,as always my apple cord shorted out and i was in need of a car charger because my phone dies really fast,1
9192,got a better clear case from i-blason but i am sticking with amazon prime on everything from now on,1
9193,and the first use the person on the phone with att support i surrender,1
9194,the screen protectors that i received were too big for the galaxy note 3 but was described as being compatible with this phone,1
9195,the fact i only paid a dollar and some change you get what you pay for,1
9196,i bought this and it never charged my phone for more than 10 seconds,1
9197,called zagg and they are sending replacement but require a charge card to get a free warranty replacement,1
9198,this cord did not charge my phone barely and on top of that sellphonestop keeps sending emails to remove my review,1
9199,good reason to buy a case that comes directly from china,1
9200,i mean its not even really attached to the case so after looking at the shipping and handling charges,1
9201,i was very disappointed that it would not work i tried the suggestions from other buyers too nothing,1
9202,they are pretty cords and i really like the anker 2-usb high output charger,1
9203,then the four claws that grab the corners of the phone is not protected whats so ever,1
9204,but it was a long time for the battery to deplete,1
9205,if you look closely you will see the feedback on the screens also,1
9206,this cover is not big enough at the top and is held securely by the frame,1
9207,i'm anal about bubbles under the screen so i threw this away after first use definitely avoid this one,1
9208,it's not leather it doesn't say is that this is a five star product,1
9209,after we suspected a family member of drinking some of the solution that comes with them to clean the screen before you put them on,1
9210,they are the worst screen protectors probably available,1
9211,they don't fit well and just won't work with cases but that's not enough i want my phone protected,1
9212,it did have a long time for the battery to deplete,1
9213,i don't lesson to music load at all and the material itself gets dirty and does not wipe off easily,1
9214,very very disappointed that i wasted my money the next time i headed over near the sprint store,1
9215,it does it's job in terms of protection and doesn't wear well,1
9216,it was a waste of money i will not purchase anything else from them,1
9217,samsung galaxys ii sprint epic 4 g touch phone cover to start with,1
9218,i returned it to amazon and ordered another one from another place and i still havent gotten a good screen,1
9219,worked for 4 weeks but one day all of a sudden the tip falls off and something rattles inside all but the blue one,1
9220,broke the first time i've seen this kind of thing should not happen on amazon,1
9221,it goes on easy enough but there are too many imperfections and makes the screen more difficult to read for the person using the iphone,1
9222,the feeling is absolutely terrible it's almost like you're in a tunnel or something,1
9223,you can charge both the battery and the battery icon on the screen turns from white to green,1
9224,the phone was made to be the smallest piece of junk i ever bought in every way,1
9225,i went back and looked and it doesn't feel like a very protective case,1
9226,i had but one day remaining to be able to do multiple things with one tap,1
9227,like the top edges that should go up over the edge of the phone or maybe the particular charger i was using,1
9228,i'm sure my experience is a bit of a quality discrepency between the two virtually identical items,1
9229,it may be cheap and uses micro usb but it wont charge properly and the tip of the iceberg,1
9230,all the pics posted match what went wrong with my case because i had the exact same issues,1
9231,these head phones do not stay in my ear so that i don't think that will consume much power,1
9232,it isn't worth my time or energy,1
9233,an awesome phone with a bad carrier will give you a refund because they know they are selling counterfeit batteries,1
9234,there are better cases out there for a lot less to keep both hands warm,1
9235,you should spend the extra money and get something that is going to last,1
9236,it bends and is so weak that it won't work in the software update menu,1
9237,this item was horrible i had to go out and buy another brand,1
9238,i specifically asked for the iphone 4 cable and i received the case it stated on the package case for iphone,1
9239,worked fine for a week then stopped working,1
9240,i took it to the pool and the water get in the case and the phone in one fell swoop,1
9241,luckily i had ordered tech armor apple new iphone 5 high definition hd clear screen protectors with lifetime replacement warranty 3-pack retail packaging,1
9242,i explained that i have 3 computers at my desk with the laptop on the other,1
9243,i like the fact i had to take them off or too delicate for it to come in the mail and i am disappointed,1
9244,but since the sd cards are different it makes it difficult to slide across for writing and if you don't use it for exercise,1
9245,unless you want to pay a lot for a good reason cause it beyond cheap,1
9246,it does not exactly fit the evo it took a lot longer to get the phone in the pink case that fits vs,1
9247,this crummy thing broke the first 5 mins i had it and i had to give the headset to my father,1
9248,i would suggest pending a few more dollars on something that actually works,1
9249,however if morning shows the day then it doesn't work at all i tried it the first day i used them then stopped working,1
9250,anyway i know they were looking to make it thin but it's hard plastic and very thin,1
9251,and for that reason alone i threw it away what a waste of 11,1
9252,you can find my glowing review of that case if you want to use them for anything other than light drawing,1
9253,you'll need to buy another one and it doesn't work,1
9254,the volume is way too lowthe comfort is good but for the price i figured i couldn't go wrong,1
9255,if i don't get it for about 8 weeks after ordering and ended up getting ours a day or two,1
9256,if you do not have extra parts available you will be without a phone while i am asleep here time difference,1
9257,the case is suppose to protect my phone either,1
9258,seller then wouldn't take the product back and offer me a credit,1
9259,at any rate i'm disappointed how they need to be to make contact with the screen,1
9260,i wouldnt give this any stars if i had the windows down it would be impossible to hear,1
9261,the snaps on the front part broke with in the first two units the bottom right of the screen and i have to say,1
9262,for that reason i'm taking it back to the bumper,1
9263,however this unbranded version does not work at all and should remove the wording on the title as premium,1
9264,these screen protectors are of cheap quality i had to use scissors to trim them down right,1
9265,a complete waste of money designed to last just long enough that you can't plug anything into your phone with this case on,1
9266,and only one part had sticky stuff on it so no way to attach to phone and have room to reach keypad,1
9267,unable to return the case the same day i place it on my phone unless all my other cases break or something,1
9268,do not buy this case unless you only want to hold cards,1
9269,the case is hudge but thats not what the charger is for,1
9270,i took it out it was sticky and didn't do much,1
9271,now struggling to get a refund since it hasn't i feel compelled to discuss it here,1
9272,and if i placed the phone on my wife's galaxy s2 same result,1
9273,i was so displeased that i have never dropped this thing or thrown it down onto a table,1
9274,of course the deadline for returning it for replacement is not an option,1
9275,also the charger takes 8 hours to fully charge a 5000mah backup battery once a day,1
9276,i bought two of them and don't need to buy a sketchy cut-up sim card,1
9277,once it was here i tried to put them back together,1
9278,buy the aduro case adn i guarantee you will enjoy your electronic device much more,1
9279,the case came pretty fast in the mail however they still charged me for the old one,1
9280,i was upset that when i received it i couldn't track it down,1
9281,i've tried just about every other option,1
9282,i've never had an issue with her screen protectors scratching in the past but i didn't get a good seal around the edges,1
9283,they are going down the tubes and your phone is charging back to life easy,1
9284,it didn't even work when i got them they are regular clear ones,1
9285,i decided to order this charger for my htc my touch 4 g,1
9286,if you want extra screen protection i would recommend using your phone too charge battery's over this charger,1
9287,i ended up tossing it because it was so exciting when we got it,1
9288,i attempted to find a way to try to make it work right,1
9289,this so called privacy screen would not even stay in the case it doesn't so i'm returning the product,1
9290,it worked exactly as planned and charged my iphone 5 very slowly and then i noticed that the phone does not charge,1
9291,6 phone slides out of the case and politely told them that it was not in the package,1
9292,it provided extended life for a few days the kickstand broke,1
9293,i was very disappointed when i got this product to protect my device and it just made the whole tablet experience awkward,1
9294,the response from motorola was we will try to find someone who can use them,1
9295,this is ok if you want something that stands out,1
9296,all too often i don't like to have it though,1
9297,it's pretty but i would never buy this product again,1
9298,the ultra hybrid has a slight dint in the bottom left corner piece of the frame would not snap together,1
9299,hopefully i can still get a refund for this item i would save the money,1
9300,it is way inferior to half-priced spigen slim armor case i think the few extra bucks is worth it,1
9301,btw i'd give this one a pass,1
9302,callers can't understand me when i'm talking on my phone,1
9303,it came in the mail i was pretty happy with it for the price is because its fake garbage,1
9304,this case was not what i spected i just did not succeed in getting this new screen cover on my iphone 5,1
9305,you have to look at your phone as there is clearly something wrong with the samsung hm1800,1
9306,however i have to say this is the most minor of my complaints,1
9307,i did buy another one and it was a beautiful color and it was so disappointing,1
9308,when i received this case and it came off completely within 2 days and got down to 20 % and used all of the features,1
9309,after explaining countless times what had happened they finally decided to send me another one can you send me the right oroduct,1
9310,the battery has samsung branding and says it is a rim blackberry but it will not likely work with the next model,1
9311,i grabbed a towel to see if the product is in the warranty period why won't they fix it,1
9312,don't waste your money on these because if they don't even last 30 minutes,1
9313,back section caved in as soon as i got it and took it to the other colors,1
9314,99 and it works as well as the black area it should have been perfect,1
9315,i have installed i don't know if it's a small splash and does not recur,1
9316,so i ripped it off 10 minutes after the application i now wish i would've reviewed this item before purchase,1
9317,i've had my phone for several months and i wish i could've returned this because it never worked again,1
9318,it started to lift enough on day 3 i had to pull and pull and pull the get the two pieces apart,1
9319,i ordered these to replace the samsung ear buds that came with my cell phone ipad 2 kindle and ipod shuffle,1
9320,this aint the one for my phone,1
9321,i had this product it worked perfectly when he purchased it back in 2008,1
9322,all buttons and ports are easy to open and close,1
9323,i had had the intercept for less than 30 days ago i could only get 3 corners into the case,1
9324,after a full dry i have to restart the phone on a separate charger,1
9325,at first i thought it was great for me the talker but the mic didn't even worked from the very beginning,1
9326,my son drop the phone in the pocket instead,1
9327,the protector doesn't fit to iphone 53,1
9328,hate it because it doesn't charge as quick as the wall charger even when i am navigating with the note 3,1
9329,i would not recommend this case to any one because its a pice ofs do not wast your time or money,1
9330,as soon as i got it i was not too impressed,1
9331,i have had this item for less than six months later just like the first one it's coming apart,1
9332,it was very difficult to put on and off and when i went to purchase these,1
9333,i really regret wasting my money on something that works,1
9334,it will randomly drop if you prop it up with books and duct tape it to the table,1
9335,btw i got the feeling the customer service rep said that was in error,1
9336,cant say more dont know if i can still return them,1
9337,the background noise cancellation was so-so in getting it on my iphone 5 and it is not easy when plugging in,1
9338,this is a poorly designed plastic case with a anchor sticker that has no glitter,1
9339,not a huge deal unless you are in an area that does not operate with the phone,1
9340,quality sound for listening to music or a blue tooth to talk,1
9341,it would not stick even for a second not even if i wiggled it,1
9342,also the are cover the proximity sensor on the iphone 4 and all 3 are horrible,1
9343,i was mislead by the picture and i received it within 3 days of having it,1
9344,because of the inconvenience i will not purchase anything else from them,1
9345,save your time and go order a real samsung battery about 1 3 the life of the standard 2800mah battery,1
9346,by slower i mean a lot of bluetooth headsets prior to owning this one,1
9347,this cable works on all my devices except for the google nexus 4 is a phenomenal phone in every way,1
9348,update there customer service was awesome they sent me a new one but it hasn't arrived yet,1
9349,my husband thought about keeping but he said the same thing but the rest of it works decently,1
9350,i plugged my phone in and it charged it by 3 percent in a hour,1
9351,it came about a week ago let it fully charge and fully die it has the same issues with the air bubbles,1
9352,if i could i would return it but for the low price and i don't think that i will attempt another,1
9353,2 i wanted to be able to access the internet,1
9354,i understand this case is only good for about three insertions before it fails,1
9355,i fell like i should have used my phone without a screen protector unlike the 9,1
9356,the first problem is that no one wants to have to return them and disappoint my thoughtful husband,1
9357,unfortunately this case has already taken a tumble or two and no scratches on the case one on each side,1
9358,i use a speck candyshell case that fits perfectly and a hybrid case that i really like,1
9359,amazon you all should test these products before they are sent out,1
9360,this shorted out pretty quickly so i feel like i should have used my phone without a cover,1
9361,but ill tell you what this case didnt even fit my phone but i received a completely all black silicon case,1
9362,i returned it and replaced it with an lg optimus slider,1
9363,amended i sent samsung a photo of the dropper to the images section,1
9364,this is true even when connected to the phone and could not charge it no mater what i did,1
9365,i had no idea what was wrong and said i would have to pay shipping not worth the trouble i'd send it back,1
9366,i have to return the phone the guy did refund my money to their credit,1
9367,this product was extremely cheap when i ordered it it estimated shipping at about a month insane,1
9368,try tech armor i have never had a problem with the case,1
9369,my spigen 2pc case wouldn't sit right i am returning this it did not fit my phone,1
9370,third protector was dirtier than the first didn't even bother after i had so many problems installing a screen protector,1
9371,the buttons do not even fit on top to well either it rattles i had to use scissors to trim them down right,1
9372,i use it when i go to the gym,1
9373,i will keep searching until i find a better product and pay a little more for a good one,1
9374,ordered several different brands of screen protectors to see the outcome,1
9375,update this stopped working after a month and half ago,1
9376,i am within my 14 days and am going to look for one that cost a bit more,1
9377,and when the first one stopped working i was happy to see that it synced fine and audio came streaming through,1
9378,bought a different one too loose and was really ugly when placed in my phone then proceded to follow instructions after frustrating attempts gave up,1
9379,i'm contacting amazon to see if it wouldve got me by,1
9380,i have obviously only used it in the shower a couple of times,1
9381,i took it to a local cell phone store for a trip using my phone as a daily case,1
9382,i want my money back didn't charge my phone or my sisters even though they were listed as compatible,1
9383,the case only charged once there was a big gap between the two parts which are held by two tiny and wimpy screws,1
9384,it may look like the real thing but when you plug it in the wall it would have to sit on the floor,1
9385,thankfully the phone iself is a gem so i was able to get a hold of amazon to give them back,1
9386,cases should not only protect the phone they should also allow the phone to switch between 2 g 3 g networks,1
9387,a couple problems with this headset when using it with the nexus 4 this product fails,1
9388,therefore the moral of the story is that it would not fit correctly on my phone,1
9389,i can not comment on the quality of the matterials is below standards and it was only after i received the case fairly quickly,1
9390,i then after contacting the seller about the pin i later found out that i could use it as a cloud device,1
9391,so i opened it up and discarded it because there is no pad and the control surface is shared with 4 other buttons,1
9392,i see that the backcover of the phone has smudge marks all over it and it was clearly a used product resealed in the packaging,1
9393,i had the black snap-on case btw and while it can be a little spotty here but h2o wireless worked right away,1
9394,i asked to return for a full refund,1
9395,i was very disappointed that i bought this,1
9396,the reason i am giving 1 star is because there is no menu key,1
9397,its working fine using the audio jack on the phone and hold the phone to your ear,1
9398,it really wasn't what i wanted in the first place,1
9399,the screen protector what seems to happen is that when put on the phone and waited for a long series of photographic exposures,1
9400,several times i tried to cram my iphone 5 into the car port in my car plugged my brand new iphone 5s,1
9401,my wife and i have a protective case for a samsung galaxys iii,1
9402,given that the plastic is so cheap it has this major design flaw,1
9403,this one wouldn't work on my iphone 5 too small,1
9404,so i decided to try it out,1
9405,i wasted two of these before i realized what the problem was and offered to send me a new one,1
9406,the cord didn't last long at all i think it might have been old with a dead battery,1
9407,5 connector does not fit the samsung galaxy 3,1
9408,the case is cheap and my belt clip broke the first time i've ever purchased a screen shield,1
9409,silicone feels cheap after i managed to get it on right,1
9410,this also made me think there was something wrong so i did it several times,1
9411,check the customer images i've uploaded to see what i took it was always upside down,1
9412,when it arrived i decided i don't like the color of the case and my phone's back screen to pieces,1
9413,the reinforced corners look good because you the weak points of the galaxy s3 curve down towards the bezel the edges of the case broke,1
9414,i even had the phone to my shirt pocket so that it would be better to just avoid phones with slide out keyboards,1
9415,the retractable cable that comes with an samsung s3 but this is not one of them worked,1
9416,nope that wasn't at all the case might be sturdy but other than that nice price,1
9417,there is protection for the back and sides after about 4 weeks,1
9418,all the reviews on these things were great so maybe it was just a couple of days and neither of them worked thereafter,1
9419,if you don't have a clue how they can say this is official,1
9420,we ended up getting a portable battery pack power pack or self contained charger,1
9421,im so dissapointed this cable is junk can not believe they sent me a link to a battery listed here for 3,1
9422,the bad news is that it seems to affect primarily the nexus 5 and see how thick 12 mm is,1
9423,this headset does not include an in-ear ear bud for me,1
9424,you'll have to pay more for a higher quality one than to have to replace this case,1
9425,it does not extend beyond the front of the phone is slippery and i almost dropped my phone once,1
9426,i've dealt with hyperion before and let me tell you a little about my cell phone use,1
9427,things are somewhat improved when the case is closed and still extremely difficult to reach the buttons on the phone,1
9428,the new samsung infuse 4 g is a great looking case,1
9429,this cord worked for less than a dollar halfway across the world is a waste of money,1
9430,the top most portion of the phone is flush with the case,1
9431,buyer beware save your money and buy something of far better quality,1
9432,might be good for other people but if you ask me but you get what you pay for,1
9433,i'm glad i did not pay much for it so what do u expect,1
9434,bought this charger for my blackberry tour,1
9435,i bought this case for my nexus 4 from either the 1 or 2 amp port,1
9436,once you put on the hard plastic running through it now,1
9437,also it doesn't charge at all and the color is completely off,1
9438,the usb cords are not compatible with iphone 4s as it claims,1
9439,the phone does rock side to side considerably and i have to hold my hands in order to hear perfectly,1
9440,that has apparently solved because this fits as well as the stock batteries but it obviously only worked once,1
9441,too bad i really needed and wanted to like this item and i probably would have,1
9442,this was supposed to work on my wife's phone,1
9443,mine broke within a week of usage,1
9444,i bought it for the back of my phone case,1
9445,i don't usually use a car charger while this case is definitely slim,1
9446,my disappointments with the samsung galaxys iii,1
9447,buy a reputed brand and make sure you never lose it,1
9448,it was just dead refusing to turn back on charge or do anything for the motorola atrix hd 4 g,1
9449,unfortunately they don't cling to the screen very well and it's very protecting,1
9450,everything else i've tried has rectified it,1
9451,screen is exposed drop it and it's still a pretty good device particularly for the cost,1
9452,the only way to fix the problem well that's what it deserves,1
9453,also my tv isn't a cheap piece of equipment from china,1
9454,the idea behind this case was nice but the charger blew out within a few days,1
9455,touch it with my finger and the screen when i was outside,1
9456,i think they are old used batteries that may have a larger capacity than the stock battery but was seeing marginal gains,1
9457,i purchased this for my note 2 not from this company,1
9458,if you read the reviews on this product,1
9459,2013-05-29 update the seller contacted me and encouraged me to email support which i did,1
9460,i have 14 apps i've downloaded and installed and the phone is not secure and disconnects immediately,1
9461,yes but it's overkill and this is the most minor of my complaints,1
9462,i might have been able to find any cable other than the apple cable,1
9463,i was really disappointed don't order it is a waste of money don't buy it,1
9464,unfortunately the kickstand on the case broke on the first use,1
9465,they then sent me the address to ship it back,1
9466,i placed in my pocket and am hopeful that someone will come out with an updated product for the iphone,1
9467,otterbox does back it up and warranty the product but it's obviously not really from samsung,1
9468,first day i put it on the back and they leave a huge rainbow effect,1
9469,i wouldn't recommend using amazon wireless and this is coming from some1 who's wicked careful with his phone,1
9470,the case is extremely and i mean extremely difficult to get on it is too small to fit i never saw any case this bad,1
9471,i just acquired a galaxy s3 and not on my s4,1
9472,well i really loved this when i received it though it was junk,1
9473,i attach it to a wall charger actually kind of sucks,1
9474,also item i received was not the same level of protection,1
9475,not the point of a case was to help protect the phone,1
9476,it was damaged as soon as i plugged it in that this doesnt work,1
9477,be sure to read other comments what i received was the headset in a recharging box,1
9478,so my samsung note 2 but it didn't turn out,1
9479,so if you are a seasoned citizen be prepared to be frustrated if you buy this case check for these thing,1
9480,i tried and i tried but it would not stay on my phone,1
9481,and even in that case you'll need to know linux to make many changes check certain settings,1
9482,but its not and for the price and isn't even water proof,1
9483,item is wonderful for someone who is between xs-m,1
9484,around the end and the screen protector has kinda a weird surface,1
9485,enjoy the phone for 2 yrs before upgrade it's going to take a chance on purchasing this item again,1
9486,3 times before the external battery was 100 % drained,1
9487,i purchased the poetic piano case for my phone and will not work in any mild noisy environment,1
9488,does not work with my iphone 5 i knew i had to buy something else,1
9489,i needed a 2nd set of headphones for listing to music or a podcast it doesn't,1
9490,5 stars for now and might comeback again in a few days and the belt loops broke a week later,1
9491,the package i received was bent and the screen protectors were far too long for the s3,1
9492,although this product did arrive early at my house it looks very cheap and the plastic clips that holds the phone,1
9493,but because it was hard to get bubbles out and that scratched it,1
9494,the problem is that this screen protector feels on my phone,1
9495,i ordered one because of all the great reviews here,1
9496,i was in the bathroom flushed the toilet and down went the phone of course and trying to mount the cradle in my car,1
9497,the case did ship pretty quickly but it was in a plastic ziplock bag,1
9498,if you see one listed as original spend the extra money get yourself a phone that works,1
9499,also i run a lot and take off this case it will be a waste of money,1
9500,although who would pay more than 90 cents for a piece of plastic like screen scratch covernot highly mirrored as pix,1
9501,either modify your ad or don't sell it at the stores at all if its so great,1
9502,if i held the phone in just the right pressure position and now it doesn't have any sound,1
9503,this product caused problems with my ability to charge my iphone 4s this time and the exact same thing for the new iphone 5,1
9504,if i found a phone with the same capability plus good ecosystem good popular apps are available for it,1
9505,the phone will shut down without warning me from time to time it didn't cut out as much as this one,1
9506,i could have returned it for an exchange but do not know how it happened but this is over all cheap,1
9507,i recently dropped my phone on the second or first floor,1
9508,i am going to look for a mirror screen protector as advertised,1
9509,there is nothing like the cord that came with the phone,1
9510,again very disappointing when the product does not glow in the dark it is very very cheap,1
9511,trying to get motorola to fix it but an hour later the phone was done charging,1
9512,now i have to spend 25 for a new screen protector on my 18 month old immaculate evo,1
9513,well i work from home so i don't blame the seller all that much but the product is not suitable for its advertised purpose,1
9514,i bought this for my son and it did not stick and i would not recommend this product at all,1
9515,i'm sure i put it together on my phone and it gave my screen a rainbow effect,1
9516,i was going to return this because i can't talk to others and hear them at the same time,1
9517,i was so excited that i got the package and one of them was already broken,1
9518,i've had slim fit cases on other phones and get the same coverage,1
9519,to be more exact the rear speaker cover hole is on the wrong side and do not let speakers work or charge phone,1
9520,the colors are not what you'll receive,1
9521,however the plastic case cracked when i removed the zagg the screen was coated with a sticky residue,1
9522,there was also no starter credit as stated in the directions it got very hot,1
9523,i bought it because it was too flimsy,1
9524,phone came on time but as soon as i get another camera,1
9525,this was not a perfect fit at all for the 3 g or 4s iphones,1
9526,hyperion is the only one to fit my battery and it caused my iphone to fall and break,1
9527,i should have done in the first place i am happy with it,1
9528,i have purchased several different styles of cases for my phone from amazon because of the selection and the prices,1
9529,original review this is the best protector i have used on a phone and i am constantly afraid of breaking it with excessive force,1
9530,it came apart when i plugged it in the cable not only worked but it also did not contain the 34 handy carrying case,1
9531,same cables tried worked just fine with other chargers and the note doesn't even recognize that it's been plugged into a charger,1
9532,basically i can not recommend this product because it does not align properly,1
9533,that wasn't my biggest issue the protector won't stay on the scratch easily and are impossible to wipe clean,1
9534,their products have been getting such high ratings with performances like the one i ordered from wireless hub brooklyn ny,1
9535,without it the phone is really loose if you take the case off everything works fine,1
9536,the details like the screws on the rear of the docking unit for travel,1
9537,the blue tab is completely pointless and since i ordered two of these clear cases for my iphone 5,1
9538,the case is so cheap did not like it and so far it seems to,1
9539,the phone works as it should be or didn't notice,1
9540,got it on november 13th and not even 6 months after i bought it,1
9541,the first week i had to look for something to keep my phone one inch away from my pc to use it,1
9542,this case didn't last a year,1
9543,so the phone doesn't even recognize that it's been plugged into a charger,1
9544,very difficult to push power button and volume buttons are to hard to press,1
9545,also the cord is so short that it will not fit it makes a huge difference,1
9546,of the three vm phones i have had the case for less than 4,1
9547,overall i can't really say much about bubbles as i only had it for a couple days and then quit,1
9548,by the way this cradle in not compatible with the ipad or the iphone,1
9549,once you rub your credit card to get bubbles out and showed all fingerprints and i took it off and threw it away,1
9550,the directions are horrible for me it wasn't a rip-off,1
9551,from prior experience with belkin i ordered this charger but it did not charge that device,1
9552,you don't want to take the product back,1
9553,it doesnt fit the screen they are made in china,1
9554,i was soooo excited to get this and it didn't work pretty good while paired with two mobile phones simultaneously,1
9555,i bought 2 of them and they all did the same,1
9556,don't even get what you pay for the plug would not stay in the ears,1
9557,i have a flat piece for my galaxy s3 regardless of access to an outlet,1
9558,i have had my gs4 for a few days and they work perfectly,1
9559,i'm highly dissapointed i wouldn't recommend this case for anyone that is looking for security quaiity or veristility,1
9560,anyone that works on ipods iphones will tell you that you have a limited number of electrical outlets,1
9561,the headset arrived with a broken speaker and i never got the phone as well as displaying the screen perfectly,1
9562,i have ordered this 3 times so far since they really need to educate themselves on this smartphone to be able to service anyone,1
9563,like most screen protectors i've ever had to deal with it while i waited for a second opinion and some help from my husband,1
9564,i also chose this one as it wasn't worth to send back because of the super cheap price,1
9565,it smudges and is difficult to get on,1
9566,i've learned my lesson luckily the vendor gave me a full refund if i sent it back for a replacement,1
9567,i found out the phone will no longer fit any case,1
9568,i should have read the reviews and the product specs i purchased this case for m y daughter and it is poor quality,1
9569,and no doubt i bought a cheap case and i've found this one to be impossible to apply without many bubbles,1
9570,but in reality the lip around the screen so when i put the case on,1
9571,the slot for the camera was off and the opening for the lightning plug isn't big enough,1
9572,how ever i did contact the seller and i said i had ordered a couple of months after i got the x2 for free,1
9573,now i have to buy a new phone,1
9574,i recently purchased several other qi charging mats and all of them work great and they look to be of a good quality,1
9575,there is no doubt in my mind that this product was from china or japan whatever,1
9576,believe me when i tell you to spend a few extra bucks and get the iwalk instead,1
9577,cheap construction but i was expecting that for the price i am not looking for a refund to apply toward the much better anker unit,1
9578,i am not impressed with this case seeing how much you have to pay your own shipping,1
9579,i go through a lot of grief as i was not able to do so,1
9580,right now i use the speakerphone on my iphone and connect it to my htc it kept telling me 34 roku player 34,1
9581,the device has some positive aspects and i don't think it was from shipping,1
9582,there were three screen protectors but there is,1
9583,however this is extremely reflective and makes it impossible to put the mini sim inside,1
9584,or you need to have all tabs working properly the case is not bad just false advertising and misleading product photo,1
9585,i found out the defects of this product before i got it sent it back obviously,1
9586,and it seems cheap compared to the oem charger that came with my samsung galaxy s5 at 5 am,1
9587,since i truly love the other features of the phone i dropped the phone it would fall out,1
9588,have owned this stylus for over a year with no problem,1
9589,i thought it was just my bad luck on this device,1
9590,i was happy with this phone but it's not for the apple iphone 3gs,1
9591,i ordered two because i had a boxweave belt clip on the note 2 and 3 it didn't work,1
9592,because this hybrid thing is not that great and i have an htc phone but this is a lie,1
9593,this case especially the punk model is very disappointing to see this thing that looks like an oil spill all over the screen,1
9594,showed up so i can't rate it,1
9595,well the motorola photon would not charge when placed on the charging pad the green light never comes on,1
9596,ashame really if not for the scratches and i will not stand for having these small raised dots on my screen,1
9597,it is nothing like what i expected and i sent it back,1
9598,it is easier than the dry screen protector because it is very easy to install and had no bubbles at all,1
9599,when you get this case you might want to save your money and continue your search,1
9600,if you disagree i'd like to listen to music or throw them away,1
9601,for me i already have two kindle fire units and i wanted a black one for my fiancee his is still holding on,1
9602,i sent another message to amazon and they are conducting an investigation,1
9603,there is no way to turn off the phone without the black protective piece on it,1
9604,my iphone 4s from another vendor and it was flawless charging the same battery in 3-4 hours and hardly plays 15 minutes,1
9605,i will be hooking it up to the smallest setting and it barely works,1
9606,if not for screen protector it would've been ok,1
9607,at first i thought that chargers don't have to remove it more then a few times the seams will rip,1
9608,i thought it was going to fry my phone so i didn't exactly feel bad about wrecking it just to free my phone,1
9609,that didn't work out for me and my gs3,1
9610,i got this belt clip with my otterbox defender case for my iphone 3 g and the my touch 4 g phone,1
9611,i am very impressed with how well it charges if you never want to use it,1
9612,now that i have received it i see that the description on amazon hides all of this,1
9613,its cheap in quality and doesn't work for walking around or driving or when you just want to use a wireless earbuds,1
9614,they realy don't have a trackball problem and make sure you never lose it,1
9615,if you can tell the difference it's not a real lifeproof case and absolutely love it,1
9616,the case doesn't fit my samsung galaxy s2 and re-verifying,1
9617,you can go to a t-mobile family plan it was time to recharge the backup charger,1
9618,i would not recommend purchasing this item unless you're looking for a cheap case this ain't it,1
9619,screen brightness always left on 28 % on one of the photos was not included with any of my laptops,1
9620,going into bluetooth setting on the phone i wouldn't be able to fix it,1
9621,the back is perfectly lined up with the camera and the speaker were perfectly aligned,1
9622,i don't like it at all and within a couple of mintues you can see the thread here with the actual sellers shady responses,1
9623,i know its not expensive at all but i guess you get what you pay for,1
9624,i needed to get some protection on my s3 so i tried to take off this cover and it was so disappointing,1
9625,the outside is well constructed steady but i didn't try to fake those,1
9626,if you're looking for a good phone to go along with it i was very pleased as my spigen hybrid case still fit perfectly,1
9627,granted i did not spend much on this case but the ears have a tiny plastic pegs the help it stay up,1
9628,the android upgrade and the faster phone meant that it was a good idea i suppose but it is almost like a time sync issue,1
9629,i managed to get it out i don't use my phone constantly like some people,1
9630,if you look at the amazon warehouse they have a lot of the 5 star reviews are fake,1
9631,the case also is very snug and is making the glue tear apart at the seams after less than 2 days of use,1
9632,i thought it was a good headset but this kind of thing should not happen on amazon,1
9633,i went to a sprint store and they couldn't apply it either,1
9634,this did not work for my application,1
9635,box was in great condition but it did not and in the end this lead to the unraveling of the stripping,1
9636,i contacted bestmatch for a refund since i didn't want to spend a lot of money for this,1
9637,this case is very lightweight and truly not worth the money this should not happen to those products,1
9638,i recently wanted to have an extra cable and i bought this product i thought its very affordable when it arrived at my house broken,1
9639,the chains keep breaking hanging off the side of the phone to push up against the screen directly,1
9640,amazon you all should test these products before they are sent out,1
9641,even though i followed the directions to a t and used the supplied cloth,1
9642,it is a silicone case so eventually it is not going to cut it with two complete failures,1
9643,the phone interface is different which is fine but the interface makes it almost impossible to use,1
9644,if you want extra screen protection i would recommend using your phone too charge battery's over this charger,1
9645,this was a total waste it will not fit my phone for the very first time since i set it up,1
9646,this cover would not stay on my waist,1
9647,but it does work as a 3 0 usb device with the original cable comes with the phone,1
9648,now i'll have to buy a new sim slot and tray,1
9649,i am not sure if these are and oem product they seem very cheaply put together and the top of the phone,1
9650,i already used ibolt with my old galaxy s3 and i have been waiting for over a week,1
9651,i thought these would be better and wouldn't have to use this just to hold it in place,1
9652,xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx x x x x,1
9653,note the connector did fit into the iphone if it has a case on and made with very thin leather material,1
9654,unfortunately the reason verizon sold out so quickly didn't get any scratch at all and no issue using the stylus,1
9655,the device was paired with my iphone and ipad neither worked,1
9656,it does not extend beyond the front of the bear and the brown isn't very dark,1
9657,for their part samsung did a poor job when they did not bother to check what versions it fits or which doesn't,1
9658,i have a hard time dragging icons from one screen to another it because a little difficult,1
9659,i then repurchased it again because i really wanted the purple to match my tablet cover,1
9660,its just a piece of hard plastic case is the worst case ive ever tested,1
9661,but it was a bad product and they did not even have any dialog with me before doing so,1
9662,i never got the chance to use it while it's in the mood,1
9663,like others i was excited to get them then i tried to charged and oh surpirse it didn't,1
9664,complete junk and was not worth sending back wont buy again,1
9665,the product is not a good product at all,1
9666,after taking insert out it did not charge more than one line,1
9667,if you actually intend to listen to the music on your phone,1
9668,this cable did not last very long on a charge,1
9669,i purchased the poetic piano case for my phone but it was cool though,1
9670,impossible to get out when the case is on you ca nt,1
9671,sadly i wad unable to use the case but now i'm going to return it,1
9672,on the 510 each has a different slope making it easy to shut off when you leave the car,1
9673,for data i keep get reconnects all the time to the point it no longer holds the phone in the case,1
9674,i guess they don't want to go through,1
9675,it arrived on time that's about the only thing that seems to be the only choice available,1
9676,so they received the phone and held onto it for about 2 hours my ears were killing me they were very uncomfortable,1
9677,i've purchesed the s9 from volume cellular and received the item as ordered and it never worked,1
9678,turns out that bluetooth issues with this phone i have tried,1
9679,a stain on motorola and android both of which are larger than the razr units,1
9680,when trying to create the great call account after 3 attempts,1
9681,crinkled the first time i removed the case again and tried squeezing it,1
9682,i thought after i read the reviews however it does not work at all,1
9683,is just not what i expected i just didn't like it removed it with in the first two months,1
9684,if this one doesn't even fit on my droid x,1
9685,i buy this kind of things make sure you look at the front of your phone,1
9686,not good for my galaxy note 3 at all,1
9687,this is a big let down being that i needed a battery and this did not work with my galaxy s3 as advertized,1
9688,my unit did not charge past 86 % and keeps getting lower,1
9689,everything i have purchased for other phones and didn't experience what i did,1
9690,i emailed lenmar to request their opinion and not surprisingly didn't get a good enough grip to slide this case off,1
9691,i received these headphones in 3 weeks i used it for less than a hundred dollars,1
9692,i still can't understand why this has such good ratings,1
9693,got this case for a verizon iphone 4 perfect condition never drop it,1
9694,meaning that you have to have this cutout,1
9695,we'll see how well they work considering i bought this for my dad and his phone,1
9696,the backside of the cradle so it is in the trash where it belongs when my other case arrives,1
9697,obviously not otterbox granted it was only a jelly to cover the phone,1
9698,update i've lowered this to one star because the screen protector is very cheap,1
9699,the longest it stayed on my phone and then stopped working burning smell,1
9700,also they are thick so you can see at a glance that 1,1
9701,i was so happy when i got it installed it didn't seem right,1
9702,the others can be clipped places worn on wrist etc because it's not working anymore so don't buy this cord,1
9703,they don't fit the samsung galaxy sii and is not worth buying at any price for several reasons,1
9704,what you get is a cheap piece of equipment from china,1
9705,this product overheats when charging more than one device all devices do not charge,1
9706,but used it one day and it doesn't work,1
9707,my other issue is i wanted to return it and instead i ordered a motorola razr maxx,1
9708,i am still using my old motorola headphones,1
9709,this lead to a bit of embarrassment as i found out after using this for a while it is still garbage,1
9710,i would not put my iphone in my pocket and i don't really hate it,1
9711,at that price it is a good case for the money,1
9712,just a sticker attached to the actual screen protector which you have to buy it but if don't please don't,1
9713,this means that if you press just a little bit more money making this case a complete waste of money,1
9714,i purchased this for my note 2 not from this company,1
9715,like one reviewer said not much better than the stock battery but i am able to request a return label authorization,1
9716,made to look good but its a nightmare to get on and off got the black one instead,1
9717,i will be hooking it up to a lesson learned,1
9718,the film is so thin that it virtually hangs off the phone without putting a dent in your fingertip,1
9719,i was afraid that it was going to damage my phone,1
9720,i wasn't able to notice the problem until it was too late to do anything about it,1
9721,i got this and like a week later one of the ears started losing sound and it now has weak audio,1
9722,its cheaply made definitely not real leather and i am very disappointed with the material and product style,1
9723,the chargers don't work and that was the reason why i gave it 1 star because i never got it,1
9724,if the phone isn't upright and once it's on your phone it is so rubbery it stretches out of shape,1
9725,connect the charger that came with the galaxy siv,1
9726,they both broke after using only a couple of weeks ago and both that i purchased are broken,1
9727,within 2 days of use the white finish started to wear off and look very scruffy,1
9728,the box doesn't have the ears as in the photo and i've asked for a full refund,1
9729,i was so displeased that i have never used it once because i was afraid of scratching it,1
9730,it's just plain mediocre which it should not be folded and now i cant trust buying something like this from here,1
9731,it will detract from the quality of the pics by applying this screen protector,1
9732,unfortunately the product i received was not as pictured,1
9733,my wife is on her 4th one of these phones do not waste money on that pos,1
9734,the wires pulled out of the base which could have caused some connection issues so i'm not stuck with thee,1
9735,there are big cutouts on the side top and bottom so when i plug in the power cord the fingers block both speakers,1
9736,don't buy from here i wish i can post the picture of burnt cable here,1
9737,i lived in a 4 g coverage area,1
9738,not sure what happened when i received this piece of garbage now,1
9739,i have a bedside dock for my alarm and i have a samsung s4 and have used this product for 3-3,1
9740,but instead they sent me what looked like a new phone but the friend needed it asap or i would have not wasted my time,1
9741,cheapy looking i won't buy them again especially if you need a reliable charger do not purchase this you will be disappointed,1
9742,i tried it on for 15 seconds then took it off and my 4 g popped back up,1
9743,i can't recommend them to my enemy,1
9744,and the only way to fix the problem but you can be sure i won't be able to charge my phone,1
9745,not only that it was difficult to snap on and it didn't fit my phone,1
9746,it says it is made for my phone but it would never charge seems to be a knock off,1
9747,i bought these to charge my nexus 4 from digital media source,1
9748,while i loved my first gen jawbone when it broke and i through this case away and bought an android,1
9749,most other devices will assume usb data connection and will not charge on any charger or cable that is not authentic samsung,1
9750,that's been my experience with belkin products,1
9751,i hardly even used the volume buttons since controlling the volume with my phone is 79h00095-01 m and is ul approved,1
9752,the battery option didn't work at all we tried all of the ports still didn't recognize my phone,1
9753,will try another brand to see if it was one of the cases from their american supplies,1
9754,this is the 3rd generation of this plantronics headset that i've ever bought for my daughter,1
9755,so i am way past the 30 days they didn't work on my tablet either,1
9756,i did not receive the black heavy duty canvas pouch but i didn't have any sticky left on it,1
9757,very smooth and sense of security because of the thickness of the material being used would surely cause rips on a replacement,1
9758,nope these might fit my pebble but i'm not going to work for 7 weeks then you should get a better brand,1
9759,flimsy and it did not fit at all,1
9760,the phone does not charge with it on,1
9761,i would not buy again and do not recommend others buying this item except directly from apple,1
9762,no matter how hard we tried they just would not go in more than 1 3rd,1
9763,i use headphones primarily for running and i've always been leery of chargers that come this way,1
9764,i have returned the case to this company and received a refund with no hassles minus the shipping cost to return it,1
9765,very disappointing since i was really looking forward to getting and it shows sent and lost in transit,1
9766,was looking for cell phone face protectors but i should have known when i saw how flexible the skin was prior to application,1
9767,it's normally hooked up so it had to be a short where the plug flips up and down on the zaggsparq2,1
9768,6-20-13 update i have had nothing but problems with it because it calls 911 all the time,1
9769,even if it breaks at least it was less than 5,1
9770,yes i am young and i would like to hand it to the advertising people,1
9771,i'm sure that some people like that but i like when the phone is in my pocket it does not work clearly,1
9772,i believe i paid a dollar for two of them so i didn't try the other ones to see how well it charges,1
9773,nothing that a little glue couldn't fix but it's not awful considering the previously mentioned benefit hiding just below it,1
9774,i couldn't see my screen in the sun only good as a last resort spare for emergencies,1
9775,i was extremely careful with this charger and even tried with a different charger black ac adapter with samsung printed on it,1
9776,i didn't really like it at all,1
9777,first off they're shorter than the cable that came with my iphone 5s phone said incompatible accessory,1
9778,it has beent he best one but when i contacted the vendor severals times for a refund never received it,1
9779,charger takes too long to dial a phone number press 1 for letters a b or c,1
9780,also my tv isn't a cheap piece of crap will fall off it's so cheap i don't mind,1
9781,this unit is supposed to charge a phone they need 5v i'm an electrical engineer,1
9782,also the dialing buttons are very small vertically yet at least 1 3 of the battery in about 2 hours with almost no use,1
9783,it worked for about a week every day,1
9784,i haven't had it a week and it charges fine,1
9785,still couldn't get the cutout portion that goes over the home button and speaker area,1
9786,there were always technical issues with it it seems to be in the field with no power,1
9787,i believe that falls under the heading of you get what you pay for,1
9788,so in principle i am very upset with this trying to find something out now,1
9789,although its a very nice case if you like the thin snap on cases i would go with a ballistic hardcore series case,1
9790,i gave up putting it on since it did not come with power cord,1
9791,even worse this plug felt hot so needless to say i am not happy and no longer have an operational device,1
9792,the power light turns on green for less than a week very poor quility and a total waste of money,1
9793,it's loose and you can actually move the phone up and have it go to sleep over and over,1
9794,in fact it meets my expectations for the following reasons 1,1
9795,this armband case is too small for the phone,1
9796,i tried it on my phone i could barely hear them,1
9797,he was suppose to use it on my bike but unfortunately it isn't when using a samsung case,1
9798,this product is a buyer beware or buy at your own risk its cheap but your smart phone is not,1
9799,i believe this product would have worked well for me because i don't like about the case,1
9800,this was a third the cost of the case and it kept popping out,1
9801,i tried to pair it to my galaxy 3 and it was not any easier than the ac cord,1
9802,i love the design of the charger is terrible it is honestly completely unsafe,1
9803,i should have known what i was going to use it as it didn't work anymore,1
9804,on top of that the little piece that you talk into broke off,1
9805,after owning this case for a dual-usb it is nice,1
9806,note when i tried to clean it with the cloth that came with it stopped working within 2 weeks of light use,1
9807,it holds on the dashboard beautifully whereas this one does not do anything when connected to a plug sure it worked nicely enough,1
9808,i'm glad i didn't pay much for it so it didn't actually protect our investment,1
9809,the apple logo on the back is so thin it felt like a piece of paper god knows why,1
9810,i tried returning it but its been a week and so far so good,1
9811,your simple mobile data service is at risk of being splashed or rained upon,1
9812,the hard plastic case is the worst case i have ever bought,1
9813,also i did not think this was a reliable phone,1
9814,i would not buy this if you are planning to purchase from best buy,1
9815,if you try to use it i have to go about finding it again and returning it back to amazon,1
9816,so now i'm on the go a bit of a phone and accessory junkie,1
9817,pulling apart after two weeks of careful use as shown in the picture but thats all im very dissapointed,1
9818,so i couldn't tell you how many times i was told to return it for a refund within a week,1
9819,each battery was made by a different company and the cable work a few days and i will be sol then,1
9820,still looking for a case that actually works,1
9821,this is how to fix it my money,1
9822,i dont like this i know it wasnt gon na be that nice for the price,1
9823,my wife used this for a few days the speck logo on the back of the phone not the operating system software of the phone,1
9824,these screen protectors are of cheap quality i had to use my fingernails to dig my phone out,1
9825,i have had tried screen protector on my phone since a couple days after i got it,1
9826,i thought this was so pretty when i got it it looks cheap and childish,1
9827,well it never came and i gave it to my son for christmas because he's always borrowing chargers from other family members,1
9828,i really regert purchasing this product and i would like to return it but there is clearly a problem with the case,1
9829,if you have ever owned one of those old brick phones than this piece of junk just fell apart,1
9830,at first i thought maybe this is a new design and is correct for the inspire 4 g,1
9831,you have to glue to the back of iphone looks nasty,1
9832,this one was shipped quickly but i was able to return for a refund but it wasn't,1
9833,tried cleaning and it will not stay connected,1
9834,will not buy again this case was so cheap and i knew i was in trouble when no lights went on,1
9835,better look for a better one don't waste your time and money,1
9836,mine peel off and no matter what i tried it sounded like i was under water the sound was so muffled,1
9837,dont waste your money unless you re looking for a simple case to protect your iphone 5,1
9838,this cord shorted out in less than a month and already it is useless,1
9839,i was really looking forward to receiving it and i went to go get two double a batteries when i put them on,1
9840,there are some aspects that i did not receive the front screen protectors and only got the backs,1
9841,it works to charge my iphone with it,1
9842,can not charge phone off it while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage,1
9843,first of all the cord is so short that it can not fit comfortably in your ear,1
9844,tried with an otterbox protection case on when it wouldn't sync to my axim x50v,1
9845,as it comes it can be used to scroll up and down lists but when you try to touch the screen,1
9846,and it keep falling off the stand in the few months between then and now this phone has taken a disastrous nosedive,1
9847,however if you need a case that you can get iphone 4 and 4s,1
9848,it is not worth the effort or money to return it to the seller with no problems for complete refund,1
9849,amazonbasics silicone case and screen protectors for at t and it's just overall cheap,1
9850,the phone arrived with 2 seals on the box were cut and the speaker did not really line up symmetrically with the speaker,1
9851,my husband no wimp is he couldn't get it to set up with my pc nor with my droid,1
9852,one for myself and one for my daughter for christmas and it has already cracked at a weak point along the top,1
9853,i ordered ismooth after seeing and reading a large number of cell phone owners that will explain why you're wrong,1
9854,they are cut horribly and don't fit right in the ear,1
9855,the back wire is longer then the one on the droid for use in the car as it would drain fast,1
9856,i cant say it works because i tryit for a long time breaking a nail and attempting a million different ways,1
9857,this was a little disheartening as these were a gift for my dad who has a long commute,1
9858,anything else will not work since they do not have the activation button on the outside surface,1
9859,plus after the excitement of having a hands-free headset and the microphone stopped working after one week of usage,1
9860,i plop the phone on it will just sag down even though i haven't even got it,1
9861,it did work well as far as the company i approve,1
9862,zagg is the only way to go if you're going to get cheap case quality,1
9863,power support is by far the worst item from intocircuit,1
9864,i've had this case and the price even more,1
9865,don't know what i was shipped but it wasn't even that long of a cord,1
9866,i was hoping this could charge my phone but it failed to do its purpose both of them and nothing worked,1
9867,there are cut out holes for the camera and the speaker were perfectly aligned,1
9868,she can not hardly use the phone because of the rating on cnet don't do it,1
9869,the tools however are nice for the price execpt a piece of cheap plastic,1
9870,i am past my refund period or else i would have probably gotten stuck with sub-standard merchandise,1
9871,the case interfered when i tried to take off this cover and it broke after 3 days,1
9872,cheap yes but still robbery even at that price believe it or not you can't take photos from across the room,1
9873,i purchased this cover twice because i really liked having a different color charger,1
9874,i'm usually really good at putting screen protectors on since i had a palm pilot 10 years ago,1
9875,after seeing the somewhat flimsy build and construction i wouldn't really recommend or buy it again,1
9876,you end up with short battery life and this was the first product to pop up had decent reviews and was cheap,1
9877,the frosting that i was looking for something that will get to you fast don't buy this product,1
9878,i wish i could give it zero stars i would have,1
9879,it too almost 2 months for this product and thank god didn't ask me to ship it back,1
9880,i recently purchased several other qi charging mats and all of them do not be fooled it is not a user error,1
9881,the screen stopped working a few weeks after getting the item the on off button maybe 8 times when it broke,1
9882,it's very cheaply made which is why it only gets three stars,1
9883,2 the film is slightly too big for the product with a good rating,1
9884,it does not work for me because i don't like that because it make me feel like my phone was barely protected,1
9885,this is a horrible product that does not last a full day,1
9886,it took me a minute to figure out how to unmute it but have never been able to,1
9887,can not write anything on the sound since i was not able to charge my galaxy phone with this item,1
9888,it is a very cute case but poor quality,1
9889,second the pen itself withdrew into the casing and there is no way i can recommend it to anyone,1
9890,the pattern is missing around the corners and edges of the phone,1
9891,if you use the optional foam cover it fits better but i haven't isolated if that is the case at all,1
9892,second the case does not go over the screen edges enough to protect the screen of a htc one x phone,1
9893,was expecting the item to be in silver because that's what the product really was i wouldn't have ordered it,1
9894,the armor suit is what you want if you like ear buds like myself,1
9895,the earphones were bent at a weird angle and will not charge on it,1
9896,so disappointed i want to use this thing,1
9897,we can't even get it on without lint or any bubbles does not work with the ipad 3,1
9898,however this is too loose on my phone and they both perform the same terribly,1
9899,maybe that has something to do that it's just a normal charger,1
9900,they would send me another case i wasn't about to take my chances with my other case because this one is going back,1
9901,with the large sized earbuds installed you can get a genuine product not some fake chinese copy,1
9902,it just doesn't work with my samsung galaxy s3 slower than the motorola charger i have,1
9903,in each case the difference between the two software versions,1
9904,from the product description i still couldn't see my screen,1
9905,i agree with other reviews that the design on the back is a cheap plastic product and is brittle and will break,1
9906,only one of them actually holds the 5 c and it does not fit the blackberry it says it fits,1
9907,i will go back to the original battery,1
9908,texting you can not text to the us phone number it's a landline,1
9909,sadly it turned out a waste of money and material to make thisgarbage garbage garbage,1
9910,i loved it took great care of it but it appears that it could have been a mistake in the mass production,1
9911,you'll just end up with a dent in the screen protector,1
9912,with this stated you would like you would get at a kiosk at the county fair,1
9913,once that's on your supposed to be able to use the volume and power buttons,1
9914,if you read all of the instructions provided and none of them stay in my ear,1
9915,i can hear the sounds when the phone is in the case it really is a terrible product please do not buy it,1
9916,you will pay so much for your iphone and when you put this battery is the screen flickers and freezes,1
9917,once i put the matte cover on the clarity of the hx550 is excellent whether on the road or in the office,1
9918,i had to try 3 of them before i could get one on right,1
9919,was a great idea but the cams open to far and you can not get rid of the dust particles beneath protector,1
9920,i had to reboot my note 2 by removing the battery i waited 2 mins and put the battery in and tried charging it,1
9921,ended up tearing it off and throwing it in the trash,1
9922,i can't even answer a call or trying to get to a particular desktop easily besides using both hands and swiping,1
9923,the mute button is halfway covered on my verizon iphone for the 200-300 the unit cost me,1
9924,i read some bad reviews but i am very disappointed and very mad that my money is wasted,1
9925,the bow immediately came off on my first day of use on my bose sou dock hooked up great but,1
9926,i was looking for something that allows you to use existing headphones semi-wirelessly,1
9927,after hearing back from skinomi they pointed out the disclaimer on the product description that it is a much better case,1
9928,lights up but does not work with verizon,1
9929,i figured it was cheap enough that i didn't receive this one,1
9930,i contacted the seller and advised of the situation the seller was very good in handling the this without charging me for return shipping,1
9931,now the title of my review doesn't pertain to the quality of the frame was not made as well,1
9932,it broke the first day i got it waste of money,1
9933,arrived today and the frustration free packaging box appeared intact but there was a speck of dust or an air bubble under it,1
9934,bad first the unit feels like it will fall off as it does when my phone is in my pocket or in my purse,1
9935,did not fir my phone and i eneded up scratching it,1
9936,i will never recommend to buy this product and i would not recommend this phone,1
9937,0 data sync connect transfer charge cable is poor quality and does not fit well to small around the corners and edges of the phone,1
9938,looks cute but won't last a week combined they took forever to come,1
9939,i tried it twice put my iphone on it and shake it and the phone does not fitin the case completely,1
9940,i mistakenly bought this thinking it would be a good idea for my galaxy note 3 at all,1
9941,but wait there are more to buy but wait why would you want this one that is weird,1
9942,would not recommend even if you are driving it it the worse,1
9943,you have to wipe the screen apply the solution to the shield put it on the phone,1
9944,to be honest it was sort of 34 loose 34,1
9945,do not buy if you care about this is not a noise canceling headset which i knew before i bought it,1
9946,i suspect it may have been just a bad unit but my review stands on the product i received the second time looked identical,1
9947,but because it is not worth your money,1
9948,had this product for only a week now and am not very pleased with its performance,1
9949,would not recommend it to anyone who is fond of their phone,1
9950,it's cheap alright and not worth the money at all,1
9951,this seems like the only viable option so i gave it 1 star and it doesn't work,1
9952,i did not bother to send it back than it is worth,1
9953,was not happy bc at the time i opened the package,1
9954,for those who did not listened to me you might as well try to use plastic wrap,1
9955,this battery does not have the htc logo and forge the certification agency marks on the enclosure are all forged,1
9956,i had a blackberry tour before this phone and now i have some refurbished one and i am not surprise if it is,1
9957,this case came on time but as soon as you put this screen protector on,1
9958,although the bag it came it says new i am not sure getting a new phone i am trying to return it,1
9959,this lends me to believe that there was any easy way to get my phone out of my pocket,1
9960,i bought this based on all the positive reviews for this case i was so disappointed because i really love this brand,1
9961,at first when i saw the panavise and decided to give this one a pass,1
9962,slacker sounded terrible it seemed to have a very hard time getting it off,1
9963,might be a good replacement battery for my blackberry curve which is no longer holding a charge after less than a month,1
9964,my phone kept falling off the crappy support that comes with it too bad you're stuck with it,1
9965,found that when i ordered this case based off the reviews thinking it would be a clear winner,1
9966,it won't even go in all the way to stop the connector from sliding back,1
9967,would not recommend this to someone i would not buy this item it will last you around 3 weeks,1
9968,it's normally hooked up so it had to be dug out of the lighter,1
9969,it would freeze constantly during the past 2 months forcing me to remove the metal part from my ipod but there was no response,1
9970,right when i put the case on and it was really really hard to see the screen,1
9971,so hopefully until quickpull resolves this you will have to listen to that same song over and over again4,1
9972,mine peel off and no matter what i did it just didn't work,1
9973,i wouldn't suggest ordering this item unless you plan to use your iphone with all kinds of writing including a solicitation for a review,1
9974,how come it clearly states that it comes with one,1
9975,etc so if you don't have an issue with but thats for another review,1
9976,i only gave 1 star because i have only had this phone 2 months to go and it's still a collosal piece of junk,1
9977,the cell phone will not recognize that it is charging the phone,1
9978,it took forever and i would have to pay shipping not worth the trouble when they are so cheap,1
9979,this case is a total waste of my time and money,1
9980,the only reason for the 1 star review is you can see the logo on the phone,1
9981,the only reason for the 1 star review so that other galaxy s3 owners know what they're talking about,1
9982,i have had the note plugged into the six foot cable barely charges the note if you are using it,1
9983,they send you 3 is to keep replacing them because of a design flaw,1
9984,very unhappy with this purchase and i wouldn't recommend buying it,1
9985,i've managed to get it on the phone and you can see the glue marks,1
9986,when it fell from my hand so it dose not live up to the quality of apple or just about any other brand's quality,1
9987,would be perfect if the spot for the camera on the back of the neck and pulling on the ears drives me crazy,1
9988,int he end they basically told me to go to the store and pay for them to do it,1
9989,i ordered the nexuss to give it another shot as the idea was great,1
9990,i would never recommend this product to anyone and i will not buy from this companyno guidecheap toolswrong item,1
9991,would have given 0 stars but that is not the case they sent looks nothing like what i expected and i am highly disappointed,1
9992,at first i thought maybe the app or the s-pen without serious effort,1
9993,it was unbearable and i ended up having to take the protective cover off of my iphone4,1
9994,i've come across a few people with the same case that is shown in the picture,1
9995,this is one of the worst i have ever had so i up graded to the razr v3 late last year 2007,1
9996,no one has stepped on it and i could see it pop up as a bluetooth item on my phone,1
9997,wonky at best i would stay away from this item and possibly the seller,1
9998,i never could get a good fit on the phone and a bunch of bubbles,1
9999,the only way to charge it on the ihome is to remove this case after i saw that is was not what i expected,1
