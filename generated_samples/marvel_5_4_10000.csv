373,i just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
374,it hooks you from beginning to end and robert downey jr was born to play tony stark in this movie was also fun and exhilarating,5
375,of all of the massive financial hits in history the avengers is one of the most electrifying and rocking score i've ever heard,5
376,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power,5
377,the third if it is made is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
378,the female characters in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5

409,the score is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
410,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
411,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book feeling so relieved and excited for the sequel,5
412,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
413,i don't like spiderman but i loved this movie immensely and i can not wait to see the next installment,5

634,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
635,thanos is by far one of the best mcu movies i've ever gotten to see along with guardians of the galaxy vol,5
636,the way he pulled it off and it is spectacular,5
637,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5

640,this movie soooo much fun to watch when i went to see black panter twice,5
641,i made it into a spider-man film to date,5

654,full of heart visual spectacle terrific performances and featuring one of the best marvel movies of all time to date,5
655,mark ruffalo did an amazing job portraying ghost,5

657,i personally liked it better than the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5
658,also is very important to say that this is an important chapter in the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
659,gotg2 was written by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
660,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
661,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite movies of all time,5
662,i enjoyed the first one but this film is the lack of an excellent super villain or a better final showdown,5
663,but that is one of the best in superhero genre,5
664,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
665,tom holland is the best spiderman movie yet,5
666,nobody does it better he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
667,loved the story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of my seat the whole movie and enjoyed it so much,5
668,yondu's character arc is one of the best superhero films of all time,5
669,the sequel to the best film in the marvel franchise loki,5
670,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's as fun as this one who cares,5
671,ties for 1 with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie in history,5
672,oh my goodness this movie was so much better but this is still good,5
673,marvel's the avengers an epic superhero crossover four years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off,5
674,the best superhero movie of all-time,5
675,another thing that makes iron man a great film is an even greater story,5
676,it's the movie that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
677,the score is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
678,lots of laughs lots of the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
679,so overall iron man is a great way to start the mcu in the first place,5
680,all in all i'd say this was even better than guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best,5
681,meanwhile i will already be looking forward to the next one for sure,5
682,i would recommend to this movie to anyone that asked me,5
683,it was as good as the first two,5
684,without a doubt one of the best movies in the mcu,5
685,from the brilliant jacob batalon as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
686,josh brolin did amazing as the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
687,there was more than one occasion where i said to myself i'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that,5
688,i'm so glad thanos was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
689,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of my favourite super hero movies of all time,5
690,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
691,we have a bit of the spotlight,5
692,the villain wasn't overdone there was a ton of great songs from the 70's and 80's,5
693,chris pratt is hilarious as star-lord but its surprising to see how he will end the story in guardians of the galaxy,5
694,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
695,it has some of the best cgi i have seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
696,overall the plot was extremely well done and the story was so moving,5
697,this movie is not unique because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
698,5 to 5 with this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
699,this is my favorite film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
700,and has the hawkeye that was one of the main reasons why i prefer this sequel to the original,5
701,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
702,at first i had no desire to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
703,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
704,it's no understatement that this is the best cross over of super heroes in movie history,5
705,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brand new take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
706,ryan did an excellent job in all aspects,5
707,i love the look and animation of this hulk much better than the first one since the story displayed a little more character development,5
708,so far my favorite mcu movie so far,5
709,one more movie for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy was a huge risk for marvel,5
710,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
711,it was very good maybe even better than the fist guardian's movie,5
712,when differentiating this from the past spider-man movies this is probably the best superhero movie to date,5
713,by far the most fresh funny and amazing spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
714,black panther is a colorful showcase of african culture and design it has created a believable futuristic world,5
715,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy is creative energetic and spacetacular,5
716,i love iron man and his tech dominate spider-man's eventual return,5
717,this film was a masterpiece of action that saw one of the all-time best comic book-inspired stories,5
718,but this one starts you out in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
719,the film that started the marvel cinematic universe,5
720,raimi's spider-man is coming out of marvel and iron man is an excellent example to set up the entire universe,5
721,i enjoyed the first one but still amazing,5
722,the cast was perfect for each of their parts and you will be at the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
723,you see it in the first half hour,5
724,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one,5
725,avengers infinity war is the culmination of everything in this universe for the past ten years in a satisfying way,5
726,is amazing as tony stark in the start of the marvel cinematic universe black panther has proved to be the best yet,5
727,in most cases spider-man 3 x-men the last stand and the amazing spider-man 2,5
728,director joss whedon said that there isn't a single dull part in this movie,5
729,who would have thought you could turn one of marvel's best films they have ever made,5
730,this is probably my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
731,this movie was amazing and one of my new favorite mcu films,5
732,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite movie of 2018,5

735,for me this is an instant classic and is one of the most ambitious movies of all time,5
736,i expected it to be great and man did it have a killer message that the world needs now,5

743,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
744,one of those is heart soul and last but not least adrian toomes aka the vulture is another one of marvel's best,5
745,that means guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best super hero movies of all time,5
746,the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
747,speaking of the hulk this movie is just plain enjoyable,5

753,marvel's the avengers is a brilliant movie,5
754,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu's best film is a thrilling beautiful roller coaster,5

778,grand giant and perfectly connected movie instead of age of ultron is action-packed entertaining and very surprising,5
779,a breath of fresh air to a character that has now become known all over the world,5
780,this will be so fun to see in captain america civil war for my favourite movie of all time,5
781,the best movie i've ever seen next to the dark knight and iron man,5
782,but the movie was so much better than the first one,5
783,good stand alone marvel movie with lots of actions and jokes,5
784,never been done before and turn it into one of the most boring villain i've ever seen,5
785,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5

806,the avengers was so much fun and even better then the first by far can't wait for avengers 4,5

808,the best most fun anyway movie in the mcu for me has everything you want in a film in general,5
809,great movie and one of the best action sequences ever seen in cinema,5
810,marvel's the avengers builds up its cinematic universe by bringing together some of the best thespians in the business,5

814,don't know how avengers age of ultron is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone,5
815,2 is better and funnier than the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
816,the first ant-man but this movie changed that,5
817,the best mcu film and one of the best superheroe movies ever great acting and great story and will trick your mind,5
818,this is not just a great superhero movie it's a great movie with a awesome story,5
819,i thought her widow character was amazing but i'm definitely gon na re-watch this entire week,5
820,we're the guardians of the galaxy i have zero complaints,5
821,just wait till ant-man and the wasp is amazing,5
822,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5

824,everything i could have hoped for in a comic book movie from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
825,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
826,the avengers is one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie marvel has ever made,5
827,the avengers infinity war is an essential watch,5
828,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
829,all my favourite characters in the movie i thought the iron man and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
830,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
831,it may not be as good as the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
832,what sets this apart most importantly from the previous films and improves on all points from them,5
833,loved the intrigue at the very end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
834,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
835,iron man is definitely one of the best movies that i have ever seen,5
836,another great addition to the marvel movie family,5
837,the latest chapter in the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again,5
838,marvel has knocked it out of the water and it satisfies on every level,5
839,this film is definitely spider-man's high school life,5
840,i honestly thought this movie was great beginning to end,5
841,the characters are good and there is a lot of fun to be had with the friendly neighborhood web-slinger,5
842,when a film that is so much fun and deserved all its success,5
843,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's so much better then the 1st one i think,5
844,it had strong character development he was influenced from the events of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
845,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
846,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is one of the best superhero films of all time,5

852,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
853,i think it is the best movie i've ever seen,5
854,it may not be as good as the first iron man back in 2008,5
855,in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
856,all the past spider-man movies this is probably the best since 2014's transformers age of extinction,5
857,my favourite marvel movie of all time you should watch it,5
858,it's not as wow as the first one but this film is the lack of an excellent super villain or a better final showdown,5
859,at the very end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
860,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and i really enjoyed it,5
861,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for the 2nd one,5
862,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
863,she was the weakest point of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
864,joss whedon did a great job directing iron man and this is what i wanted looking at you last jedi,5
865,black panther is one of the greater superhero movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
866,i don't like spiderman but i loved this movie immensely and i can not wait to see,5
867,movie was shit jk that's why i hated sequels so much,5
868,better than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
869,the actors do a good job with the villain the vulture,5
870,this is by far the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron is here,5
871,this is by far one of the best entries into the marvel universe,5
872,not only the one of the best movie in 2018,5
873,this movie soooo much fun to watch when i went to watch this movie without having watched the first one,5
874,this also happens in the avengers and thor the dark world,5
875,a very fun fresh take on spider-man's true identity combined with a maniacal grin on his face,5
876,was really good loved all the action and explosions have weight to them,5
877,great film looking forward to the next one for sure,5
878,here i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man is a well made comic book movie,5
879,i loved this movie so much the best spider man movie of all time,5
880,with it's independent storyline and laughs ant-man and then we'll really push it in your faces,5
881,this movie is definitely one of the best movies of 2014,5
882,black panther is a colorful showcase of african culture and design it has created a believable futuristic world,5
883,avengers infinity war is my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
884,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe while also being able to stand on its own fine in the marvel cinematic univers,5
885,i'm really looking forward to the next one for sure,5
886,it was a good marvel movie that lets fans of the comics as well,5
887,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5
888,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
889,2 is better and funnier than the first one but still pretty good,5
890,at first they thought it was a little bit of magic,5
891,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
892,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
893,and the comedy and this was a match made in heaven,5
894,the first marvel movie is still one of the best films of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
895,ghost as the antagonist is one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
896,we really enjoy funny and lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
897,4 on my top 10 of the year and is one of marvel's best imo,5
898,this is my favorite mcu movie so far,5
899,cant wait to see it again on the big screen,5
900,this is the best spiderman movie ever made,5
901,without a doubt one of the best mcu movies i've seen in a long time,5
902,this is what we've been waiting to see plus more,5
903,is it as good as something like the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
904,tom holland is excellently cast as our hero and michael keaton as the titular hero and brings a king's gravitas to the role,5
905,iron man is definitely one of my favorites from the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
906,therefore i think that the movie is another belter from marvel,5
907,the best spider i have ever seen love fun action,5
908,if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
909,that is what i wanted the first avengers movie avengers assemble,5
910,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
911,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very good and more entertaining than i thought it was really really good,5
912,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be the quintessential spider-man film and one of the best marvel movies i ever watched,5
913,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
914,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
915,one of the best comic-book movie roles,5
916,the score is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
917,this is easily for me the best marvel movie i've seen twice in theaters,5
918,this was a fun superhero movie should be,5
919,it is funny and there's a lot of action the kind of stuff we do,5
920,music is as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
921,the avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5
922,i don't know how they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5
923,is it as good as the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
924,was it the films building up to this movie for ten years,5
925,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome,5
926,this first film is by far the best superhero movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
927,iron man is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
928,this is not just a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
929,awesome flick i rate it up there with winter soldier as one of my favorite films of the year and one of the best,5
930,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's so much better then the 1st one i think,5
931,thematically it is also the best mcu film and one of the funniest and most lighthearted entries in the entire mcu,5
932,one of the best movies i've ever seen and i feel like he almost ruined the movie because of his personality and power,5
933,gotg2 was written by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
934,he didn't have to be iron man,5
935,most of the movie you could tell it was going to be stupid but it actually was a very good film,5
936,one of the greatest super hero movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
937,even though logan is my movie of the year great chemistry and music,5
938,this is a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
939,the avengers is by far the best mcu film by far,5
940,in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy was a huge risk for marvel,5
941,that means guardians of the galaxy is a brilliant movie with an all star cast a spectacular villain and action,5
942,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the funniest marvel films to date,5
943,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5
944,what made guardians of the galaxy to return,5
945,very different for marvel but that's not what they eat,5
946,simply put the kind of movie you can enjoy over and over again for years come,5
947,overall this is probably one of the best superheroe movies ever great acting and great story and will trick your mind,5
948,marvel has its reasons for all of the fans one of the best marvel movies ever made,5
949,avengers past all of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing job at setting the mood right away,5
950,michael doglus as hank pym is like one of the best the mcu has ever seen,5
951,while a film like this has been a long time coming but was worth the wait,5
952,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers and i don't see a nickel,5
953,ant-man is hilarious action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
954,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5
955,aside from avengers 3 this might be the best marvel movie i've seen in a long time,5
956,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
957,the characters are likeable the effects are outstanding the action is so mind-blowing some of the best of any of the mcu films,5
958,iron man is the first movie in the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
959,it's rare sequels are as good as the first one,5
960,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best marvel movie it is also one of the smartest,5
961,all in all people keep saying guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
962,it's not one of my favorite movies of all time,5
963,they were able to separate the black panther from all of the actors but this all couldn't have been done better,5
964,but the real allure of the film is the first half and hour is actually pretty bad,5
965,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but have a smile on your face,5
966,this is one of the greater superhero movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
967,black panther is what i hoped for and i can't get by that face,5
968,definitely one of the if not the best superhero movie i've seen twice in theaters,5
969,not feeding into the hype but it is clearly one of the best marvel movies ever to be created,5
970,also robert downey jr was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
971,but unlike avengers assemble guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i've ever cried to in my life,5
972,the tone of the film at the heart and soul of this trilogy is downey jr,5
973,by far the best marvel movie after avengers,5
974,loved the action and the character interaction the avengers is definitely a movie you have to watch most of the mcu movies,5
975,one of the best new movies i have seen in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy it's still hilarious,5
976,it was the best mcu movie to date,5
977,maybe it was a little bit of magic,5
978,this has to be my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie,5
979,in addition each actor fits their role to a t and you can't help but have empathy for her,5
980,this is the definitive spider-man film by almost every metric of cinema,5
981,the story is one of the best superhero movies ever,5
982,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
983,best marvel movie of all the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
984,the best most fun anyway movie in the mcu for me has everything you want in a film in general,5
985,nobody does it better he is the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
986,the avengers age of ultron easily one of the best marvel movies i ever watched,5
987,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee should be able to fly at all,5
988,marvel cinematic universe has been building up for the past 5 movies,5
989,owns the role of tony stark and jeff bridges is great as the bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
990,by far the start up of the mcu and just as entertaining,5
991,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war is marvel at its finest,5
992,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
993,plus the soundtrack is one of the best films of 2017,5
994,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie is really great and i like it a lot,5
995,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the best comic-book villain of all time,5
996,the cast was perfect for each of their parts and you will be at the edge of your seat,5
997,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
998,i mean it's the best marvel movie ever,5
999,diagnosis dischargedyes the villain is a little weak but that's not what they eat,5
1000,the prologue with was a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
1001,this movie is action packed with a lot of marvel films or know the characters from the comics,5
1002,overall it was a great movie and is the best marvel movie,5
1003,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
1004,ant-man and the wasp is the perfect superhero partner for ant man,5
1005,run don't walk to see this movie again its awesome,5
1006,at the end of the day it's ranked up there with the dark knight for the best super hero movie of all time,5
1007,oh yes phase one of the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5
1008,i loved it and it is quite possibly the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
1009,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
1010,the movie is basically a better version of the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
1011,this movie was the best of marvel and in its genre,5
1012,i'm a big marvel fan and this is one of my top 5 favorite marvel and superhero movies of all time to date,5
1013,i don't know how they pulled it off and it is spectacular,5
1014,there was more than one occasion where i said to myself i'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that,5
1015,at first i worried this film might be the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
1016,there wasn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie and enjoyed it so much,5
1017,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one,5
1018,this is an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite mcu films so far,5
1019,the best marvel movie the one that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
1020,i would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
1021,it was so action packed with so much comedy it's a good heist film which i don't see a nickel,5
1022,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's as fun as this one who cares,5
1023,in addition each actor fits their role to a t and you can't help but have empathy for her,5
1024,this not only has everything you want from a superhero film and a deep one in that,5
1025,amazing movie ant-man and the wasp is a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie fans,5
1026,the film is honestly so much fun and marvel absolutely nailed it,5
1027,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
1028,40 min of the movie is michael b,5
1029,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
1030,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
1031,the fun and adventure and movie production are as good as first movie but this one is amazing,5
1032,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the mcu since the first iron man,5

1041,i loved this movie so much the best spider man film ever made,5
1042,iron man is definitely one of the best movies that i have ever seen,5
1043,the ten rings want tony to build them a diabolical and powerful weapon known as the jerricho missile,5
1044,however there wasn't a single thing i didn't really like was how there was just so much instant death,5
1045,now that deadpool has come out i can say that this is the best spiderman ever,5
1046,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers is the culmination of everything in this universe for the past ten years,5
1047,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain since the joker,5
1048,to be more specific i think this is the best movie i have ever seen,5
1049,thematically it is also the best mcu film hands-down,5
1050,i thought guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy is creative energetic and spacetacular,5
1051,if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5

1061,one of the greatest superhero movies ever and probably the best character in the mcu and this one is the best one ever,5
1062,marvel's the avengers is the best thing ever except the mad titan thanos,5
1063,this is film is an instant classic all the way through only to end with more feels,5
1064,when ant-man is up to while the rest of the cast they all do well,5
1065,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5

1069,plus the soundtrack is one of the best marvel movies i watched ever,5
1070,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't comedic it was emotionally gripping,5
1071,tom holland is my favorite spider-man movie we've all been waiting for,5
1072,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5

1077,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i found even slightly off was the pacing around the middle,5
1078,iron man 3 is a good film in the mcu,5
1079,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
1080,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp there wasn't that much ant-man action,5
1081,one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5

1093,the next installment for ant-man 3 which i'm fairly confident is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
1094,happened if they had the chance if they had the chance if they had the power over themselves,5
1095,coming from a massive spider-man fan they did it right,5
1096,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5

1639,top notch start to the mcu and to the superhero universe,5
1640,highly interesting plot with a great balance of action and comedy that you can not find anywhere else,5
1641,to get to the point this movie is instantly one of the best comedies i've watched in the longest time,5
1642,i it is a great combination of sci-fi demand but the real star of the soundtrack is not as strong as the original,5
1643,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
1644,at the end of the movie is lacking,5
1645,iron man is an excellent start for the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
1646,not only is the ant-man character was done great,5

1653,hulk was amazing in this movie he is so cool,5
1654,but this one starts you out in the middle of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design,5

1661,lastly the post-credits cutscenes sets the massive stage for the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much bigger,5
1662,best marvel movie of all the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
1663,it's not as wow as the first one but this film is the lack of an excellent super villain or a better final showdown,5
1664,was it the films building up to this movie for ten years,5
1665,this is easily the most shocking superhero film ever and also one of the best spider-man movie is the best,5
1666,brolin as thanos delivers one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie overall blew me away,5
1667,this is by far one of the best to watch right now,5
1668,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
1669,it never got boring or anything and when the movie was released the hype was real,5
1670,yondu now has one of the best movies made period,5
1671,this movie is what i would call one of the greatest superhero and comic book films ever made,5
1672,another thing that makes iron man a great film is an even greater story,5
1673,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite movies of all time,5
1674,after years of waiting we have a film that empowers women and africa,5
1675,and i have to say this is my favorite comic book character that i have been waiting years to see,5
1676,that's why he was the perfect villain for this movie,5
1677,aside from avengers 3 this might be the best mcu movie and the 2nd best superhero movie,5
1678,has the thrill of the mcu but it is also so much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the original,5
1679,while ant-man is definitely one of my favourite movies of 2014,5

1688,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone simply because it is an almost flawless movie,5
1689,funny touching and a great edition in the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much bigger,5
1690,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one,5
1691,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
1692,it was so action packed with so much comedy it's a good heist film which i don't see what you're doing,5
1693,this is easily the most shocking superhero film ever and also one of the best wall paced full story comicbook superhero introduction i have seen,5
1694,2 is better and funnier than the first movie highly recommend,5
1695,this movie is action packed with a lot of heart and depth to the whole thing,5
1696,it not only made me cry by it touching my heart,5

1700,can't wait to see it again with my father,5
1701,at first i had no desire to see this movie in theaters because i was a fan of chris pratt after watching parks and rec,5
1702,although if you want to further understand the movie you have to be nitpicking to say something negative about it,5
1703,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
1704,personally i think this was easily one of the most electrifying and rocking score i've ever heard,5
1705,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee should be able to fly at all,5
1706,not one moment of boredom during this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
1707,the humor was very fun to watch and is honestly one of the best mcu movies to date,5
1708,the action all of the action scenes and visual effects were spectacular,5
1709,i expected nothing better than guardians of the galaxy is fun hilarious and exciting,5
1710,next to the first iron man movie was the best of marvel and my favourite movie of all time,5
1711,ant-man is hilarious action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor,5
1712,loved it funny has lots of action in it and it's a must watch it for sure,5
1713,this is by far one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
1714,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
1715,this has to be one of the greatest comic book movies i've ever seen next to the dark knight,5
1716,the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't care what you say this is the greatest movie within the mcu,5
1717,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
1718,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent,5
1719,it just means you know how it's going to be a huge climb,5
1720,still my favorite marvel movie i think it's works fine in a movie,5
1721,makes this marvel movie one of the best visual effect in my opinion the film is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5
1722,there is quite a lot of cgi but it doesn't take away that it is great,5
1723,there's no other word to describe it except that this movie was one of the highlights of the movie,5
1724,reading all the online reviews i guess it's true what can one bee do,5
1725,funny i just can't say anything else just absolutley spectacular,5
1726,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
1727,the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
1728,overall this movie is one of the most ambitious movies of all time,5
1729,funny and almost better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
1730,iron man got it right when it comes to movies the avengers is down as the greatest of all time in my book,5
1731,movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy was one of the best marvel flicks,5
1732,the best most fun anyway movie in the mcu for me has everything you want in a film in general,5
1733,james gunn did what i didn't like in the whole movie,5
1734,iron man is the film that started the marvel universe and is still one of the best character actors around,5
1735,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to be in the tournament of roses that's every florist's dream,5
1736,i love iron man and his tech dominate spider-man's high school life,5
1737,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
1738,you know i could watch this over and over again and would recommend it,5
1739,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers is the culmination of all these marvel stories and it was amazing,5
1740,here he was quite different from the other marvel cinematic universe films in my opinion iron man 3 delivers an action-packed adventure,5
1741,still holds up as one of the if not the best offering from the studio so far,5
1742,oh man this movie is brilliant i thought,5
1743,but this one starts you out in the middle of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design,5
1744,this has to be my favorite marvel movie i think it is the best marvel movie,5
1745,loki our villain from the film returns after the events of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
1746,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5
1747,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers but it was still good,5
1748,as ant-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the cgi is probably the best superhero movie of all time,5
1749,the scene with his mother hits you right in the feels and this movie is very rewarding to you,5
1750,avengers infinity war is nothing short of one of the highest-grossing films of all time,5
1751,at first i thought it was a bogey but they eventually find out it's a man in women's clothes,5
1752,i'm so glad thanos was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
1753,i don't care what you say this is the best in the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5
1754,i'm going to get to the point this movie is instantly one of the best heist movies i have seen,5

1833,they did it first with an unknown property called guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
1834,i personally liked it better than the first addition to the series,5
1835,christine everhart whom he had sex with early on in the film in the way that they did that made it all possible,5

2081,after seeing infinity war ant-man and the wasp was action packed humorous and intriguing to watch,5
2082,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
2083,this addition to the marvel comic book universe so would love to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
2084,all of the actors but this all couldn't have been brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight,5
2085,it is also very dark unpredictable and it has great writing and great action and acting,5

2106,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
2107,it's an amazing must see movie that's better than the first and second films in my opinion,5
2108,overall this movie was portrayed very well with the idea of the movie and leave us wanting more,5
2109,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
2110,i thought this film was going to be an absolute disaster,5
2111,i thought guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and the story is told perfectly,5
2112,great movie and one that set the standards for the rest of the avengers are fighting a war,5
2113,overall as a marvel fan this is my favorite paul rudd movie,5
2114,this is why i believe that the guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
2115,this movie was so much better but this is also good not great good,5
2116,avengers age of ultron easily one of the most daringly bold finales i've ever seen in my life,5
2117,simply one of the best iron man movie of all time,5
2118,if not the best tied for the best with spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
2119,the fun and adventure and movie production are as good as first movie but this one is excellent,5
2120,the first marvel movie is still one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in a long time,5
2121,his boyish good looks have a bit of bad weather in new york,5
2122,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5

2124,this story was a fresh take on the team movie,5
2125,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
2126,best super hero movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
2127,great way to start the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
2128,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
2129,marvel you done it again making a film that isn't even his and make spider-man seem weak dependent,5
2130,overall the plot was extremely well done and the visuals are breathtaking,5
2131,the cast was perfect for each of their parts and you will be at the edge of my seat in joy,5
2132,this is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the rest of the avengers are fighting a war,5
2133,the latest treat entry in the marvel universe pays off and exceeds expectations,5
2134,love it can't wait for guardians of the galaxy was the best film of summer 2014,5
2135,this was a breath of fresh air to a character that has now become known all over the world,5
2136,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
2137,the scenes and actors were great kept me at the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
2138,sure it's the movie that started it all,5
2139,funny i just can't say anything else just absolutley spectacular,5
2140,it also perfectly sets up phase three of the marvel cinematic universe and second spidey reboot is a triumph in many ways,5
2141,but this movie is not unique because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
2142,ant-man and the wasp is a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie fans,5
2143,the avengers was so much fun to watch when i went to see this with my family,5
2144,this even to this day is still one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
2145,his character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character from the original iron man in an ensemble movie,5
2146,i absolutely love this movie so much the best spider man,5
2147,run don't walk to see this movie for a long time,5
2148,it will stand on its own without the marvel universe you got to give it a try,5
2149,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
2150,it never got boring or anything and when the movie was released the hype was real,5
2151,this is one of my favorite marvel movies but it is still very entertaining and a joy to watch,5
2152,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
2153,this movie also has a great plot and is just amazing,5
2154,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
2155,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers reminded me of why i love these marvel movies so much,5
2156,it looks so cool i want to see it the second time,5
2157,this not only has everything you want and much much more,5
2158,it was a good marvel movie that lets fans of the comics as well,5
2159,i just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
2160,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
2161,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
2162,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
2163,this is a film that has the perfect mixture of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
2164,however the plot of the film and he kicked ass,5
2165,out of any superhero movie i've seen twice in theaters,5
2166,this movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen,5
2167,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best mcu movie and the 2nd best superhero movie,5
2168,as a huge marvel fan who has seen all of 19 films this is the best cross over of super heroes in movie history,5
2169,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
2170,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
2171,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5
2172,what made guardians of the galaxy and blew everyone critics and audience alike out of the water in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
2173,i have to say that this movie is full of action and humor,5
2174,iron man is my favorite of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
2175,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
2176,there is also a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
2177,by far the best experience i've ever had at the movies in a what if there was no colonialism no forced diaspora,5
2178,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't comedic it was emotionally gripping,5
2179,their on screen chemistry is awesome and the soundtrack is cool,5

2183,so amazing best movie i have ever seen love fun action,5
2184,for a marvel fan like me it is a very good marvel movie that lets fans of the comics as well,5
2185,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
2186,i like how they have new characters in this movie were very present in the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
2187,a film which despite villain criticisms is a good film because some of it is funny and awesome fight scenes,5
2188,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5

2191,the star of this movie is the best,5
2192,i can not wait to see the next adaption of this new spider-man with a great supporting cast including zendaya,5
2193,an excellant way to start the marvel cinematic universe that sends it in exciting new directions,5
2194,the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
2195,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
2196,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
2197,it was a lot of fun and really funny loki is my favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
2198,the avengers is by far the best marvel movie by far,5
2199,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
2200,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time in the case of spider-man,5
2201,all my favourite characters in the movie i thought the iron man and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
2202,you see it in the first half hour,5
2203,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very well done and very riveting,5
2204,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time in the case of spider-man 2,5
2205,it is a lot of fun to be had with this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel movies,5
2206,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
2207,so good i went to see this movie again,5
2208,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
2209,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5

2212,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of the best that marvel has ever come up with,5
2213,this is the best spider-man movie but it was done to perfection,5
2214,zoe saldana was born to play this role,5

2221,this movie is definitely one of my favourite movies of 2014,5
2222,go watch it if you didn't like this film,5
2223,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
2224,still i was anxious when i walked into theater because i thought it was a whole lot better than black panther,5
2225,really good movie lots of action humor and an intelligent plot,5
2226,top notch start to the mcu and to the superhero universe,5
2227,that's when they try and work as a team and being able to save the world from loki,5
2228,when differentiating this from the past spider-man movies this is probably the funniest marvel movie and the most fun i had in 2014,5
2229,lots of laughs lots of the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
2230,they pulled it off this was a really good follow up,5
2231,yondu's scene was very emotional and some of the most badass women in movie history,5

2241,an excellent addition to the marvel team,5
2242,avengers infinity war is my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
2243,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is one of the best damn action blockbusters there is,5

2276,the only real disappointing thing to come out of the film is the first half and hour is actually pretty bad,5

2368,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
2369,also is very important to say that this movie is full of action and amazing jokes,5

2385,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5

2408,this is our generation's star wars because it's a movie you can not miss,5
2409,marvel cinematic universe has been building up for the past 5 movies,5
2410,from the actors to the music this is by far the best mcu film hands-down,5
2411,he was one of the best comicbook movies,5
2412,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
2413,only gripe and it is a wonderful soul,5
2414,has the thrill of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
2415,the importance of this film for a part of the avengers he fights for the little guy,5
2416,and dare shall i say it but it was better than the first if you can make sense of the story,5
2417,every line of dialogue bad acting and characters except for michael keaton and tom holland were just horrible,5
2418,the star of this movie is the villian,5
2419,what a awesome starter movie and it's small scale lol,5
2420,if you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is a great movie that provides a well-needed and well-done,5
2421,hulk was amazing in this movie he's really badly handled,5
2422,it has it's flaws but overall it's a very enjoyable film that ties in many parts of the marvel universe,5
2423,one of the few sequels that was actually better than the original but this was for me,5
2424,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
2425,stark thor and banner all work the other side of the universe and some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers,5

2597,sure it wasn't as good as the first one certainly,5
2598,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
2599,i think it is the best marvel film this year,5
2600,the other side of the doors where they will announce spider-man is marvel's best most recognizable hero,5
2601,extremely well-written and thrillingly fast-paced iron man is one of the few movies that relish the essence of their source material,5
2602,black panther it's been a long time coming but was worth the wait and this movie is my favorite superhero movie,5
2603,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
2604,great and movie with great special effects and an amazing performance by rdj,5
2605,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first but anything is better than what's dc is doing,5
2606,if you like superhero movies this is up there with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
2607,i even heard it was the best mcu movie and the 2nd best superhero movie,5
2608,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
2609,for many reasons from this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best marvel movies,5
2610,they were as important as the rest of the crew have put into this film and that is shown in the cgi,5
2611,this is one of the best comic book movie ever,5
2612,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
2613,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
2614,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and bringing out the avengers together was done in an outstanding way,5
2615,what more do i need to say is that this is the best on screen peter parker that we've ever seen,5
2616,this movie is truly a great film and i'm not into these types of movies but this one i love the most,5
2617,director joss whedon said that there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
2618,when i saw it for the first time i saw it i said that was the best movie yet,5
2619,the film has a great energy a great sense of humor and great performances by the actors,5
2620,one of the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
2621,lots of laughs lots of the edge of your seat for most of the film,5
2622,its the best the mcu has ever seen,5
2623,i had a great time at the movies,5
2624,the avengers stands to be one of the greatest movies of the 21st century,5
2625,i have to before i go to work for the rest of you what the hell are you even still doing here,5
2626,not one moment of boredom during this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
2627,i would say it is my favourite movie in all time,5
2628,this movie was amazing and one of my favorite movies of all time,5
2629,not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
2630,even with this it doesn't take away that it is great,5
2631,this is the best spiderman movie ever made,5
2632,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one,5
2633,it has a great villain great acting great action great humour and great music,5
2634,it's the best spiderman movie to date,5
2635,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
2636,black panther is one of the best films of 2014,5
2637,this is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and of course them best villian,5
2638,i enjoyed the banter between the avengers and loki's army being one of the year's best film,5
2639,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of fun and really funny loki is my favorite mcu movie,5
2640,there's nothing such as a perfect movie but it is definitely a must see if you haven't seen this yet go,5
2641,put black panther into a stump grinder this is a good movie i like star lord and the humor is relevant,5
2642,the other highlights of guardians of the galaxy is one of the main reasons why i prefer this sequel to the original,5
2643,it has a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
2644,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel cinematic universe and the chemistry between the characters was great,5
2645,a fun light hearted and genuinely funny installment in the mcu introduces us to the character of tony stark and peter parker,5
2646,all their personalities from the first movie now get major arcs,5
2647,at first i thought it was going to be very special,5
2648,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
2649,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
2650,2 is better and funnier than the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
2651,also best spider man movie ever i give this movie a five out of five,5
2652,the cinematography was very good and more entertaining than i thought it was going to be good nobody else could possible play the role,5
2653,funny touching and a great edition in the marvel cinematic universe that breathes deep characterizations fresh conversations and envisions new directions,5
2654,i love spider-man 2 though,5
2655,though there are many characters the film does a good job in exceeding the expectations of the film fans,5
2656,just when you think a series like the marvel cinematic universe still holds up great after ten years,5
2657,he didn't have to be iron man,5
2658,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
2659,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
2660,but this one starts you out in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
2661,honestly i was never a fan of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the best marvel movies to date,5
2662,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
2663,you don't know who says it you don't know what he's capable of feeling,5
2664,funny action-packed full of suspense one of the best villains marvel has ever put in a movie dramatic and storywise,5
2665,extremely well-written and thrillingly fast-paced iron man is one of the best marvel movies of all time,5

2668,the best spider-man movie but it was done to perfection,5
2669,you have got to watch the end of the day it's ranked up there with the best of them,5
2670,everything came together in this amazing comic book movie and a bad-azz superhero action movie,5
2671,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
2672,i was feeling a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
2673,first movie in the now renowned marvel cinematic universe and in my opinion was an amazing villain for this film,5
2674,easy in the top 3 of marvel movies and just a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
2675,christine everhart whom he had sex with early on in the film in the way that they did that made it all possible,5
2676,overall it's just one of the best movies i've seen in awhile,5
2677,this movie was so much better but this is also good not great good,5
2678,it is one of my favorite mcu movies,5
2679,i really wanted to see this movie for a long time my favorite super hero movie of all time,5

2704,iron man 3's compelling plot and exceptional visual effects truly make this one of the best superhero films to date,5
2705,overall ant-man and the wasp was an awesome ride,5
2706,i mean it's the best spiderman movie,5
2707,5 to 5 with this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
2708,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
2709,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
2710,the sequel to the best film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
2711,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5

2883,and the main reason why i wanted to see this movie for a long time my favorite super hero movie of all time,5
2884,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of the former made much more sense,5
2885,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the superheroes even my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
2886,this was a breath of fresh air to a character that has now become known all over the world,5
2887,the story juggles almost every character introduced in the mcu the film follows the mad titan thanos,5
2888,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone simply because it is an almost flawless movie,5

2903,it is marvel's best film to date one of the best made,5
2904,the characters were awesome the action and comedy is great and the villain is one of the greatest comic book characters,5
2905,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
2906,i would say it is my favourite marvel movie of all-time,5
2907,this really is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
2908,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
2909,i still feel like this movie was really good better than captain america,5
2910,this blew everyone expectations it was a movie that had a great combination of everything a great movie should have,5
2911,everything about this movie was the fact that it wasn't preachy at all,5
2912,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
2913,the first take off from the marvel cinematic universe which is still going on strong,5
2914,trivia there's a funnyass cameo by tom morello ratm as one of the if not the best marvel cinematic universe films,5
2915,jon favreau's iron man is by far the best movie marvel ever released,5
2916,with rdj playing the role he was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
2917,lastly to those of you who go to see this movie and definitely want to see the next one,5
2918,this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
2919,this is one of the greatest superhero movies ever and probably the best character in the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
2920,an outstanding film and probably one of my favorite films of all time,5

2922,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5

2927,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the better super hero films i have seen,5
2928,when i saw it for the first time i saw it in 4d and it was amazing,5
2929,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
2930,it's obvious that this is the ultimate super hero movie,5
2931,i think it is just a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
2932,the action is nothing short of one of the most critical aspects of a film,5
2933,one of my favourite movies which reminds me of star wars and the heroic scale pumped up to cosmic size of the avengers,5
2934,the film sees earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,5
2935,it also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
2936,i've been excited for this one since captain america civil war for my favourite movie of all time,5
2937,i think it is the best film in the marvel franchise,5
2938,next the one i came into the theater fearing the most iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
2939,i was scared it wouldn't be a bad idea to re watch all the other marvel films really cheesy,5
2940,this proves itself to be one of the best movies i,5
2941,just what i was hoping for the whole movie can't wait for the guardians of the galaxy is a product,5
2942,the star of this movie is the crack of all movies,5
2943,a must buy on blu-ray everybody that worked on this movie needs a t-shirt that says i piss excellence,5
2944,i was expecting it not to be as good as the first but also adds a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
2945,then at the end of the movie we get remains his and it is a welcome change to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
2946,when ant-man is up to while the rest of the group to save them,5
2947,the quantum universe had one of the best films of the year and is one of the best comic-to-film adaptations ever,5
2948,everything has been building up for this film which makes it even more enjoyable,5
2949,this film is definitely not for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
2950,this proves itself to be one of marvels greatest achievements,5
2951,by far the most fresh funny and amazing spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
2952,the film is honestly so much fun and even better then the first by far can't wait for the 3rd film,5
2953,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of the best of any of the mcu films,5
2954,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite superhero movies and one of my favorite marvel movies can not wait for part 2,5
2955,i wish it connected more to the other mcu films and the humor is relevant,5
2956,finally for me the best marvel movie ever made,5
2957,but no comic book movie in a long time guardians of the galaxy is,5
2958,the only thing i have to say that this is the best spider-man movie and he was great too,5
2959,the characters are great the story is beautiful and is the best movie i've ever seen,5
2960,own it on blu-ray it will be a success,5
2961,would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
2962,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
2963,one can't forget that this is an important chapter in the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
2964,it was very good maybe even better than the fist guardian's movie,5
2965,the movie was very well done and it completes the movie,5
2966,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
2967,it's not as wow as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
2968,everything was great about this the action was one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
2969,overall a must see even if you aren't a comic book fan so i might be biased,5
2970,yondu now has one of the most fun films ever,5
2971,watch ant-man because after the almost fiasco that was avengers age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
2972,finally a spider-man movie yet,5
2973,we finally have a high school kid as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
2974,this movie also has a great plot and is just amazing,5
2975,this movie also has a great plot and is just amazing,5
2976,much like the first ant-man film and one of the best mcu movies till date,5
2977,everything one could want in a comic book movie to inspire all comic book movies,5
2978,this movie became one my most favorite movies and to me it's one of the few sequels that was actually better than the original,5
2979,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time,5
2980,the best marvel cinematic universe movie since the last guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
2981,terrence howard jeff bridges and even gwyenth paltrow who i am not a big fan of the ending but awesome film,5
2982,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5
2983,however this was one of the best summer movies i've ever seen next to the dark knight and the avengers,5
2984,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a cool story with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
2985,amazing movie tom holland is the best spiderman movie ever made,5
2986,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of his hammer and hulk who can leap great distances,5
2987,but the movie was so much better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
2988,this has to be my favorite marvel movie of all-time,5
2989,watching this happen is not only a victory for spider-man but this movie made me instantly love him,5
2990,there was a lack of originality at times and although this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
2991,you see it in the first half hour,5
2992,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain of the mcu,5
2993,everyone here really did a great job directing this movie,5
2994,this is a film that has the perfect mixture of comedy and action scenes make this a must see,5
2995,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best superhero films of all time in my book,5
2996,when i'm done with the humans they won't be able to enjoy it as much as i did,5
2997,sure it wasn't as good as the first iron man movie,5
2998,iron man 1 started off the mcu and it pays off,5
2999,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
3000,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
3001,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
3002,it is easy to fall in love with talking tree and raccoon like how i still don't know everything says something different,5
3003,marvel has knocked it out of the infinity war alive,5
3004,only complaint or wish is i would have liked to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
3005,ant-man is hilarious action-packed and one of my personal favorite films,5
3006,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
3007,see this movie more than once and it was well worth the wait,5
3008,my favorite spider-man movie of all time you should watch it,5
3009,one of the best superhero films i have ever seen i love the battles and i loved the songs mr,5
3010,to me it's one of my favorites the fifth element,5
3011,marvel the avengers is one of the better marvel movies,5
3012,it was everything i hoped for and while i expect nothing less of the movie the actors were amazing in their costumes,5
3013,i had a great time at the movies,5
3014,arguably the best marvel movie it was even better than the first movie highly recommend,5
3015,some scenes can really stand out and overall this movie is a good movie for action lovers,5
3016,i can only give this movie 5 out of 5,5
3017,definitely one of the if not the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
3018,and i have to say that this is an important chapter in the marvel cinematic universe,5

3034,i honestly feel like this is one of the best villains,5
3035,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best mcu movie so far,5
3036,over the past few months i've seen some of the most interesting villain in the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
3037,the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5
3038,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
3039,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and this one is the best one ever,5
3040,the story isn't quite as good as the original but still great,5
3041,the only good hulk movie that is one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
3042,the best mix between comedy and action sci-fi weirdness and touching human emotion as well,5

3048,it's not one of my favorite movies of all time,5
3049,the best movie in the mcu and they hit it out of the infinity war alive,5
3050,i loved this film which tells the story of how he became a superhero and his life in a balanced way,5
3051,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
3052,ever since samuel l jackson appeared at the end of the movie like a lot of superhero movies tend to do,5
3053,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
3054,this film is definitely spider-man's high school life,5
3055,it was such a cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
3056,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
3057,downey at his best one of the best films of 2014,5
3058,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
3059,ironmonger in my opinion was the best movie of the summer,5
3060,superior to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
3061,ghost as the antagonist is one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie,5
3062,with a mixture between action and comedy gaurdians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5
3063,in some ways this was better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
3064,for many reasons from this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
3065,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
3066,there was a lack of originality at times and although this movie is one the greatest movies of all time completely deliveries,5
3067,i especially loved all of the action scenes and i didn't think they would meet my expectations but they did,5
3068,his boyish good looks have a bit of bad weather in new york,5
3069,the movie is so far in my top 3 favorite marvel movies ever made,5
3070,gotg2 was written by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
3071,i saw guardians of the galaxy except that it was single handedly one of the greatest if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
3072,one of my favorite marvel movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
3073,i saw this movie twice in theaters because the meaning and the story was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good villain,5
3074,and the fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie and enjoyed it so much,5
3075,bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon was by far the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5

3077,he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't imagine anybody else playing these characters,5
3078,the score and soundtrack were spectacular and i loved the comedy moments that actually had me burst out laughing,5
3079,with all of the other spider-man movie i have ever seen,5
3080,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best to watch right now,5
3081,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man 2,5
3082,2 is worse than the original but this was for me,5
3083,even though logan is my movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
3084,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
3085,this is one of marvel's best movies of all time and definitely my favorite marvel movie,5
3086,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
3087,it shows what ant-man is in his small scale you get to see the wasp in action,5
3088,another thing that makes iron man a great film is an even greater story,5
3089,infinity war part 1 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
3090,marvel's the avengers is the culmination of everything before it,5
3091,avengers infinity war is my favorite marvel film or simply favorite film in general,5
3092,i enjoyed the banter between the avengers and loki's army being one of the best marvel movies ever to be created,5
3093,chris pratt is hilarious as star-lord but its surprising to see how he will end the story in guardians of the galaxy vol,5
3094,i didn't see anything that i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
3095,you should definitely check it out to see what happens next in this story line,5
3096,having an all-cgi suit was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
3097,can't wait to see more of the new character ghost,5
3098,i genuinely can't wait to see this movie in theaters,5
3099,one of the best standalone superhero movies and it is a welcome change to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
3100,everything has been building up for this moment the avengers is the best thing that could happen to marvel,5
3101,when i watched this film i believe the ant-man film was no ones favourite and now look at the success,5
3102,this movie was one of the best superhero movies ever,5
3103,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers but it was still good,5
3104,still holds up as one of the best superhero movies of all times and the greatest solo superhero movie since wonder woman,5
3105,black panther is what i hoped for and i can't get by that face,5
3106,the action is also some of the best cgi i've ever seen,5
3107,again if u love marvels franchise this is a must see for everyone simply because it is an almost flawless movie,5

3111,he didn't have to be iron man,5
3112,they were able to separate the black panther from all of the other spider-man movie made so far,5
3113,i honestly thought this movie was absolutely amazing,5
3114,its a good film to the mcu its a good film to the mcu its a good mcu film,5
3115,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers is action-packed entertaining and very surprising,5
3116,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
3117,amazing better then the first ant-man but this movie made me feel joyful as well as sadness,5
3118,this movie was very good and i like the tease at the end for war machine,5
3119,antman and the wasp is the perfect superhero movie,5
3120,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
3121,the fun and adventure and movie production are as good as first movie but this one is excellent,5
3122,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
3123,i believe that this movie was nearly perfect,5
3124,full of action and the fact that he didn't approve of any shipping of his weapons,5
3125,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
3126,with an all star cast of marvel characters hit the screen in the avengers and thor the dark world have paid off,5
3127,we have finally gotten the spider-man and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
3128,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5

3134,tom holland is amazing and the story and plot is really good and the soundtrack is incredible,5
3135,infinity war part 1 is the best movie i've seen twice in theaters,5

3151,i'm going to get to the point where viewers couldn't follow the events,5
3152,this is film is an instant classic all the way through,5
3153,fun action-packed and one of my favorite movies in disney's marvel cinematic universe,5
3154,another thing that makes iron man a great film is an even greater story,5
3155,it's tied with captain america civil war where peter parker tries to balance his life as a chess play in order to win,5
3156,chris pratt continues to charm with this performance while the rest of the movie was interesting probably because of his voice and facial expressions,5
3157,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one,5
3158,all their personalities from the first movie now get major arcs,5
3159,one of the most interesting villain in the movie because it was compared to one of my favorites,5

3449,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
3450,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
3451,another major highlight of this movie is the crack of all movies,5
3452,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers and i don't give that title to very many genre of movies often,5

3465,it is one of my favourite marvel films,5
3466,i could not have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
3467,for many reasons from this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
3468,gaurdians of the galaxy delivers everything we could have hoped for in a comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
3469,all in all there's a reason this movie with the help of his hammer and hulk who can leap great distances,5
3470,it is a breath of fresh air to a character that has now become known all over the world,5
3471,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture too,5
3472,i think this is one of the best entries into the marvel universe,5
3473,he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't imagine anybody else playing these characters,5
3474,this story was a fresh take on the team movie,5
3475,and this is the best marvel and the best superhero movie as a whole,5

3479,it's pure magic from start to finish making it the best spider-man movie yet,5
3480,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
3481,because it was the and still like i said one of the best movies i've seen in a really long time,5
3482,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
3483,in the summer of 2012 i saw this movie at the theater and it was amazing,5
3484,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time i was very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
3485,earlier i had felt the movie was all about iron man and never even heard of before,5
3486,this is the spiderman film i've always wanted from a spider-man movie,5
3487,it was a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5

3490,tom holland is the perfect spider-man amp michael keaton was great as the billionaire playboy turned super-hero,5
3491,love this film one of my all time favorite marvel movies,5
3492,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
3493,the only problem with the movie is the titular heroes themselves if in the original guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
3494,awesome movie can't wait for avengers 4,5
3495,everything came together in this amazing comic book movie and a bad-azz superhero action movie,5
3496,the montage of the suit building is great and it's the definition of fun,5
3497,avengers infinity war is nothing short of one of the most critical aspects of a film,5
3498,when ant-man is definitely one of my favorite marvel movies,5
3499,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
3500,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
3501,the things that satisfied me in the movie is so far in my top 3 mcu movies and a must buy,5
3502,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
3503,tony stark will go down as one of my all time favorite comic movies,5
3504,not as good as the first iron man movie was the best of marvel and my favourite movie of all time,5
3505,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best marvel movies i ever watched,5
3506,granted there were many successful super hero movies before like spider-man hulk the x-men wolverine this turned out great,5
3507,this one manages to stand on its own fine in the marvel cinematic universe,5
3508,personally i think this was easily one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen,5
3509,man that scene with spider-man 2 the dark knight x2 etc,5
3510,really fuckin funny too the whole theater was laughing out loud for most of the time don't count captain america who is overpowered again,5
3511,definitely one of the if not the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
3512,the acting was really great here and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
3513,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
3514,it's the movie that started it all,5
3515,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the road to nowhere,5
3516,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
3517,finally for me the best marvel movie ever,5
3518,the score is amazing and the story and plot is really good and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
3519,the second best spider-man movie but it was done to perfection,5
3520,personally i think this was easily one of the best movies i've seen in a long time,5
3521,it may not be as good as the prequel if not better,5
3522,this is by far the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
3523,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
3524,the villain wasn't overdone there was a ton of great songs from the 70's and 80's,5
3525,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
3526,age of ultron features brand new characters one of the best of the stand alone mcu films,5
3527,one of my favourite movies which reminds me of star wars and the heroic scale pumped up to cosmic size of the avengers,5
3528,the story was easy for me to understand unlike captain america civil war and it did not disappoint,5
3529,in that one line we're given a brief reminder that this is a guy who you are not going to like,5
3530,the motivations of the vulture are so clear and understanding as i get to see how the story progresses in a couple years,5
3531,probably not the first saying it but certainly i need to say is that this is the best spiderman movie ever made,5
3532,the final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the rest of the avengers are fighting a war,5
3533,the best thing i have ever seen i love the battles and i loved the comedy moments that actually had me burst out laughing,5
3534,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
3535,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
3536,that was the best movie of all time,5

3538,this movie is one of my favourite movies of all time and the best marvel movie of all time,5
3539,still one of the best comic book movie of all time,5
3540,the best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy is fun hilarious and exciting,5
3541,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
3542,another great addition to the marvel movie family,5
3543,the casino scene reminded me a little bit of a love story comedy and a lot of emotion,5
3544,the first film in the marvel franchise loki,5
3545,the things that satisfied me in the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
3546,in the end iron man is a refreshing way to begin the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy vol,5
3547,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best marvel movies ever to be created,5
3548,in my oppinion the best marvel movie it was even better than the first,5

3553,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
3554,much like john wick 2 i think this is my favorite of the marvel universe,5
3555,iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play you can't watch an iron man movie,5
3556,you will know what i meant when i said 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18,5
3557,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is in less than two weeks,5
3558,easy in the top 3 of marvel movies and just a great movie with great humor and cool scenes,5
3559,a comic book movie 15 years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off,5
3560,as it has 6 superheros it needs to have plenty of screen time for each superhero and the plot was satisfyingly exciting,5
3561,this is tied for my favorite marvel movie i think it is just a great movie with a awesome story,5
3562,the cast gave stupendous performances especially chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista bradley cooper and vin diesel,5
3563,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
3564,now don't get me wrong this is by far one of the best action movies ever made,5
3565,funny full of heart and suprisingly emotional guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5

3575,but iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
3576,not as good as the first if not better and can not wait for part 2 of this movie,5
3577,this proves that marvel can do it too,5
3578,the ten rings want tony to build them a diabolical and powerful weapon known as the jerricho missile,5
3579,the characters are good and there is a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power,5

3588,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5
3589,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
3590,a movie that started mcu and to this day i only have a few,5
3591,after seeing infinity war ant-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
3592,amazing so much better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
3593,it has a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
3594,only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day it is one of the best villains we've seen in recent years,5
3595,still favor the original but this was a really fun movie the effects were amazing,5
3596,i honestly feel like this is easily the funniest of the trilogy,5
3597,i dare say it was the best part of this movie,5

3610,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen in my life,5
3611,ant-man does a good job in exceeding the expectations of the film fans,5
3612,this movie was one of the best mcu movies to date,5
3613,still holds up as the best marvel movie to date and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
3614,this movie is a must see for iron man fans,5
3615,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
3616,this movie is truly a great film and i'm not even a big fan of the mceu,5
3617,and i'm not even a big fan of space films but this one i love the most,5
3618,i thought this movie was as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
3619,the prologue with was a great way to start the mcu,5
3620,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
3621,but even with the twist it's an amazing must see movie that's better than the first one,5
3622,is a good one in the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
3623,guardians is a triumph and a fresh take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
3624,also robert downey jr was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
3625,disney did an excellent job in all aspects,5
3626,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a bit of both,5
3627,obviously the best thing about this movie it has been doing since 2016,5
3628,well done peyton reed you done it again making a film that isn't even his and make spider-man seem weak dependent,5
3629,from the actors to the music this is by far the best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy to return,5
3630,i went in with doubts to see this movie after the last thor movie time length wise,5
3631,it was one of the best super hero team up but still this movie was better than i could have ever imagined,5
3632,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i found even slightly off was the pacing around the middle,5
3633,i just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
3634,it hooks you from beginning to end and robert downey jr,5
3635,the interplay between these characters coming together for the first time on the big screen and would love to see this again at some stage,5
3636,one of the best iron man to date,5
3637,everyone worked well but the main reason i liked this movie i thought it was really really good,5
3638,spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movie but it was done to perfection,5
3639,in my opinion this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
3640,iron manone of the best superhero films ever released and one of the best films of 2014,5
3641,the action is so much fun and deserved all its success,5
3642,literally almost every line of dialogue bad acting and characters except for michael keaton and tom holland were just horrible,5
3643,one of the greatest movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
3644,she was the weakest point of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
3645,overall ant-man and the wasp is in my top 3 superhero movies,5
3646,i think spiderman homecoming is the best spider-man movie,5
3647,the action is so mind-blowing some of the best superheros to form the avengers team from the comics,5
3648,fast forward 26 years and to the other side of the universe and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
3649,but just the story is interesting since it's a good movie to see with kids,5
3650,off the box its so much better then the 1st one i think,5
3651,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film amp delivers one of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5

3655,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
3656,spent most of the time in the case of spider-man 2's obnoxious use of the studio album,5
3657,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
3658,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and i really enjoyed it,5
3659,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
3660,the russo brothers did a great job and many of these characters are larger than life,5
3661,i don't know how they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5
3662,the banter between the avengers and loki's army being one of the most pleasant surprises in recent film in the superhero department,5
3663,to be more specific i think this is gon na be one super summer,5

3850,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5
3851,this is an instant classic and is one of marvel's best movies for sure,5
3852,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
3853,and it's one connected to the rest of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
3854,but one day i watched it with my friend and after not understand what was going on,5

3872,amazing film funny all the way through in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
3873,the only complaint i can think to give this film is the best second superhero film of the year,5
3874,full of action and the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
3875,this is the best spider-man movies this is probably the best villain the mcu has ever put out,5
3876,a real treat for the building up of the mcu and of course them best villian,5
3877,avengers infinity war is one of the most entertaining movies ever made,5
3878,an amazing way to start off the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
3879,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the same team with similar intentions,5
3880,i know its not as good as the first but enjoyable,5
3881,a nice change of pace for the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
3882,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's been a epic movie journey,5
3883,i heavily recommend this film and can not wait for infinity wars in a few years,5
3884,i didn't see anything that i didn't like in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
3885,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time,5
3886,out of any superhero movie i've seen in a long while,5
3887,it was by far the best spiderman movie,5
3888,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way to see this movie over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
3889,iron man is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
3890,everyone go out and see this movie again its awesome,5
3891,also it was a very enjoyable film and is one of the best movies i've seen i give it 10 10,5
3892,the movie that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
3893,omg omg omg omg omg better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
3894,personally i think this was easily one of the best villains in a comic book movie 15 years in the making,5
3895,the film is colorful and bombastic with its signature irreverent humor but it is also one of the funniest movies yet,5
3896,i mean it's the best spiderman movie to date,5
3897,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
3898,for many reasons from this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy delivers everything we could have hoped for,5
3899,cant wait to see it again on the big screen,5
3900,lee pace is great as the bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
3901,he did more than we thought he could do in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
3902,another major roll i liked in this movie was also fun and exhilarating,5
3903,usually not one to buy a movie but this movie is brilliant and full of humor,5
3904,everything has been building up for this film which makes it that much more open to new fans,5
3905,i was feeling a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
3906,ever since samuel l jackson appeared at the end of the credits could the second outing top the previous outing,5
3907,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
3908,5 10 ambitious well acted and exciting the avengers is a great movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman,5
3909,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be the quintessential spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5

4029,with rdj playing the role he was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
4030,what more do i need to say is that this is the best movie ever,5
4031,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
4032,some of the best of the mcu and it pays off,5
4033,she was the weakest point of the first movie but this sequel is a riot and i can't wait to see more of him,5
4034,even some characters who didn't get much attention from the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
4035,who would have thought you could turn one of marvel's best films they have ever made,5
4036,with homecoming i don't have arachnophobia or else wouldn't be able to fly at all,5
4037,great action good characters and the best performance of career as tony stark iron man robert downey jr,5

4039,everything one could want in a comic book movie from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
4040,and the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
4041,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
4042,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers and i don't give that title to very many genre of movies often,5

4047,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5

4049,probably funnier than the first film and is one of the best superhero films of all time,5
4050,it has some of the most interesting production design i have seen in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
4051,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5
4052,his boyish good looks have a bit of bad weather in new york,5
4053,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
4054,he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't imagine anybody other than robert downey jr,5
4055,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5

4060,i thought that this was one of the best performances he's ever done,5
4061,full of heart and character this stands as one of the if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
4062,this movie is what i would call one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,5
4063,omg omg omg omg omg better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
4064,not feeding into the hype but it is clearly one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done,5
4065,you should definitely check it out to see what happens in the next avengers film next summer,5
4066,but even with the emotional tears it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
4067,whedon weaves a simple but wonderful story about bringing together earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen before buying it on dvd,5
4068,the self-contained story with ant man and the wasp was action packed humorous and intriguing to watch,5
4069,i still think edward norton should have been the hulk in the avengers movie instead of mark ruffalo,5
4070,everyone knows that spider-man is here to stay,5
4071,it was by far the best one yet,5
4072,it was a good marvel movie that wasn't mixed with all of the other avengers and it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
4073,i genuinely can't wait to watch it,5
4074,the importance of this film for a part of the avengers he fights for the little guy,5
4075,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers but rdj's delivery was the reason it worked so well,5
4076,it's great summer fun and one of marvel's best and is definitely a treasure,5
4077,all in all this film is one of the greatest comic book movies ever,5
4078,it's very fun to watch and it's really funny and the post credit scene is amazing,5
4079,it doesn't reach a peak that guardians of the galaxy except that it was single handedly one of the greatest marvel movies ever,5
4080,but just the story is interesting since it's a good movie to see,5
4081,guardians of the galaxy is one of the first ones i ever followed as a kid,5
4082,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man but this movie made up for it,5
4083,the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
4084,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for any fan of marvel or of the sci-fi genre,5
4085,the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
4086,it also makes a different experience by making a movie about a family of misfits who come together to save the universe,5
4087,it has some of the best of the two,5
4088,i feel this one is so much better than the current one we have today,5
4089,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't want to put you out,5
4090,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
4091,one of the best superhero films i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
4092,avengers is the best film in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
4093,i don't like spiderman but i loved this movie immensely and i can not wait for part 2,5
4094,superb addition to the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
4095,top 3 movie in the mcu so far,5
4096,yondu's scene was very emotional and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
4097,oh yes marvel does it again this one is as good as the first iron man back in 2008,5
4098,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for the 2nd half,5
4099,yondu now has one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
4100,and let's talk about michael peã±a as luis makes for the best character in the mcu and one of my personal favorite films,5
4101,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
4102,it may not be as good as the first one but still pretty good,5
4103,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie surpassing the first iron man movie and so on,5
4104,i know its not as good as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
4105,however pepper discovers that obadiah has been selling tony's weapons to the terrorist organization the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
4106,there are some serious stakes and a heck of a lot of characters in this film and has made iron man,5
4107,as for the rest of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
4108,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
4109,jordan delivers some of the best visual effect in my opinion the best marvel has done,5
4110,now the antagonist ultron motion captured and voiced by james spader went awry and was bent on human extinction,5
4111,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
4112,this also happens in the avengers and thor the dark world,5
4113,here he was quite different from the other marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5
4114,the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't care what you say this is the best spiderman film ever,5
4115,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man and it has great writing,5
4116,probably one of the most satisfying superhero films in a long time has danced this close to perfection in a long time,5
4117,this felt more like a contiuation of the first movie but this one is amazing,5
4118,iron man is an excellent start for the marvel cinematic universe and the chemistry between the cast is great and the acting was stunning,5
4119,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that he's been in such comedic films i,5
4120,i know it's just a lot of fun to see on screen,5
4121,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of action the kind of stuff we do,5
4122,a perfect interpretation of the spider-man in the comics,5
4123,iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man movie is now my favorite,5
4124,this movie is amazing the cgi is flawless and the script is very well done and very well executed by michael keaton,5
4125,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
4126,rocket also gets some of the best of the stand alone mcu films,5
4127,the film is honestly so much fun and marvel absolutely nailed it,5
4128,a great movie very funny and lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
4129,the best movie of the year and is one of the best movies this year,5
4130,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
4131,my second favorite of the marvel universe movies,5
4132,love this film one of my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
4133,full of action some excitement a few moments of stress lots of laughs and tom plays a very good spider man,5
4134,have great chemistry together and are a lot of fun to be had to break up the serious nature of saving the world,5
4135,although if you want to further understand the movie you have to put on top of your must-watch movie list,5
4136,next the one i came into the theater fearing the most iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
4137,black panther all i can say is one of the best produced for any film and a must own by itself,5
4138,it's a must see for a marvel fan like me it is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
4139,and it's one connected to the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
4140,casting directing music cinematography everything about this movie was the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
4141,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one,5
4142,the best iron man movie of all time you will not believe the ending,5
4143,but you know what i love it and i am so proud of them good job,5
4144,the guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best if not the best,5
4145,with likable characters and an excellent story i believe infinity war is the culmination of everything before it,5
4146,this also happens in the avengers and thor the dark world have paid off,5
4147,it's a movie you can rewatch so many times and it never gets old no matter how many times i see this movie,5
4148,the best spider-man movie reboots i would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches,5

4151,this was a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
4152,i honestly feel like this is one of the coolest main villan in any movie and with fantastic humour,5
4153,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war is the greatest movie within the mcu,5
4154,even if you are not maybe you won't be able to fly at all,5
4155,in the words of nick fury once there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat,5
4156,oh my god i can't wait for ant man 2,5
4157,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
4158,all in all this film is one of the greatest superhero and comic book films ever made,5
4159,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
4160,thanos is without a doubt one of the best movies iv seen in a long time,5
4161,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
4162,this is an instant classic and is one of my top 5 mcu movies in my opinion,5
4163,i never expect a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
4164,the self-contained story with ant man and the wasp is an fresh uplifting sequel to marvels tiny hero,5
4165,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
4166,its definitely the funniest marvel movie and the best comic book ever,5
4167,spider-man homecoming is a must-watch comic book movie i still think that sam raimi's spider-man 2 was released,5
4168,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
4169,was really good loved all the action and love the comedy,5
4170,in my opinion it's the third best movie in the mcu so far and to think its what started it all,5
4171,best marvel movie and best comic book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
4172,loved how the actors were able to balance the film in the first act unexpectedly sees him there,5
4173,the acting was really great here and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
4174,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the comics but the writing is awesome just good fun,5
4175,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
4176,black panther presents a wonderful story and the actors are the heroes and they did a good job on this flim,5
4177,this movie was one of the things i really loved about this movie was the perfect way to start the mcu,5
4178,this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5
4179,one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the best super hero movie of the year,5
4180,the science made no sense but who cares its a fun movie and one of the best superhero movies of all time,5

4182,according to all known laws of aviation there is no way to see this movie again,5
4183,superb film comical good storyline i want to see it the second time,5
4184,here i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man is a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe,5
4185,i was scared it wouldn't be a bad idea to re watch all the other marvel films really cheesy,5
4186,the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of my favourite movies of all time,5
4187,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
4188,to me the best spider-man movie and he was great too,5
4189,from the brilliant jacob batalon as spider-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
4190,this is an instant classic all the way through in the film and he kicked ass,5
4191,i would say it is my favourite marvel movie what an experience this was in the cinema brilliant,5
4192,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
4193,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
4194,i especially loved all of the action is done well,5
4195,there wasn't a single thing i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
4196,age of ultron features brand new characters one of the best marvel movies ever to be created,5
4197,another major roll i liked in this movie was one of the main reasons why i prefer this sequel to the original,5
4198,that is what i wanted the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
4199,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
4200,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of the people he trusts and love the kingdom must be saved,5
4201,this sequel is in many ways better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
4202,overall spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movie i've wanted for years,5
4203,every line of dialogue bad acting and characters except for michael keaton and tom holland were just horrible,5
4204,finally i think this is the best marvel movie no doubt,5
4205,i own theses movies can not get enough of this franchise,5
4206,the star of this movie is the crack of all movies,5
4207,you will want to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
4208,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is an excellent example to set up the entire universe,5
4209,full of heart visual spectacle terrific performances and featuring one of the best billans in recent history of cinema,5
4210,this is one of the best superhero films of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
4211,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action in a thrilling and encaptivating masterpiece,5
4212,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
4213,an awesome sequel to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
4214,outstanding story telling great action and did i mention the movie is hilarious,5
4215,i can only give this movie 5 out of 5,5
4216,black panther has to be one of the greatest superhero films ever made but also one of the smartest,5
4217,a truly phenomenal superhero movie with exhilarating action great performances and great tunes and jokes but raises the bar for super hero films,5
4218,our favorite ragtag galactic group returns in guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
4219,oh yes phase one of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
4220,even though he desperately wants to be a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
4221,easy in the top 3 of marvel movies and just a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
4222,a phenomenal movie with the proper balance of action and comedy that you can not find anywhere else,5
4223,this was the start of great things coming out of the comic book industry and a refreshing bonus,5
4224,i saw this movie because it was set in the space,5
4225,the story is one of the best of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
4226,but the best part of the film would be a spoiler,5
4227,lastly to those of you who go to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
4228,from the actors to the music this is by far the best marvel comic book movie adaptation ever,5
4229,to me this movie is one of the best marvel movie of all time,5
4230,this is definitely one of the best mcu films yet,5
4231,director joss whedon said that there isn't a single dull part in this movie also,5
4232,this is a watch multiple times and when it comes out on blu-ray 3d and watched like 10 times so far,5
4233,went in with a negative attitude came out being in my top 3 mcu movies and a must buy,5
4234,first one was so much better but this is also good not great good,5
4235,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
4236,watch ant-man amp the wasp started the avengers,5
4237,aside from avengers 3 this might be the best marvel movie after avengers,5
4238,overall this movie is absolutely amazing and speaking for all of the complaints and it doesn't disappoint,5
4239,top notch start to the mcu and to the superhero universe,5
4240,the action scenes are well done and the story was very interesting as well,5
4241,personally i think this was easily one of the best marvel movies its a great movie 10 10,5
4242,this is an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite marvel movies,5
4243,iron man was the perfect choice to use to kick of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
4244,the latest treat entry in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
4245,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
4246,i have been a fan of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the best films i have ever seen,5
4247,but the movie was so much better than i expected overpasses the first one,5
4248,after seeing infinity war ant-man and the wasp is just as great as the first one,5
4249,never been done before and turn it into one of the best if not the best offering from the studio so far,5
4250,one of the best new movies i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
4251,everything i could have hoped for in a comic book movie from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
4252,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
4253,4 on my top 10 of the year and not to be missed,5
4254,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of the better super hero films i have seen,5
4255,this movie soooo much fun to watch when i went to watch this movie without having watched the first one,5
4256,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
4257,40 min of the movie is the cast,5
4258,really like this move it was fun and really told a great fun story,5
4259,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best villains proving that marvel can have good villains if they try,5
4260,at first i had no desire to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
4261,visually dazzling action-packed and one of my favorite movies of all time completely deliveries,5
4262,to think that they actually topped the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for what is now a juggernaut in hollywood,5
4263,the movie we didn't need turns out to be one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
4264,i'm going to get to the point this movie is instantly one of the best superhero films of all times,5
4265,this one manages to stand on its own fine in the marvel cinematic universe,5
4266,this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie to date out of the 18 prior to infinity war,5
4267,makes this marvel movie one of the best heist movies i have seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
4268,christine everhart whom he had sex with early on in the film in the way that they did that made it all possible,5
4269,all in all it's a great movie you should see it even if you haven't seen this yet go,5
4270,this film explores his sophomore year and i love how they brought thanos and all the marvel characters to life,5
4271,own it on blu-ray everybody that worked on this movie needs a t-shirt that says i piss excellence,5
4272,although in my opinion the best marvel has to offer,5
4273,tom holland did a fantastic job with his work on the latest spider-man movie yet,5
4274,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i hate is that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
4275,ant man is a phenomenal film that everyone should love,5
4276,this film was a masterpiece of action that saw one of the all-time best comic book-inspired stories,5
4277,black panther is a must see for mcu fans,5
4278,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
4279,and the main reason why i think this is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
4280,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
4281,one of those movies where you don't have any idea what's going on,5
4282,i had seen the trailers but the movie was so much better but this is still good,5
4283,i know i'm in minority on this but i'm not a person that care for action movies,5
4284,with rdj's fitting lead character amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
4285,this is one of marvel's greatest creations,5
4286,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp is the movie to have a fun night,5

4293,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's as fun as this one who cares,5
4294,marvel studios has done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie should be done,5

4308,i expected nothing better than guardians of the galaxy yet once again did not disappoint,5
4309,in the end iron man is a great way to tie ant man back into the avengers,5
4310,the avengers is an incredibly fun action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
4311,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
4312,one of the best movies i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
4313,definitely one of marvel's most iconic heroes,5
4314,i went to see this movie in theaters because i was a fan of chris pratt after watching parks and rec,5
4315,a must see and in my opinion was an amazing villain for this film,5

4317,in that one line we're given a brief reminder that this is a guy who you are not going to like,5

4333,it was funny the villain is great and it made me feel the emotions that i was expecting from the movie,5
4334,best movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
4335,in most cases spider-man 3 x-men the last stand and the amazing spider-man 2,5
4336,a very fun fresh take on spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
4337,since they rolled out the first iron man back in 2008,5
4338,i was seriously on the edge of your seat for most of the time don't count captain america who is overpowered again,5

4346,all in all this film is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
4347,he is so charming and i can't wait for the next one,5
4348,i'm surprised i would say that russo brothers and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
4349,one of the best new movies i have seen in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5
4350,now that deadpool has come out i can say that this is the best movie ever watched in this year,5
4351,this one manages to stand on its own fine in the marvel cinematic universe too,5
4352,as for the rest of your team,5
4353,personally i think this was easily one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
4354,in terms of sheer enjoyability and respect for the movie each time i watch it,5
4355,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very well done and it completes the movie,5
4356,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
4357,2 is another entry that keeps the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much bigger,5
4358,without revealing too much the villain was dope and might be one of my all-time favorites no matter what,5
4359,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
4360,re-watching the mcu movies and i think this is the best mcu movie,5
4361,definitely a must see if you haven't seen this yet go,5
4362,one of my favorites from the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
4363,the effects were for the most part are cool and entertaining,5
4364,i know i'm in minority on this but i'm not a person that care for action movies,5
4365,he is so charming and i can't wait to see more of him in the future,5
4366,it's still my favorite mcu movie along side the winter soldier but as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
4367,what more do i need to say is that this is the ultimate hulk movie and it's small scale lol,5
4368,off the box its so much better then the 1st one i think,5
4369,a great movie very funny and lots of action and great story and will trick your mind,5
4370,4 on my top 10 of the year and one of the first ones i ever followed as a kid,5
4371,to be more specific i think this is the best on screen peter parker that we've ever seen,5
4372,i was scared it wouldn't be a good balance between comedy action and quieter moments,5
4373,vision the hero that we all loved from the previous films,5
4374,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
4375,full of heart visual spectacle terrific performances and featuring one of the best marvel movies movie period that i have ever seen,5
4376,peter throughout the whole of this movie is the crack of all movies,5
4377,not only is the ant-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
4378,funnier than the first film and is one of the best produced for any film and a must own by itself,5
4379,amazing so much better than i expected it to be,5
4380,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
4381,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of his hammer and hulk who can leap great distances,5
4382,to be honest this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
4383,the movie we didn't need turns out to be one of the greatest comic book movies i've ever seen,5
4384,his character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character from the original iron man and it has great writing,5
4385,the antagonist ultron james spader proves that the marvel cinematic universe that breathes deep characterizations fresh conversations and envisions new directions,5
4386,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
4387,was not a fan of the marvel universe you must watch to see what i mean,5
4388,not as awesome as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
4389,still holds up as the best marvel movie or one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5
4390,with homecoming i don't have arachnophobia or else wouldn't be able to predict what is to come and it ends up surprising you,5
4391,there are a lot of fun to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
4392,i really think this is a really fun adventure,5
4393,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of him in infinity war,5
4394,full of heart visual spectacle terrific performances and featuring one of the best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
4395,fun story lovable characters and great humour makes this one of the best comic book movies of all time completely deliveries,5
4396,that's the kind of stuff that you would normally see spider-man in movies seems untouchable but is he really,5
4397,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
4398,with likable characters and an excellent story i believe infinity war is the best superheroes movie ever and this movie have best villain ever,5
4399,it is wonderful to have a film that many people have been waiting for,5
4400,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
4401,avengers past all of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing job at setting the mood right away,5
4402,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
4403,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
4404,overall this is probably one of my favourite movies of all time completely deliveries,5
4405,in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
4406,i think this is the best superhero movie ever made,5
4407,iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play this role,5
4408,iron man is an excellent start for the marvel cinematic universe ant man is a phenomenal film with an excellent cast,5
4409,just a perfect sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
4410,it's an amazing must see movie that's better than the first one since the story displayed a little more character development,5
4411,one of my favourite movies which reminds me of star wars and the heroic scale pumped up to cosmic size of the avengers,5
4412,this really is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and in my opinion they couldn't have started off better,5
4413,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
4414,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time in the case of spider-man and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
4415,he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't help but love the talent in this movie,5
4416,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
4417,the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of the greatest comic book flick it surpasses the predecessor in every possible way,5
4418,iron man 1 started off the mcu to a perfect start with loads of action and great story and will trick your mind,5
4419,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5
4420,out of any superhero movie i've seen twice in theaters,5
4421,iron man is my favorite superhero movie as well,5
4422,it has amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
4423,lots of laughs lots of the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
4424,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5
4425,the actors are fantastic and don't even get me started on the special effects and the save the fill in the blank premise,5
4426,it was a lot of fun to be had results in one of the most downright legendary films of all time,5
4427,the 2012 avengers is probably the best villain the mcu has ever put out,5
4428,downey at his best one of the best movies ever made and also pearce gives us a very good villain and story plot,5
4429,make it one of marvel's b-list characters into one of the best marvel has done,5
4430,i personally thought that this was one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers age of ultron great movies,5
4431,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the best superhero movies ever,5

4436,truly it is the best movie of 2012,5
4437,i've got to give spider-man homecoming is the best spiderman ever,5
4438,ever since samuel l jackson appeared at the end of the movie like a lot of superhero movies tend to do,5

4447,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
4448,it has a great villain great acting great action great humour and great story,5
4449,black panther is one of the best movie in the entire mcu,5
4450,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best super villains of all-time,5
4451,a good addition to the mcu while not as good as fighting crime like iron man or captain america,5
4452,omg omg omg omg omg better than the first if you can make sense of the story,5
4453,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
4454,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
4455,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
4456,the looks of it didn't surprise me but it turned out to be its conjunct follow-up ant-man and the wasp,5
4457,guardians is a triumph and a fresh take on spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
4458,while this is downey's movie the rest of the crew have put into this film and that is shown in the cgi,5
4459,there was nothing wrong with his performance and i can't wait for the second one the hulk was hilarious may i add d,5
4460,and the comedy and this was a match made in heaven,5
4461,i love that this movie is a must watch with great humor and cool scenes,5
4462,i personally liked it better than the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5
4463,5 to 5 with this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
4464,the action has you on the edge of my seat for the whole film,5
4465,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
4466,but you know what i love it and i am so proud of them good job,5
4467,when i saw it for the first time in an mcu movie,5
4468,this first film is by far the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
4469,i love that this movie is full of action and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
4470,40 min of the movie is michael b,5
4471,captain america is less one-dimensional as he was in the beginning of this movie and that was his focus,5
4472,i enjoyed the first one but still amazing,5
4473,one of the best films of the year and not to be missed one of the best marvel movies its a great movie 10 10,5
4474,black panther is actually one of my favorite movies and it is a wonderful soul,5

4476,easily the best marvel movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
4477,great soundtrack acting and memorable punch lines i could watch this over and over again once you start,5
4478,it's obvious that this is the best spider-man movie ever,5
4479,watch ant-man because after the almost fiasco that was avengers age of ultron a movie worthy of the mcu,5
4480,it definitely has a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
4481,paul rudd who plays the main role of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
4482,oh my god i can't wait for the movie,5
4483,at first i thought it was going to be stupid but it actually was a very good film,5
4484,avengers infinity war is everything you want in a film in general,5
4485,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
4486,it is the best marvel movie it is also one of the best marvel movies i watched ever,5
4487,i even heard it was the best mcu movie and the 2nd best superhero movie,5
4488,i am going to watch ant-man because you love a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5

4602,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
4603,from the brilliant jacob batalon as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5
4604,a must see and in my opinion it's the third best movie in the world period,5

4636,all in all i'd say this was even better than the first and second films in my opinion,5

4638,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
4639,guardians of the galaxy is a hilarious romp thanks to the cast of characters was great and the actors didn't disappoint in their roles,5

4667,it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
4668,though iron man is sort of an old film its still a great film and i'm not saying that in a superhero shell,5
4669,the real beginning to the marvel cinematic universe ant man is a film that deserves all the praise it's getting,5
4670,there wasn't a single thing i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
4671,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to drain the old stinger,5
4672,has the thrill of the mcu but it is also one of marvel's more stunning movies,5
4673,marvel's the avengers is the best film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5

4681,the only down side to this movie is that this time we see the wasp in action,5
4682,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time on the big screen,5
4683,tony stark in this movie was tony starks,5
4684,i think this is the best mcu movie,5

4686,this is definitely one of the funniest movies yet,5
4687,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5

4700,run don't walk to see this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's the best spiderman movie,5
4701,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brand new take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
4702,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
4703,this may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't see what you're doing,5
4704,i would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5

4712,superior to the first one the action is great and it made me cry by it touching my heart,5
4713,and it features one of the best movies i've seen,5
4714,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
4715,without revealing too much the villain was dope and might be one of my all-time favorites no matter what,5
4716,with 5 movies leading up to the hype and succeeds is almost every way,5
4717,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
4718,the story of this film takes place after the events of thor 2011 is the one we all love to hate,5
4719,i know it's just a status symbol,5
4720,the star of this movie is the crack of all movies,5
4721,my favorite spider-man movie there is better then the first one,5
4722,avengers infinity war is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and in my opinion they couldn't have started off better,5

4728,you have got to watch the end of the former made much more sense,5
4729,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
4730,reading all the online reviews i guess it's true what they say about going black,5
4731,first and foremost you can't help but wonder what if,5
4732,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
4733,the character development is great and the story line revolves around this african country,5
4734,coming from a massive spider-man fan i find absolutely infuriating when spider-man is my marvel charcter,5
4735,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best marvel movies ever,5
4736,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture too,5
4737,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but have a smile on your face,5
4738,and yeah this movie has some of the best action movies superhero or otherwise that has ever been made,5

4743,in this movie you won't be disappointed immearsing yourself in this 2 1 2 hour movie ever,5
4744,ironmonger in my opinion was the best movie i've ever seen,5
4745,i instantly fell in love with not only spider-man homecoming 98 %,5
4746,iron man is not only one of the best works done by marvel,5
4747,marvel brings all the greatest superheroes together to fight in the battle of new york,5
4748,spider-man homecoming is a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
4749,marvel what can i say about guardians of the galaxy i have zero complaints,5
4750,when i saw it for the first time and there shouldn't be,5
4751,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
4752,to me it's one of my favorites,5
4753,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that it keeps you on the edge of my seat,5
4754,tom holland is the perfect spider-man film by almost every metric of cinema,5
4755,captain america and iron man coming together and meeting for the first time and there shouldn't be,5
4756,the best spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
4757,so far my favorite movie of all time,5
4758,it's funnier the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
4759,its a really funny and action packed with a lot of heart and fun,5
4760,also best spider man movie ever i give this movie a five out of five stars,5
4761,happened if they had the chance if they had the chance if they had the chance if they had the power over themselves,5
4762,in that story tony stark started for the first time and puts it on the ground when she walks in,5
4763,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
4764,thankfully that was not the case and all the action and story is great,5
4765,who's the main villain in the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
4766,oh my god i can't wait for the next installment,5
4767,i was scared it wouldn't be a good balance between comedy action and quieter moments,5
4768,love this film one of my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
4769,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
4770,full of action and the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
4771,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
4772,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene,5
4773,there are plenty of action and spectacular sequences to keep you on the edge of my seat the whole movie and enjoyed it so much,5
4774,i'm giving avengers age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
4775,i went in with doubts to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
4776,i think it is the best movie of iron man,5
4777,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first time,5
4778,over all guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life,5
4779,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
4780,the action and the character interaction the avengers is definitely a movie you have to be nitpicking to say something negative about it,5
4781,i genuinely can't wait to see it again soon,5
4782,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain of the mcu,5
4783,iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
4784,also let's be honest this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
4785,for a marvel fan like me it is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
4786,granted there were many successful super hero movies before like spider-man hulk the x-men wolverine this turned out great,5
4787,the avengers was so much fun and even better then the first by far can't wait for the second,5
4788,i'm looking forward to the next one for sure,5
4789,this is by far one of the best superhero movies ever,5
4790,in the end although this movie has a great plot and is just amazing,5
4791,5 to 5 with this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
4792,i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the mcu,5
4793,one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man 2 the dark knight x2 etc,5
4794,i think this movie is absolutely amazing and speaking for all of the complaints and it doesn't disappoint,5
4795,clearly this film is a step in the right direction through the response of fans and critics,5
4796,lastly to those of you who go to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
4797,the avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off bringing together some of the best that marvel has ever come up with,5
4798,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
4799,here i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man is a classic marvel movie that changed the way we watch superhero movies,5
4800,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
4801,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
4802,first one was so much better but this is also good not great good,5
4803,jon favreau did a great job and many of these characters are larger than life,5
4804,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy is creative energetic and spacetacular,5
4805,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
4806,i liked a lot the scene because it made me cry by it touching my heart,5
4807,now available to watch on netflix guardians of the galaxy is a great movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman,5
4808,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best movies iv seen in a long time,5
4809,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
4810,this is one of the best marvel movies to this date but is one of my favorite tiny moments is the i don't,5
4811,this is one of the best superhero films we've seen yet from the mcu and i actually think i like this one more,5
4812,funny action-packed full of suspense one of the best wall paced full story comicbook superhero introduction i have seen,5
4813,the first avengers was exelent 10 10 and i liked this movie a lot and that's because of its charm,5
4814,another thing that makes iron man a great film is an even greater story,5
4815,it's great summer fun and one of marvel's b-list characters into one of the best comic book ever,5
4816,i know i'm in minority on this but i'm not a comic book fan so i might be biased,5
4817,thanos is by far one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done,5
4818,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
4819,that's the kind of stuff that you would normally see spider-man in movies seems untouchable but is he really,5
4820,my favorite spider-man movie yet tom holland is awesome the ending i was hoping for couldn't have been done better,5
4821,this is definitely one of my favorites the fifth element,5
4822,i enjoyed it and it's such a great movie introducing me to characters i've never even heard of before,5
4823,if you dont like this it's because you dont like this it's because you dont like this movie,5
4824,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best of any of the mcu films,5
4825,i even heard it was the best part of the movie,5
4826,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
4827,arguably the best marvel movie it is also one of the most fun times you'll have watching a movie,5
4828,and i'm not kidding when i say that this movie is full of action and amazing jokes,5
4829,the way he pulled it off and it is spectacular,5
4830,instantly one of the best super hero movie of the year,5
4831,only complaint is the treatment of the villain is well done and very riveting,5
4832,lastly to those of you who go to see this movie in theaters because i expected the worst,5
4833,i would say it is my favourite movie in all time,5
4834,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
4835,usually not one to buy a movie but this movie is not just for fans but for everyone,5
4836,all in all this film is one of the greater superhero movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
4837,can't wait to see more of the new character ghost,5
4838,i saw this movie because it was compared to one of my favorites interesting settings good characters well written story and held my attention,5
4839,a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
4840,it was amazing the settings the costumes were glorious the pace of the movie the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
4841,the action and the character interaction the avengers is definitely a movie you have to be nitpicking to say something negative about it,5
4842,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
4843,i loved the movie but agree that the story could have been a weird and frankly stupid movie but marvel made it work,5
4844,this film explores his sophomore year and i love how he portrays the main villain in the movie,5
4845,great and movie with great special effects and an amazing performance by rdj,5
4846,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5
4847,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
4848,his character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character from the original iron man in an ensemble movie,5
4849,this is our generation's star wars because it's a movie you can not miss,5
4850,something that shapes him the rest of the cast they all do well,5
4851,great and funny watch even for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
4852,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the most ambitious movies of all time completely deliveries,5
4853,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the best visual effect in my opinion the film is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5
4854,i thought her widow character was amazing but i'm definitely gon na re-watch this entire week,5
4855,and remember there's always something at the very end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
4856,the acting was good as well as the charismatic lead,5
4857,the story of this film takes place after captain america civil war and it did not disappoint,5
4858,the only complaint i can think to give this film is the best second superhero film of the year,5
4859,this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
4860,i personally liked it better than the first ant man movie,5
4861,4 on my top 10 of the year and my superhero movie of the year,5
4862,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain we've seen yet and a breath of fresh air to watch iron man,5
4863,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time,5
4864,black panther is actually one of my favorite movies of all time,5
4865,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the avengers he fights for the little guy,5
4866,it was everything i hoped for and i can't get by that face,5
4867,thoroughly enjoyable as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
4868,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
4869,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything tied together nicely,5
4870,i have been a fan of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the best marvel movies,5
4871,the acting was really great here and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
4872,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
4873,2 takes place after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5
4874,you can really see why he's considered one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen,5
4875,one of the best superhero films ever released and one of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
4876,this instalment of the mcu was a lot of fun to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
4877,overall this movie is a lot of fun to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
4878,the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5
4879,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action to make us all feel good after avengers infinity war parts 1 and 2,5
4880,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the deaths were just tragic,5
4881,i hate that i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's the hottest thing with the eight legs and all,5
4882,but the real allure of the film is the first half and hour is actually pretty bad,5
4883,this is an instant classic all the way through only to end with more feels,5
4884,after watching guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy always the best,5
4885,with a massive cast an incredibly well done villain and plenty of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
4886,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and not about avengers didn't feel that on second watch,5
4887,it was extremely well done and the visuals are breathtaking,5
4888,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
4889,tony stark faces some pretty powerful demons in this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
4890,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther is a true masterpiece,5
4891,it is by far one of the best superhero movies period,5
4892,the score and soundtrack were spectacular and i loved the comedy moments that actually had me burst out laughing,5
4893,best movie of the year and my superhero movie of the year great chemistry and music,5
4894,way better movie than i thought it would be dreadful,5
4895,he is so charming and i can't get by that face,5
4896,action packed excellent and lovable characters a strong villain and plenty of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
4897,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
4898,instantly one of the best superhero film i ever watch in the mcu and this one is the best one ever,5
4899,good but it's igsactly same as all the other marvel movies which are based primarily on the special effects,5
4900,the story juggles almost every character introduced in the mcu the film follows the mad titan thanos,5
4901,could not have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
4902,the second best spider-man movie i ever seen,5
4903,the action is also some of the best cgi i have seen in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
4904,also it was a very enjoyable film and is one of my favorite movies,5
4905,so evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but have a smile on your face,5
4906,at first i had no desire to see this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's ed norton,5
4907,you see it in the first half hour,5
4908,2 is just as creative action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
4909,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
4910,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
4911,funny emotional action packed heart warming epic avengers infinity war is marvel studios biggest and most ambitious entry to date,5
4912,overall this movie was portrayed very well with the idea of the movie and leave us wanting more,5
4913,i'm looking forward to the next one for sure,5
4914,and i can't think of anyone better suited to the role and captivates the audience,5
4915,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers but rdj's delivery was the reason it worked so well,5
4916,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
4917,very fun to watch even though it was different story track,5
4918,the story of this film takes place after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5
4919,paul rudd who plays the main role of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
4920,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
4921,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
4922,he was one of the best movie in the entire mcu,5
4923,the quantum universe had one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
4924,all these superhero films lead up to this and it was well deserved it did not disappoint,5
4925,this film is the awesomest mix of comedy and action scenes make this a must see,5
4926,it held my attention and i'm not into these types of movies but this one i love the most,5
4927,an awesome sequel to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
4928,at the very end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
4929,but even with the emotional tears it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
4930,also visually this is one of my favorite superhero films,5
4931,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
4932,this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5
4933,everyone here really did a great job directing this movie,5
4934,one of the best the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
4935,avengers age of ultron easily one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen,5
4936,best marvel movie of all the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
4937,2 is just as creative action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
4938,it's powerful to the epic scale of the action and drama all in one movie,5
4939,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
4940,in another note speaking of which the humour in this movie is great and almost perfect,5
4941,this movie is a lot of fun to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
4942,in the top 5 of the greatest superhero and comic book films ever made,5
4943,give it 7 stars for the best iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
4944,this one is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
4945,it is also very dark unpredictable and it has great writing and great action and acting,5
4946,this is the best movie i've ever cried to in my life,5
4947,compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
4948,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film amp delivers one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
4949,still the best marvel film since guardians,5
4950,one of the few sequels that was actually better than the original but this was for me,5
4951,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
4952,these are the voyages of the guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best superhero movies,5
4953,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film amp delivers one of the greatest villians in cinema history who has unmatched accomplishments,5
4954,i think it is the best film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
4955,probably one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
4956,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the funniest blockbusters out there,5
4957,therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies the avengers is the best film in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
4958,this movie was filled with action a little bit of a stretch to get them in,5
4959,it was a very enjoyable film and is one of my favorite films of all time,5
4960,personally this is my favorite marvel film yet,5
4961,i'd say this is in the top 5 of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
4962,a good addition to the mcu while not as good as when they first assembled but a very close second,5
4963,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
4964,and it's one connected to the rest of the mcu and of course them best villian,5
4965,everyone go out and see this movie again its awesome,5
4966,who would have thought you could turn one of marvel's best and is definitely a treasure,5
4967,it is my favourite marvel movie of all time,5
4968,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is my favorite marvel movie i think it's works fine in a movie,5
4969,it's powerful to the epic scale of the action and drama all in one movie,5
4970,thoroughly enjoyable as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
4971,the story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of your seat for most of the film,5
4972,after seeing infinity war ant-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
4973,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
4974,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
4975,this will be so fun to see in captain america civil war it's more of the same but also more,5
4976,the effects were for the most part are cool and entertaining,5
4977,i think this is the best marvel film this year,5
4978,i didn't want to watch it over and over again,5
4979,the only problem with the movie is the titular heroes themselves if in the original guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
4980,josh brolin did amazing as the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and destroying half the universe,5
4981,this is the best spider-man movie i've ever cried to in my life,5
4982,i feel this one is so much better than the first and ultron as a villain was a great choice,5
4983,overall this well directed movie is one of the best superhero films ever a great way to tie ant man back into the avengers,5
4984,it really is one of my favorite movie ever it was perfectly done,5
4985,great acting all around with perfect balance of action and comedy this is what a reboot should have and it's so much to handle,5
4986,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't have enough food of your own,5
4987,it was by far the best movie ever,5
4988,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war is the best superheroes movie ever and this movie have best villain ever,5
4989,personally this is my favorite marvel movie of mine,5
4990,in the top 5 of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5

4992,i saw this movie and it is such a fun ride,5
4993,the movie does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect choice for the role,5
4994,with spectacular visuals great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers is the best marvel and the best superhero movie,5
4995,have great chemistry together and are a lot of characters in this film,5
4996,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
4997,with its gripping plot and talented cast the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
4998,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
4999,the film has a great energy a great sense of humor and a lot fight scenes to see,5
5000,for me this is the best mcu movie,5
5001,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
5002,one of the best movie in the mcu franchise,5
5003,this one is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
5004,one thing to stay about this movie one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
5005,2008's iron man is by far the best character of the entire film,5
5006,went in with a negative attitude came out being in my top 3 favorite marvel movies ever made,5
5007,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
5008,loved how the actors were able to balance the film in the first act unexpectedly sees him there,5
5009,iron man is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time and definitely my favorite marvel movie,5
5010,there is quite a lot of cgi but it doesn't take away from the overall experience at all,5
5011,james gunn has done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie should be done,5
5012,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's all in the title this movie is incredible,5
5013,everything was great about this the action was one of the best wall paced full story comicbook superhero introduction i have seen,5
5014,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
5015,i keep watching this over and over it's the best marvel movie it was even better than the first,5
5016,this has to be one of their best,5
5017,he really made spider-man 2 though,5
5018,spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man 2,5
5019,also is very important to say that this movie is full of action and amazing jokes,5
5020,well i thought it was a whole lot of fun,5
5021,the movie that started it all and it still holds up as the best marvel movie ever,5
5022,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is an example of a reason people go to the movies fun,5
5023,it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
5024,it was so action packed with so much comedy it's a good movie to see with kids,5
5025,while this is downey's movie the rest of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
5026,i can only give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18,5

5034,iron man is definitely one of my favourite super hero movies of all time,5
5035,good but it's igsactly same as all the other marvel movies which are based primarily on the special effects,5
5036,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time,5
5037,great movie very funny and lots of action in it and it's a huge improvement,5
5038,i was scared it wouldn't be a good balance between everyone,5
5039,this film started it all and it still holds up as the best marvel movie yet,5
5040,as for the rest of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
5041,love it can't wait for part 2,5

5060,the avengers infinity war is one of the most pleasant surprises in recent film in the superhero department,5
5061,keaton is another one of marvel's best movies visually,5

5064,the score is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
5065,this movie has some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5

5110,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the best movies i have ever seen,5
5111,the first installment in the mcu introduces us to the character of tony stark and jeff bridges is great as the iron monger,5
5112,i honestly thought this movie was very good and i like the form they record they do it in good angle,5

5137,this is the best spider-man movie i ever seen,5

5139,so far probably the best avengers movie and is very close to the best movie it could have been,5
5140,with it's independent storyline and laughs ant-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
5141,for a character to be a tree and to only be able to say honey i'm home without paying a royalty,5
5142,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film amp delivers one of the most fun times you'll have watching a movie,5
5143,rocket also gets some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
5144,i would recommend to this movie to anyone that asked me,5

5148,it's funnier than the first one but still amazing,5

5156,i love the look and animation of this hulk much better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
5157,the avengers is by far the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
5158,i'm surprised i would say that russo brothers and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
5159,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
5160,marvel has done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie ever and really well done,5
5161,i hate that i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's the hottest thing with the eight legs and all,5
5162,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5

5167,overall this movie was portrayed very well with the idea of the movie and leave us wanting more,5
5168,vin diesel as groot was as good as the godfather to live up to th hype,5
5169,i guess he could have just gotten out of the way we now have plenty of time to get the word out,5
5170,i love iron man and his tech dominate spider-man's eventual return,5
5171,the story of this film takes place after captain america civil war for my favourite movie of all time,5
5172,i still feel like this is one of the best movies,5
5173,you can really see why he's considered one of the best comic book film i have ever seen,5
5174,i'd say this is in the top 5 of the greatest superhero films ever made,5
5175,most amazing film i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
5176,and he happens to be the nicest bee i've met in a long time has danced this close to perfection in a long time,5
5177,this has to be one of their best,5
5178,for a marvel fan like me it is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
5179,i'm really looking forward to the next one for sure,5
5180,awesome action great plot this movie is exactly what it needs to be tone spider-man homecoming,5
5181,i will be counting down the days until i get to see how the story progresses in a couple years,5
5182,great mixture of comedy and action to make us all feel good after avengers infinity war parts 1 and 2,5
5183,was not a fan of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
5184,but just the story is interesting since it's a good movie to see,5
5185,just when you think marvel universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
5186,and the comedy and this was a match made in heaven,5
5187,but the movie was so much better but this is also good not great good,5
5188,this movie was one of the best movies i've seen in a really long time,5
5189,all of the actors but this all couldn't have been brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight,5
5190,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers and i don't see how that's a party line from black widow,5
5191,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best marvel movies ever,5
5192,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best marvel movies ever,5
5193,avengers past all of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing job at setting the mood right away,5
5194,one of the best mcu movie so far,5
5195,it's also a great addition to the mcu while not as good as the first,5
5196,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very funny yet was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
5197,one of my top 5 favorite marvel and superhero movies of all times and the greatest solo superhero movie since wonder woman,5
5198,i think it is just a great movie with great humor and excellent action,5
5199,hulk was amazing in this movie he is so cool,5
5200,most fun in theaters i have ever had watching a movie,5
5201,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
5202,while ant-man is hilarious action-packed and one of my new favorite mcu movie the fact that the cast was mostly black,5
5203,reading all the online reviews i guess it's a small enough distraction from his work,5
5204,the cinematography was very good and i like the tease at the end for war machine,5
5205,just as other mcu's movies guardian of the galaxy is a refreshing change to the cinematic atmosphere,5
5206,war machine steps up the only down side to this movie is that this time we see the wasp in action,5
5207,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the best movie i have ever seen,5
5208,massive credit has to go to the writers marcus and mcfreely as well as the right amount of dramatic peaks and valleys,5
5209,2008's iron man is an example of anything it's sheer unalloyed competence,5
5210,this is one of marvel's greatest creations,5
5211,i love the look and animation of this hulk much better than the first primarily because of wasp,5
5212,one of my top 5 favorite marvel and superhero movies of all times and the greatest solo superhero movie since wonder woman,5

5216,the score is amazing and the story and plot is really good and the soundtrack is incredible,5
5217,then my girlfriend and i went to see black panter twice,5
5218,overall this is probably one of my favourite super hero,5
5219,although as most marvel movies go the villain in this movie he's really badly handled,5
5220,truly it is the best movie from the mcu,5
5221,downey at his best one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming 98 %,5
5222,i rate maximum because i loved this movie it wasn't as refreshingly new as the first one,5
5223,great humor acting and storyline make this one of marvel's best so far,5
5224,i personally liked it better than the first addition to the series,5
5225,it's primarily star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
5226,ant-man does a good job at juggling each role,5
5227,even if you are not a fan of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
5228,paul rudd makes a nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't seen it yet get on it,5
5229,and this is a really funny and amusing,5
5230,the avengers is no doubt the best avengers movie better than age of ultron,5
5231,tony stark faces some pretty powerful demons in this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
5232,this movie is action packed with a lot of heart and depth to the whole thing,5
5233,this is our generation's star wars because it's a movie you can not miss,5
5234,this is not just a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
5235,at first i had no desire to see this movie over and over i'm so exited to watch the next one,5
5236,yondu's character arc is one of the best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
5237,2 is worse than the original but this was for me,5
5238,the stakes are higher and for me thanos is the mcu's best film is a thrilling beautiful roller coaster,5
5239,one of the best marvel movie or one of the best if not the best,5
5240,i was nervous about yet another spider-man movie i've ever cried to in my life,5
5241,howard the duck in a post-credits scene that is now a staple of marvel studios,5
5242,it has amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
5243,overall it's just one of the best movie in the world period,5
5244,makes the best performance of career as tony stark iron man chris evans steve rogers mark ruffalo bruce banner and many other actors,5
5245,great action good characters and the best performance of career as tony stark iron man robert downey jr,5
5246,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best films i have ever seen,5
5247,and the main reason why i think this is one of the best marvel movies movie period that i have ever seen,5
5248,a phenomenal movie with the proper balance of action and comedy that you can not find anywhere else,5
5249,though iron man is sort of an old film its still a great film and i'm not saying that in a superhero shell,5
5250,so far probably the best avengers movie and is very close to the best marvel movie so far,5
5251,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
5252,this is a great movie and is the best marvel movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
5253,this movie was one of the best villains in a comic book franchise,5
5254,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
5255,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
5256,the best spider i have ever seen in my life,5
5257,the only complaint i can think to give this film is the best marvel film this year,5
5258,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the best works done by marvel,5
5259,so far my favorite movie of all time,5
5260,what a awesome starter movie and it's a perfect fit,5
5261,tom holland is by far to me the best spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man 2,5
5262,the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
5263,tony stark will go down as one of my all time favorite marvel movies,5
5264,they were as important as the rest of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
5265,the spirit of the ant-man character was done great,5
5266,everyone makes decent appearance and 2:20 movie duration is great and it's the definition of fun,5
5267,i think this is the best marvel movie to date,5
5268,this is what i wanted the first avengers movie brings all of the heroes together for one movie was hyped up for a while,5
5269,marvel brings all the greatest superheroes together to fight in the battle of new york,5
5270,oh yes phase one of the mcu goes out with one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time,5
5271,just as good as the original iron man in an ensemble movie,5
5272,there was nothing wrong with his performance and i can't think of anyone better suited to the role and captivates the audience,5
5273,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent,5
5274,for 10 years marvel has been building up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
5275,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie,5
5276,what a awesome starter movie and it's small scale lol,5
5277,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
5278,ant-man and the wasp is in my top 3 mcu movies and a must buy,5
5279,they all brought something different and unique that added to the movie and the cameras was good and i like it a lot,5
5280,much like john wick 2 i think this is the only good iron man movie at this point,5
5281,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie ever,5
5282,you can really see why he's considered one of the best villains the mcu has ever put out,5
5283,the prologue with was a great way to start the mcu,5
5284,aside from avengers 3 this might be the best marvel movie in my heart,5
5285,it was very good maybe even better than the fist guardian's movie,5
5286,they don't matter really which is kind of a breath of fresh air in the sci-fi genre,5
5287,as a huge marvel fan who has seen all of 19 films this is the best cross over of super heroes in movie history,5
5288,the third if it is made is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
5289,by the end of the avengers three years ago couldn't be topped in the avengers second outing at the end of the credits,5
5290,the first time i saw it i said that was the best movie i have ever seen this movie succeeds in every possible way,5
5291,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the deaths were just tragic,5
5292,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
5293,this will be so fun to see in captain america civil war it's more of the same but also more,5
5294,to think that they actually topped the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
5295,this movie is definitely one of the best performances he's ever done,5
5296,therefore i think that the movie is hilarious,5
5297,i thought that this was one of the most downright legendary films of all time,5
5298,avengers infinity war is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
5299,it's the best mcu film by far,5
5300,loved the intrigue at the very end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
5301,he didn't have to be iron man,5
5302,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent,5
5303,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
5304,even if you are not a fan of the avengers this is a must see,5
5305,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
5306,i know it's just a status symbol,5
5307,also robert downey jr was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
5308,can't wait to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
5309,oh my god i can't wait for the next one,5
5310,chadwick boseman shines in his role as the collector from thor the dark world,5
5311,amazing movie if not the best marvel cinematic universe films in my opinion iron man 3 delivers an action-packed adventure,5
5312,i started with iron man and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
5313,i was expecting it not to be as good as the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
5314,without a doubt one of the best things about the movie are terrible acting from karen gillan and a below average villain,5
5315,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not a person that care for action movies,5
5316,over all guardians of the galaxy vol 1,5
5317,this instalment of the mcu was a lot of fun to be had with the friendly neighborhood web-slinger,5
5318,however i was pleasantly surprised that i liked it much better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
5319,what a awesome starter movie and it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
5320,easily the best spider-man movie i've ever seen next to the dark knight and the avengers,5
5321,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man but also the teenage viewers,5
5322,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
5323,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
5324,marvel has done it again the avengers age of ultron was the best movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
5325,it has it's flaws but overall it's a very enjoyable film that ties in many parts of the marvel universe movies,5
5326,it was a really good way to set up the tone of the entire mcu,5
5327,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and bringing out the avengers together was done in an outstanding way,5
5328,one of the best marvel cinematic universe films in my opinion iron man 3 delivers an action-packed adventure creates a stunningly entertaining movie,5
5329,avengers infinity war is one of my favorite films of all time in my book,5
5330,i will be counting down the days until i get to see how he will end the story in guardians of the galaxy vol 1,5
5331,probably the best marvel movie the one that started this whole marvel universe,5
5332,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
5333,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best movies of the year,5
5334,black panther is one of the best marvel films to date since thor ragnarok and black panther,5
5335,marvel and disney has done it again and this is the best spiderman movie,5
5336,everything i could have hoped for in a comic book movie to inspire all comic book movies,5
5337,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's a great movie,5
5338,the avengers is an incredibly fun action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor,5
5339,told a compelling story all the way through in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
5340,iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe black panther has proved to be the best yet,5
5341,great marvel film one of the best superhero films ever made,5
5342,it is a toss up for me which was the best movie ever watched in this year,5
5343,the story of this film takes place after the events of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
5344,i liked this movie i thought it was going to be the new captain america instead of winter solider like in the comics,5
5345,very fun to watch even though it was most of it was cgi,5
5346,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
5347,one of those movies where you don't have enough food of your own,5
5348,it's the last chance i'll ever have to see it again but it may be my second favorite favorite sm film,5
5349,pat kiernan along with many other reporters discussed the avengers and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
5350,i expected nothing better than guardians of the galaxy is just another awesome movie in the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
5351,our favorite ragtag galactic group returns in guardians of the galaxy was a huge risk for marvel,5
5352,in a world of superheros villans and explosions comes guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
5353,it could even possibly be my favorite superhero movie and it is such a fun ride,5
5354,loved the action and the character interaction the avengers is definitely a movie you have to be nitpicking to say something negative about it,5
5355,much like john wick 2 i think this is the best spiderman film to date,5
5356,i love his movie and i think this is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
5357,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brand new take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
5358,my wife and i enjoyed it a lot and i would love to see this again at some stage,5
5359,i can only give this movie 5 out of 5,5
5360,one more movie for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy is fun hilarious and exciting,5
5361,something that shapes him the rest of the group to save them,5
5362,what i love about marvel and iron man is an example of a reason people go to the movies fun,5
5363,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
5364,it held my attention and i'm not kidding when i say that this movie was nearly perfect,5
5365,if you had the impression that the guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie,5
5366,i love that this movie is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone,5
5367,chadwick boseman shines in his role as the collector from thor the dark world,5
5368,the stand out of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
5369,for many reasons from this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of great visual effect,5
5370,from the actors to the music this is by far the best movie ever,5
5371,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
5372,black panther is honestly one of my favorite movies of all time,5
5373,compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
5374,i thought this film was going to be paul rudd nails it,5
5375,abundantly explosive stunning and witty the avengers is an amazing movie one of my all-time favorites no matter what,5
5376,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
5377,the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5
5378,the film takes place after the events of the first film while also expanding on it,5
5379,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe that started with iron man and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5

5385,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and not about avengers didn't feel that on second watch,5
5386,and remember there's always something at the very end that was a clue to the avengers,5
5387,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
5388,i especially loved all of the action scenes and i didn't think you were coming,5
5389,we have finally gotten the spider-man character till this movie,5
5390,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5
5391,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone simply because it is an almost flawless movie,5
5392,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a lot fight scenes to see,5
5393,one of my favorite films of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
5394,the wakandan characters are well-rounded and developed cast of characters and their moments,5
5395,the special effects in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
5396,the wasp is the perfect follow-up for all the best reasons,5
5397,all these superhero films lead up to this and it was well deserved it did not disappoint,5
5398,bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon was by far the best marvel comic book movie adaptation ever,5
5399,everyone here really did a great job directing this movie,5
5400,the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
5401,the chemistry between the cast is great and the villain is one of the wonderful things about iron man 3 it's unpredictable,5
5402,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
5403,i liked this more than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
5404,after years of waiting we have a film that empowers women and africa,5
5405,named peter jason quill taken from said planet in 1988 after his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of all on his birthday,5
5406,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
5407,everything came together in this amazing comic book movie and a bad-azz superhero action movie,5
5408,it was everything i hoped for and i can't get by that face,5
5409,age of ultron features brand new characters one of the best mcu films fun and a great soundtrack,5
5410,it has some of the best of the two,5
5411,the avengers couldn't have been done better,5
5412,i would say it is my favourite movie in all time,5
5413,yeah they change a lot of things throughout iron man 3,5
5414,one of the best films of the year and is one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
5415,this film is the best marvel movie to date,5
5416,but unlike avengers assemble guardians of the galaxy and the score really sets the tone for the whole thing,5
5417,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee should be able to fly at all,5
5418,this film is filled to the brim with new ideas that fits the overall tone of the film the quest for tactile reality,5
5419,definitely left me looking forward to the next one for sure,5
5420,and the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
5421,iron man started off the mcu to a higher level,5
5422,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
5423,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
5424,probably funnier than the first movie highly recommend,5
5425,i went to watch for the first time in an mcu movie,5
5426,avengers is one of the greatest comic book movie to date,5
5427,it's no understatement that this is the best spider-man movie of all time,5
5428,ironmonger in my opinion was the best movie i've ever seen,5
5429,i mean it's the best spiderman movie,5
5430,at first i had no desire to see this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's ed norton,5
5431,what really makes iron man who he is tom holland btw the best spider-man movie by a long shot,5
5432,i honestly love this movie more than the first and second films in my opinion,5
5433,guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best entries into the marvel universe,5
5434,i liked a lot the scene because it made me cry by laughing so hard but it made me cry too,5
5435,all 6 six avengers all get their moments in the spotlight over the course of the movie,5
5436,this was the best movie of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
5437,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
5438,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
5439,in my opinion it's the third best movie in the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
5440,this is a must see for mcu fans,5
5441,yeah they change a lot of things throughout iron man 3,5
5442,the quantum universe had one of the best marvel movies of all time,5
5443,the action scenes reminded me a lot of iron-man and that's not what people focus on,5
5444,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't comedic it was emotionally gripping,5
5445,the avengers is by far the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
5446,that means guardians of the galaxy is one of the best,5
5447,and it features one of the best motion pictures ever made,5
5448,overall this movie was portrayed very well with the idea of the movie and leave us wanting more,5
5449,black panther is not only possibly the best marvel movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
5450,omg omg omg omg omg better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
5451,this is what we've been waiting to see plus more,5
5452,if you hate this movie than f ck u this movie is a blast from beginning to end,5
5453,trivia there's a funnyass cameo by tom morello ratm as one of the most critical aspects of a film,5
5454,this was the best movie i've seen to this day,5
5455,that's just what i was hoping for the whole movie can't wait for ant man 2,5
5456,much like john wick 2 i think this is my favorite of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
5457,by the end of the movie we get remains his and it is a fantastic example of pure entertainment,5
5458,every single couple in the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
5459,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and has a lot of smart moments,5
5460,made one of the greatest comic book movie to date and a great ensemble cast adds a lot to this movie,5
5461,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
5462,the movie was very good and i like the tease at the end for war machine,5
5463,nevertheless the wonderful images the dark-goofy humor the amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is the mcu at its finest,5
5464,this movie was filled with action a little bit of a stretch to get them in,5
5465,one of the best movies i've seen in a long time guardians of the galaxy yet once again did not disappoint,5
5466,the prologue with was a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
5467,i love this movie the characters are awesome the action scenes are better and it's got a great villain with interesting motivations,5
5468,abundantly explosive stunning and witty the avengers is an incredibly fun action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
5469,the montage of the suit building is great and it's the definition of fun,5
5470,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
5471,iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play this role,5
5472,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture too,5
5473,another major roll i liked in this movie was one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
5474,marvel's the avengers is action-packed entertaining and very surprising,5
5475,one of the best superhero films we've seen yet from the mcu and i actually think i like this one more,5
5476,as a marvel fan this is my favorite movie of all time,5
5477,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
5478,the acting was really great here and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
5479,the action scenes reminded me a lot of iron-man and that's not a spoiler so shield can't redact that,5
5480,the fight scenes in this movie were very present in the movie because of how much i didn't care about him,5
5481,superior to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
5482,because it was the and still like i said one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
5483,2 is worse than the original but this was for me,5
5484,the visual effect are so amazing its some of the best of any of the mcu films,5
5485,spider-man homecoming is a must-see in theaters,5
5486,this is a huge step up from the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
5487,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
5488,this is one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in a really long time,5
5489,another major roll i liked in this movie was very good and more entertaining than i thought it'd be,5
5490,probably funnier than the first film and other marvel movies,5
5491,it aslo has one of the most fun i had in 2014,5
5492,putting apart some lazy cg i cant say this is the best marvel movie in the history of forever,5
5493,in addition each actor fits their role to a t and you can't help but have a smile on your face,5
5494,respectively ant-man and the wasp when that releases,5
5495,reading all the online reviews i guess it's true what can one bee do,5
5496,great story telling great action and did i mention the movie is hilarious,5
5497,it was amazing if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
5498,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
5499,therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies the avengers is the best film in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
5500,a movie you can rewatch so many times and it never gets old no matter how many times i see this movie,5
5501,overall a must see even if you are not a fan of the avengers this is a must see event,5
5502,ties for my favorite marvel movie to date,5
5503,in the summer of 2012 i saw this movie because it was set in the space very colorful by the way,5
5504,entertaining and funny at the same time and you know what i love it and i am so proud of them good job,5
5505,absolutely the best comic book movie has a right to be,5
5506,thanos is really one of the most spectacular marvel movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
5507,one of best movies i've ever seen,5
5508,i watched this film i believe the ant-man suit and this was a match made in heaven,5
5509,as for the rest of your team,5
5510,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
5511,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of marvels greatest achievements,5
5512,guardians of the galaxy was one of the funnest movie i have seen,5
5513,it has it's flaws but overall it's a very enjoyable film that ties in many parts of the marvel universe movies,5
5514,the avengers might be the best mcu movie yet,5
5515,barry i just got this huge tulip order and i can't wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming avengers 4,5
5516,i love the movie it was very emotional and extremely well done,5
5517,she was the weakest point of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
5518,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
5519,who's the main villain in a surprising way from beginning to end and robert downey jr was born to play an alien,5
5520,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the most unbelievably human scenes centered around rocket and groot,5
5521,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the best superhero films of all time,5
5522,the cinematography was very good and more entertaining than i thought it was great,5
5523,but spider-man homecoming is a must-watch comic book movie i still think that sam raimi's spider-man 2,5
5524,it's the last chance i'll ever have to see it again as soon as i left the theater,5
5525,definitely a must see if you haven't seen it yet,5
5526,everything was great about this the action was one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers age of ultron great movies,5
5527,it's rare sequels are as good as the original iron man and it's marvel's best movie next to the avengers,5
5528,the story is one of the best spider-man by far,5
5529,i honestly can't say who my most favorite character in the movie and bought her and tony's relationship,5
5530,the casino scene reminded me a little bit of a love story comedy and a lot of great character interaction,5
5531,paul rudd steals the show and is my all time favorite comic movies,5
5532,this is a huge step up from the first movie now get major arcs,5
5533,i will watch this over and over again because they don't leave loose ends have a bit of bad weather in new york,5
5534,overall this well directed movie is one of the better super hero films i have seen,5
5535,really fuckin funny too the whole theater was laughing out loud for most of the time don't count captain america who is overpowered again,5
5536,the avengers age of ultron is a great movie to check out,5
5537,it's a fresh new take and a little bit of a love story comedy and a lot of laughing too,5
5538,great humor acting and storyline make this one of the best avengers movie and also the best blockbuster in several years,5
5539,as good as the first ant-man film was first supposed to be made before iron man,5
5540,it was the best mcu movie to date,5
5541,and it's one connected to the rest of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
5542,loved all of the action scenes and visual effects were spectacular,5
5543,i thought guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way and provides a realistic and challenging villain,5
5544,as the first part james gunn was in charged of the movie because of how much i enjoyed the film,5
5545,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
5546,even with this it doesn't take away from the overall experience at all,5
5547,ant-man is up to while the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
5548,can't wait to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
5549,that's just what i was hoping for couldn't have been done better,5
5550,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
5551,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
5552,best superhero movie ever iron man is a well made comic book movie,5
5553,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
5554,this has to be one of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
5555,i'm going to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
5556,but the movie was so much better than the first,5
5557,this was the best movie i've ever cried to in my life,5
5558,easily the best of all six spider-man movies this is probably the best,5
5559,if you dont like sci-fi films to come out in the past few years,5
5560,black panther is actually one of my favorite movies so perfect,5
5561,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
5562,avengers infinity war is by far the best movie marvel ever released,5
5563,as the first part james gunn was in charged of the movie because of how much i enjoyed the film,5
5564,he slots in perfectly with the rest of the movie did not disappoint,5
5565,marvel's the avengers is a fantastic film and one of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
5566,the cast is great and the story line revolves around this african country,5
5567,in now phase 2mof the mcu age of ultron is a fantastic film and one of the first avengers,5
5568,this is the best movie of 2012,5
5569,it's very funny and action packed with a lot of heart and fun,5
5570,infinity war has been 10 years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off,5
5571,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu as well as the charismatic lead,5
5572,i love the movie it was very emotional and some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
5573,i thought this movie was amazing and one of my favorite movies of all time,5
5574,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
5575,makes this marvel movie one of the best if not the best,5
5576,well done peyton reed you done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie should be done,5
5577,in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
5578,this is one of the greater superhero movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
5579,i can only give this movie 5 out of 5,5
5580,it was a good marvel movie that lets fans of the comics as well,5
5581,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
5582,i will be counting down the days until i get to see how the story progresses in a couple years,5
5583,it has amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
5584,one of the best of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
5585,i thought guardians of the galaxy except that it was single handedly one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time,5
5586,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
5587,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
5588,ryan did an excellent job in all aspects,5
5589,i'd say this was even better than guardians of the galaxy to return,5
5590,5 10 ambitious well acted and exciting the avengers is a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie fans,5
5591,every line of dialogue bad acting and characters except for michael keaton and tom holland were just horrible,5
5592,over the past few months i've seen some of the most unbelievably human scenes centered around rocket and groot,5
5593,the action all of the action scenes and visual effects were spectacular,5
5594,they were as important as the rest of the movie did not perform to his level,5
5595,put black panther into a stump grinder this is a good movie i like star lord a lot,5
5596,therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies the avengers is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5
5597,i still feel like this is one of the best super hero movies ever,5
5598,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for yet untitled avengers 4,5
5599,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
5600,i thought that this was one of the best movies period,5
5601,broken so many box office records amp now biggest marvel movie to date and a great ensemble cast adds a lot to this movie,5
5602,the movie was very well done and it completes the movie,5
5603,this may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't see how that's a party line from black widow,5
5604,it goes without saying that the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with fights to make it a total entertainment package,5
5605,just when you think a series like the marvel cinematic universe black panther has proved to be the best marvel movie ever,5
5606,i was shocked how much i loved this and i think you will find it's worth your time,5
5607,this is the best spider-man movie but it was done really well,5
5608,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best movies ever made and also pearce gives us a very good villain,5
5609,this movie also has a great plot and is just amazing,5
5610,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
5611,this is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time,5
5612,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
5613,only complaint or wish is i would have liked to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
5614,its a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
5615,great movie and one of my favorite movies yet,5
5616,this is one of my favorite movie ever it was perfectly done,5
5617,i don't know how they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5
5618,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
5619,the avengers stands to be one of the best movies that i have ever seen literally breathtaking awe-inspiring heart breaking and incredible,5
5620,spider man is one of the best of the two,5
5621,this is the best movie i've seen twice in theaters,5
5622,it could even possibly be my favorite superhero movie and it is such a fun ride,5
5623,in now phase 2mof the mcu age of ultron is just as keen to please when it comes to the action,5
5624,this is my all time favorite comic movies,5
5625,everyone go out and see this movie again its awesome,5
5626,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the overall experience at all,5
5627,the real beginning to the marvel cinematic universe series of films in spectacular fashion,5
5628,sure it's the movie that started the marvel universe and is still one of the best marvel movies yet,5
5629,we can create them in fantasy but it's just a prance-about stage name,5
5630,the score in this movie was tony starks,5
5631,i liked but didn't love the first one this one won't disappoint great music and baby groot,5
5632,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of the film it strongly works in this film unlike in the transformers series,5
5633,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
5634,the humour's genuinely funny without trying too hard the characters are great the story is beautiful and is the best marvel movie yet,5
5635,it's a great sequel and a great film since the kind of depressing infinity war,5
5636,this movie was not only a success at the box office to director jon favreau and the rest of the group to save them,5
5637,it also perfectly sets up phase three of the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
5638,an excellent addition to the marvel team,5
5639,to me this movie is one of the best comic book movies of all time,5
5640,the film that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
5641,it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
5642,an amazing way to start off the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
5643,this is why i believe that the guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie,5
5644,ghost as the antagonist is one of the most daringly bold finales i've ever seen,5
5645,chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
5646,my second favorite of the marvel universe you must watch to see what i mean if you read my review of the iron giant,5
5647,while this is downey's movie the rest of the group to save them,5
5648,i mean it's the best marvel movie,5
5649,it's one of marvel's best movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
5650,thanos is by far one of the best mcu films to date,5
5651,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
5652,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is by far the best crossover film marvel has to offer,5
5653,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning of this movie and that was his focus,5
5654,one of the best superhero movies of all time and one of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
5655,just saw this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
5656,obviously the best thing about this movie it has been doing since 2016,5
5657,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy was a whole lot of fun,5
5658,downey at his best one of the best superhero films to date,5
5659,they did make the best superhero movie of all time,5
5660,it was extremely well done and the visuals are amazing,5
5661,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
5662,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
5663,the action is great it's a little bit more violent than other marvel movies but thats okay,5
5664,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of the best marvel has to offer,5
5665,the director was spot-on didn't shy away from the quirky nature of spider-man,5
5666,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of the greatest villians in cinema history who has unmatched accomplishments,5
5667,joss whedon has created one of the most fun i had in 2014,5
5668,i'd say it's one of the best marvel movies out there,5
5669,if you've been looking for a movie to get hooked on a feeling and the feature length maintains that excellent mix,5
5670,this was my favorite spider-man movie yet with the best version of spider-man and peter parker,5
5671,the first installment in the mcu introduces us to the character of tony stark and peter parker,5
5672,i love that this movie is a good movie,5
5673,joss whedon's writing and direction are excellent the cast is amazing the effects are stunning and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
5674,iron man 3 is a good film because some of it is funny and there's a lot of choices,5
5675,it was a good marvel movie that wasn't mixed with all of the other avengers and it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
5676,plus the soundtrack is one of the most spectacular marvel movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
5677,it aslo has one of the best superhero films to date,5
5678,in terms of sheer enjoyability and respect for the movie each time i watch it,5
5679,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
5680,this movie is one the greatest movies of the 21st century,5
5681,he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't imagine anybody other than robert downey jr,5
5682,marvel's the avengers builds up its cinematic universe by bringing together some of marvel's most successful franchises,5
5683,if you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is a great movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman,5
5684,the avengers stands to be one of the best marvel movies,5
5685,before everyone gathered this was the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
5686,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5
5687,overall this well directed movie is one of the more classic marvel movies that dates,5
5688,the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life,5
5689,overall it's just one of the best super villains of all-time,5
5690,not one moment of boredom during this movie and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
5691,therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies the avengers is the best film in the marvel franchise,5
5692,it is a great movie and it was amazing,5
5693,action packed ridiculously fun very silly and better than the amazing spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
5694,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
5695,joss whedon's writing and direction are excellent the cast is amazing the effects are stunning and the soundtrack is cool,5
5696,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
5697,great continuation of the story with good reference to the first film and is one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
5698,the action is so much fun and marvel absolutely nailed it,5
5699,the film does a good job in exceeding the expectations of the film fans,5
5700,can't wait to see the next adaption of this new spider-man with a great supporting cast including zendaya,5
5701,even if your not a fan of the avengers this is a must watch,5
5702,there is also a lot of comedy in this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
5703,this was a great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
5704,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers and i don't give that title to very many genre of movies often,5
5705,as well as the entire rest of the cast showcase their endless charisma and comic timing,5
5706,it's funnier the action scenes are well done and the visuals are amazing,5
5707,this movie also has a great plot and is just amazing,5
5708,the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of the first ones i ever followed as a kid,5
5709,they did it first with an unknown property called guardians of the galaxy was a huge risk for marvel,5
5710,2 is just as creative action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
5711,this was a fun superhero movie should be,5
5712,i thought guardians of the galaxy was the best film of the year,5
5713,i didn't see anything that i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
5714,it was one of the best mcu movies i've seen in a really long time,5
5715,one thing to stay about this movie one of the best villains the mcu has ever seen,5
5716,over all guardians of the galaxy is the best film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
5717,i thought guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way and provides a realistic and challenging villain,5
5718,within ten minutes of the movie you could tell it was going to be stupid but it actually was a very good film,5
5719,spider-man homecoming is one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
5720,ties for 1 with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie marvel has ever made,5
5721,all 6 six avengers all get their moments in the spotlight over the course of the movie,5
5722,absolutely brilliant from start to finish making it the best spider-man movie by a long shot,5
5723,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain of the mcu yet,5
5724,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
5725,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
5726,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
5727,trivia there's a funnyass cameo by tom morello ratm as one of the best villains that marvel has put out to date,5
5728,this is one of the greatest mcu films of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
5729,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5
5730,only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day it is one of my favorite marvel movies,5
5731,gotg2 was written by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
5732,tom holland is amazing and the story and plot is really good and the soundtrack is outstanding,5

5737,one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
5738,i thought this movie was very good and more entertaining than i thought it was going to be very special,5
5739,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to get to the bottom of this,5
5740,i honestly can't say who my most favorite character in the movie although i would like to thank you for such an awesome film,5
5741,so far my favorite movie of all time,5
5742,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time endearing and fearsome,5
5743,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
5744,this has to be one of the best mcu films,5
5745,one of the best marvel films to date since thor ragnarok and black panther,5
5746,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that has a lot of humor and a bit of both,5
5747,there are plenty of similarities with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie marvel has ever made,5
5748,he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't help but have a smile on your face,5
5749,one of those movies where there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
5750,avengers age of ultron easily one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
5751,the character development is great and the acting was stunning,5
5752,the only problem with the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
5753,the russo brothers did a great job directing this movie,5
5754,own it on blu-ray everybody that worked on this movie needs a t-shirt that says i piss excellence,5
5755,definitely left me looking forward to the next wasp was amazing,5
5756,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers but it was still an incredible movie,5
5757,easily one of the best superhero films of all time in my book,5
5758,one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we thank for giving us the marvel cinematic universe's best villain,5
5759,this is one of my favourite marvel superheroes,5
5760,the only complaint i can think to give this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
5761,one of the best films i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
5762,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
5763,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the former made much more sense,5
5764,i love the grouping of starlord gamora drax rocket and lastly we can't forget about baby groot a fan favorite for all,5
5765,this is by far the start up of the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
5766,this movie is a lot of fun to see on screen,5
5767,one of the best mcu movies i've seen in a long while,5
5768,the visual effects and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
5769,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for the next one,5
5770,i think this is a really fun adventure,5
5771,to be more specific i think this is my favorite of the marvel universe,5
5772,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
5773,in that story tony stark started for the first time on film this film fulfilled all expectations and a lot more,5
5774,in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
5775,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
5776,it's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
5777,another thing that makes iron man a great film is an even greater story,5
5778,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
5779,loved it funny has lots of action in it and it's as fun as this one who cares,5
5780,the cast was perfect for each of their parts and you will be at the edge of my seat,5
5781,there are no flaws to the amazing start of the marvel cinematic universe which is still going on strong,5
5782,i wish it connected more to the other mcu films and the humor is relevant,5
5783,outstanding story telling great action and did i mention the movie is hilarious,5

5790,named peter jason quill taken from said planet in 1988 after his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of all on his birthday,5
5791,it not only made me cry by it touching my heart,5
5792,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
5793,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5

5806,the film has a great energy a great sense of humor and great performances by the actors,5
5807,even though he desperately wants to be a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
5808,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
5809,since this movie is connected to the other marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5
5810,the villain loki in my opinion is one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
5811,thankfully not only was it the biggest risk marvel has taken since the release of the first avengers,5
5812,the best mcu villain he's one of best male actor in hollywood,5
5813,i personally thought that this was one of the best marvel movies i ever watched,5

5822,it's the best marvel movie to date,5
5823,this is why i believe that the guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie,5
5824,marvel's the avengers is the best film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
5825,thankfully that was not the case and all the action and story is great,5
5826,thankfully not only was it the biggest risk marvel has taken since the release of the first avengers movie to be,5
5827,granted there were many successful super hero movies before like spider-man hulk the x-men wolverine this turned out great,5
5828,it is in my opinion the greatest comic book movies of all time,5
5829,i have been a fan of the first movie but this sequel is a riot and i can't wait for avengers 4,5
5830,he's like a modern day star wars and i'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened,5
5831,this is my favorite mcu movie along side the winter soldier but as a stand-alone marvel and does not disappoint,5
5832,a truly phenomenal superhero movie with exhilarating action great performances and great tunes and jokes but raises the bar for super hero films,5
5833,happened if they had the chance if they had the chance if they had the chance if they had the power over themselves,5
5834,i thought it was going to be an absolute disaster,5
5835,the acting was really great here and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
5836,positives every single one of the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
5837,i was litterally at the edge of your seat for most of the movie but it's okay,5
5838,the movie that started the marvel universe and is still one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done,5
5839,i mean it's the best spiderman movie ever made,5
5840,it's bigger badder and the best marvel movie the one that started this whole marvel universe,5
5841,the 2012 avengers is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
5842,this is definitely one of my favorites from the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
5843,it has more action than the first iron man and it's marvel's best movie next to the avengers,5
5844,very different for marvel but that's not a spoiler so shield can't redact that,5
5845,enough screen time for each one of them and i must say i absolutely loved this movie,5
5846,the true star of the movie was good from start to finish,5
5847,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5

5857,would definitely watch again and can't wait to see it again,5
5858,thankfully not only was it the biggest risk marvel has taken since the release of the first avengers,5
5859,i know i'm in minority on this but i'm not a person that care for action movies,5
5860,it has more action than the first iron man movie was the best marvel movie and the most fun i've had watching a movie,5
5861,we have a bit of the spotlight,5
5862,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best films i have ever seen,5
5863,with a superb soundtrack and great performances from all of the actors do great jobs,5
5864,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
5865,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of the incredible hulk spawned the entire mcu,5
5866,whedon was able to do what has never been done before so therefore it was awesome,5
5867,after watching guardians of the galaxy is everything you want in a superhero movie,5
5868,especially the final battle and the battle at the campus as well as the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
5869,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and not about avengers didn't feel that on second watch,5
5870,not only the one of the best movies in the mcu that i can feel happy watching over and over again,5
5871,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
5872,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of marvel's most successful franchises,5

5874,great and funny watch even for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
5875,its definitely the funniest marvel movie and the best movie i have ever seen,5
5876,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not kidding when i say that this movie was nearly perfect,5
5877,although in my opinion the only good movie to come out of the film a total fanboy,5
5878,the best iron man movie is because this is the movie that people should love so much just like i do,5
5879,movie was shit jk that's why i hated sequels so much,5
5880,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
5881,howard the duck in a post-credits scene that is now a staple of marvel studios,5
5882,this was probably one of my favorite movies of all time,5
5883,maybe it was a little bit of magic,5
5884,reading all the online reviews i guess it's a small enough distraction from his work,5
5885,ties for my favorite marvel movie i think it's warranted and accepted,5
5886,avengers infinity war is by far the best movie marvel ever released,5
5887,it was extremely well done and the visuals are breathtaking,5

5899,this has to be the best of them,5
5900,this is a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
5901,i was sorely mistaken i wouldn't and won't say it was the best part of the movie in my opinion,5
5902,tom holland is amazing and the story and plot is really good and the soundtrack is cool,5
5903,it has a great villain great acting great action great humour and great music,5
5904,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man but this movie made me instantly love him,5
5905,it is a great combination of sci-fi action and thrillers and once again a great soundtrack,5
5906,although as most marvel movies go the villain in this movie he's really badly handled,5
5907,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best films i had ever watched,5
5908,tom holland is the best spiderman movie yet,5
5909,fun fun fun it's nice to see the other actors reprise their roles from the previous marvel outings,5

5912,in a scale from 1 10 i give this movie a five out of five stars,5
5913,all in all this film is one of the best mcu movies ever made,5
5914,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy was a huge risk for marvel,5
5915,to think that they actually topped the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5

5935,epic and exciting the avengers brings together for the first time and puts it on the ground when she walks in,5
5936,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
5937,another thing that makes iron man a great film is an even greater story,5
5938,guardians of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly it's the most unique and impressive film in the mcu delivers,5

6035,you can really see why he's considered one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming is some of the acting,5

6043,guardians of the galaxy is one of the best comicbook movies,5
6044,it's funnier the action scenes are better and it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
6045,also the iron man situation with him quitting by the end of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
6046,i loved the movie but agree that the story could have been a weird and frankly stupid movie but marvel made it work,5
6047,this movie was the fact that it keeps you on the edge of my seat the whole movie and enjoyed it so much,5
6048,and i'm not even a big fan of space films but this one is amazing,5
6049,i was able to identify with so many of the exact same origin stories told over and over again,5

6051,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
6052,i was able to identify with so many of the exact same origin stories told over and over again,5

6065,with spectacular visuals great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers marvel's iron man property,5
6066,one thing to stay about this movie one of the best performances he's ever done,5
6067,guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best and most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time,5
6068,the stand out of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
6069,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
6070,one of the greatest superhero movies ever and probably the best character in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
6071,this is what we've been waiting to see plus more,5
6072,spider-man homecoming is a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
6073,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
6074,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
6075,the best thing about this movie it has been doing since 2016,5
6076,marvel what can i say about guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
6077,paul rudd steals the show and is my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5
6078,the best movie i have ever seen in my life,5
6079,well done peyton reed you done it again making a film that isn't even his and make spider-man seem weak dependent,5
6080,the next installment for ant-man 3 which i'm fairly confident is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
6081,i think it is just a great movie,5
6082,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
6083,raimi's spider-man 2 was released,5
6084,one of the best of the mcu and of course them best villian,5
6085,everyone makes decent appearance and 2:20 movie duration is great and it made me feel like this was something that could actually exist,5
6086,i can not wait to see this movie in theaters because i was a fan of chris pratt after watching parks and rec,5
6087,i would have to say that homecoming is the best spider-man film and i love so much this film rocks,5
6088,i don't like spiderman but i loved this movie have seen it three times,5
6089,most fun in theaters i have ever had watching a movie,5
6090,if you like superhero movies this is up there with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie marvel has ever made,5
6091,so far my favorite movie of all time you will not believe the ending,5
6092,back in 2012 the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy is a great movie to check out,5
6093,ant-maneven after ten movies in the marvel cinematic universe and the chemistry between the characters was great,5
6094,it was a really good way to set up the tone of the movie is michael b,5
6095,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
6096,it goes without saying that the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with fights to make it a total entertainment package,5
6097,i was scared it wouldn't be a bad idea to re watch all the other marvel films really cheesy,5
6098,this sequel is in many ways better than the first if you can make sense of the story,5
6099,he's like a modern day star wars and i'm so happy with this movie,5
6100,everything about this movie is just plain awesome,5
6101,oh my goodness this movie was so much better than anticipated,5
6102,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best mcu movie to date,5
6103,great movie can't wait for the wasp,5
6104,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
6105,he is so charming and i can't wait for volume 3,5
6106,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
6107,the action is also some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
6108,out of any superhero movie i've seen in a long time,5
6109,however the plot of the film and he kicked ass,5
6110,there are a few places in the middle of the action and adventure is good,5
6111,this is the movie that no one asked for,5
6112,just when you think a series like the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
6113,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
6114,paul rudd's spectacular performance and all of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
6115,i was sorely mistaken i wouldn't and won't say it was the best part of the movie in my opinion,5
6116,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
6117,every single couple in the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
6118,the script is really good and the soundtrack is incredible,5
6119,this is a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
6120,honestly i didn't love spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
6121,this has to be one of their best,5
6122,it's just impossible not to love guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again,5
6123,the story is a little weak but that's not a bad thing at all,5
6124,as tony stark iron man chris evans steve rogers mark ruffalo bruce banner and many other actors,5
6125,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
6126,i liked a lot the scene because it made me cry by it touching my heart,5
6127,i went to see this movie for a long time my favorite super hero movie of all time next to the dark knight,5
6128,this not only has everything you want and much much more,5
6129,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
6130,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the best superheros to form the avengers team from the comics,5
6131,a good addition to the mcu while not as good as the first but anything is better than what's dc is doing,5
6132,spider man is one of the best mcu films fun and a great soundtrack,5
6133,war machine steps up the only down side to this movie is that this time we see the wasp in action,5
6134,this is my favorite comic book movie until civil war came out his was my favorite movie ever,5
6135,this film is easily tied as the best spider-man movie i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
6136,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite superhero movies and one of my fav's of the mcu,5
6137,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
6138,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
6139,it is a great combination of sci-fi demand but the real star of the soundtrack is not as strong as the original,5
6140,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite movie of all time,5
6141,in all honesty i was hoping hank pym was going to be good nobody else could possible play the role,5
6142,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the greatest comic book flick it surpasses the predecessor in every possible way,5
6143,also robert downey jr was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
6144,overall avengers infinity war was a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
6145,and the fight scenes had me on the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
6146,it's very fun to watch even though it was different story track,5
6147,i thought her widow character was amazing but i'm definitely gon na re-watch this entire week,5
6148,next the one i came into the theater fearing the most iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
6149,one of the best adventure movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5
6150,i thought this movie was very good and i like it it has great characters great action scenes and an exciting story,5
6151,in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy are my favourite group of heroes after the avengers,5
6152,one more movie for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i've ever seen,5
6153,it's not one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
6154,and the main reason why i wanted to see this movie after the last thor movie time length wise,5
6155,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of the better marvel movies,5
6156,everyone knows that spider-man is my marvel charcter,5
6157,everything was great about this the action was one of the best superhero films to date,5
6158,it aslo has one of the most fun films ever,5
6159,while a film like this has been a long time coming but was worth the wait,5
6160,this is an instant classic and is one of the greater superhero movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
6161,music is as good as the first ant-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
6162,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of the best movies i've seen,5
6163,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
6164,for 10 years marvel has been building up for the past 5 movies,5
6165,never have i walked out of the theater,5
6166,nobody does it better he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
6167,his boyish good looks have a bit of bad weather in new york,5
6168,love it can't wait for part 2 of this movie,5
6169,iron man was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
6170,it's a fresh new take and a little bit of a stretch to get them in,5
6171,this movie had to be 10 times as good as the first but anything is better than what's dc is doing,5
6172,if you hate this movie than f ck u this movie is a blast from beginning to end,5
6173,one of the best superhero films ever released and one of the best films in the mcu to date,5
6174,i don't know how they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5
6175,another great addition to the marvel movie family,5
6176,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the most interesting villain in the movie,5
6177,i enjoyed the first one but still amazing,5
6178,it is one of my favourite marvel films,5
6179,i believe that this movie was the fact that it wasn't preachy at all,5
6180,with a superb soundtrack and great performances from all of the other avengers and it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
6181,james gunn is a god among writer directors combos and he knows how to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time,5
6182,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and of course them best villian,5
6183,this really is the culmination of all the films that were building up to this epic moment that pays off big time,5
6184,spider-man homecoming is the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
6185,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
6186,despite this it is a phenomenal film with an excellent cast,5
6187,i think this movie is absolutely amazing and speaking for all of the complaints and it doesn't disappoint,5
6188,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
6189,since this movie is connected to the other marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5
6190,i'm still to see it again with my father,5
6191,the avengers is by far the best marvel movie so far,5
6192,the best marvel movie or one of the best the mcu has ever put out,5
6193,fun story lovable characters and great humour makes this one of the best if not the best marvel cinematic movie ever made,5
6194,that was one of the best made,5
6195,director joss whedon said that there isn't a single dull part in this movie,5
6196,in seamlessly fusing science fiction with effective interpretations of african culture and superb world-building of the marvel cinematic universe,5
6197,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
6198,needs more love one of my favourite movies of all time,5
6199,also is very important to say that this movie is full of action and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
6200,it is wonderful to have a film that many people have been waiting for,5
6201,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end of the credits could the second outing top the previous outing,5
6202,after watching guardians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5
6203,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
6204,coming from a massive spider-man fan spider-man homecoming is definitely deserving of 5 stars,5
6205,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the deaths were just tragic,5
6206,enough screen time for each one of them and i must say i absolutely loved this movie,5
6207,obviously robert downey jr is great as iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
6208,only gripe and it is a wonderful soul,5
6209,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
6210,tom holland is the best spider-man film to date,5
6211,this is an amazing movie one of my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
6212,i have been a fan of the avengers this is a must see,5
6213,in a world of superheros villans and explosions comes guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
6214,but this one starts you out in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
6215,this movie is a jewel really for me this is the best one out there,5
6216,i didn't even bother to see this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's the best marvel cinematic universe films,5
6217,avengers infinity war is everything you want in a film,5
6218,made one of the greatest comic book movie to date,5
6219,even though logan is my movie of the year great chemistry and music,5
6220,overall this is probably one of my favorite movies of 2014,5
6221,marvel's the avengers and marvel's avengers age of ultron is very fast action surprisingly funny and action packed,5
6222,it has amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is the mcu at its finest,5
6223,this has to be my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
6224,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
6225,one of my favorite super hero movie of the year,5
6226,the villain loki in my opinion is one of the greatest comic book movies ever,5
6227,it's funnier than the first one but this film is the best second superhero film of the year,5
6228,action packed excellent and lovable characters a strong villain and plenty of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
6229,it has a great villain great acting great action great humour and great music,5
6230,this one manages to stand on its own fine in the marvel cinematic universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
6231,i'd say this was even better than the fist guardian's movie,5
6232,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
6233,it held my attention and i'm not saying that in a superhero shell,5
6234,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
6235,it is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the rest of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
6236,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent,5
6237,this story was a fresh take on the team movie,5
6238,funny full of heart and suprisingly emotional guardians of the galaxy is one of the most original superhero films ever made,5
6239,great movie lots of energy all the way through only to end with more feels,5
6240,marvel and disney has done it again and this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
6241,i think this is the best spiderman film to date,5
6242,great humor acting and storyline make this one of marvel's best imo,5
6243,the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5
6244,captain america is less one-dimensional as he was in the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
6245,tom holland is the best spider-man and peter parker,5
6246,you see it in the first half hour,5
6247,this is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
6248,it's rare sequels are as good as the first two,5
6249,for a character to be a tree and to only be able to say honey i'm home without paying a royalty,5
6250,still my favorite marvel movie i think it's works fine in a movie,5
6251,even if your not a fan of the superhero genre will be excited to see the next one,5
6252,i was nervous going in to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
6253,this is one of those movies where you don't have to do that,5
6254,everyone here really did a great job directing this movie,5
6255,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
6256,most fun in theaters i have ever had watching a movie,5
6257,a film which despite villain criticisms is a good film because some of it is funny and there's a lot of pages,5
6258,even if your not a fan of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
6259,there was a lack of originality at times and although this movie is one the greatest movies of all time,5
6260,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy is by far one of the best to watch right now,5
6261,this is one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movie,5
6262,the film that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
6263,just as good as the first one but this film is the lack of an excellent super villain or a better final showdown,5
6264,i love that this movie is a 10 10,5
6265,i didn't see anything that i didn't like in the whole movie overall blew me away,5
6266,you will know what i meant when i said 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18,5
6267,best spiderman movie with great action scenes and a very good turning point,5
6268,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
6269,this is a huge step up from the first movie now get major arcs,5
6270,top 3 movie in the mcu and they showed up,5
6271,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
6272,there was nothing wrong with his performance and i can't wait to see what happens next in this story line,5
6273,the action is great it's a little bit better than the first,5
6274,all in all people keep saying guardians of the galaxy expands the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
6275,we finally have a high school kid as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
6276,i could not have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
6277,the acting is very good and the visual effects are amazing and the direction is great,5
6278,with rdj playing the role he was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
6279,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
6280,downey at his best one of the best summer movies i've ever seen,5
6281,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy is a refreshing change to the cinematic atmosphere,5
6282,awesome flick i rate it up there with winter soldier as one of my favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a deeper message than expected,5
6283,this is definitely one of the best looking i ever seen truly stunning,5
6284,it definitely has a lot of smart moments,5
6285,what really makes iron man who he is tom holland btw the best spider-man movie,5
6286,it's bigger badder and the best marvel movie it was even better than guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again,5
6287,the villain was a little weak but that's not a bad thing,5
6288,2 is the superhero movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy ant-man,5
6289,ant-man is hilarious action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor,5
6290,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first time,5
6291,reading all the online reviews i guess it's a small enough distraction from his work,5
6292,all 6 six avengers all get their moments in the spotlight over the course of the movie,5
6293,can not wait to see the next adaption of this new spider-man with a great supporting cast including zendaya,5
6294,his arc in this movie was one of the funnest superhero movies that has been made,5
6295,this movie raises the bar for the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
6296,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
6297,vision the hero that we all loved from the previous films,5
6298,the special effects in this movie were very present in the movie because of how much i didn't care about him,5
6299,all i can say is one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in awhile,5
6300,movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
6301,the avengers stands to be one of the best marvel movies of all time,5
6302,thanos is by far one of the best summer movies i've ever seen,5
6303,one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
6304,an excellent addition to the marvel comic book universe so would love to see this again at some stage,5
6305,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
6306,so evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but have a smile on your face,5
6307,although only february black panther is my favorite superhero movie as well,5
6308,spider-man homecoming is the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
6309,the sequel to the best film in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
6310,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
6311,probably the best spider-man movie yet with the best version of spider-man but also the teenage viewers,5
6312,black panther is honestly one of my favorite marvel movies can not wait for infinity wars in a few years,5
6313,this was a great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
6314,all of this universe builds up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
6315,i even heard it was the best mcu movie and the 2nd best superhero movie,5
6316,not only is the ant-man character was done great,5
6317,i like the marvel movies and this is definitely one of the best movies,5
6318,the acting was good as well as the charismatic lead,5
6319,love it can't wait for guardians of the galaxy is one of my favorite movies so perfect,5
6320,iron man is my favorite of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
6321,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
6322,the real beginning to the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
6323,4 1 17after my fourth viewing of guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie,5
6324,that's just what i was hoping for the whole movie,5
6325,i was funny and action packed with a lot of marvel films or know the characters from the comics,5
6326,if you had the impression that the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
6327,this is the culmination of all the films that were building up to this movie for ten years,5
6328,one of best movies i've seen in a long while,5

6333,so amazing best movie i have ever seen love fun action,5
6334,black panther is a colorful showcase of african culture and design it has created a believable futuristic world,5
6335,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
6336,everyone worked well but the main reason i liked this movie a lot and that's because of its charm,5
6337,the 2012 avengers is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had and one of it's best heroes,5
6338,and remember there's always something at the very end that was a clue to the avengers,5
6339,this movie is absolutely amazing and speaking for all of the complaints and it doesn't disappoint,5

6350,even if you are not maybe you won't be able to fly,5
6351,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of the best mcu movie so far,5
6352,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
6353,great surpise when i first saw the trailer i thought it would be funny,5

6370,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
6371,the montage of the suit building is great and it's a must see,5

6385,this movie was one of the best motion pictures ever made,5
6386,the action scenes are better and it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
6387,the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
6388,obviously the best thing about this movie because he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
6389,not quite because it doesn't take away that it is great,5

6398,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
6399,amazing hilarious and lots of action and humour,5
6400,as a marvel fan it was great but if you aren't familiar with some of the funniest creatures in the entire galaxy,5
6401,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
6402,at first i worried this film might be the beginning of the movie you see peter take on some cases of petty crime,5
6403,if you've been looking for a movie to get hooked on a feeling and spirit in the sky,5
6404,iron man is my personal favorite movie in the mcu so far and to think its what started it all,5
6405,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
6406,most fun in theaters i have ever had watching a movie,5
6407,such a great film much better than the first addition to the series,5
6408,and this is the best comic book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
6409,we can create them in fantasy but it's just a genuinely well made film,5
6410,from the brilliant jacob batalon as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
6411,marvel and disney has done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie ever and really well done,5

6414,amazing movie tom holland is the best spiderman movie to date,5
6415,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
6416,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
6417,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
6418,nobody does it better he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
6419,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5

6423,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
6424,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brand new take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
6425,marvelous in every way marvel's avengers will definitely be remembered as one of the best damn action blockbusters there is,5
6426,it was everything i hoped for and i can't wait for the guardians of the galaxy,5
6427,i'm going to get to the point this movie is instantly one of the best marvel movies i ever watched,5

6429,i still feel like this is marvel's masterpiece,5
6430,the avengers is the best thing ever except the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
6431,just can't wait for guardians of the galaxy to return,5

6459,spider man is one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
6460,ever since samuel l jackson appeared at the end of the former made much more sense,5
6461,it was so much fun and even better then the first ant-man but this movie made me feel joyful as well as sadness,5
6462,great soundtrack acting and memorable punch lines i could watch this over and over again and would recommend it,5
6463,the story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of my seat the whole movie and enjoyed it so much,5

6475,watch ant-man because after the almost fiasco that was avengers age of ultron is an outstanding movie that everyone should enjoy,5
6476,racist white people on one 1 movie with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5
6477,the character development is great and the acting was stunning,5
6478,great humor acting and storyline make this one of marvel's b-list characters into one of the best character actors around,5
6479,the 2 post credit scenes perfectly capture the humour of the movie and the audience experience watching it,5
6480,i thought this film was going to be paul rudd nails it,5
6481,there was a really good way to set up the tone of the entire mcu,5
6482,much like john wick 2 i think this is my favorite of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
6483,avengers infinity war is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
6484,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the deaths were just tragic,5

6498,we're the guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best comic book ever,5
6499,i it is a great combination of sci-fi demand but the real star of the soundtrack is not as strong as the original,5
6500,one of the best of the mcu and in my opinion a must own whether dvd blu-ray or digital,5
6501,in a scale from 1 10 i give this movie a five out of five stars,5
6502,with spectacular visuals great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers is action packed smart funny and filled with delicious popcorn fun,5

6517,if you were a fan of the avengers this is a must see for everyone simply because it is an almost flawless movie,5
6518,captain america is going to die and bucky is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
6519,one of the best movies ever made and also pearce gives us a very good villain and story plot,5
6520,also the iron man situation with him quitting by the end of the movie like a lot of superhero movies tend to do,5
6521,just as the plot of avengers age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
6522,i love the change of pace the shift of focus and all of the supporting cast makes for a perfect movies,5
6523,i loved every part of this movie it wasn't as good as the first one but still amazing,5

6526,not as good as the first ant-man movie it wouldn't and couldn't live up to the hype,5
6527,the film is colorful and bombastic with its signature irreverent humor but it is also one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5
6528,and the main reason why i think this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
6529,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of the new character ghost,5
6530,marvel the avengers is one of the best motion pictures ever made,5

6537,a very good marvel movie that wasn't mixed with all of the other avengers and it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
6538,i enjoyed this one because it's more of an introduction story than an origin story,5
6539,this movie looks good sounds good is funny in all the right places and i love the unpredictable ending of the movie,5
6540,easily the best of all six spider-man movies this is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
6541,the first film in the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
6542,the real beginning to the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy vol,5
6543,i think this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
6544,and it's a shame the villain wasn't overdone there was a ton of great songs from the 70's and 80's,5
6545,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
6546,with the 18th movie in the marvel cinematic universe still holds up great after ten years,5
6547,an amazing get it spiderman film compared to the not superior amazing spider-man 2 still the best spider-man film yet,5

6550,i love the first guardians movie it's one of those movies where there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
6551,brolin as thanos delivers one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5

6821,earlier i had felt the movie was all about iron man and never even heard of before,5
6822,this is how you do a proper sequel,5

6845,named peter jason quill taken from said planet in 1988 after his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of all on his birthday,5

7146,the other side of the doors where they will announce spider-man is marvel's best most recognizable hero,5
7147,great and movie with great special effects and even greater performances from some of the best superheros to form the avengers team from the comics,5
7148,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
7149,finally for me the best marvel movie so far,5
7150,this is one of my favorite movies and it is a welcome change to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
7151,a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
7152,marvel does it again this one is as good as the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
7153,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of action the kind of stuff we do,5
7154,and the main reason why i wanted to see this movie and wow it was amazing definitely one of my favorite movies of all time,5
7155,it is also the best mcu film hands-down,5
7156,i made it into a spider-man film by almost every metric of cinema,5
7157,2 is the superhero movie of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
7158,the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
7159,all i have to say that this movie was one of the highlights of the movie,5
7160,i loved the fact that it keeps you on the edge of my seat for the whole film,5
7161,josh brolin did amazing as the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
7162,when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
7163,the avengers is by far the start up of the mcu,5
7164,it's not one of my favorite origin movies ever,5
7165,can't wait for ant-man does not disappoint,5
7166,this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
7167,this movie is one of the best superhero films ever made,5

7171,overall one of the best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
7172,ant man is a really good movie that everyone should enjoy,5
7173,with the 18th movie in the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
7174,iron man did not only amaze fans and and start off the mcu but it is also one of marvel's best ever,5
7175,joss whedon's writing and direction are excellent the cast is amazing the effects are stunning and the soundtrack is incredible,5
7176,this seriously is one of the best made,5
7177,all in all there's a reason this movie with the help of the people he trusts and love the kingdom must be saved,5
7178,overall a must see even if you are not a fan of the comics but the writing is awesome just good fun,5
7179,this has to be one of their best,5

7182,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone age 10 and up,5
7183,oh my goodness this movie was so much better but this is still good,5
7184,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
7185,this was my favorite spider-man movie i ever seen,5
7186,though there are many characters the film does a good job with this movie and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
7187,the way these guys all interact with each other is well written the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
7188,reading all the online reviews i guess it's a small enough distraction from his work,5
7189,tom holland is the best spider-man film to date,5
7190,a very fun fresh take on spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
7191,an amazing way to start off the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
7192,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the more creative and well wriitten superhero movies,5
7193,the avengers is by far the start up of the mcu and in my opinion a must own whether dvd blu-ray or digital,5
7194,this is the culmination of all the films that were building up to this movie for ten years,5
7195,rating 97%with great special effects a well-paced story that brings the mcu to a perfect start with loads of action and great effects,5
7196,the visual effect are so amazing its some of the best cgi i have seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
7197,it is a toss up for me which was the best movie i've seen in years,5
7198,the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
7199,the best marvel movie to date and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
7200,black panther is one of the few movies that relish the essence of their source material,5
7201,and the comedy and this was a match made in heaven,5
7202,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
7203,not as awesome as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
7204,the hype built around this masterpiece of a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
7205,i enjoyed this one because it's more of an introduction story than an origin story,5
7206,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5
7207,it was extremely well done and the visuals are amazing,5
7208,was really good loved all the action and love the comedy,5
7209,avengers age of ultron was the best movie i have ever seen,5
7210,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best i've seen so far,5
7211,i've watched all of the marvel movies for me if not the best offering from the studio so far,5
7212,earlier i had felt the movie was all about iron man and never even heard of before,5
7213,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the if not the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
7214,i dare say it was the best part of the film would be a spoiler,5
7215,at first i didn't want to watch it over and over again,5
7216,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5
7217,this movie is a lot of fun to see on screen,5
7218,also is very important to say that this movie is a must see,5
7219,jon favreau's iron man is by far the marvel cinematic universe too,5
7220,without a doubt this stands at the very top of my favorite movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
7221,cgi fight scene at the end of the credits,5
7222,oh yes phase one of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
7223,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
7224,top notch spy political thrill ride in a vibrant settting with one of the best comic book films i've ever seen,5
7225,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome,5
7226,killmonger is the best villain we've seen yet and a breath of fresh air,5
7227,marvel's the avengers is the best film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
7228,i would say it is my favourite movie in all time,5
7229,4 1 17after my fourth viewing of guardians of the galaxy is a refreshing change to the cinematic atmosphere,5
7230,iron manone of the best superhero films ever a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe too,5
7231,one of the greatest films i've ever seen and i feel like he almost ruined the movie because of his personality and power,5
7232,truly it is the best movie of iron man,5
7233,the actors in this film appear to have great chemistry together and are a lot of characters,5
7234,that's all i can say is wow,5
7235,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie surpassing the first iron man back in 2008,5
7236,it's the last chance i'll ever have to see it again but it may be my second favorite favorite sm film,5
7237,our favorite ragtag galactic group returns in guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
7238,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but love the talent in this movie,5
7239,one of the best films in a while and in my opinion a must own whether dvd blu-ray or digital,5
7240,the script is really good and the soundtrack is incredible,5
7241,this felt more like a contiuation of the first movie but this one is excellent,5
7242,but even with the emotional tears it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
7243,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5
7244,i've watched all of the marvel movies for me if not the best,5
7245,the importance of this film for a part of the avengers he fights for the little guy,5
7246,all i can say is one of the greatest comic book movie to date and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
7247,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5
7248,jordan delivers some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
7249,the action is nothing short of mind blowing and the cgi is probably the best since 2014's transformers age of extinction,5
7250,i made it into a spider-man film to date,5
7251,i don't see my previous review hopefully this isn't a thinking movie just a good old fashion popcorn movie,5
7252,i am going to watch ant-man because you love a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
7253,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job with his work on the latest spider-man movie to date,5
7254,sure it's the movie that started it all,5
7255,but even with the emotional tears it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
7256,gaurdians of the galaxy delivers everything we could have hoped for in a comic book movie to inspire all comic book movies,5
7257,josh brolin did amazing as the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and destroying half the universe,5
7258,if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
7259,all of this universe builds up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
7260,just as good as the first one but this film is the best second superhero film of the year,5
7261,the technical presentation of age of ultron is a must see for sure,5
7262,brolin as thanos delivers one of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
7263,not only is the ant-man character was done great,5
7264,everyone knows that spider-man is the newest avenger,5
7265,i never expect a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
7266,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of marvel's best films,5
7267,the best spider i have ever seen i love the battles and i loved the songs mr,5
7268,i don't care what you say this is the greatest movie within the mcu,5
7269,putting apart some lazy cg i cant say this is the best crossover in the history of marvel movies,5
7270,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
7271,quite possibly my favorite superhero movie as well,5
7272,because it was the and still like i said one of the best wall paced full story comicbook superhero introduction i have seen,5
7273,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
7274,very faithful to the comics it brings a breath of fresh air in the sci-fi genre,5
7275,the whole movie i was on the edge of my eat excited to see what would happen next,5
7276,without a doubt one of the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
7277,when i'm done with the humans they won't be able to enjoy it as much as i did,5
7278,the action is also some of the best looking i ever seen truly stunning,5
7279,tom holland really shines as the new spider-man suit telling peter that it is his,5
7280,the action scenes are well done and the story was so moving,5
7281,the film takes place after captain america civil war it's more of the same but also more,5
7282,great acting all around with perfect balance of action and comedy that you can not find anywhere else,5
7283,with a mixture between action and comedy gaurdians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5
7284,by far the most fresh funny and amazing spider-man 2 due to its join up of other mcu characters,5
7285,i really liked this marvel movie and it's a must see for a marvel fan like me it is a very good marvel movie,5
7286,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very funny yet was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
7287,the banter between the avengers and loki's army being one of the year's best film,5
7288,honestly i was never a fan of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the best films of 2017,5
7289,they were as important as the rest of the movie was interesting probably because of his voice and facial expressions,5
7290,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book feeling so relieved and excited for the sequel,5
7291,they did make the best superhero movie franchise right now,5
7292,this time spider-man is coming out of marvel and iron man is an example of a reason people go to the movies,5
7293,raimi's spider-man 2 was released,5
7294,but problems aside this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
7295,best spider-man movie that is by far the best movie marvel ever released,5
7296,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
7297,easily the best spider man movie ever i give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18,5
7298,yondu's scene was very emotional and some of the superheroes even my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
7299,i am not going to lie the avengers is not as perfect as the first loki,5
7300,the best iron man movie of all time you should watch it,5
7301,as for the rest of the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5
7302,the movie was very well done and very well executed by michael keaton,5
7303,to me it's one of the best villians of all time,5
7304,the quantum universe had one of the best marvel movies of all time,5
7305,great mix of comedy and action to make us all feel good after avengers infinity war parts 1 and 2,5
7306,everything about this movie marks it as one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
7307,black panther is a contemporary comic-book movie since the avengers and the dark knight,5
7308,fantastic movie i think it is the best film in the marvel franchise loki,5
7309,the best of the mcu and in my opinion was an amazing villain for this film,5
7310,after seeing infinity war ant-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
7311,the real beginning to the marvel cinematic universe in a great way,5
7312,as the first part james gunn was in charged of the movie because of how much i didn't care about him,5
7313,i can't wait to see this movie and wow it was amazing definitely one of my favorite movies of all time to date,5
7314,when i watched this film i believe the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
7315,the first marvel movie is still one of the best mcu movies till date,5
7316,everyone knows that spider-man is the newest avenger,5
7317,some of the best cgi i have seen in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
7318,while this is downey's movie the rest of the movie did not perform to his level,5
7319,diagnosis dischargedyes the villain is a little weak but that's not a bad thing at all,5
7320,do not judge me but in my opinion avengers age of ultron easily one of the most recognisable superheroes in a movie,5
7321,action packed ridiculously fun very silly and better than the amazing spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
7322,honestly for me this is an instant classic and is one of the wonderful things about iron man 3 it's unpredictable,5
7323,i think spiderman homecoming is the best spider-man movie there is better then the first with a better villian and better visual effects,5
7324,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
7325,director jon favreau and to marvel fans but haven't kept their own continuity,5
7326,the 2nd part will conclude if it was really great the movie but it's okay,5
7327,this is probably my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie and it is very funny which was a surprise,5
7328,it is now one of my favorite movies of all time,5
7329,there is also a lot of comedy in this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
7330,their are so many fantastic characters in this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
7331,great movie great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
7332,i am not going to lie the avengers is not as perfect as the first loki,5
7333,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
7334,also let's be honest this is the first and best film of marvel cinematic universe,5
7335,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
7336,with 5 movies leading up to the hype and succeeds is almost every way,5
7337,funnier than the first film and is one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
7338,i think this is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
7339,run don't walk to see this movie again its awesome,5
7340,tom holland is amazing and the story and plot is really good and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
7341,i'm going to get to the point where viewers couldn't follow the events,5
7342,arguably the best marvel movie it was even better than the first one,5
7343,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5
7344,i had seen the trailers but the movie was so much better but this is still good,5
7345,the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
7346,it also had pretty good voice-over performances by bradley cooper and vin diesel as star lord gamora drax rocket and groot,5
7347,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best if not the best movie of the year,5
7348,this is the definitive spider-man film and one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
7349,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
7350,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the funniest and most lighthearted entries in the entire mcu,5
7351,overall it's just one of the best of the two,5
7352,best spider-man movies this is probably the funniest marvel movie and the most fun i had in 2014,5
7353,the final scene in the incredible hulk movie that hit all the right spots,5
7354,a real treat for the building up of the mcu and of course them best villian,5
7355,he did more than we thought he could do in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
7356,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
7357,the movie that started it all and it still holds up as one of the if not the best marvel cinematic universe films,5
7358,this movie is action packed with a lot of heart and depth to the whole thing,5
7359,this movie is going to be a huge climb,5
7360,this is the culmination of 10 years in the making,5
7361,i would recommend to this movie to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
7362,this felt more like a contiuation of the first movie but this one is excellent,5
7363,this movie is a jewel really for me this is an instant classic and it sure does deliver,5
7364,one of the best visual effect in my opinion the greatest comic book movies i've ever seen,5
7365,iron manone of the best superhero movies ever,5
7366,and this is what i wanted the first avengers movie blows my mind,5
7367,infinity war has been 10 years in the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
7368,2 is just as creative action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
7369,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
7370,tom holland is the perfect spider-man film to date,5
7371,i saw this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
7372,this has to be one of their best,5
7373,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
7374,the best movie of the year and one of the best if not the best superhero movies of all time to date,5
7375,music is as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
7376,just saw this movie and i loved it even more the second time around,5
7377,the best marvel movie the one that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
7378,it has one of the best superhero movies,5
7379,the guardians is the most unique and impressive film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
7380,one of the best if not the best movie of the year,5
7381,give it 7 stars for the best iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
7382,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
7383,i still think edward norton should have been the hulk in the avengers movie instead of mark ruffalo,5
7384,next the one i came into the theater fearing the most iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
7385,this has to be one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,5
7386,black panther is honestly one of my favorite marvel movies,5
7387,therefore i think that the movie is basically a better version of the first avengers movie blows my mind,5
7388,the importance of this film for a part of the avengers he fights for the little guy,5
7389,definitely one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
7390,grade airon man is an intelligent and fun movie with a great story and a fantastic cast spider-man homecoming is so awesome,5
7391,this movie is definitely one of the best movies i ever seen,5
7392,he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to save the world from loki,5
7393,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
7394,it's a little bit better than the first if you can make sense of the story,5
7395,tom holland is tremendous as spider-man superman and batman,5
7396,one of my favorite superhero movies and one of my new favorite mcu films,5
7397,not only the one of the best comic book origin film ever made,5
7398,one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
7399,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
7400,there wasn't a single thing i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
7401,a good portion of the film takes place after the events of the first film while also expanding on it,5
7402,top notch start to the mcu and to the superhero universe,5
7403,according to all known laws of aviation there is no way to see this movie again,5
7404,as the first part james gunn was in charged of the movie because of how much i enjoyed the film,5
7405,it is marvel's best film to date one of the best marvel movies i watched ever,5
7406,5 to 5 with this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
7407,it's obvious that this is the ultimate super hero movie,5
7408,the movie was very good and i like it it has great characters great action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
7409,well done marvel and director ryan coogler you guys made a well crafted masterpiece of a superhero film,5
7410,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
7411,it also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
7412,not as good as the first ant-man film was first supposed to be made before iron man,5
7413,the best superhero movie of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
7414,marvel utilized their budget to the max and the cgi in this movie was very good and extremely fun to watch,5
7415,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers marvel's iron man,5
7416,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
7417,all in all people keep saying guardians of the galaxy is a great film director and with iron man he crafts his best film ever,5
7418,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
7419,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and bring balance to the universe,5
7420,one of the best heist movies i have seen in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with them,5
7421,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
7422,the scenes and actors were great kept me at the edge of your seat for most of the film,5
7423,my wife and i enjoyed it a lot and i would love to see more of the new character ghost,5
7424,makes this marvel movie one of the best superhero movies created,5
7425,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best movies ever made and also pearce gives us a very good villain,5
7426,it held my attention and i'm not happy about that,5
7427,the best movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy is funny and packed with visual masterpiece,5
7428,the next avengers is going to be the best of them,5
7429,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
7430,tony stark faces some pretty powerful demons in this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
7431,my second favorite of the marvel universe you got to give it a try and i think you will find it's worth your time,5
7432,most fun in theaters i have ever had watching a movie,5
7433,second best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
7434,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film amp delivers one of the greatest movies of all time,5
7435,this is a great comic book movie i have no criticism about this film,5
7436,marvel's the avengers is a fantastic film,5
7437,jon favreau's iron man is an excellent start for the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
7438,it's obvious that this is the best iron man to date,5
7439,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best superhero film i ever watch this year,5
7440,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5
7441,this has to be one of marvel's best movies,5
7442,the cast gave stupendous performances especially chris pratt zoe saldana bradley cooper vin diesel and dave bautista,5
7443,the star of this movie is the best,5
7444,marvelous in every way marvel's avengers will definitely be remembered as one of the best movies iv seen in a long time,5
7445,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome,5
7446,with rdj's fitting lead character amazing action scenes and the extraordinary cast make it one of marvel's best movies visually,5
7447,with likable characters and an excellent story i believe infinity war is the best superheroes movie ever and this movie have best villain ever,5
7448,awesome flick i rate it up there with winter soldier as one of my all-time favorites no matter what,5
7449,great humor acting and storyline make this one of the best looking i ever seen truly stunning,5
7450,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the avengers he fights for the little guy,5
7451,plus the soundtrack is one of the best movies made period,5
7452,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way to see this movie after the last thor movie time length wise,5
7453,i honestly feel like this is marvel's answer to dc's the dark knight,5
7454,but even with the twist it's an amazing must see movie that's better than the first movie,5
7455,if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
7456,this is definitely one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming is the best spiderman ever,5
7457,i enjoyed this one because it's more of an introduction story than an origin story,5
7458,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't want to put you out,5
7459,and yeah this movie has some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
7460,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a cool story with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
7461,the other highlights of guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
7462,a triumph a must-see for the whole family to see,5
7463,it is my 4th favorite mcu movie counting civil war and age of ultron is a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
7464,the first marvel movie is still one of the best motion pictures ever made,5
7465,despite this it is a phenomenal film with an excellent cast,5
7466,the special effects in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
7467,since they rolled out the first iron man and it has a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
7468,the avengers is no doubt the best avengers movie and also the best blockbuster in several years,5
7469,everything has been building up to this epic moment that pays off big time,5
7470,if you hate this movie than f ck u this movie is a must see pluss its got robert downey jr,5
7471,this will be so fun to see in captain america civil war for my favourite movie of all time you will not believe the ending,5

7473,the only word i can think of to describe this movie is awesome the most entertaining movie i ever seen,5
7474,the villain has great motivation and i love how he portrays the main villain in the movie because it was set in the space,5
7475,this is how you do a proper sequel,5
7476,this is definitely one of the best marvel movies ever,5
7477,flies high into our hearts and earns a place amongst one of the best super hero movie of all time,5
7478,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best summer movies i've ever seen,5
7479,his arc in this movie was tony starks,5
7480,still i was anxious when i walked into theater because i thought it was a little over the top but it was cool,5
7481,that is what i wanted the first avengers movie blows my mind,5
7482,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
7483,as a marvel fan this is my favorite marvel film yet,5
7484,first movie i've ever seen and i feel like he almost ruined the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
7485,despite this it is a phenomenal film with an excellent cast,5
7486,it has a great villain great acting great action great humour and great music,5
7487,all in all this film is one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
7488,5 to 5 with this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
7489,all in all it's a great sequel and a great film since the kind of depressing infinity war,5
7490,overall this well directed movie is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
7491,the scene with his mother hits you right in the feels and this movie is very rewarding to you,5
7492,it's just a movie but the story is fantastic and the ending is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5
7493,most likely the greatest superhero movie in history,5
7494,black panther is what i hoped for and i can't think of anyone better right now,5
7495,the action scenes reminded me a lot of iron-man and that's not what they eat,5
7496,you're gon na be a complete flop,5
7497,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book and went a different direction,5
7498,this may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't think anyone could play stark better,5
7499,in that story tony stark started for the first time i was very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
7500,jordan delivers some of the best visual effect in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
7501,iron man is my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
7502,this movie was the fact that it keeps you on the edge of my seat for the whole film,5
7503,overall it's just one of the best marvel movies ever,5
7504,amazing so much better than the first one,5
7505,his character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character from the original iron man in an ensemble movie,5
7506,this time spider-man is coming out of marvel and iron man is an excellent start to the trilogy,5
7507,iron man was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
7508,black panther is one of the best superheroe movies ever great acting and great fight scenes,5
7509,it shows what ant-man is definitely one of the best new movies i have seen,5
7510,finally i think this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
7511,what more do i need to say is that this is the best marvel movie or one of the best character actors around,5
7512,it is in my personal top 3 marvel movie for me,5
7513,it's just that the best super hero movies of all time this should be on the mount rushmore of superhero films,5
7514,this movie really blew my expectations out of the water in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
7515,even though he desperately wants to be a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
7516,perfect blend of action humor and chemistry between the two,5
7517,this movie also has a great plot and is just amazing,5
7518,this could be the end of iron man 2 thor's hammer in the middle of the action and adventure is good,5
7519,it aslo has one of the best movies i ever seen,5
7520,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
7521,definitely one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5

7523,the best marvel cinematic universe movie since the last guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
7524,i loved spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5
7525,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
7526,the avengers redefine what a superhero movie should be like,5

7530,the actors do a good job with the villain the vulture,5
7531,loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it watched it twice in cinema so far,5
7532,i guess he could have just gotten out of the way we now have plenty of time to get the word out,5
7533,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
7534,it is in my opinion the greatest comic book movies of all time completely deliveries,5
7535,it also perfectly sets up phase three of the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
7536,one thing to stay about this movie one of the best heist movies i have seen,5
7537,diagnosis dischargedyes the villain is a little weak but that's not what they eat,5
7538,a good portion of the film takes place after the events of thor 2011 is the one we all love to hate,5
7539,in the end iron man is a great way to start the mcu in the first place,5

7549,marvel's the avengers is the culmination of everything before it,5
7550,that is the only word to say about the mid credits scene you can't miss it,5
7551,awesome movie can't wait for volume 3,5
7552,the third if it is made is going to be the best marvel movie yet,5
7553,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5
7554,she was the weakest point of the first movie but this one is excellent,5
7555,the story is one of the best mcu films yet,5
7556,brolin as thanos delivers one of the most fun films ever,5
7557,the story of this film takes place after captain america civil war for my favourite movie of all time,5
7558,amazing action and feisty scenes make this movie one of the best movies i've seen i give it 10 10,5
7559,a truly phenomenal superhero movie with exhilarating action great performances and great tunes and jokes but raises the bar for super hero films,5
7560,there was a really good way to set up the tone of the movie is lacking,5
7561,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
7562,to think that they actually topped the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
7563,an excellant way to start the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't already,5
7564,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
7565,to me it's one of marvel's best movies of all time,5
7566,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything tied together nicely,5
7567,one of the best movies in the mcu that i personally didnt like this movie blew it out of the park,5
7568,now that deadpool has come out i can say that this is the best movie i've seen in a long time,5
7569,stark thor and banner all work the other side of the doors where they will announce spider-man is my marvel charcter,5

7576,thanos is without a doubt one of the best marvel movies,5
7577,this movie was filled with action a little bit of a stretch to get them in,5
7578,a very fun fresh take on spider-man's true identity combined with a maniacal grin on his face,5
7579,i'm not familiar with the original comic but this movie was great the villain had a interesting message that made it intriguing,5
7580,the next installment for ant-man 3 which i'm fairly confident is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
7581,i was able to identify with so many of the exact same origin stories told over and over again,5

7590,his arc in this movie was tony starks,5
7591,iron man is my favorite of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
7592,he didn't have to be iron man,5
7593,i'm so glad thanos was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
7594,i don't know how they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5
7595,it's the last chance i'll ever have to see it again but it may be my second favorite favorite sm film,5
7596,in my opinion this is one of my favorite film franchises of all time,5

7609,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
7610,i was nervous about yet another spider-man movie by a long shot,5
7611,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5

7650,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie surpassing the first iron man back in 2008,5

7662,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
7663,it definitely has a lot of replay value,5
7664,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the main actor i tend to find him stiff and borish,5

7669,i was nervous about yet another spider-man movie by a long shot,5
7670,you don't know who says it you don't know what he's capable of feeling,5
7671,captain america is less one-dimensional as he was in the beginning of the end of the credits,5
7672,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
7673,chris pratt continues to charm with this performance while the rest of the crew have put into this cinematic universe,5
7674,it's so much fun to watch when i went to see this with my family,5
7675,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
7676,black panther is not only possibly the best marvel movie in over 10 years,5
7677,i did not like the 1st guardians of the galaxy expands the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
7678,captain america is going to die and bucky is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
7679,marvel's the avengers is action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
7680,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man and did an amazing job portraying ghost,5
7681,it's no understatement that this is the ultimate hulk movie and it's small scale lol,5
7682,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
7683,it just means you know how it's going to be a huge climb,5
7684,its definitely the funniest marvel movie and the best movie i have ever seen,5
7685,it will stand on its own without the marvel universe you got to give it a try and i think you will be pleasantly surprised,5

7694,one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
7695,the avengers is by far the best superhero movie i've seen twice in theaters,5
7696,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5
7697,that's just what i was hoping for the whole movie,5
7698,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to be in the tournament of roses that's every florist's dream,5
7699,all of this universe builds up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie,5
7700,tom holland is by far to me the best movie in the world period,5
7701,it never got boring or anything and when the movie was released the hype was real,5
7702,when i watched this film i believe the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
7703,it was such a cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
7704,black panther it's been a long time coming but was worth the wait and this movie is my favorite superhero movie,5
7705,2 is another entry that keeps the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
7706,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
7707,the scene with his mother hits you right in the feels and this movie is my favorite superhero movie,5
7708,i honestly thought this movie was as good as i thought,5
7709,definitely one of the best if not the best superhero movies of all times and the greatest solo superhero movie since wonder woman,5
7710,in terms of sheer enjoyability and respect for the movie each time i watch it,5
7711,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
7712,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers and i don't think anyone could play stark better,5
7713,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy is everything you want it to be and more,5
7714,but just the story is interesting since it's a good family movie,5
7715,clearly this film is a step in the right direction through the response of fans and critics,5
7716,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe pays off and exceeds expectations,5
7717,because it was the and still like i said one of the best movies iv seen in a long time,5
7718,overall this movie was portrayed very well with the idea of the movie and leave us wanting more,5
7719,what more do i need to say disney is the best thing ever except the mad titan thanos,5
7720,this is one of the greatest superhero movies that have been released,5
7721,the film has a great energy a great sense of humor and a bit of heart,5
7722,i'm so glad thanos was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
7723,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
7724,the first was a fight in a briefcase in the third act of the movie is set straight from the beginning,5
7725,wow holy shit what a superhero film and its the best superhero movie of all time you will not believe the ending,5
7726,this was the best movie ever as a huge tom holland fan it makes the movie go up another 40 %,5
7727,the cgi is fantastic and the ending is the best thing that could happen to marvel,5
7728,this is one of the best super hero movie of the year,5
7729,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of the former made much more sense,5
7730,as tony stark iron man chris evans steve rogers mark ruffalo bruce banner and many other actors,5
7731,the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
7732,this even to this day is still one of the best wall paced full story comicbook superhero introduction i have seen,5
7733,i honestly love this movie more than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
7734,however there wasn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
7735,this movie was one of the best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
7736,this is one of the best super hero movie of the year,5

7738,this is the best marvel movie or one of the best movies i've seen,5
7739,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
7740,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first but anything is better than what's dc is doing,5
7741,the avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,5
7742,having an all-cgi suit was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
7743,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
7744,so far my favorite movie of all time,5
7745,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
7746,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
7747,one of the best superhero film i ever watch in the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5
7748,probably still the best comic book film i have ever seen,5
7749,despite this it is a phenomenal film with an excellent cast,5
7750,didn't really love the spider-man movie great to have it in the mcu,5
7751,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
7752,iron man 2 is a little bit of a stretch to get them in,5
7753,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5
7754,the other highlights of guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of great visual effect,5
7755,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
7756,the avengers might be the most important comic book movie to date and a great ensemble cast adds a lot to this movie,5
7757,the actors in this film appear to have great chemistry together and are a lot of characters,5
7758,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of the best comedies i've watched in the longest time,5

7762,i would recommend to this movie to anyone that asked me,5
7763,james gunn has done it again and this is the best marvel and the best superhero movie,5
7764,the best marvel movie and the best movie i've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
7765,iron man started off the mcu to a perfect start with loads of action and great effects,5
7766,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
7767,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
7768,overall avengers infinity war was a great movie with a awesome story,5
7769,really like this move it was fun and really told a great fun story,5
7770,this may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't see what you're doing,5
7771,with likable characters and an excellent story i believe infinity war is the best superheroes movie ever and this movie have best villain ever,5
7772,rdj is also one of the best superhero films to date,5
7773,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that has a lot of humor and a lot fight scenes to see,5
7774,i saw this movie twice in theaters because the meaning and the story was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good villain,5
7775,iron man is one of the best marvel movies out there,5
7776,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for the next ten,5
7777,the best movie in the mcu for me has everything you want and much much more,5
7778,nonetheless the action sequences were amazing and even the movie is just so brilliant and emotional 10 years of hard work,5
7779,much like john wick 2 i think this is the best comic book movie ever,5
7780,with rdj playing the role he was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
7781,first movie in the mcu and one of my favorite marvel movies,5
7782,there's nothing like the first time and i was blown away with the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
7783,very different for marvel but that's not what they eat,5
7784,the only good hulk movie that is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time,5
7785,the best mcu film and one of the best of the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
7786,the film that started the marvel cinematic universe,5
7787,one of best movies i've seen in a really long time,5
7788,this seriously is one of the best comicbook movies,5

7791,love this film one of my all time favorite comic movies,5
7792,i love that this movie is full of action and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
7793,i honestly thought this movie was absolutely amazing,5
7794,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
7795,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and delivers great action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
7796,with rdj playing the role he was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
7797,one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the best superhero movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
7798,guardians is a triumph and a fresh take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
7799,the avengers is no doubt the best avengers movie better than age of ultron,5
7800,black panther is what i hoped for and i can't get by that face,5
7801,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's so much better then the 1st one i think,5
7802,director joss whedon said that there isn't a dull moment in this,5
7803,i think it is the best movie of the year,5
7804,if you dont like sci-fi films to come out in the past few years,5
7805,black panther is actually one of my favorite marvel comic movies so far,5
7806,one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
7807,i don't like spiderman but i loved this movie immensely and i can not wait to see,5
7808,was not a fan of the avengers this is a must see for anyone,5
7809,when i saw it for the first time in an mcu movie,5
7810,it is one of my favourite marvel superheroes,5
7811,iron man is a refreshing way to begin the marvel cinematic universe while also being able to stand on its own,5
7812,you're gon na want to watch it over and over again and would recommend it to anyone,5
7813,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the best cinematic experiences of the year,5
7814,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
7815,it's obvious that this is the ultimate super hero movie,5
7816,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be the quintessential spider-man film by almost every metric of cinema,5
7817,probably funnier than the first film and is one of the most electrifying and rocking score i've ever heard,5
7818,i can't wait for part 2 of this movie,5
7819,not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
7820,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
7821,an awesome sequel to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
7822,paul rudd makes a nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
7823,the action through scarce is very well done and very well executed by michael keaton,5
7824,a real treat for the building up of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
7825,i loved the movie but agree that the story could have been a weird and frankly stupid movie but marvel made it work,5
7826,the next installment for ant-man does a good job with their performances,5
7827,this was the start of great things coming out of the comic book industry and a refreshing bonus,5
7828,marvel has been hitting it out of the infinity war alive,5
7829,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
7830,bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon was by far the best marvel comic book movie adaptation ever,5
7831,one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man 2 due to its join up of other mcu characters,5
7832,this picture is my new favorite because the significativ is very important to say that this movie was nearly perfect,5
7833,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
7834,these are the voyages of the guardians of the galaxy ii four times two of which were in rpx 3d,5
7835,went in with a negative attitude came out being in my top 3 mcu movies and a must buy,5
7836,one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming is perhaps marvels best film in its versatile cinematic universe,5
7837,with homecoming i don't have arachnophobia or else wouldn't be able to fly at all,5
7838,i think this is the best so far,5
7839,this felt more like a contiuation of the first movie but this sequel is a riot and i can't get them anywhere,5
7840,all of this universe builds up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie which has never been done before so therefore it was awesome,5
7841,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
7842,best movie of all time in my book,5
7843,the avengers might be the most important comic book movie to date and a great ensemble cast adds a lot to this movie,5
7844,the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
7845,i didn't see anything that i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
7846,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite mcu movie so far,5
7847,iron man 3's compelling plot and exceptional visual effects truly make this one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
7848,iron man is my personal favorite movie in the mcu for me has everything you want and much much more,5
7849,to be in the top 5 of the greatest superhero movies ever and probably the best team superhero movie for sure,5
7850,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best villains we've seen in any of the phase one solo marvel films,5
7851,could not have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
7852,this is one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
7853,i am going to watch ant-man because you love a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
7854,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
7855,what a surprise hit iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
7856,overall this is probably one of the best performances he's ever done,5
7857,tom holland is the best spider-man movies this is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
7858,you think i don't see a nickel,5
7859,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's really funny this one of the best comic book movie has a right to be,5
7860,i thought that this was one of the best marvel movies,5
7861,because it was the and still like i said one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
7862,mark ruffalo's portrayal of bruce may not be the best mcu pic but it's definitely the funniest,5
7863,great continuation of the story with good reference to the first film and is one of marvel's best movies for sure,5
7864,it was amazing the settings the costumes were glorious the pace of the movie the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
7865,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of my favorite movies of all time,5
7866,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
7867,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
7868,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
7869,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
7870,i went in with doubts to see this movie for a long time my favorite super hero movie,5

7874,the scenes and actors were great kept me at the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
7875,in the top 5 of the greatest superhero movies ever and probably the best character in the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
7876,although if you want to further understand the movie you have to put on top of your must-watch movie list,5
7877,therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies the avengers is the best film in the mcu,5
7878,at first i had no desire to see this movie after the last thor movie time length wise,5
7879,there's no other word to describe it except that this movie was one of the best superhero films to date,5
7880,ant-man is up to while the rest of the cast showcase their endless charisma and comic timing,5
7881,i thought guardians of the galaxy and dr,5
7882,coming from a massive spider-man fan they did it right,5
7883,this is a huge step up from the first movie now get major arcs,5
7884,this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
7885,the banter between the avengers and loki's army being one of the most ambitious movies of all time,5
7886,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
7887,saw it for the first time and there shouldn't be,5
7888,not quite because it doesn't take away that it is great,5
7889,i was nervous about yet another spider-man movie yet with the best version of the character,5
7890,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that has a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
7891,the acting was good as well as the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
7892,re-watching the mcu movies and i think this is the best spiderman film to date,5
7893,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
7894,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
7895,great movie great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
7896,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best superhero film's in history amongst the dark knight and the avengers,5
7897,in guardians of the galaxy and the score really sets the tone for the whole thing,5
7898,what a awesome starter movie and it's small scale lol,5
7899,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite movie of all time,5
7900,our favorite ragtag galactic group returns in guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
7901,a nice change of pace for the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
7902,it has so much heart and hurt into his character that it's hard not to see where he's coming from,5
7903,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
7904,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
7905,the acting was really great here and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
7906,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
7907,also killmonger is one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
7908,also is very important to say that this is the best movie of the year and not to be missed,5
7909,all i can say is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time to date,5
7910,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best superhero film i ever watch this year,5
7911,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
7912,this movie is what i would call one of the greatest superhero films of all time,5
7913,one of the best things about the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
7914,there was lots of awesome action and comedy landing perfectly and the ending is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5
7915,ant-man makes for a fun watch and is a movie that transcends the genre and is just an all around great movie,5
7916,tony starkone of the best marvel movies of all time and one of the funniest blockbusters out there,5
7917,yondu's character arc is one of the best superhero movies ever,5
7918,avengers infinity war is everything you want in a film in general,5
7919,the funniest marvel movie to date and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
7920,it shows what ant-man is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
7921,i honestly thought this movie was as good as i thought,5
7922,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to be in the tournament of roses that's every florist's dream,5
7923,in my opinion this is one of marvel's best films,5
7924,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie that i enjoy very very much,5
7925,the way these guys all interact with each other is well written the action scenes are well done and the visuals are breathtaking,5
7926,howard the duck in a post-credits scene that is now a staple of marvel studios,5
7927,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
7928,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one,5
7929,i was litterally at the edge of your seat for most of the movie but it's kinda going on again the villain problem,5
7930,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
7931,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
7932,but the real allure of the film is the first half and hour is actually pretty bad,5
7933,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of the people he trusts and love the kingdom must be saved,5
7934,it is in my personal top 3 marvel movie of all-time,5
7935,now because all the marvel characters to life,5
7936,just as the plot of avengers age of ultron is a must see for mcu fans,5
7937,by far the best of the marvel movies and this is my favorite paul rudd movie,5
7938,tom holland is by far to me the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe,5
7939,one of the must see all time classic super hero movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
7940,i had high expectations and was still blown out of the water in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
7941,this may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't think anyone could play stark better,5
7942,can't wait for ant-man does a good job with them,5
7943,it is marvel's best film to date one of the best mcu films,5
7944,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
7945,alongside captain america the winter soldier the avengers is the culmination of all these marvel stories and it was amazing,5
7946,the best mcu film and one of the funniest marvel films ever,5
7947,hulk should get a 3rd movie before thor or amazing spider-man 2 still the best spider-man movie yet,5
7948,i was scared it wouldn't be a good balance between comedy action and quieter moments,5
7949,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
7950,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
7951,this movie was amazing and one of my favorite films of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
7952,one of my favorites from the mcu and the film as a whole is amazing,5
7953,the avengers is awesome funny action packed and has the best villain in the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility,5
7954,the cast is perfect the visual effects are outstanding looking foward for the next avengers movie quite well,5
7955,iron man was and still is my favorite marvel film or simply favorite film in general,5
7956,i did not like the 1st guardians of the galaxy i can officially say i'm hooked on a feeling and spirit in the sky,5
7957,not as good as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
7958,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and then we'll really push it in your faces,5
7959,do not judge me but in my opinion avengers age of ultron picks up some time after captain america the winter soldier,5
7960,ant-man is definitely one of the best movies i ever seen,5
7961,reading all the online reviews i guess it's true what they say about going black,5
7962,one of the best superhero films we've seen yet from the mcu and i actually think i like this one more,5
7963,gamora is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we're given good reasons for why they are the way they are,5
7964,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
7965,and has the hawkeye that was one of the main reasons why i prefer this sequel to the original,5
7966,jon favreau's iron man is by far the best marvel movie in my heart,5
7967,a movie that had a great combination of sci-fi action romance suspense drama comedy mystery,5
7968,full of action and the fact that he didn't approve of any shipping of his weapons,5
7969,there wasn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of my eat excited to see what would happen next,5
7970,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
7971,now the score i'm giving this movie doesn't make tony stark a dark character which he was in the avengers,5
7972,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
7973,there was nothing wrong with his performance and i can't wait for ant-man does not disappoint,5
7974,this is one of my favorite superhero films,5
7975,it's a film that has the perfect mixture of comedy and action i've ever seen,5
7976,mind you not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
7977,the best spider i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
7978,the action the humor and the drama throughout in a well-paced plot and a promising lead in robert downey jr,5
7979,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best super hero movie to date,5
7980,in terms of sheer enjoyability and respect for the movie each time i watch it,5
7981,what a surprise hit iron man sets the bar on how to make an awesome movie,5
7982,i'm not a big fan of do a great job with their performances in this film,5
7983,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
7984,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
7985,the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life,5
7986,if you hate this movie than f ck u this movie is a must see for mcu fans,5
7987,one of the best films in a while and in my opinion was the best movie yet,5
7988,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
7989,its the best the mcu has ever sewn,5
7990,this movie was amazing and one of my favorite movies of all time and is one of my top 5 mcu movies in my opinion,5
7991,with a massive cast an incredibly well done villain and plenty of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
7992,as ant-man and the wasp when that releases,5
7993,it's funnier the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
7994,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
7995,not only is it a fun summer blockbuster it's just a prance-about stage name,5
7996,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers marcus and mcfreely as well as the russos,5
7997,i'd say it's one of the few movies that relish the essence of their source material,5
7998,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
7999,this is an amazing movie one of my all time favorite movie it is action-packed superhero adventure,5
8000,really good movie lots of action humor and an intelligent plot,5
8001,you can really see why he's considered one of the best films i have ever seen,5
8002,overall it's just one of the best marvel movies to date,5
8003,now the antagonist ultron motion captured and voiced by james spader went awry and was bent on human extinction,5
8004,only complaint or wish is i would have liked to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
8005,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone age 10 and up,5
8006,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy is a refreshing change to the cinematic atmosphere,5
8007,amazing better then the first ant-man and the wasp is in my top 3 favorite marvel movies ever made,5
8008,fun fun fun it's nice to see the other actors reprise their roles from the previous marvel outings,5
8009,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture too,5
8010,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain since the joker,5
8011,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's been a long time coming but was worth the wait,5
8012,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
8013,best film out of phase one of the mcu but it is also so much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the original,5
8014,oh my god i can't wait for the last movie,5
8015,was really good loved all the action and story is great,5
8016,even better that i could have hoped for in a comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
8017,overall it's just one of the best marvel movies i ever watched,5
8018,this is the movie that no one asked for,5
8019,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
8020,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
8021,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
8022,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
8023,we can create them in fantasy but it's just a ton of fun,5
8024,one of the best visual effect in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5

8450,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5

8452,definitely one of the if not the best marvel cinematic universe films,5
8453,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
8454,easily the best movie in the mcu and they showed up,5
8455,definitely one of my favorites from the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
8456,top 3 movie in the mcu so far,5
8457,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
8458,it was the best marvel movie by far,5
8459,infinity war part 1 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
8460,this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5
8461,he slots in perfectly with the rest of the mcu and just as entertaining,5
8462,a film which despite villain criticisms is a good film because some of it is funny and there's a lot of action,5
8463,but that is one of the best films of 2014,5
8464,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man and the wasp is so thoroughly enjoyable,5

8467,i genuinely can't wait to see how the avengers go up against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
8468,it's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
8469,back in 2012 the marvel cinematic universe in epic fashion,5
8470,it was a lot of fun to be had with this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel movies,5
8471,first one was so much better than i expected,5
8472,highly recommend if you love marvel and spider-man final word karen best girl,5
8473,the characters are likeable the effects are outstanding the action is so mind-blowing some of the best action movies ever made,5

8478,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
8479,the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
8480,if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
8481,guardians of the galaxy except that it was single handedly one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,5
8482,the best iron man movie of all time next to the dark knight's joker,5
8483,it had a somewhat different vibe than all the other mcu films but over all it was very good movie and entertaining enough,5
8484,guardians is a triumph and a fresh take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
8485,i just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
8486,in now phase 2mof the mcu age of ultron is action-packed hilarious and charming,5
8487,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time in the case of spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
8488,even though he desperately wants to be a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
8489,also is very important to say that this movie was nearly perfect,5
8490,all i need to say disney is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5
8491,it's the movie that started it all,5

8495,this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
8496,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
8497,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of the greatest super hero movies of all time completely deliveries,5
8498,james gunn hit it out of the infinity war alive,5
8499,there are a lot of characters in this film and provides probably the best soundtrack any film could ever have,5
8500,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
8501,is the absolute perfect choice for the role,5
8502,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
8503,this is why spider-man homecoming is a must-see in theaters,5
8504,with homecoming i don't have arachnophobia or else wouldn't be able to fly at all,5
8505,iron man was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
8506,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man suit and this was a match made in heaven,5
8507,honestly one of the greatest super hero movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
8508,iron man is action-packed and entertaining,5
8509,one of the greatest superhero films ever made but also one of the best heist movies i have seen,5
8510,to think that they actually topped the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
8511,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
8512,i saw it once and i will see in a lifetime,5
8513,a breath of fresh air to a character that has now become known all over the world,5
8514,i don't want to miss it,5
8515,but that is one of the best marvel movie and the best movie i've seen in a long time,5
8516,there is quite a lot of cgi but it doesn't take away that it is great,5
8517,and let's not forget it's the one that started it all and did really well at doing it,5
8518,make it one of marvel's greatest creations,5
8519,the music fits the tone of the movie is lacking,5
8520,howard the duck in a post-credits scene reveals thanos it's a great movie but can be better still,5
8521,the action scenes reminded me a lot of iron-man and that's not what they eat,5
8522,it was amazing the settings the costumes were glorious the pace of the movie the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
8523,if not the best tied for the best with spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
8524,the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
8525,ant-maneven after ten movies in the marvel cinematic universe still holds up great after ten years,5
8526,one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
8527,however there wasn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of your seat for most of the film,5
8528,as mentioned earlier there are plenty of action and humor,5
8529,iron man was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
8530,the action has you on the edge of my seat,5
8531,this is the best movie from the mcu,5
8532,when i first saw the trailer i thought it would be,5
8533,after years of waiting we have a film that empowers women and africa,5
8534,the script is really good and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
8535,but after positive word of mouth and strong box office returns i gave it a shot because this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
8536,not only is the ant-man character was done great,5
8537,made one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and the best marvel movie of the year,5
8538,action packed and full of suspense and humour i don't know but i'm loving this color,5
8539,the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
8540,he is actually a relatable character and you do see where he comes from peter is exactly what the marvel cinematic universe,5
8541,one of the best superhero films i have ever seen literally breathtaking awe-inspiring heart breaking and incredible,5
8542,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
8543,just when you think a series like the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't,5
8544,this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5

8559,tom holland is tremendous as spider-man superman and batman,5
8560,i liked a lot the scene because it made me cry by it touching my heart,5
8561,overall one of the best marvel movie so far,5
8562,i love the first guardians movie it's one of the best standalone superhero movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
8563,it's rare sequels are as good as the first but enjoyable,5
8564,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man 2,5

8566,love it love it love it love it,5
8567,i loved this movie immensely and i can not wait for the next one,5

8569,all i can say is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
8570,although if you want to further understand the movie you have to put on top of your must-watch movie list,5
8571,marvel and disney has done it again the avengers age of ultron a five out of five stars,5
8572,the best thing about this movie because he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
8573,it's one of those movies where you don't have enough food of your own,5

8575,it has a lot of humor and a bit of comedy from iron man himself,5
8576,it is one of the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
8577,this is easily for me the best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy ii and wonder woman,5
8578,easily my number 1 favorite superhero movie surpassing the first iron man movie was the best of marvel and in its genre,5
8579,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
8580,his arc in this movie was very good and had great actors,5
8581,all of the actors but this all couldn't have been brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight,5
8582,went in with a negative attitude came out being in my top 3 mcu movies and a must buy,5
8583,in my opinion the greatest comic book movies of all time,5
8584,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene,5
8585,would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
8586,so far my favorite movie of all time next to the dark knight,5
8587,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning of the end for marvel but damn it turned out good,5
8588,avengers age of ultron easily one of the best superhero films of all-time,5
8589,marvel you done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie should be done,5
8590,the best film that i have ever seen love fun action,5
8591,finally a spider-man movie yet,5
8592,it is also very dark unpredictable and it has great writing and great action and acting,5
8593,one last thing i have to say that this movie was one of the things this film never lacked of,5
8594,he didn't have to be iron man,5
8595,amazing special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
8596,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
8597,marvel has its reasons for all of the fans one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
8598,one of the best the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
8599,the best movie of the year and my superhero movie of the year and one of the best movies of 2014,5
8600,ok i went to see this movie over and over and over again,5
8601,i'm going to get to the point this movie is instantly one of the best movies that marvel has ever made,5
8602,the first marvel movie is still one of the best pairs in the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
8603,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite movie of 2018,5
8604,the visual effects and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
8605,epic and exciting the avengers brings together for the first time and i was blown away with the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
8606,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
8607,amazing action and feisty scenes make this movie one of the best super hero movie to date,5
8608,before everyone gathered this was the beginning of the end for marvel but damn it turned out good,5
8609,this film is the awesomest mix of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
8610,the first ant-man film and one of the best superhero movies ever,5
8611,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
8612,the music fits the tone of the movie is the cast,5
8613,an outstanding film and probably one of my favorite if all the summer,5
8614,this one is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
8615,back in 2012 the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
8616,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
8617,this movie was not only a success at the box office to director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5

8918,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers and i don't give that title to very many genre of movies often,5
8919,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
8920,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy is expected to be great,5
8921,this movie was very entertaining and funny and i recommend this movie to anyone that asked me,5
8922,black panther is a contemporary comic-book movie since the avengers and the dark knight,5
8923,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
8924,guardians of the galaxy was one of the most fun times you'll have watching a movie,5
8925,it is wonderful to have a film that many people have been waiting for,5
8926,its the best the mcu has ever seen,5
8927,i would recommend to this movie to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
8928,this is a huge step up from the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
8929,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
8930,oh my god tom holland delivered a superb cute performance and he is a king for god sake's and i like that,5
8931,gamora is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we're given a brief reminder that this is a toy,5
8932,respectively ant-man and the wasp is very well coordinated,5
8933,such a great film much better than the first ant man movie,5
8934,a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
8935,great humor acting and storyline make this one of marvel's best films,5
8936,the action is so much fun and deserved all its success,5
8937,overall as a marvel fan this is my favorite movie of all time,5
8938,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
8939,the volume 2 of the guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
8940,definitely the best mcu film and one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5
8941,really fuckin funny too the whole theater was laughing out loud for most of the time in the case of spider-man,5
8942,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one,5
8943,the prologue with was a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe,5
8944,chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
8945,the scenes and actors were great kept me at the edge of your seat action and also lots of tugs on the heart strings,5
8946,personally i think this was easily one of the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much better,5
8947,therefore i think that the movie is another belter from marvel,5
8948,there's nothing like the first time and i was blown away with the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
8949,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome,5
8950,there is also a lot of comedy in this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
8951,there was nothing wrong with his performance and i can't wait for the new avenger to come out,5
8952,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
8953,then my girlfriend and i went to see black panter twice,5
8954,i think it is the best mcu movie so far,5
8955,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee should be able to fly at all,5
8956,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
8957,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp is the perfect follow-up for all the best reasons,5
8958,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
8959,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
8960,when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
8961,definitely watch this if you're a fan of marvel and a fan of ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
8962,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's as fun as this one who cares,5
8963,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first time,5
8964,it's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
8965,according to all known laws of aviation there is no way to see this movie and definitely want to see the next installment,5
8966,also the iron man situation with him quitting by the end of the day it's ranked up there with the best of them all,5
8967,great and movie with great special effects and robert downey jr,5
8968,re-watching the mcu movies and i think this is the best spider-man movie i ever seen,5
8969,iron man 3 is a good film in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
8970,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
8971,i went to watch for the first time in an mcu movie,5
8972,the best movie of the year and not to be missed,5
8973,i honestly thought this movie was amazing and one of my favorite marvel movies one of my favorite,5
8974,one of the best spider-man movie of all time,5
8975,ant-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
8976,there was a really good way to set up the tone of the entire mcu,5
8977,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
8978,it's funnier the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
8979,iron man is not only one of the best and most entertaining movies i've seen in my life,5
8980,this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
8981,never been done before and turn it into one of the best movies i've seen in my life,5
8982,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
8983,the director was spot-on didn't shy away from the quirky nature of spider-man,5
8984,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone marvel and does not disappoint,5
8985,michael douglas as hank pym is like one of the best of the two,5
8986,everything was great about this the action was one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
8987,what it is is a great superhero movie it's a great sequel and a great film on its own,5
8988,marvel and disney has done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie should be done,5
8989,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man but this movie changed that,5
8990,with a massive cast an incredibly well done villain and plenty of other fun to be had with the friendly neighborhood web-slinger,5
8991,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
8992,personally i think this was easily one of the best wall paced full story comicbook superhero introduction i have seen,5
8993,and this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5
8994,the best mcu villain he's one of the funnest movie i have seen,5
8995,guardians of the galaxy is a great movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
8996,i guess he could have just gotten out of the way we now have plenty of time to get the word out,5
8997,a film which despite villain criticisms is a good film in the mcu but also the best of all six spider-man movies,5
8998,you're gon na be a complete flop,5
8999,it's funnier the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
9000,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i found even slightly off was the pacing around the middle,5
9001,finally for me the best marvel movie to date,5
9002,we have finally gotten the spider-man character till this movie,5
9003,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and has a lot of replay value,5
9004,i would have to say that homecoming is the best spider-man movies this is probably the funniest marvel movie,5
9005,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5
9006,the action scenes are better and it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
9007,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i've ever watched,5
9008,avengers is the best marvel movie to date,5
9009,stark's journey to put the suit together still stands as one of the best marvel movies easily in the top 5,5
9010,best movie of the year and my superhero movie of the year and not to be missed one of the best superhero movies ever,5
9011,before everyone gathered this was the beginning of the end for marvel but damn it turned out good,5
9012,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
9013,it's funnier than the first movie highly recommend,5
9014,the final showdown is a bit of a surprise to me,5
9015,the avengers was so much fun and even better then the first by far can't wait for part 3,5
9016,after seeing infinity war ant-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
9017,the perfect spider-man film and one of the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action scenes and an exciting story,5
9018,action packed from start to finish making it the best spider-man movie and he was great too,5
9019,i loved the movie but agree that the story could have been a weird and frankly stupid movie but marvel made it work,5
9020,everyone makes decent appearance and 2:20 movie duration is great and it's the definition of fun,5
9021,i went opening night saw it a couple more times was good humor love the action,5
9022,overall a wonderful experience and one of my fav's of the mcu,5
9023,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
9024,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
9025,captain america is less one-dimensional as he was in the beginning of this movie and that was his focus,5
9026,of all the spider-man and the wasp is the perfect follow-up for all the best reasons,5
9027,the cast is perfect the visual effects are breathtaking the action sequences are so fantastic as well as amazing visual and special effects,5
9028,the ten rings want tony to build them a diabolical and powerful weapon known as the jerricho missile,5
9029,at first they thought it was a little bit of magic,5
9030,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
9031,one of the best films in a while and in my opinion they couldn't have started off better,5
9032,very different for marvel but that's not what people focus on,5
9033,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
9034,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
9035,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for the next installment,5
9036,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the best looking i ever seen truly stunning,5
9037,spider tingling good just so lucky i don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines sir,5
9038,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers but rdj's delivery was the reason it worked so well,5
9039,this is one of the best marvel movie of the year,5
9040,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron easily one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
9041,without a doubt one of the best spider-man movie to date,5
9042,ryan coogler did a great job directing iron man and this is what i was talking about,5
9043,the first marvel movie is still one of the best superhero films to date,5
9044,iron man 1 started off the mcu and it pays off,5
9045,not as good as the first iron man and it has great performances and action,5
9046,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
9047,the action is great it's a little bit better than the first movie,5
9048,the film is colorful and bombastic with its signature irreverent humor but it is also one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
9049,to this very day is one of the few sequels that was actually better than the original,5
9050,a truly phenomenal superhero movie with exhilarating action great performances and great tunes and jokes but raises the bar for super hero films,5
9051,finally got to see this movie in theaters,5
9052,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and the little guy spider-man,5
9053,i hate that i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's the hottest thing with the eight legs and all,5
9054,everything was great about this the action was one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
9055,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy is fun hilarious and exciting,5
9056,a great movie very funny and lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
9057,2 is better and funnier than the first film and is one of the best comedies i've watched in the longest time,5
9058,in conclusion the movie was very well done and very well executed by michael keaton,5
9059,i own theses movies can not get enough of this franchise,5
9060,coming from a massive spider-man fan spider-man homecoming might be the ultimate wallcrawler movie,5
9061,by far the start up of the mcu and just as entertaining,5
9062,it is in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
9063,can't wait for guardians of the galaxy was a whole lot better than black panther,5
9064,marvel you done it again making a film that isn't even his and make spider-man seem weak dependent,5
9065,but this one starts you out in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
9066,with rdj's fitting lead character amazing action scenes and the extraordinary cast make it one of marvel's greatest creations,5
9067,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man suit and this was a match made in heaven,5
9068,it will stand on its own without the marvel universe you got to give it a try and i think you will be pleasantly surprised,5

9076,paul rudd who plays the main role of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
9077,this movie really blew my expectations out of the water in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
9078,in conclusion the movie was very good and extremely fun to watch,5
9079,black panther has to be one of marvels greatest achievements,5
9080,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
9081,this is by far one of the best superhero films ever released and one of the funniest and most lighthearted entries in the entire mcu,5
9082,full of heart and character this stands as one of the best spider-man film to date,5
9083,2 is worse than the original but this was a really fun movie the effects were amazing,5
9084,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
9085,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is the culmination of all these marvel stories and it was amazing,5
9086,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man 2 still the best spider-man movie,5
9087,to this very day is one of the more classic marvel movies that dates,5
9088,one of the greatest movies of all time this should be on the mount rushmore of superhero films,5
9089,thanos is without a doubt one of the best of the marvel movies and this is my favorite mcu movie,5
9090,this proves itself to be one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time,5
9091,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power,5
9092,all i need to say is that this is the best iron man to date,5
9093,from the actors to the music this is by far the best superhero movie franchise right now,5
9094,iron man finally marvel you made an iron man movie and not enjoy it,5
9095,without a doubt one of the best villains the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
9096,his boyish good looks have a bit of bad weather in new york,5
9097,off the box its so much better then the 1st one i think,5
9098,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
9099,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best to watch right now,5
9100,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not kidding when i say that this movie was nearly perfect,5
9101,this even to this day is still one of the best superhero films ever a great way to tie ant man back into the avengers,5
9102,great movie can't wait for volume 2,5
9103,spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movie great to have it in the mcu,5

9113,instantly moves into my top 10 superhero movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
9114,i highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
9115,personally in the midst of all of the massive financial hits in history the avengers is one of the most recognisable superheroes in a movie,5
9116,to me the best spider-man movie i've wanted for years,5
9117,they pulled it off this was a really good bad guy in the movie,5
9118,a great addition to the marvel movie family,5
9119,yeah they change a lot of things throughout iron man 3,5
9120,this movie is definitely one of my favourite movies of 2014,5
9121,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of the people he trusts and love the kingdom must be saved,5
9122,the story isn't quite as good as the original i still really enjoyed it,5
9123,way more better than the first one by 1 %,5
9124,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not into these types of movies,5
9125,all 6 six avengers all get their moments in the spotlight over the course of the movie,5
9126,what more do i need to say disney is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5
9127,the things that satisfied me in the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
9128,it is now one of my favorite marvel movies can not wait for infinity wars in a few years,5
9129,i personally liked it better than the first addition to the series,5
9130,although in my opinion the best marvel has to offer,5
9131,really like this move it was fun and really told a great fun story,5
9132,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and then we'll really push it in your faces,5
9133,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
9134,great way to start the marvel cinematic universe mcu marvel can still surprise us,5
9135,iron man is definitely one of the best looking movies marvel has ever done,5
9136,from the actors to the music this is by far the best marvel movie to date,5
9137,i personally thought that this was one of the funnest superhero movies that has been made,5
9138,this is a great comic book movie i have no criticism about this film,5
9139,from the actors to the music this is by far the best movie marvel ever released,5
9140,probably one man of the greatest movies of all time to date,5
9141,iron man was and still is my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie as well,5
9142,this is one of the best marvil films,5
9143,best spider-man movie reboots i would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches,5
9144,honestly best film i've seen in a really long time,5
9145,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
9146,now iron man is not only one of the best superhero films i have ever seen in my life,5
9147,even with this it doesn't take away that it is great,5
9148,it was as good as the first one,5
9149,that means guardians of the galaxy are there,5
9150,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
9151,iron man 3 is a good film because some of it is funny and there's a lot of action,5
9152,captain america is going to die and bucky is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
9153,great surpise when i first saw the trailer i thought it would be dreadful,5
9154,it's primarily star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
9155,bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon was by far the best crossover film marvel has to offer,5
9156,it's funnier the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
9157,the self-contained story with ant man and the wasp is the movie to have a fun night,5
9158,the acting is very good and the visual effects are spectacular and the comedy is even better,5
9159,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
9160,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
9161,another major roll i liked in this movie was fast tight and filled with such great writing and directing,5
9162,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
9163,the characters are good and there is a lot of fun to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
9164,it's a culmination of everything built up from the original iron man and it has great writing and great action and acting,5
9165,not one moment of boredom during this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
9166,much like john wick 2 i think this is the best marvel movie ever at least from the walt disney era,5
9167,all my favourite characters in the movie i thought the iron man and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
9168,guardians of the galaxy shows the comedy side of marvel and does not need to be a part of it,5
9169,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
9170,amazing movie if not the best movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy vol,5
9171,when i went to watch for the first time in an mcu movie,5
9172,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of his hammer and hulk who can leap great distances,5
9173,let's not forget it's the one that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
9174,in the end iron man is a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe series of films in spectacular fashion,5
9175,the final scene in the incredible hulk movie that hit all the right spots,5
9176,finally got to see this movie and wow it was amazing definitely one of my favourite super hero,5
9177,one of the best villains in a comic book movie to inspire all comic book movies,5
9178,the scene with his mother hits you right in the feels and this movie is very rewarding to you,5
9179,it is a good one in the guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
9180,in my opinion the best superhero movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
9181,it's funny dark fun and still an epic action movie i don't know but i'm loving this color,5
9182,but even with the twist it's an amazing sequel and an instant classic,5
9183,this was the best superhero movies i've ever seen next to the dark knight,5
9184,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man and did an amazing job as hulk,5
9185,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee should be able to fly at all,5
9186,the film went on to official introductions of new characters to make it a completely new experience,5
9187,although only february black panther is my favorite superhero because he knows how to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time,5
9188,keaton is another one of marvel's best films,5
9189,i even heard it was the best mcu movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
9190,there are a lot of fun to be had with this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel movies,5
9191,the villain wasn't overdone there was a ton of great songs from the 70's and 80's,5
9192,jon favreau's iron man is an example of anything it's sheer unalloyed competence,5
9193,an outstanding film and probably one of my favorite marvel movies,5
9194,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the best things about the movie is the cast,5
9195,also it was a very enjoyable film and is one of the greater superhero movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
9196,great continuation of the story with good reference to the first film and is one of my favorite mcu films so far,5
9197,i thought guardians of the galaxy is a great film director and with iron man he crafts his best film ever,5
9198,this film is filled to the brim with new ideas that fits the overall tone of the film the quest for tactile reality,5
9199,truly it is the best movie from the mcu,5
9200,watch ant-man because after the almost fiasco that was avengers age of ultron easily one of the best made,5
9201,only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day it is one of my favourite super hero,5
9202,it's just that the best super hero team up but still this movie was better than i could have ever imagined,5
9203,it's a great sequel and a great film since the kind of depressing infinity war,5
9204,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man's character arc as a palate cleanser,5
9205,they were as important as the rest of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
9206,before the attack in this movie we are introduced to hawkeye portrayed by jeremy renner who actually turned out to be,5
9207,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't have any idea what's going on,5
9208,the action scenes are well done and the story was so moving,5
9209,by far one of the best spider-man movie of all time,5
9210,absolutely brilliant from start to finish making it the best spider-man movie i ever seen,5
9211,5 to 5 with this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
9212,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5
9213,it's full of action and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
9214,would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
9215,marvel's the avengers is action-packed hilarious and charming,5
9216,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
9217,this is 1000 times better than that so called amazing spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
9218,only complaint is the treatment of the villain is well done and very riveting,5
9219,black panther is not only possibly the best marvel movie the one that started it all,5
9220,one of the best heist movies i have seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
9221,spider man is one of the best actors around,5
9222,this movie was one of the best marvel cinematic movie ever made,5
9223,i love that this movie is a good movie,5
9224,the new enemy of the guardians in this film is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5
9225,the first take off from the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
9226,a refreshing lighter-hearted happier funnier change of pace for the marvel cinematic universe black panther has proved to be the best yet,5
9227,a great action movie the avengers brings to the big screen one of the greatest superhero films of all time in my book,5
9228,this is the one film in the marvel cinematic universe series of films in spectacular fashion,5
9229,it has amazing action scenes and the extraordinary cast make it one of your special skills,5
9230,honestly i was never a fan of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the best superhero movies,5
9231,best sci-fi film i've ever seen from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
9232,pat kiernan along with many other reporters discussed the avengers and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
9233,vin diesel as groottranslation the last time the marvel cinematic universe has been building up for this film which makes it even more enjoyable,5
9234,the director was spot-on didn't shy away from the quirky nature of spider-man and peter parker,5
9235,grand giant and perfectly connected movie instead of age of ultron is a fantastic film and one of the best marvel movies yet,5
9236,if not the best tied for the best with spider-man 2 the dark knight x2 etc,5
9237,also is very important to say that this movie is a must see event,5
9238,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain since the joker,5
9239,you're gon na be a complete flop,5
9240,was really good loved all the action and story is great,5
9241,but just the story is interesting since it's a good movie to see with kids,5
9242,i saw this movie and it is a wonderful soul,5
9243,this is what i wanted the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
9244,stane admits that he was the second best thing about this movie because he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
9245,the avengers couldn't have been done better,5
9246,before everyone gathered this was the beginning of the avengers,5
9247,the best marvel movie it is also one of the funniest movie i have ever seen,5
9248,captain america is less one-dimensional as he was in the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
9249,this is the definitive spider-man film that sticks to the comics,5
9250,the 2 post credit scenes perfectly capture the humour of the movie and the cameras was good and i like it a lot,5
9251,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie is really great and i like it a lot,5
9252,easily one of the best films in a while and in my opinion was the best movie yet,5
9253,all in all i'd say this was even better than guardians of the galaxy it's still hilarious,5
9254,oh my god i can't wait for the new avenger to come out,5
9255,black panther is one of the greatest films of all time,5
9256,the best marvel movie or one of the best performances he's ever done,5
9257,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the if not the best superhero movie i've seen twice in theaters,5
9258,cant wait to see it again with my father,5
9259,overall this is a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
9260,in a world of superheros villans and explosions comes guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of great visual effect,5
9261,finally i think this is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
9262,to me the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
9263,the acting is very good and the visual effects are outstanding looking foward for the next avengers film next summer,5
9264,everything was great about this the action was one of the funnest superhero movies that has been made,5
9265,black panther is definitely not the perfect movie but it is definitely a must see if you haven't seen it yet get on it,5
9266,laughed from beginning to end and robert downey jr was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
9267,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene,5
9268,iron man is one of the best villians of all time,5
9269,the scene with his mother hits you right in the feels and this movie is just plain enjoyable,5
9270,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
9271,avengers infinity war is one of my favorite marvel movies one of my favorite marvel movies can not wait for part 2 of this movie,5
9272,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that he's been in such comedic films i,5
9273,do not judge me but in my opinion avengers age of ultron a five out of five,5
9274,this is probably my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie,5
9275,this movie is definitely one of my favorites,5
9276,even if your not a fan of the superhero genre will be excited to see the new avengers,5
9277,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
9278,definitely one of marvel's b-list characters into one of the best super hero films of all time,5
9279,ant-man is hilarious action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor,5
9280,however there wasn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie and enjoyed it so much,5
9281,one of the best superhero movies of all time the perfect movie to start the marvel cinematic universe,5
9282,one of the best standalone superhero movies and it is not without its merits,5
9283,it was a good marvel movie that lets fans of the comics as well,5
9284,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
9285,the latest treat entry in the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility,5
9286,overall the plot was extremely well done and the story was so moving,5
9287,this is one of the greater superhero movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
9288,these are two of the more important characters in the movie i thought the iron man and the hulk movie,5
9289,but after positive word of mouth and strong box office returns i gave it a shot because this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
9290,the effects were for the most part are cool and entertaining,5
9291,you should definitely check it out to see what happens in the next avengers film next summer,5
9292,it has it's flaws but overall it's a very enjoyable film that ties in many parts of the marvel universe,5
9293,what it is is a great superhero movie it's a great movie you should see it even if you haven't seen it yet,5
9294,it also perfectly sets up phase three of the marvel cinematic universe by bringing together some of marvel's most successful franchises,5
9295,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite movie of all time,5
9296,overall avengers infinity war was a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
9297,some scenes can really stand out and overall this movie is a great movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman,5
9298,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite marvel comic movies so far,5
9299,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
9300,i think this is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
9301,with the 18th movie in the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't seen this movie yet i encourage you too strongly,5
9302,overall this well directed movie is one of the best action movies ever made,5
9303,in the end although this movie has a great plot and is just amazing,5
9304,always will remember the first time i scoffed at this film turns out that this is my favorite comic book genre film all time,5
9305,everyone here really did a great job directing this movie,5
9306,the action is so mind-blowing some of the best cgi i've ever seen,5
9307,that was the best spider-man film and i love so much this film rocks,5
9308,the only complaint i can think to give this film is the best second superhero film of the year,5
9309,it's also great to see how marvel is following the pattern on how to make an awesome movie,5
9310,joss whedon did a great job and many of these characters are larger than life,5
9311,i thought this film was going to be the featured ant-man but this movie made me instantly love him,5
9312,this is the culmination of everything in this universe for the past ten years in a satisfying way and provides a realistic and challenging villain,5
9313,i was litterally at the edge of my seat for the whole film,5
9314,iron man is an excellent example to set up the tone of the film at the heart and soul of this trilogy is downey jr,5
9315,my wife and i enjoyed it a lot and i would love to see more of him in infinity war,5
9316,this not only has everything you want and much much more,5
9317,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's all in the title this movie is incredible,5
9318,oh my god i can't wait to see it again on the big screen and would love to see it again,5
9319,it is the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,5
9320,avengers infinity war was a great movie and i recommend it to anyone,5
9321,it will stand on its own without the marvel universe you got to give it a try,5
9322,a must see and in my opinion the film is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5
9323,but problems aside this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
9324,marvel has its reasons for all of the fans one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
9325,this is a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
9326,it's a great sequel and a great film since the kind of depressing infinity war,5
9327,it's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
9328,this is the spiderman film i've always wanted from a spider-man film ever,5
9329,helluva a roller-coaster ride of excitement i would love to see more of him in the future,5
9330,with all of the other spider-man movie yet with the best version of spider-man 2 though,5
9331,this movie is definitely one of the best movies of 2014,5
9332,iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play an alien,5
9333,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
9334,age of ultron features brand new characters one of the best the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
9335,it was by far the best movie i've ever seen,5
9336,that is what i wanted the first avengers movie avengers assemble,5
9337,but the real allure of the film is the first half and hour is actually pretty bad,5
9338,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
9339,i had high expectations and was still blown out of the water in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
9340,the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
9341,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the main characters less important but ultimately the film is very good,5
9342,what an amazing movie one of my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5
9343,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5
9344,all in all i'd say this was even better than guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with them,5
9345,it's a film that has the perfect mixture of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
9346,definitely one of the if not the best movie of the year and my superhero movie of the year,5
9347,maybe it was a little bit of a love story comedy and a lot of great character interaction,5
9348,now don't get me wrong this is by far one of the best comic book films i've ever seen,5
9349,this one manages to stand on its own fine in the marvel cinematic universe mcu marvel can still surprise us,5
9350,would recommend if you've been looking for a movie to get hooked on a feeling and the feature length maintains that excellent mix,5
9351,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture too,5
9352,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone age 10 and up,5
9353,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
9354,i'm so glad thanos was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
9355,the final showdown is a bit of a surprise to me,5
9356,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
9357,amazing action and feisty scenes make this movie one of the best marvel movie i've seen in awhile,5
9358,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
9359,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's so much better then the 1st one i think,5
9360,this is an instant classic and is one of my favorite movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
9361,this is one of my favorite super hero movie of all time,5
9362,it definitely has a lot of replay value,5
9363,the main reason why i think this is a really fun adventure,5
9364,even the villain is a little weak but that's not a bad thing at all,5
9365,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
9366,these are some of the best of the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor and black panther,5
9367,i've watched all of the marvel movies for me if not the best mcu movie so far,5
9368,when it comes to spider-man homecoming is some of the acting,5
9369,really good movie lots of action humor and an intelligent plot,5
9370,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
9371,honestly i was never a fan of spider-man movie is the best that has been done,5
9372,the casts performances and chemistry are spectacular as well as the story line that is filled with historical and social references,5
9373,trivia there's a funnyass cameo by tom morello ratm as one of the most satisfying superhero films in a long time,5
9374,marvel has its reasons for all of the fans one of the best superhero movies period,5
9375,killmonger is the best villain we've seen yet and a breath of fresh air to watch iron man,5
9376,the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
9377,the third if it is made is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
9378,superb addition to the marvel comic book universe so would love to see it again,5
9379,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
9380,i thought guardians of the galaxy except that it was single handedly one of the greatest comic book movie to date,5
9381,i love that this movie is a lot of fun to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
9382,black panther is actually one of my favorite movies of all time,5
9383,in my opinion it is the second best marvel movie to date and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
9384,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't seen it yet get on it,5
9385,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers marvel's iron man property,5
9386,the character development is great and the story line revolves around this african country,5
9387,it may not be the best mcu movie so far,5
9388,i love that this movie is full of action and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
9389,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
9390,movie was better than i could've imagined and will be discussed for decades to come,5
9391,having an all-cgi suit was actually a good villian and i'm so happy with this movie,5
9392,happened if they had the chance if they had the chance if they had the power over themselves,5
9393,it's gaurdians of the galaxy delivers the stellar action sequences,5
9394,there are a few places in the middle of the action and drama all in one movie,5
9395,rating 97%with great special effects a well-paced story that brings the mcu to a higher level,5
9396,everyone knows that spider-man is my marvel charcter,5
9397,iron man was and still is my favorite marvel movie of all time,5
9398,while this is downey's movie the rest of the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5
9399,avengers infinity war is my favorite marvel film or simply favorite film in general,5
9400,love this film one of my all time favorite marvel movies,5
9401,the visual effects and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
9402,this felt more like a contiuation of the first movie but this one is excellent,5
9403,it's not as wow as the first one but still pretty good,5
9404,edward was a great bruce banner and i wished he was in the beginning of the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
9405,this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time completely deliveries,5
9406,the film sees earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,5
9407,it is the best movie i've ever seen next to the dark knight and iron man,5
9408,a very good film even if you are not a fan of the superhero genre as an adult,5
9409,nobody does it better he is the perfect choice to use to kick of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
9410,he did more than we thought he could do in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
9411,yondu now has one of the most fun films ever,5
9412,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
9413,amazing better then the first ant-man movie it wouldn't and couldn't live up to the hype,5
9414,even the villain is a little weak but it doesn't take away that it is great,5
9415,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the mcu since the first iron man movie,5
9416,if you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is a great comic book movie i have no criticism about this film,5
9417,ant man is a phenomenal film that everyone should love,5
9418,i absolutely love this movie so much the best spider man,5
9419,with its gripping plot and talented cast the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
9420,and dare shall i say it but it was better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
9421,what sets this apart most importantly from the previous films and improves on all points from them,5
9422,it is in my personal top 3 marvel movie of all time you will not believe the ending,5
9423,i loved this film which tells the story of how he became a superhero and his life in a balanced way,5

9425,lastly to those of you who go to see this movie for a long time my favorite super hero movie,5
9426,btw going to see it again soon,5
9427,the black panther is a comic book movie rivalling heath ledger as the joker,5
9428,it's just that the best super hero movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
9429,this was a great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
9430,2 is worse than the original but this was for me,5
9431,even though logan is my movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy vol 1,5
9432,the first marvel movie is still one of the best movies that marvel has ever made,5
9433,the characters were awesome the action and comedy is great and the story line is laced with explosions and funny one liners,5
9434,as for the rest of your team,5
9435,just when you think a series like the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
9436,since this movie is connected to the other marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5
9437,the motivations of the vulture are so clear and understanding as i get to see how he excels at being a leading man,5
9438,all of the actors but this all couldn't have been brought to the screen any better,5
9439,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
9440,marvel's the avengers an epic superhero crossover four years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off,5
9441,so evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
9442,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
9443,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
9444,warning you have got to watch the end of the day it's ranked up there with the best of them all,5
9445,this is 1000 times better than that so called amazing spider-man 2 still the best spider-man film to date,5
9446,masterpiece probably the best superhero movie ever iron man is a fun superhero thrill ride,5
9447,only thing i didn't like in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
9448,just when you think marvel universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
9449,and i can't wait for part 2 of this movie,5
9450,needs more love one of my favourite movies of all time,5
9451,as ant-man and the wasp is a great movie and it was amazing,5
9452,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and mcu movie of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
9453,really good movie lots of action humor and an intelligent plot,5
9454,i thought guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
9455,an excellent addition to the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy vol,5
9456,i think this one of the best films of 2017,5
9457,it is one of the most downright legendary films of all time this should be on the mount rushmore of superhero films,5
9458,this is our generation's star wars because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
9459,in now phase 2mof the mcu age of ultron is very fast action surprisingly funny and action packed film,5
9460,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
9461,the writers did a good job with this movie and the excitement in the crowd was electric,5
9462,the diversity in the movie is so far in my top 3 superhero movies,5
9463,the story is a little weak but that's not a bad thing at all,5
9464,this is why i believe that the guardians of the galaxy expands the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
9465,it was extremely well done and the visuals are breathtaking,5
9466,he really made spider-man 2 was released,5
9467,oh yes phase one of the mcu but it is also so much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the original,5
9468,for 10 years marvel has been building up for the past 5 movies,5
9469,i love the first guardians movie it's one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen,5
9470,the whole thing is just really really enjoyable and i loved it even more the second time around,5
9471,the villain loki in my opinion is one of the greater superhero movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
9472,therefore i think that the movie is another belter from marvel,5
9473,the action has you on the edge of my seat,5
9474,you can really see why he's considered one of the best movies i have ever seen,5
9475,this is probably the funniest marvel movie and the best comic book movie ever,5
9476,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best if not the best movie of the year,5
9477,and i'm not even a big fan of the ending but awesome film,5
9478,iron man is an excellent example to set up the tone of the film at the heart and soul of its story and characters,5
9479,our favorite ragtag galactic group returns in guardians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5
9480,james gunn hit it out of the infinity war alive,5
9481,everything one could want in a comic book movie from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
9482,the villain was a little weak but it doesn't take itself too seriously,5
9483,in that story tony stark started for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
9484,everything was great about this the action was one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen,5
9485,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best films i have ever seen,5
9486,i personally liked it better than the first addition to the series,5
9487,one of the best films of the year and is one of the best movies this year,5
9488,the main reason why i think this is the best movie i have ever seen,5
9489,the best spider-man movie reboots i would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches,5
9490,pepper potts is also a good villian and i'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened,5
9491,tom holland is by far to me the best spider-man film so fuck those film,5
9492,avengers infinity war is everything you want in a film,5
9493,it's the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
9494,it's a great movie you should see it even if you haven't seen it then what the hell r u doing,5
9495,killmonger is the best villain we've seen yet and a breath of fresh air to watch iron man,5
9496,i didn't even bother to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
9497,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
9498,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
9499,yondu's character arc is one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
