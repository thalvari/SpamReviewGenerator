0,i'd love to leave a photo but i can't get it to pass 2,2
1,i have now had this for several months and find it difficult at best to manage competently,2
2,after that day i threw this piece of junk and trade it for a blackberry plan,2
3,because i am a dancer and instructor and use my phone with a heavy hand at all either,2
4,however after i got it it was broken and they sent me another iphone 4 case,2
5,there are tags of it hanging off uneven corners and it looks like a bumper but it actually still protects the back,2
6,however there are a number of other colors,2
7,the other two just stopped outputting sound in one of the usb ports is a deal breaker,2
8,the case is cute and i think the color is not teal which is what i ended up doing,2
9,the case was inexpensive so i am not happy with these,2
10,the international version uses the samsung exynos 5 processor not the qualcom snapdragon 800,2
11,i have owned my iphone 4s for just about a year and the battery life reception and ruggedness of the s10-hd,2
12,the covers over the volume buttons were a little flat and the top row is hard to get rid of the bubbles 1 star,2
13,when taking the case off the phone but it's still not that bad for less then two bucks,2
14,while you can get an iphone 5 into this case it's so hard i almost break my nails,2
15,this was ok while it lasted but then the plastic chipped and now it wont turn on at all,2
16,this thing makes your phone bulky and it will be in the way a lot and won't fit in the case,2
17,it was only after using my wife's lg phone with similar results,2
18,eventually griffin replaced it and they are a cheap alternative for something temporary,2
19,i thought about getting another since they are so cheap but i guess it's just the adhesive on this protector is very strong,2
20,it was great but after a week or two of usage the stitching began coming apart rapidly,2
21,a little thicker than i expected it too,2
22,update i actually was very happy with the way it looked but the sparkles are falling off after one use,2
23,i tested it out to see it work right away one of the two things at a time on this device,2
24,i purchased this one because i have the older phone,2
25,it provides no protection for the sides as the vents on the sides of the mount apart but i can,2
26,another thing i noticed with these is that they are terribly uncomfortable and unbalanced,2
27,i was excited to give it a 2 start review,2
28,save your money and don't have confidence it would protect the phone in case i drop it,2
29,in addition the earbud does not fit my galaxy 3 with extended battery properly,2
30,i purchased this case for my s3 and when i first put this on the phone my phone would freeze,2
31,now the word diamond is used however it is not shock as shock absorbing as i need,2
32,the belt clip needs to be made smaller or else it should come with more than a usb adapatar,2
33,there's no quick way to pop this on my ear it didn't feel like it would protect my precious note 2,2
34,both pieces are lightweight and junky but they did not make the orange for note 3,2
35,item was purchased to replace a broken case and it did not stick around the edges of the phone and then back on,2
36,first off the instructions are not explained well,2
37,they couldn't explain why thier sound bar didn't want to muck around that much so i called plantronics customer service,2
38,also i used it on the disk,2
39,i was able to get it off the iphone,2
40,because despite being very careful with the way i took care of it immediately even though motorola is supposed to resolve warranty issues,2
41,while they're definitely better than the abysmal headphones i really think it's worth the premium pricing of their products,2
42,i bought this for traveling to charge two phones and or phone with ipad,2
43,i purchased 2x of these cases one for my wife's phone since hers dies all the time,2
44,at first the batteries worked excellent and i couldn't keep it on without constantly adjusting it,2
45,the connector end is a fraction too large so you have to take off the case to wipe the drops off,2
46,so be aware that you might not be very satisfied with this case and the edges on both sides makes it feel really bulky,2
47,i've tried this is my least favorite by a very wide margin,2
48,i like the material it is made of cheap-feeling material,2
49,i always used water apply screen protectors but i must say it does not fit the whole screen,2
50,i need a charger that hold more power so i went with covering the main area and the buttons only,2
51,installed perfectly i was rubbing out bubbles to the edges and its on securely compared to the stock battery,2
52,feels cheap and does not fit the maxx hd very well,2
53,i was very hurt the way i was expecting it to last at least few months,2
54,i was very excited when i opened the box and pulled out the case,2
55,it is definitely not worth the high price,2
56,but based on the button issue is a bit of a glare but i did not get what i asked for,2
57,now it doesn't work for me besides the above it's a bit easier to open,2
58,also the cellphone's gps is by far the best i have used on any of my phones,2
59,made it very difficult to put on her phone and doesn't line up well or the holes don't align very well,2
60,scratches are very easy to get the bubbles of air out of the screen but that isn't why i returned it,2
61,i'm not a newcomer to android phones i've had cases break after taking the phone out,2
62,so needless to say i am somewhat disappointed,2
63,the case itself appears durable but i won't buy again didn't really like either,2
64,the cons had to watch a youtube video to tell you how much power it has left,2
65,takes over a week to get use to the size of the fob tag,2
66,very flimsy not much protection for my phone,2
67,if anyone want to buy a 5 pack of any brand for the same amount of time that my wall charger does2,2
68,i also found the controls to be easy to apply since i've applied many protector films before,2
69,i also use the usb port for the ipad still works,2
70,very cheaply made not a fan of this product and company,2
71,i hear everyone super clearlythe bad bluetooth connection to the phone or how to get the bubbles out,2
72,first case had a warped foot the little rubber foot that looks like a mini hdmi plug to charge the hk250 as well,2
73,suggestions for easier application of the screen protector causing sides to bubble up,2
74,i know i know what do you expect for the price which was a mistake,2
75,flimsy looks cheapordered it as a replacement for my galaxy nexus,2
76,as soon as i turned my head or raised my arm,2
77,after trying several sheets i have given up and gone back to the khomo,2
78,i know this is not a very good product,2
79,i really wanted to like this charging system but i just can't do it unless you scroll down and click on it there instead,2
80,i like the sleek look of my iphone with it on there so i took it off to clean it,2
81,i could hear the button clicking but it didn't protect the phone all that well,2
82,this could be a great smartphone it's got a lovely feel to it not exactly a rich feeling,2
83,if they haven't been able to get to work,2
84,i am not sure it is going to take a month to get here and it ships from china,2
85,when watching videos on wifi with the phone it drops its charge time dramatically,2
86,they make their money on people like me who realize that i'll be replacing the phone with a soft shirt,2
87,the material started shredding after only two weeks it just stopped charging my daughter's phone,2
88,if you are use to bb's with a trackball you are going to clip the case holster inside his pocket instead of outside,2
89,the pink hard case doesn't lay flat,2
90,i have had lots of people complain about background noise all the time wind and other noises,2
91,i just ordered this and the estimated delivery date is about 1-2 months to warn other buyers about the ridiculously slow shipping,2
92,i didn't expect much for the price that i paid,2
93,it is a very pretty shade but they should do away with the virtual one and touchscreen altogether,2
94,and then it just didn't fit right,2
95,i had to wash my case to get rid of the preinstalled apps and maybe get by,2
96,to be fair it is a weak signal area to begin with but that wasn't the case,2
97,the fit is loose enough that i don't like the sound quality a rating of 5 10,2
98,arrived when the package was opened other than that the case is probably better than most for heat dissipation,2
99,the wire also started to rupture after a few weeks of use and have effectively ruined the case,2
100,i have had the case for a very short period of time after placement,2
101,i also question if it's even convenient to have to rely on the usb port of a computer,2
102,this made it rough but i didn't pay a lot for it,2
103,it seemed to offer exactly what i wanted problem is that it is very fragile with only two wires holding it in place,2
104,i would have a hard time trying to put it on or take it off,2
105,i bought these as i didn't find a solution,2
106,i thought this wouldn't be a problem if you want to use covers,2
107,i wouldn't have ordered it if i had known i was buying a sleek black case,2
108,note that i didn't even have to charge for 2 days and then i would get an improved product,2
109,the headset looked good for the price and i hate mailing it in return,2
110,in my opinion this case doesn't line up right and repeatedly powers the phone off,2
111,this is not just annoying when you are using your phone occasionally while plugged in to the power source,2
112,it has a glossy back so it doesn't stay put on the windshield very well either,2
113,i already replaced it with another bluetooth because i couldn't find the original package,2
114,the rubberized edging especially on the right side of my phone so i won't comment on that,2
115,to charge your compatible phone wirelessly you need to buy another case for the 5s and install another screen protector,2
116,after 5 minutes of driving i had to remove the film should be place on the bottom instead of the top,2
117,the amazonbasics iphone case is very nicely designed and the white color goes onto the pink of the case,2
118,the first month i had it so it's a slow charger,2
119,its just a matter of time before it needs to be a little to small to fit battery in charger,2
120,after all the hype about openness and freedom to use the device from further than the supplied 4 ft from apple charger,2
121,trying to place the rubber covered phone in the belt clip was also hard and complicated and it was not what i was expecting,2
122,this one is highly transparent but it is about 1 2 inch too short,2
123,not very functional but it's a great looking screen,2
124,guess the galaxy s5 just doesn't have that sticky trait so it doesn't look like this the way the protector makes it,2
125,fit and feel is nice but it does not fit the htc dna not even close,2
126,this black leather case has a nice look and feel to it,2
127,changing the case is hard enough to protect the iphone 4 from bumps moisture and scratches,2
128,it does have a kickstand on it but i can and will make due but a little unhappy with the outcome,2
129,this works great i use it on airplanes to charge my phone and the case fell to the floor,2
130,i didn't seem to last as long as the real battery after they are charged,2
131,it was very cute but the bow fell off within 5 minutes,2
132,it's not as good as the first,2
133,this looks cool but all of the crystals on the back,2
134,multiple attempts by repair techs and the case would not snap completely closed over the tablet no matter how i adjusted the boom,2
135,won't buy another nor will i recommend their products to my fellow travellers,2
136,looks awesome until you use it for about 1week and unsatisfied,2
137,maybe they are so cheap but i guess it's a battery thing,2
138,the charger is very compact and works great in my car but my wife and others complained they could not hear me at all,2
139,this is going to scratch the sides of the phone completely making it impossible to use,2
140,before i bought this item because i liked the sleek design so much,2
141,also you can't very well sit down with your phone in your front pocket and never drop a call,2
142,it looks like nice leather in the picture but that may just be my phone,2
143,overall not a good quality cable like the mediasmart microusb it just can not put out the volume i was looking for,2
144,comes with a hard case and need a slimmer holster,2
145,clever gadget but no extra room in the case works just fine,2
146,i had trouble putting it on and take it off when it lifted off by mistake,2
147,i guess it would protect but can't comment on how the port holes line up,2
148,so i've had this product for about 5 months i should have,2
149,the earpiece and cable feel sturdy enough to last the sound in the left bud became muted or cut on and off,2
150,in fact i had to push really hard,2
151,i also noticed that i can not plug a usb into it,2
152,so maybe that is why the price is so cheap but no question i would spend the extra 10-15 dollars anyday,2
153,amazon would charge me 6 to ship it back to them after a crash had broken a part again paying for shipping,2
154,there are other good phones but the note 3 doesn't last i will be done with that company forever,2
155,i was not happy with the one i received was used scratched and beat up,2
156,this one however is poorly designed and doesn't work well if your using a case with your phone,2
157,this is a bit odd and if you reach up to make the headset forget it's last paired device,2
158,at lowest brightness setting i can't see myself ever using it,2
159,save your money and get the real deal,2
160,this case look so cheap in person and this was the first phone i pair up as phone 2,2
161,instead what was in the photo and not have to worry about breaking this when you throw it in your pocket,2
162,so if you just need a cell phone to actually talk to people,2
163,i was very disappointed in the quality of the calls is general bad,2
164,the first scratch i put in mine was the pattern to unlock my phone and such other things like that,2
165,i have been a fan of spigen forever,2
166,would not always reconnect when i'd get out of a chinese finger trap pretty much every movement makes things worse,2
167,and forget trying to use speakerphone the other person can hear me and other times they can't,2
168,i'm very disappointed mainly because i really don't like the clip on to belt attachment,2
169,i forget my cellphone at home all the time and shortened battery life really limit the use of this fob,2
170,they are very lightweight and they don't keep a charge nearly as long as i need too before the magpul case is released,2
171,i also found there was a lot of static even when within a few feet of the headset the sound flickers in out,2
172,what made me set this aside and find another case is that it's actually a sleeve that you slide your phone into,2
173,move the cable a bit and it kept my iphone relatively safe,2
174,this case didn't hold up as i would have hoped,2
175,it wasnt what i expected i never use it because it's very cheap for a pack of 3,2
176,i made the mistake of ordering this before i realized that the blue light on the side to see whether it charged or not,2
177,sadly i think motorola was in a hurry to make a phone call,2
178,powerbanks are great things to have to keep track of your belongs in the general area,2
179,mine broke within the first couple weeks requiring you to carry the charger with you you don't have one,2
180,in fact it was cut short around the lips and seemed too big for the iphone 4s was also pretty easy,2
181,it has a chance to become a great phone but no driver for it,2
182,despite the review warnings i went ahead and got it anyway,2
183,it should have been this way and if you have no previous radio control experience and try to overfly it,2
184,the framed portion for fitting the iphone is poorly laid out and i can not verify that the feature is working,2
185,now to be fair my biggest problem with them is due to my phone or the cable,2
186,it would charge the battery but leave it in a hot car even for a few hours it would switch back on and work again,2
187,not a very strong case for everyday use at the office,2
188,it charges the phone ok with a wall plug which it did nt,2
189,i have tried it with several phones and it will not connect to any lightning device while in the battery pack,2
190,the left side doesn't come up to my expectations,2
191,now the other side has a problem too and i have to take this case off i literally broke all my nails,2
192,since this was the most important feature to me i am returning the product because it does not have dust covers for ports,2
193,one suggestion for spigen perhaps put 3 screen protectors in a short period of time after placement,2
194,i am using it now for a number of reasons i have dinged it down to 3 stars,2
195,forget using the music application for some reason it is difficult to remove,2
196,if the device worked like it did in the product picture that you tug on to slide the phone up out of the case,2
197,i followed all the instructions for application were cryptic at best but once i figured out how to correct this issue,2
198,i contacted the seller via amazon and they sent me another iphone 4 case,2
199,when i received it put it on the body of the case has started to develop cracks around the edge after only six months,2
200,after figuring how to get it to work despite contacting the manufacturer for troubleshooting,2
201,sometimes when using this with my lg specturm and the product seems to work fine but the audio quality was not especially crisp,2
202,i noticed right away because the light was not working when i put the 2nd one the one that is working,2
203,i like the design of the case itself with no way to bypass those warnings,2
204,size i listed this as a pro but i found it to be a spare charger cable it's almost useless to me,2
205,the texture of this product was actually harder for me to get the product to fit just right,2
206,after 3 weeks i had to remove this everytime i need to charge my phone to see if it breaks down the film any better,2
207,the micro usb port seems much sturdier than mophie-the main reason i went ahead and got a custom rom,2
208,moreover the new chargers flow charge up to 3-4 times slower than the stock charging cord that my puppy ate,2
209,i just didn't like the 2 part port gasket fight each time you want to charge your phone each time,2
210,it is exactly what i wanted makes it easy to hold and it doesn't work very well on my android tablet,2
211,easier said then done if you have a hyundai i do not suggest getting this,2
212,i just returned it as i got another case that have much better sound for not a whole lot,2
213,been 17 hours since i applied the protector,2
214,fits so loose that it becomes a balancing act to keep them in place comes off and leaves your cords on the floor,2
215,it's also very light and the earloop isnt even worth talking about smh,2
216,a companies customer service is just as good as the battery that came with the otterbox ranks near or at the bottom of mine,2
217,so keep that in mind you may have to replace every 6 months,2
218,so what we have here is essentially highly disposable expensive in the long run make you a happier technology-lover aka nerd,2
219,next time don't cover the volume power buttons and access the usb port,2
220,i then slid a credit card between the phone and the usual warning message would pop up on my 5s,2
221,i like the 34 rnd dock and 2nd battery charger for samsung galaxy s4 active i9295 purple and i enjoy that case much more,2
222,if you are getting one of these and paid for it in october,2
223,decent case overall but if you use your phone as the charging device,2
224,it leaves a gap that allows dust and dirt to get into your phone,2
225,sadly we are going to look for another brand,2
226,in concept this thing is a strobe light,2
227,i put one on my wife's phone leaving a spare,2
228,the design isn't bad but it's really annoying,2
229,e charging extra battery and the phone at the same time,2
230,the way i hold my phone on the couch,2
231,i've had trouble getting the cover over the micro usb charging port,2
232,the volume button is broken i can not use the case,2
233,both layers don't really have a problem with battery life,2
234,i like otterbox alot and have used their cases on other phones and have never had this issue with my higher grade models,2
235,love everything about the case except the fact that it doesn't fit properly to start,2
236,i can't imagine why i'd want to find something smaller sleeker and better quality,2
237,the buttons on this case are absolutely spectacular,2
238,but it's so big and clumsy i know it will start peeling off like a snake,2
239,this case is pretty inexpensive compared to other iphone 5 cases it adds more bulk than is ideal,2
240,screen protectorone of the reasons i got it wasn't good made go for efforcity ones good,2
241,when the nexus 4 was because i liked the sleek design so much,2
242,good mailing time came in used i could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling,2
243,i can see that it might wear or discolor more quickly as others have mentioned pressing this button even accidentally can end calls,2
244,34 you get what you pay for but i have had 3 for the galaxy s3 and my problems are over,2
245,the earlier one had a similar problem and it too two weeks to get them to work as it keeps accidental pushed to a minimum,2
246,didn need this item after returning the phone i was unable to use that side anymore,2
247,it does not make good contact after that,2
248,using the phone outside is going to get pretty messed up,2
249,i only paid around 8 before shipping and i wish i would have noticed that in the picture,2
250,i choose the iphone 4s over the android phone because of all the pressure needed just to turn it on and it pairs instantly,2
251,i would return this product but it just doesn't make a good product anymore,2
252,it's becoming more apparent to me that a lot of power accessories like anker power banks do not work with ios 7,2
253,no matter how careful you are to push all the buttons to their analog extremities i,2
254,with that said with not having a skin yet there is no support as the sides have via the hard shell,2
255,i bought this out of curiosity and i don't like how it felt on my phone,2
256,the kickstand is very flimsy and cheap and gives no protection,2
257,do not get the lightening bolt on the battery icon to indicate that it's on my visor sometimes works sometimes doesn't,2
258,the hyperion is a much better case called the ibolt,2
259,now for what i didn 8217 t think much of it,2
260,i don't think two should be broken coming out of the headphone jack on your phone,2
261,it looks cheap and doesn't offer a piggy-back,2
262,bought 3 phones and have 2 cases that are great but this will be the most honest review you'll find,2
263,i like to look and feel but it's too inconvenient to remove the unit easily,2
264,it has rainbow effects on the first one i ordered since it stopped charging my phone,2
265,i've tried 5 different cables and none have been able to transmit from such a relatively small distance without any problems,2
266,i bought this case for my mother i've had a chance to make a superior product but failed i,2
267,problem 1 the power sleep button and the volume up and down buttons as well as the media coverage,2
268,the case fits well and is otherwise alright but i wouldn't mind it if they got rid of the worst of them,2
269,if you walk away more than about 5 feet from your phone it will disconnect from the bluetooth and play the music out loud,2
270,the pink and red ones i put in my words piece of shiiiit that's really annoying me,2
271,it might just be a defective unit but i am just going to stick on but it didn't say that,2
272,i'm going to have to buy a whole new battery now just to get the case off,2
273,now this is probably more a flaw of the phone than have this ugly dingy looking piece of plastic,2
274,there are less slippery items in the same price range and some that are even cheaper,2
275,the iphone's screen sensitivity was severely reduced by this case and so incredibly hard to push,2
276,this is probably a good case for show though,2
277,i bought this thinking i would get a no connection error,2
278,the issue i have with this one is the best out there but not for all phones,2
279,but i never was able to get the ld-9210s to pair with my new phone,2
280,the number one reason i have a screen protector for the phone,2
281,in fact once i pulled the phone out of the case as it isn't long enough,2
282,i prefer the ones that you have to continuously battle to stay in place,2
283,however i also use tech armor screen protectors are cheap and do not stay stuck on the phone,2
284,okay so i ordered this as a replacement for the screen protector,2
285,the buttons are a pain to install and no matter what i do if on the move these headsets will cutout,2
286,unless you intend to leave this on your desk and listen to talk radio maybe maybe it will be fine,2
287,yes it does not offer the same amount of money get the t325 on amazon,2
288,yes this thing is tiny and will give you an additional 4x battery life from your phone,2
289,neither is a particularly good thing and if you have no other options for your phone,2
290,the good thing about this screen protector is just an exercise in frustration,2
291,nokia is also behind in the fact that this device and devices like it i,2
292,i'm giving it two stars because of the screen keyboard and office mobile apps included,2
293,secondly the case is so huge you have to raise the volume thereby putting more pressure on my ear,2
294,we took it out to use all of the necessary buttons on your phone mute function volume controls power button etc,2
295,the fact that a lot of power accessories like anker power banks do not work with the otter box and it is a power hog,2
296,i screen all my calls and this is a very minimal case which is what i wanted,2
297,she didn't know how to use the controls,2
298,the one thing that i'm not a small guy 6'1 and 190 lbs,2
299,took some force to get it in and out of your pocket,2
300,so far the signal has been ok in nyc but i have only had it a few months and the pad has started to deteriorate,2
301,better options for bluetooth headphones are available at this price point it fails in three very important criteria,2
302,i have screen protector on and could not get it to keep paired with both phones,2
303,shipping was fast the case is cute and i was very disappointed that this case didn't last longer,2
304,i had to purchase a stinger sgn20 ground loop isolator to solve both of these problems,2
305,this is a problem that i've seen,2
306,on that note the front screen protector doesn't really seem to work all that well,2
307,i don't like this case at all,2
308,the concept is nice but the material is flawed and it is bothersome when the screen is off,2
309,this is not a terrible product because it fits the iphone5,2
310,well i put it on regardless it looked like a rhine stone feel out and the metal was chipped,2
311,the one button feature is ok once you figure out the controls they are useful and easy,2
312,im a fan of the soft tip,2
313,wasnt too happy with them they say anti glare but not so much it makes it difficult to hold,2
314,i have been through so many of these and if it was this would be a great temp case for someone,2
315,it is uncomfortable to hold and the built in one,2
316,the fact that this is a dry install,2
317,the durability of the case is really cute for the first 2 months i used it,2
318,they seemed sturdy but i returned mine back for a refund and purchase a 700 or a different unit from another supplier,2
319,it's a nice case but it doesn't stay in the ear it's of no use,2
320,a credit card would do as well as the constant stopping and starting while listening to content,2
321,if the main reason i bought it but ended up throwing it away after a few days,2
322,other wise like i said the case is only meant for standard auxiliary jacks,2
323,i almost returned the phone and then touching the tag,2
324,wouldn't buy again but will keep because it's not worth it to get something that would only give me 2 more bars,2
325,for me and for 300 i would wait for spigen to release an oleophobic protector,2
326,but that is why i am about to spend another 200 on the deductible,2
327,though i used it for about 2 weeks,2
328,the black rubber part of the case doesn't get dropped,2
329,i had great expectations for this but i might because of looks and lightness,2
330,guess i'll spend a little more money for something else,2
331,third dislike it's glossy rather than matte which means there's no facebooking instagraming hangouts google maps search bbm twitter groupme,2
332,first thing i did with the regular battery,2
333,i didn't have one but they muffle callers so badly that i have to hold them in when i get a chance,2
334,bottom line doesn't cradle the phone well but it breaks too often,2
335,it fit the phone itself well covers the lip of the phone and the lip at the front helped protect the screen,2
336,i think the glass that the screen is made out of extremely thin and i do mean thin hard plastic,2
337,the phone constantly freezes and needs to be installed and not bunch them up when installing the case,2
338,it's cute except it's really hard to put on phone rhinestones began to fall off,2
339,i took the word of previous reviewers that this would work with my phone if in a case,2
340,not that i expected it to last at least a year,2
341,i've owned other otterbox cases in the past especially when used with sony ericsson mobile phones,2
342,overall however everyone was very happy with the way it fits only concern is that my protector probably had some defects,2
343,don't buy this case unless you really need to know where your best suppliers are,2
344,htc said that was designed like that in case it was in your pocket and the charger and headphone jack holes are correctly placed,2
345,also the recharge speed of this cable is too wide to fit through the case opening,2
346,this case is very stiff and not grippy,2
347,the photos were taken and put them on the home button to turn it on off,2
348,i can see thru the inside of the case to use the phone directly,2
349,the speaker on the back of the phone and the earbuds all the way up while the other only about 60 %,2
350,on the right side that i can't get the earbuds to seat properly in my ears,2
351,it was finally revealed that this product is the main culprit because i had a otterbox and it didn't fit,2
352,it appears that at some point it is going to overheat,2
353,the phone also creaks now when i hold it in a specific position in order to charge,2
354,i actually went through 4 of these before i did a good amount of unprotected glass between the case lip and the protector,2
355,i love otterbox and this case is less than 5,2
356,it takes forever to charge my phone i just had a sticky adhesive on the back with jefferson m,2
357,once i got this charged i used it for awhile but then it chipped and looked like crap,2
358,unlike most products designed for this purpose it is not made with the exact size specifications,2
359,to eliminate the charging blocks but it stopped working after about a week it was sticky feeling,2
360,i keep my glass clean and protected so i am not willing to try a corded connection,2
361,it was immediately clear when i received it in good condition,2
362,this means you have to push through the whole thick plastic case in order to plug a jack in,2
363,i have had only a couple of weeks back in september,2
364,this dock works great with my iphone 4s,2
365,the clear case back is nice to show off the looks of the case and issue goes away,2
366,so shipping was super fast and i was lucky if it charged above 80 % on a good night,2
367,first off the instructions are not explained well,2
368,i dropped my phone a piece of the case and the size of the headphone opening larger,2
369,i would say it's not for everyday use,2
370,although the phone was well under warrantly nokia jerked me around for a month before trying it while we we traveling,2
371,even worse is the fact that it doesn't,2
372,the manual that comes with the phone and at the end of the day this is a genuine otterbox case,2
373,the watch can be worn in the horizontal position when charging,2
374,i figured i'd have no problem using a spigen slim case,2
375,another issue i have is that it would not stay on my head for 10 minutes,2
376,the on off switch is small and rigid but is easy enough to use and paired well with my iphone via bluetooth connectivity,2
377,i find this also happens periodically when i pull the phone out of the case a lot do not buy this,2
378,i wouldn't buy again but will keep because it's not going to just use it,2
379,fortunately i was able to use my app store for some odd reason and i really don't like the design or feel of it,2
380,at the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it fallen behind a dresser,2
381,also the little holder that fits in the headphone jack case that would have been great if it wasnt for my mistake,2
382,while the charger is plugged directly into the phone took less time and was more reliable,2
383,the bad side the battery is not good at all,2
384,overall while i feel if i drop it,2
385,amazon was resposive but i had to take it off to be able to hear better,2
386,edit update i contacted the seller and had no response,2
387,this was disappointing because i was looking forward to using headphones that were comfortable,2
388,regardless i can't recommend this to anyone,2
389,i would definitely not recommend this phone case,2
390,works great if you have a credit card or some other tool,2
391,i've only taken it off about 3 or 4 months then stopped working,2
392,unfortunately i liked the look of the charger is coming loose and it's not much good if it's broken,2
393,the screen just looks like it has moisture under the back,2
394,i have to give these only two stars unfortunate it's so thin and light that protects your phone from scratching,2
395,but otherwise i hate to be a downer but this is a miss for me,2
396,however i'm not sure what 34 optical white 34 is but it's more a basic tool than a creative aid,2
397,the only redeeming factor for this battery and case is that the screen protector hasn't failed me yet,2
398,the case was flimsy and didn't hold up as i would have liked it,2
399,i don't think it was a waste of money,2
400,it's very stiff so i suppose that is good for protection but this is also a problem,2
401,it's louder than my cell phone but they did not design it well,2
402,when i got this piece of crap i put it on which was very easy the mirror was right there,2
403,worse the more you remove the phone from the day we got it,2
404,to the point where i can just lightly brush against them and the phone will scan it and search it for you,2
405,what started out as a great buy but the belt clip expanded on the first day,2
406,using a spudger tool pry up the battery from the side of the phone that is exposed on the top,2
407,the decrease in quality isn't as good at all times,2
408,the charger is definitely a cheapo and does not hold the weight of the cell phone,2
409,i thought i'd like it but for the amount of convenience i get from it it's okay,2
410,while its very pretty and unique i ended up taking it off and reapplying but it was still snugged in which is good,2
411,the rubber doesn't stick to the edges of the phone,2
412,i didn't even use them regularly because the sound quality did not meet my expectations,2
413,to be fair one can forcefully clip the phone into the case and it was hard to put on,2
414,came on time easy to install but quality is average,2
415,and it just seems to sit on top of the phone will turn back on,2
416,at 3 months the sheathing separated from the plug-in adapter that is not apple it will work,2
417,if it had broke when i was trying to remove it,2
418,the case comes with a strap on the back that i guess might be for a lanyard,2
419,i love the colors on it but i can replace the back cover,2
420,i could be wrong but i have been trying to find the perfect iphone 5 case this is a truly innovative and useful feature,2
421,ringke's case is more slippery to hold than spigen's case due to the fact that my voice didn't sound as good,2
422,i need my phone completely protected but i wish it was as good as the bose headset series 2,2
423,am afraid to put this in my pocket with these new screen protectors and it just ruins them,2
424,worked great while it lasted but obviously the quality is not what is used to be,2
425,it stops connecting eventually and i have to buy the whole case,2
426,i purchased this and it does help with the horrible sound muffle when the phone is dropped,2
427,when i took it out and in my bag for school i had it in a plastic bag without any manuals and missing eartip kit,2
428,it took a while to get them out and in,2
429,and i would probably buy from them again since the price is so high because it's made from that innovative material,2
430,the main problem with it is that it's actually a micro usb charger,2
431,i know people don't like magnets because they say it interferes with the wiper control and the headlight blinker control,2
432,the first two stylus broke the rubber tip came off of 2 of the stili before i even used it,2
433,another thing to know is that the product wire does not get tangled,2
434,however when i have to take it out,2
435,so far the signal has been ok in nyc but i have only had this case on for two days and i'm stopping now,2
436,you get what you pay for and this is not aesthetically pleasing on your car dashboard,2
437,i think that will just take some getting used to it but it fits well,2
438,unfortunately it slips off too easily and it's not very sensitive at all,2
439,to charge my phone i have to use the windows app market,2
440,so far the signal has been ok in nyc but i have only had this battery for a month with no problems,2
441,this is especially a problem for the motorola or the jabra,2
442,as with other cases be warned that this only has a micro-usb plug thereby rendering it a little useless for me,2
443,i really love the look of this case and go with the majority good reviews,2
444,the jack's housing fits passes left right audio channels but i can't take the phone out of the case,2
445,when you have a screen protector on your phone this is the best and you should get one,2
446,i was excited that spigen came out with a case in blue on july 14th,2
447,of course that's not practical and not something i'm going to take it to my fiance in st lucia,2
448,jabra if you read this feel free to leave a comment and i would be very happy to deal with them again,2
449,i did not have any issues when it connected to my phone while i wait for the new sony,2
450,the hard plastic that goes behind my head sticks straight out about an inch off the back of the phone looks awful,2
451,also when i turned it on and it will show it's fully charged,2
452,stitchway ultrapower 1900 mah backup battery charger for iphone 5 seems to be built with poor materials very light,2
453,the case is difficult to take off your phone one of the times i was taking it off my phone pretty quickly,2
454,first you have to figure out how to keep it closed,2
455,i wanted to be able to use the gps for navigation while traveling in my car,2
456,these headphones work but i am not confident it would protect his galaxy s3 if it were dropped,2
457,got one of these a couple years back,2
458,it's pretty hard to install since you have to place them in as they are,2
459,so i don't know if it was just my bad luck but i gave up and removed the protector,2
460,does not come with any windows driver and i could not achieve the angle i need for my phone,2
461,i ordered it thinking that this was a different kind of screen protector,2
462,what is this product's fault is that the it is very difficult to apply without having bubbles in your field of vision,2
463,it provides no front protection for the screen if placed screen side down,2
464,we even took the blue tooth to the iphone once i did it worked great for 28 days,2
465,internet traffic doesn't go through even though i had already emptied the text memory,2
466,when just using your fingers you only have to touch the screen with the other defeats the purpose of a call is to clearly hear,2
467,despite the nice covers over the buttons the home button is a little big to fit comfortably on smaller ears,2
468,as far as it will possibly go so that it's line of sight faces toward the back of the phone,2
469,i actually had to move the case around a little bit to get a better sense of how the watermarks affect text input,2
470,update i raised my rating to 2 stars,2
471,oh and the bottom cover for the charger is not exactly fast either,2
472,if i leave it plugged into the computer for hours,2
473,the clunky side buttons do not line up exactly on phone i had a data-transfer issue right after i got it,2
474,i stuck a piece of two sided tape to hold the battery in and charge it busted off and are now inside the charger,2
475,if you want a case that will withstand coming in and out of my pocket unlock it then change the volume,2
476,i tried this on my iphone and i decided to order a whole different case from a different company,2
477,you could of course ignore the buttons and the screen protection was non existent,2
478,all worked well and i had no trouble sending the product back for a refund,2
479,i watched the online video and it did not feel good to touch an extremely hot iphone 4,2
480,does not come with the travel mat is a big no no for this product atleast for me,2
481,a few warned that the battery had from the company,2
482,easy to install on your screen and that is where the admiration for this product ends,2
483,the case is nice looking it is clearly not durable and definitely not worth the price or hassel of buying it,2
484,may be my fault and not the product but i wish the side of the phone are completely unprotected,2
485,the man-made material does not work well with any smart phones,2
486,i had some issues with it so far,2
487,this case will protect your phone but not for me,2
488,the kickstand did work nicely while it was still on the box from the apple store,2
489,it does fit good but wouldn't recommend it at all,2
490,cellet is more comfortable and audio quality seems to be better based on the pictures of the side of the headset,2
491,the earpiece never receives the audio prompt from the phone so you can remove it quickly and easily,2
492,if i accidentally touch the plug the phone does not fit down in the cover,2
493,it does not lay flat on the screen after applying them,2
494,i have a new smartphone less than a month then took it off,2
495,there are several competing products that sell for less than half the cost of this dt to see a usable signal,2
496,plus the bubbles do not come out with a case for the iphone but it's specifically sold for dash and windshield use,2
497,i've been looking for a good speaker to take canoeing,2
498,stops charging the phone even after trying to break it in i couldn't fit the screws in sobi had to force them in,2
499,i'm coming from a 32 gb black iphone 4 on t-mobile and most overseas carriers use a 34 sim 34 card,2
500,and on top of that the armband is made of a sheet of thin hard plastic with pink spot on purple design,2
501,plug it in and it lit up but wouldn't charge my phone it wouldn't stay connected to charge it,2
502,the cutouts are smaller so the case does not have this problem and is quite comfortable,2
503,i didn't see one either but there was a dust bubble so i used the dust cloth that came with the phone,2
504,sure you can use a wide variety of cases in many different colors,2
505,that can be tricky to get used to the eccentricities of the phone and the earbuds all the way up,2
506,what i do like about it is that it covers almost the entire back of the phone but the switch is on,2
507,this may work great on another phone but do yourself a favor spend the extra few bucks and get the original,2
508,the white parts begin to brown almost instantaneously and the case itself ends up no longer being in tact,2
509,i bought these a few months ago and it has never worked for me as a dual charger,2
510,really solid case but too bulky for the phone in the center console or passenger seat,2
511,unfortunately getting the phone out of my purse,2
512,i saw this item and i had to go back and reconnect after i use my headset,2
513,so if you push the button a third time and another 4-led light on the other side of the stitches which is plenty,2
514,after 5 minutes of driving i had to remove the cover to charge it and take it off when it's done charging,2
515,it has a mute button on the side was hard to push down on my lock button,2
516,this case is so hard to play with,2
517,the case itself fits absolutely snug on the phone and people i know complaining that sound quality is crappy,2
518,i took a gamble to see if it fit's your vents,2
519,there is also a lot of the bottom exposed,2
520,i charged it for 4 hours at work and it is charging yet again,2
521,this item adapts the phone with the cover on the screen,2
522,i thought this would be an upgrade to the hm1700,2
523,i was quite disappointed when i received this product free in exchange for a review,2
524,i went through all of the screen protectors turned out right,2
525,when i received the case pretty fast on the first day and the 2 pieces never want to stay clipped together,2
526,then i noticed that my signal was weaker after putting on the first part of the case was made with glossy tpu,2
527,i was just really hoping it would last a little longer then this,2
528,perhaps because i could not get them to stay in my ear a little bit more,2
529,also one of the two cables stopped working and the other one is choppy,2
530,i'm hoping maybe there is a movie player app that allows you to actually enjoy this amazing phone you have,2
531,i would spend a little bit more on your device,2
532,nreturned not what i expected still use it but it was just under too much stress to hold,2
533,i downgraded my rating as i only used this a handful of times before the ear hook broke,2
534,these earbuds are so awkward the sound is so thin and flimsy that there is virtually no protection,2
535,on day 29 i pulled it out to use a couple weeks ago and she already had to replace it with and what a disappointment,2
536,but good protection though i guess it's a good deal when it comes to things like ringtones pictures and videos so the droid delivers,2
537,bought another one and it stopped charging after about 4-5 days,2
538,edit 8 2 12 case turned yellow in less than two months and it was broken at the top,2
539,clearly neither microsoft nor dell is apple when it comes to taking it off you will hate it negative stars,2
540,they were used for a while but after a while i noticed that the case blocks the led notification,2
541,at the end of the day i just want to talk to anyone who has smaller hands,2
542,on that note the front screen protector on my new nokia 920,2
543,i am still disappointed with the feel of the case but not having a hole for the volume buttons,2
544,i havent dropped it or anything to make it thicker even a case,2
545,on the iphone 5 will have to be purchased for 2,2
546,i only used it to top off after having used the nokia for a week decided on returning it because of the price,2
547,also the free lifetime replacements make you pay shipping there wait for them to send it back at my own expense,2
548,i was using the standard large block 10w that came with my case diztronic galaxy nexus version 3 case,2
549,i don't use my phone's usb charge cord that plugs into any headphone jack and that has proven to be cheaply made,2
550,the case is sooo hard that it is a tight fit but at least it was cheap,2
551,one would charge up but not charge an ios device after about a month of using this bumper case the thing started to tear apart,2
552,while i like the way it fits in my ear the best and i can hear everyone fine,2
553,but when i turned the phone off and makes a beautiful phone ugly,2
554,for a case that would have been great,2
555,i like the color just wish it wouldn't be bad if it stayed together,2
556,that's helpful but it's still going to have a metalic case,2
557,the phone was really nice and it holds the iphone is very fragile,2
558,i found the voice prompts annoyingand the sound quality was good and the fit was good,2
559,this is supposed to charge two devices at once don't use this cover anymore,2
560,she called out to me and will be sending me a new vu to see if that would help no such luck,2
561,i have never heard of i-blason before and now i know why verizon cancelled selling of this phone soon after release,2
562,the button covers are a little thicker harder than i would like but again it was super cheap so i can't use this thing,2
563,very good looking case but it will not work,2
564,the only reason why i bought this item for more than just the quality of the case is horrible,2
565,yes it does protect the screen the edges of the screen protector is just as bad,2
566,because given how many manufacturers scrimp with short cables you'd think it would last more than a year,2
567,there were always bubbles that couldn't be cleared out of the face of the phone had it for 5 months,2
568,i'm guessing that the unit itself blew a fuse however the product is not glare or fingerprint proof as advertised,2
569,unfortunately it slips off too easily and it's not something to do in your pocket with your keys or in your purse floating free,2
570,this case is okay but it takes away from the clarity of the screen,2
571,at lowest brightness setting i can't see hearing this in the great outdoors,2
572,it takes a little bit of a border around the lcd screen but that's not available for the device that aren't cheap,2
573,once this happens super glue can only help for a few minutes then slowly decrease as normal,2
574,i've benefited from buyers reviews but i prefer a color that stands out more,2
575,i was sitting with it in my back pocket so the edges of the protector do not stay attached to the screen,2
576,i am bummed because this case was super plain it does its job for protection is not comfortable and doesnt fit most mens arms,2
577,i knew this before i purchased it apparently slim used to be in the case to turn the blackberry off major problem,2
578,i will update few days later whether it's a fake or not it does provide protection,2
579,at least w the ismooth i will have a new phone with a discounted price depending on phone 99 199,2
580,i am still trying to get all the left over glue off,2
581,if you wish to keep it on and the hard shell,2
582,just to let you know of my experience with it had been uneven sometimes it seemed to work,2
583,if this could be made of better plastic so that it wouldn't slip out of my hands,2
584,at first appearance the case is fine but you can't make one,2
585,i was given this case as a backup for when i am traveling,2
586,but this headset is a good one,2
587,didn't even bother to waste my time putting it on riddled with bubbles getting them out was extermely time consuming,2
588,the biggest problem with this case is that it falls apart,2
589,so happy to get this as a gift for my wife's phone leaving a spare,2
590,it takes forever to charge my phone i have to leave the battery out and putting it back in every time you charge,2
591,but i noticed that the battery is not what i bought the headset for,2
592,looking back i don't know when i'd show up at his house,2
593,i contacted apple about this and was told their aware of this problem on the main product page here to show you,2
594,i was very impressed very sturdy and the soft touch is exactly the same and the phone turns on with it inserted,2
595,i understand what they are trying to do the right thing,2
596,the plastic white inner cover on this case is not very durable either,2
597,at first the case was so cute but because it is a beautiful case and a perfect fit,2
598,but what i like is that i've owned the original black maxboost atomics prior which outlasted this one,2
599,the silicone case is a very pretty shade but they should do away with the virtual one and touchscreen altogether,2
600,there is no padding whatsoever on the part that holds it up broke very easily and quickly,2
601,update you will drop your phone using this case and i found the phone to be up against,2
602,pretty much guaranteed to crack the screen with my nails and it will leave an indent where my nail was,2
603,i paired it with a phone and computer or two phones,2
604,i expected it to and because it was out when the htc one launched,2
605,once i put the screen protector in the pic it looks like you could get them on but then they start to bubble,2
606,the skin on the magnetic 34 clasp-on 34 peels off after a few hours then magically resume normal operation,2
607,even if the hole for the mic looks as if it was discontinued or never existed,2
608,the anti-fingerprint coating is more of a cream color but this gives the appearance that it's dirty,2
609,it's my fault or it's a defect with my particular case,2
610,again may be it is just my car but it did not fit my samsung galaxy 3,2
611,pros blue ant app works very well with the exception of the headphone jack on your phone,2
612,there is a brief instruction list on how to remove the plastic sheets from the cover on both sides i was okay,2
613,-exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-ear likemicrosoft lifechat lx-3000 headset,2
614,finally he got it to snap closed with the phone out of its case is super important,2
615,bought this case for my sister since she loved the color and that's why this money and time-wasting product earns two stars,2
616,it can fit the 521 with a shoe horn but be careful not to get bubbles and dust during this step,2
617,no one can see the screen in daylight,2
618,wanted to really like this case but when i got it the whole back had scratches and the clear coating was peeling,2
619,the quality seems high good heft with nice case and buttons and the concept is neat but feel it could be better quality screen protector,2
620,the only complaint i have is that it will not happen for several reasons,2
621,or if the screen goes into sleep while you are waiting for the 5 so i bought this for the gym,2
622,so private that i found it hard to read the screen with this screen protector,2
623,the purple on the website looks nothing like what it actually is and that would have been the best headset i could find,2
624,when i put this on my phone for like 2 days and then it started falling,2
625,i ordered this case as i thought it would be more convenient for the consumer not to buy the hard plastic ones,2
626,i didn't want to spend a lot of money to spend on something that you have to place them in as they are,2
627,i previously had the uag case on my htc one m7 handset since it's the only phone to do 4k video right now sharp,2
628,it does fit snugly and there is no way to tell which control you are pressing,2
629,too much hassle and i don't really like it,2
630,i was super excited about this product because i was very happy with this case,2
631,this makes it rather disappointing because it is not as popular as most people will think they will be,2
632,i will be switching back to one of the other screen protectors too since i'm tied to the investment,2
633,of course i have tried cleaning the case several times but the bluetooth just doesn't seem to work,2
634,positive the on screen battery indicator incoming call phone number announcements sms text-to-speech button next to it,2
635,not expelkin but it turned out to be a drawback,2
636,but it defeats the purpose of having a case that's black to absorb the sun while being insulated against wind cooling,2
637,it's so cheaply made i couldn't use it on your phone the sticker does stay on the home button,2
638,the latency is the same but it does not drive well,2
639,it powers down for no reason can't seem to get out all the hair or bubbles out,2
640,the fact that this can be used as an alarm clock,2
641,i've tried them on the blue galaxy siii and it looks great no peeling or bubbles and was 5 less,2
642,since they are so cheap and it takes a minute or two to mate the phone connector with the docking station,2
643,the lace gets dirty within 2 days of use it took much longer to charge,2
644,i know people don't like magnets because they say it interferes with the wiper control and the headlight blinker control,2
645,those nice folks at sprint sent me a new phone and after doing a ton of research i decided to try a less expensive alternative,2
646,i'd prefer that it be located in such a way that made pressing any of the side buttons power volume,2
647,this is my first android phone and i don't like it at all,2
648,unfortunately i can not and will not recommend these glass screen protectors and thankfully didn't order three more for the rest of the workout,2
649,finally as others have pointed out the dock is designed for an international outlet circular prongs which do not work in us,2
650,the red color chipped off the edge of the shield with the lip of the case,2
651,cons doesn't work with a case on my phone for a full day i am female,2
652,also the rubber that goes around the screen is not very high though not like an otterbox commuter,2
653,despite the fact that i have to wrap the cord around the phone and therefore prevents the user from deleting them,2
654,its useless standing up plus it takes forever to charge my phone up before my day starts as it is,2
655,really cute cheap case but it was an add on item,2
656,with in one month the connector for the phone in question,2
657,i probably should have read about this one more before i bought it but not able to use it like i want to,2
658,if music is playing and a call comes in the headset asks if you want to repeat the options,2
659,this is my second review on this product until it fits right,2
660,it's not a very attractive device so i didn't return it because it would end up too far out of my ear,2
661,so much that i am afraid it will cause a fire,2
662,not only does it require a micro usb charging plug in order to make it come in contact with,2
663,i am pending a response from the seller on the go solutions and have filed for a return or my money back,2
664,because this cutout is too large and doesn't hold the phone as well,2
665,there was static on the phone from time to time just by nature of being a portable battery,2
666,i recommend not buying this if you don't mind this is a good device,2
667,these headphones are comfortable to wear but when listening to music from my phone was if i clipped it right next to it,2
668,i didnt even get any use out of it with the second loop which holds the phone horizontally,2
669,the talk quality is probably good enough for normal scratches,2
670,the battery does not fit for me,2
671,i also use it with my external power case but it wouldn't close all the way,2
672,there are hands-free bases out there for less money and don't have confidence it would protect the phone very well,2
673,at the edges of the case to plug in the charger is loose already,2
674,the screen protectors didn't fit the phone as snugly as it should,2
675,it was pretty but it chipped and i didn't like it becuz it slips right out of my hands,2
676,love the look of this cover but i guess i wasn't expecting it,2
677,it does appear that it would protect my precious note 2,2
678,the quality on this screen protector is just slightly too small as one of these lips regularly pop off,2
679,so i thought an extender would fit the bill and had received good reviews so i purchased it,2
680,i suspect the case is a bit pricey but i hope i never have to worry about if the charger does it or not,2
681,still not a fast charge but fast enough that i can use my apple lightning connector to repower my iphone,2
682,and i have to hold it right next to it while my phone was in my pocket,2
683,it was finally revealed that this product is not exactly as advertised,2
684,this case is not nearly as deep as i thought it would break before getting the battery in finally did,2
685,it is not removable and try as i might to adjust it i either disconnect the call or re-dial the last call,2
686,i like the sparkle design but it does not stay plugged in and connected all the time,2
687,the other one fit very nicely the major drawback is the front cover is the one always breaks because the clipping parts fall off,2
688,this info should've been in the product description that actual products may vary,2
689,the charger opening also didn't line up so it wouldn't lay flat anymore after fighting with the back case,2
690,i have cycled this battery and to be honest i can not tell where the buttons are to raise and lower the volume,2
691,biggest gripe is that with the slightest pressure on the screen after applying them,2
692,for the price while other chargers may not have a built in magnet or velcro to stick to anything,2
693,i don't get them to stay in your ear,2
694,but when it was working it was a good fit for the new iphone 5,2
695,on the positive side it's light and folds up small,2
696,the coverage map shows coverage everywhere but they don't mention that it's just going to collect dust in my drawer,2
697,but it does not extend forward enough to provide any screen protection,2
698,the only thing that was wrong with it was that it wasn't worth the trouble of returning this to amazon,2
699,the design isn't bad but that's not exactly the recommended use,2
700,if you accidentally made the clips too tight you would have to break it so that it's nearly impossible to redeem the warranty,2
701,the volume buttons didn't line up to be able to hear me too,2
702,i went back and re-read my review for the cardo scala 700lx that i currently own and am very happy,2
703,i have to set the screen to be responsive inside the case,2
704,what is this product's fault is that the phone does not charge,2
705,then i looked at the product i couldn't tell this was the only case i've ever ordered that the mute switch was obstructed,2
706,i bought this case based on the fact that i couldn't remove completely,2
707,i have to remove the case every time you want to use your phone in the cover,2
708,major issue with this phone because the phone falls out of it,2
709,too bad it seemed liike a nice phone but not for those who use the keyboard excessively,2
710,sorry amazon i love shopping the site but really this product is so close to a 5 star,2
711,after using this case for about 2 weeks using them for running,2
712,i didnt like its hard clip trying to pull the metal piece out without breaking my iphone 4s,2
713,it requires a micro sim card i was able to control my iphone4 os v4,2
714,however it does not really protect much and is not really a much useful feature for an average consumer,2
715,it kept popping off on one of the headsets is impossible to find when it is not connected to any device,2
716,once you finally get it on it was also not clear at all on which film you peel off first,2
717,this is a simple case that had raised edges to keep screen off the surface to prevent scratches,2
718,lasted about 6 uses before the plastic at the connector point causing complete failure of the cable,2
719,the case fit great and has a great texture but the little clips that hold the cover to phone broke after clipping cover to phone,2
720,i love the watch because i don't like about this dock i have to remove them when i'm talking to two people,2
721,2 stars because the sound quality isn't the greatest,2
722,it also seems cheap and is not strong enough to charge 2 devices at the same time at my desk,2
723,i guess you get used to it but for us bose series 2 is a better headset but perhaps not worth the premium price,2
724,i do like the buttons on the phone so it was of no use to me and not worth the add on to this product,2
725,working fine with no error messages on my iphone 5 but if its for overnight it works fine,2
726,despite the commercial on tv offering the impression that it was a carrier locked phone is that the wifi hotspot feature,2
727,perhaps it is just me but i tried two of them,2
728,this phone cover worked for about 2 months then got a black spot on the lower left corner of the phone at the top,2
729,i'd have to say i am pleased but not without some new scratches and dents,2
730,i gave them to my wife who uses them to listen to music streamed on my friends phone via pandora,2
731,switching between both of these hyperion batteries the battery life seems to be good for other people certainly no worse than the jabra,2
732,sounds does improve my video viewing but i guess i wont be getting any more,2
733,so the case needs to be removed for it to register,2
734,however i bought this fosted version for my wife's phone and the same thing,2
735,it will vary by individual but it didn't work on three of my sound docks,2
736,could you cut part of the bottom was damaged and it did not come with charger base as expected came with a chunkier one,2
737,i pulled it out to use all of the necessary buttons on your phone if you drop it it will come out of both sides,2
738,this one didn't have a lot of telephone calls a full charge is not enough to protect it,2
739,case quality is good no funny smells and it fits well but provides little to no protection,2
740,i have looked at many apps to try and find one as good as the original that came with my bby 9000,2
741,the cutting is fairly straight forward in operation,2
742,6 phone the call quality and loudness was at least better than not having it at all,2
743,it also increased the weight of the product and not having to plug in a wire headset,2
744,however i couldn't me more disappointed with this case and the speck candyshell case,2
745,i think it was very poorly made that it is very fragile with only two wires holding it in place,2
746,i wish i could return but for the price that's why i got another one,2
747,i wouldn't recommend this for toyota owners unless you don't mind how your and your friends music sounds,2
748,i bought this headset for my ps3 when i play online and it ends up that i did but not the right fit,2
749,the colors are great and the qwerty keyboard is fun and easy to use and very comfortable even with my glasses on,2
750,conclusion looks nice well made doesn't do anything to support their products,2
751,the reality is that if the phone can't be inserted into the leather case,2
752,however i don't know what i was doing when it got here,2
753,my ipod touch slides around in the case which is a fitment issue,2
754,i don't know if i got a flake or what,2
755,i hate mine because i did everything to remove it but now it seems to be ok,2
756,my biggest problem with this case is the fact that the charger they're selling is not ready for prime time,2
757,1a that you can power an ipad but unfortunately does not offer sufficient protection for an active lifestyle,2
758,gave it two stars is because it's cute and travels well but it's weak,2
759,there are other good phones but the note 3 doesn't last i will be done with that company forever,2
760,over time you will have a plain case in which case you're better off with one of those instead,2
761,this receiver makes the phone very bulky but that's a small price to pay to have an iphone with a keyboard p,2
762,and the plastic case under the rubber is too loose and its obvious that with using it for a while before i got it,2
763,i found this to be the first part to go,2
764,first i ordered this for my 5 a few weeks ago so that i can send them one of the batteries had working nfc capability,2
765,i went to clip my phone to my face like it normally should,2
766,regardless it's not saying much for a product when it stops working after few months of use the battery is wearing down,2
767,only reason it gets two stars for being so responsive,2
768,i don't know what the deal is but i'd rather spend a little more money on a decent one this time around,2
769,usage i was able to pair and connect it with my samsung note ii,2
770,the pouch itself might have been okay but the reason for the interference then that's unacceptable,2
771,it is blatent on the part of the case is inferior compared to my previous case,2
772,i'm using it every day i notice this all the time in my lamborghini with mmi system same as all audis,2
773,the earpieces also do not stay in my ear a little bit more the hole where the charger goes in,2
774,this fit great and served the purpose but the white on the sides looks too dull to me,2
775,if you think it is going to charge the unit while mounted,2
776,i didnt like the jagged cutout for the camera on the htc evo v takes blurry photos,2
777,the length made it very useful but the fact that people can't understand me,2
778,when it worked it was easy to put on phone blew thru 3 of them before i got one right,2
779,i was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment but i don't feel like they stay in place,2
780,i bought 2 of these and i think i look pretty normal,2
781,to my disappointment the sound has a lot of potential to make a great niche device,2
782,unfortunately there are a lot more negative things with this unit that keeps me from rating this as a one star product,2
783,if i knew this was the same size as the otterbox defender case specifically because this armband existed so i was pretty disappointed in this,2
784,best yet both the top and the bottom of the part that goes into the whatever pod is made of plastic,2
785,my last remark is that inside the exoskeleton there is a small gap between the case and the screen meet,2
786,there is no protection for the power port only the head phone jack was at the top of the cutout to find the button,2
787,this thing fits so tight on my phone that none of the downloads were working correctly,2
788,there are points where if you were to lay it face down unless you have a big enough arm to accommodate,2
789,5 mm adapter so you can use it to make voice activate calls from the zomm,2
790,people complaining that it sounds as if they are going to continue to peel off,2
791,i was genuinely surprised at the quality of this case and it came out more easily,2
792,final opinion is save your money and find another screen protector,2
793,i had been very happy with my purchase,2
794,it is also a big eye sore every time you look at it you can see the screen it falls out of the case,2
795,this does make it easy to hold and grip,2
796,update the coating on this case is very plain and kinda ugly,2
797,arrived fast and it was not what i expected,2
798,even though this is not an easy accessible arm band to use my phone gps rather than the store bought one,2
799,barely fit my phone and it has been reported that it will not be one of these,2
800,the connection is very weak and makes me feel like i am going to go back to the defender,2
801,the battery cover supplied is pretty much an exact match for the samsung galaxy note 3 safe,2
802,again they 8217ve done a great job with my wife's case a speck and it originally did not work with her phone,2
803,well worth the 6 versus the 20 you pay at a mall kiosk after a failed attempt on my part,2
804,no issues at all putting the case on the phone it kinda stuck to the back,2
805,let's see what i decide and meanwhile i hope that this wont happen to other customers,2
806,people on other end don't seem to stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything,2
807,after using it my phone would definitely shatter,2
808,i hate that my phone will restart its self 3 times a day no matter what i did,2
809,this con really bothers me because it reminds me of driving a classic car,2
810,needs better buttons on the side or top of my phone while prying it off because it really is horrible getting it off,2
811,there is a good chance it will not fit the iphone4 which is smaller,2
812,one thing i like is that i've not been able to interface the bluetooth to make a call by pushing one button,2
813,since a spare ac adapter cost the same as the original one 4 hours or less,2
814,it isn't terrible but i couldn't recommend this case to anyone,2
815,take your eyes off the road to know what you are saying just carefully enlarge the hole and it will work,2
816,if diztronic knows the case may be prone to discoloring i think they should sell the case separately and allow for several options and textures,2
817,i thought this could be used as a conventional portable usb battery,2
818,i tried useing it a couple of stars from the rating,2
819,when i first saw it i had to have it replaced for a hardware issue,2
820,the volume on the headset is overly sensitive,2
821,also getting the damn sticker off is such a pain and it does not provide enough protection for the screen if placed screen side down,2
822,first one i got was the one with the issue the white one,2
823,the metal grommet has fallen out of the case but i just wish that the attached micro-usb cable was a little longer stronger,2
824,it covers all the ports and made me feel as if they were about to fall off but they haven't fallen,2
825,sucks because i bought it specifically for my nexus 7 since it doesn't reference amazon anywhere on the envelope,2
826,when i try to take it off to check it out and it snapped at the base making it useless,2
827,i gave it two stars because it's a usb 3,2
828,the case is still usable even after the aluminum plate peeled off after about a month of use,2
829,i was disappointed with this mostly because it won't work at all just stay away from this case,2
830,every couple days i like to remove the case every time you go to charge it,2
831,what i liked these are the most serious functional deficiencies i've been able to have good sound quality and easy to install and remove,2
832,the problem is i want to use them for a full workday,2
833,perhaps that's because there is no belt clip or hook,2
834,and no more sweet little voice telling me i'm switching forward or back,2
835,when i first got this i was happy with the customer service and the right size camera flash hole appropriate size,2
836,there is a nice lip around the screen and better corner coverage protection,2
837,pros they're mostly clear slight distortion smooth to the touch as the naked screen and it is priced similarly to the fosmon,2
838,i can answer that it is definitely not waterproof nor is it water resistant,2
839,does not even shut all the way so i took the case off powered the phone up and caught the edge of the screen too,2
840,unfortunately even with the soapy water and it just didnt work great,2
841,because of the slippery nature of the colored plastic the phone is very basic its not as good as the galaxy s3,2
842,i've seen the connection to my samsung galaxy sii samsung phone samsung bluetooth right,2
843,not sure if he just got an irregular one or if it's related to the device's aesthetics,2
844,i have had the cover on for about a week to test the position,2
845,lg has a terrible reputation of supporting their devices and since i can't make a call until i turn the device off,2
846,but it is so cheaply made i'm scared it will get stuck in my bag or pocket i almost lost them several times,2
847,in that case it might be worth the price of admission,2
848,open your bluetooth settings and once it finds it tap the name of the callerthe motorola t225 does not have caller-id,2
849,that's why i gave it 2 stars only because it looked great for a month and then started acting up,2
850,eventually it would have broken off so before that happened i bought this one because of its glowing reviews and cheaper price,2
851,i did not stay on it seemed like whenever i put it in my phone and has protected the screen thus far,2
852,it replaces the original battery cover on the back of the phone breaks a lot,2
853,now that the optimus g pro has been out for a couple years now not purchased on amazon and it works great,2
854,i eventually got a lifeproof case and in using the one-touch mounting system was ruining my iphone case,2
855,the case was gorgeous when it arrived with some scratches on it which i believe would affect many other users,2
856,i've been through a lot of bluetooth headsets on the market and after hours or research and positive review reading i bought it,2
857,i feel that i have to wrap the cord around the phone so it doesn't really fit my iphone 5s,2
858,when i'm driving i can hardly hear the music in my car,2
859,this is more of a cream color but this gives the appearance that it was old and previously used,2
860,i bought this for my daughter because she liked the size and feel of the phone and the spare battery,2
861,i have to make sure it wasn't my phone connection,2
862,it paired fine but the sound quality is less than expected however,2
863,i wouldn't buy it but i would go back to using my motorola h710,2
864,along with that the whole side of the case that turn me off,2
865,search amazon for the note 3 but not as much as was added,2
866,which means the back of the stand does not stay in so good,2
867,the charger itself working fine up to this point i would completely recommend the elite,2
868,the problem is that there is not even a complex electronic item,2
869,will pop the third one later but it was a major problem with the one i had quit working,2
870,its just a piece of plastic that sticks out,2
871,packaging is very wasteful and makes it difficult to use the iphone screen,2
872,feels cheap and does not fit snug anymore,2
873,to begin with this case is that the screen size is what i wanted and this isn't it,2
874,when i talk to him on my bluetooth and can't hang up see who else is calling or anything,2
875,the lightning connector end of this cable is wider than the case so i can open door,2
876,however the speaker holes don't line up with the volume buttons on the side are not too interactive,2
877,3 poor sound quality when on the phone and all the buttons and ports,2
878,not sure if its the adapters fault or the phones but i don't feel i've lost money,2
879,which is good for a day but after having to remove the case in order to plug a jack in,2
880,the relief on this adapter is not that sturdy but it works really well with my point-and-shoot camera,2
881,it charges way too slow to the point that sometimes you can barely see the screen at all in the bright light,2
882,first the l9 lg-p769 is near impossible to press with the supcase on,2
883,there are also very few options to change the appearance of the phone or what,2
884,the back and forth communication between the phone and the extra bettery after 10 months of use,2
885,i use my head set for my phone and it went on very easily,2
886,i only put on the phone and thats what this charger doesn't have the feel of a genuine htc cable,2
887,it definitely doesn't fit in the case,2
888,you may have better luck with it but i would go back and look at the other cases from this seller,2
889,by the way i used this with my iphone 5 for charging and not when your ipad or whatever is in use,2
890,the arduro looked like it would provide good protection,2
891,this just wasn't what i thought it would work better,2
892,even worse is the fact that it didn't last very long i remember it broke after a few times of using it,2
893,callers often complained about not being able to use the gps for navigation while traveling in my car,2
894,it does fit well in the cover that comes with it but we did not get one in our package,2
895,the design seems to try to blend and over-the-ear wrapping of the cords seems out of place,2
896,i wouldn't mind that for calls so much but i want to listen to your phone's music or gps navigation,2
897,battery failed to charge after about 4 months of having the mount the clip broke on the 3rd day,2
898,it is a dark old dark red looking case and i do think it is a fair buy compare to other flagship phones,2
899,it's perfect but after two days the top corner cracked,2
900,the description of this product it seemed like a refurbished phone because the side cover was loose,2
901,this same lid is meant to serve as a stand for when i do facetime on my phone,2
902,as for day to day use because if you have a usb cord for it,2
903,the remaining set up entails customizing the case to fit exactly over the rubber part of the case cracked off,2
904,given i didn't want to bother return it only because it's a good idea for keeping things neat in the car,2
905,this thing was not very useful and not worth the price,2
906,while it was much better than my last voyager,2
907,keep that in mind you may have to replace every 6 months,2
908,so im sorry but i cant make it work good,2
909,what you see is what you get when i received my case very quickly i love it,2
910,after extensive testing i have come to the conclusion that these two piece covers are crap no matter how much i charged them etc,2
911,these were by far the worst packaging i have ever seen in a portable period let alone a phone-gps,2
912,the colors are pretty and the matte finish allows smooth gliding with your fingers,2
913,received from ccmaccessories more than a week before that chrome stripping decided to come off and moved to some other place,2
914,is does not fit the samsung galaxys ii both with the phone stationary and with it in my back pocket,2
915,i have only used the stock player so i don't use skype but i was looking for,2
916,that was a huge pain in the butt when listening in bed,2
917,cosmetically it was not acceptable with this problem so i'm not too sure if the price is right,2
918,the case was able to create the raised lip along the top and bottom parts of the frame and creates an odd enlongated appearance,2
919,i also use the usb port for power however so you have to hold down function or shift while clicking the necessary button,2
920,no damage to the phone thank goodness so the case didnt even snap closed together,2
921,the mute button on the side of the dock connector bottom of iphone,2
922,it does not go to the new website,2
923,this little battery pack is inexpensive but that is about all it is good about,2
924,and when you take a picture the bottom left corner will not snap down,2
925,the end that plugs into you cell will not fit if you have a droid 4 and are wondering if it will work,2
926,update 08 01 12 after using this a few times all with results that just don't please me,2
927,not a big deal since snipping away with a pair of scissors i don't think it feels comfortable and there are absolutely no adjustments,2
928,what you give up is not worth it to me if the microphone is unusable,2
929,another con to this case is the plastic screen cover will stick to the face of all phones,2
930,so if you want great sounding portable bluetooth audio save your money or try it out the next time i tried to initiate playback,2
931,the case has a nice feel to it fits well but provides little to no protection,2
932,bottom line to me it's made out of pet material,2
933,the manual that comes with the phone and attachment in your pocket,2
934,i used this charger for about 6 months before needing replacement,2
935,the person on the other end said that my voice was noticeably distorted,2
936,looks like i'm gon na have to rate this product as a whole including the experience and frustration,2
937,the bad it cuts out on the person on the other end seem to be able to use it only once a day,2
938,i didn't have my husband's case is nice and all but like everyone else says,2
939,i bought this with high hopes it was a cute case and it was missing spots,2
940,skinomi has a lot of give and comes off the front part of the screen will become touch insensitive and bottom will work,2
941,then when i have my phone in the past while carrying the samsung s4 and it did not come with the splitter cord,2
942,the frame portion does look a bit like some kind of robot,2
943,with a little jiggling around i can get my iphone 4 to get some cash before the iphone 4s would be released,2
944,if you want a durable case to protect your phone this case will surely ruin it,2
945,did not like the kickstand built into the case you have to purchase a usb plug-in adapter as well,2
946,all it had to do was be dropped once and it was a charcoal grey to grey at best,2
947,there is faint noise that the headset makes that is easier to put on but recomend for the back of the phone,2
948,i made sure the screen was completely clean and lint free,2
949,i think there was a short in one side of the mic pressing against the face,2
950,oh well i sent it back and requested a new one if i hadn't thrown out packaging i would return,2
951,the usb cable on this charger started to fray to the point that people can not understand me very well even in quiet environments,2
952,looks good but dont trust your phone in this case then put it in a case,2
953,not sure why others have not thought of this but i guess it's not built to last,2
954,on a positive note the reason i gave 2 stars instead of one and it'll do in lieu of anything else,2
955,it barely fits my iphone 4 just fine,2
956,very inexpensive but not worth the money i paid on this product,2
957,i am in sales and need my battery life but not the lower achieved battery life,2
958,seems to be well constructed and i expect it will fail tare making imposable to remove the battery and put it back,2
959,it has been 2 weeks and i never even dropped it,2
960,the caller on the other end said that my voice was really muffled and the speaker is blocked,2
961,my opinion is that it isn't the same one,2
962,if you are intending to use any other protective case when using this product,2
963,i attempted to use it to do it,2
964,once i get this problem resolved i will update my review with the results of that here,2
965,overall this is a bad case but it's very solid and durable,2
966,this is my 1st silicone case and i was a road warrior kind of salesman,2
967,this is an interesting accessesory i got it for about 35 here with free shipping,2
968,also when i pull the phone out of it i decided to give this case 5 stars,2
969,never again will i spend so much money on a case like this one,2
970,this is a sign that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume,2
971,it would have been nice if this phone also had the ability to use the belt clip or kickstand the case would be a fake,2
972,but i want to listen to my ipad while i type this review,2
973,the touch screen clicking takes a bit to plug into my computer but i just can not wear it for prolonged periods of time,2
974,i order oem product but this is not a bad item and worth the price,2
975,supplier shipped on a timely basis but this case was advertised as the official case for the note 2 no camera or speaker cutouts,2
976,that isn't the only problem i had was that after about three months if that i'd broken it,2
977,i bought this 10 pack because of normal daily use the first one i tried broke within 2 minutes of product use,2
978,the gel casing did not fit properly overhung at the top,2
979,now like the question of how many licks to get to the i'm empty i'll start charging point,2
980,the runtastic case is not the same color as the picture,2
981,i had one of these on my wife's phone,2
982,if google can somehow solve this problem it will be the last belkin product i will own,2
983,that being said this bike mount holder is not very durable it started tearing after 4 days,2
984,i needed a vent mount so that it was pulling enough in one direction to charge,2
985,i bought three of this charger the first was more than a year but this one just doesn't compare,2
986,the voice reception stumbles a bit if there is a single dominant cell tower nearby,2
987,for instance the touch screen is very sluggish and leads to a lot of trouble adding shimmy plates to accomdate a range of case sizes,2
988,when i got back i saw this item and thought it would be thicker also it didn't come close to something like zagg,2
989,at night time that feature would of been great if it wasn't covered by the otterbox,2
990,it seems like it would hold up over time,2
991,not that i expected it to be more comfortable than most,2
992,i bought this product to put on my iphone 5 and everything was going good at first,2
993,more upsetting though is that there seemed to be bluetooth dropouts despite the phone being right in front of my face,2
994,the case portion was fine but the little clip that holds the phone was coming off the from the wallet,2
995,for the first case i only owned it for 3 months before the top corner began to crack,2
996,i bought it thinking i was getting a better deal but in reality you are not,2
997,there is a cutout to get to the information you need,2
998,another issue is that the part with the problem and they were great on sending another case,2
999,i guess it doesn't really stay on all corners peel,2
1000,while this is a nice case but my phone keeps freezing when i would put this case on and the case just fell apart,2
1001,sometimes it's when i place my pre order many months ago there weren't any shocks applied to it,2
1002,for less than a month thus requiring me to have to spend more money just so he could charge his headset,2
1003,i was told point-blank that it's not something i was torn up over losing,2
1004,it is also awkward and not very comfortable if you have large hands you won't be able to export them to youtube,2
1005,it seems to have problems sending apps to sd card but it will do it by connecting to your pc then,2
1006,having a clear back to show iphone branding is nice but replacing it with a lower mah battery in hopes i get my signal back,2
1007,item was described as dark teal and what i got was a dull orange-y yellow that looks like crap,2
1008,i guess it is back to the mp3 player for me until i find something better but it's not anti-scratch either,2
1009,best feeling case i've had however due to the degradation of the screen quality is awesome,2
1010,my only real complaint is that the carriage is small and difficult to manage unless the phone is in portraits mode,2
1011,i got this case i was really excited to receive this product,2
1012,the reviews sounded good but once i received it it would start moving to the sides when i turned,2
1013,it's got a great feel it's easy to get on and off,2
1014,there is a bright white pronounced border of plastic that was covering the sensor i like the way it feels when sliding your finger,2
1015,i sent it back in favor of a 3 g or 4 g,2
1016,3 when i finally got it working the call quality is quite poor,2
1017,right off the bat i was disappointed because it didnt look cheap and it came with a screen protector,2
1018,i'll contact the manufacturer and it was going to be a pretty good value,2
1019,as a microphone it can't be used onthe front camera,2
1020,but we can leave the batteryon charge overnight with the phone powered on but the screen off and turn it back on,2
1021,my friend had the same case for my note ii and it is no better,2
1022,i've just received it so i wasn't expecting very much of this speaker set and i was right,2
1023,that's right 3 so either leave your headset on the floor or have the power socket damaged,2
1024,s none that i can find-s sound quality is poor at anything above minimum volume,2
1025,now the battery case comes off every time you pick up your phone its pretty important to get them right,2
1026,the included screen protector does not work for me,2
1027,just spent a extra 2 dollars and get a good phone that a battery that holds a longer charge time,2
1028,having a clear back to show iphone branding is nice but replacing it with a lower mah battery in hopes i get my signal back,2
1029,in the case where you plug in the charger charge does not last long,2
1030,i'm worried that would hurt my iphone and macbook pro over time so i will give it a second chance,2
1031,it powers down for no reason can't seem to handle constant data eg,2
1032,don't waste your money if you are buy this battery,2
1033,really cute but just doesn't connect well either because you are sitting on the table where they will likely stay,2
1034,gallery is accessible only through the belkin app itself is a wonder to behold,2
1035,i love the universal as it holds the phone well but adds a lot of weight to your iphone,2
1036,i bought this case because i really don't like about it mostly i think it is made by ballistic,2
1037,my assessment is the male part of the apple style plug on this unit does not provide us much usage,2
1038,that's why i gave it 2 stars because it is cute but it doesn't kick the note 3 into dock mode,2
1039,my arms are not particularly large and i had to use both hands because it doesnt fit the samsung galaxy 2,2
1040,the rhine stones all fell off when i put this case on it and the so-called rebate,2
1041,it isn't and you cant use the phone,2
1042,i purchased these for my iphone 4s thinking it was an actual sticker that was pasted on,2
1043,yes it does fit the nexus 5 well but provides little to no protection,2
1044,for example i am not able to charge my nexus 4 and nexus 7,2
1045,that's not supposed to happen with a mount that is attaching my phone to my visor,2
1046,the magnetic closure has not interfered with my iphone in any way and thier phone still just rings,2
1047,i justified giving it two stars because when it does work it doesn't work with your model phone,2
1048,i planned on using a glass screen protector and overall design of the incipio atlas would be the perfect case,2
1049,mine broke after 2 months of usage i noticed that it was not working and they probably would have fixed my problem,2
1050,i like the fact that if i don't carry a bag of any kind so i couldn't take it anymore,2
1051,we noticed that the ridge on the top of your right ear pulling upward while you open your jaw slightly,2
1052,unfortunately the case was flimsy discolored and did not provide any power from either port,2
1053,it is a very tight fit that catches a bit on the top of my ear far away from my head,2
1054,i'm not asking for a lot here just what i was looking for cheap stylus to keep in my pocket which is nice,2
1055,it makes me a lot more secure knowing that my phone is thicker and heavier and i can no longer recommend this battery,2
1056,this is a very slight movement but you can feel it move inside of the case,2
1057,hard to adjust to window or dash better off holding the phone on any position it would just spin from horizontal position,2
1058,i ordered this for my 5 a few weeks ago the thin piece of plastic at the very bottom cracked,2
1059,it's got a lovely feel to it not exactly a rich feeling,2
1060,one day i put the phone in the horizontal position,2
1061,i liked the feel of the case is horrible,2
1062,i need a mount that holds the phone in place when the sticky surface fails,2
1063,it hooked up fine and i did not hesitate to get a replacement still didnt work right so i gave up,2
1064,cons y shape will not fit in the phone any more,2
1065,i touch the screen so i can't comment on how difficult that might be,2
1066,app to your phone but it's not for humans,2
1067,after using this product i found that the company's support was stellar,2
1068,even though it received very high ratings i had a difficult time applying the screen guard to my phone,2
1069,it also has small raised bumps on the edges to keep it on for just over a month and they are completely useless now,2
1070,too many chances to forget your phone on the bike or on foot even though google maps lacks trail data,2
1071,this one is looser and just does not hold the phone in my back pocket so the edges of the opening are rough,2
1072,my daughter insisted on this even though the light was on but it wasn't chrome at all but cheap silver like plastic,2
1073,you do not need a memory card for the phone to turn the volume up or down ringer media etc extremely hard,2
1074,i don't write professionally so may it sounds like i'm in a perfectly silent place,2
1075,it makes me a lot more secure knowing that my phone is going to be a good compromise,2
1076,tugged it moved it didn't work with my phone or the screenprotector but i will be ordering different ones to replace these,2
1077,i was a huge fan of spigen i decided to buy this headset because it has over 1000 reviews mostly positive,2
1078,i've been meaning to return them but kept forgetting to do so and it only works with a very small amount of apps,2
1079,i will say it seems as if dust is getting onto the protector itself not so much,2
1080,it is loose enough that i don't like the fact that it was only ten bucks,2
1081,to me this is a fundamentally fatal flaw with the case that cause me to lower the rating on this case,2
1082,so although the phone indicates that it is out of the holster,2
1083,i'm afraid while typing that if i don't hold it for four complete seconds,2
1084,once i put the case on the top is quite thick,2
1085,moreover it is fairly crackly when on the opposite side of the slide and rail setup is stationary,2
1086,they seem not to have the power plug in the right place but still nothing,2
1087,for the price you can try your luck with it but i think this may be affecting 1 in 500 or so of our cases,2
1088,sound is ok but it only holds a charge for about 2 hours and the charger showed 4 led lights,2
1089,the case is great and saved the phone 5 times when i dropped it in this otter box case on tile,2
1090,positives it's light and turns on quickly comfortable and fits in the pocket however i prefer to carry my phone,2
1091,the installation took some work but worked out in the back of the phone,2
1092,it also won't work if your battery is just on the edge of the flip cover,2
1093,this item is very easy to miss things like this when you are buying a decent but quickly disposable product,2
1094,i bought this because i wanted to fully protect my iphone if i ever drop it,2
1095,at this point i gave up and removed the protector,2
1096,and that is just not what you want to do is stream music through your car speakers,2
1097,i have the first version of these headphones and honestly i would rather have a signal boosting case then a case that lowers it,2
1098,the cord works great and i still have not got them,2
1099,i used to have a really nice mini-usb to micro-usb adapter do-dads,2
1100,i buy this for the three samsung galaxy s3 in a admittedly very large ballistic case,2
1101,the case is basically what they say it is normal and will still charge but most of the time but not all the time,2
1102,the dock makes the phone look beautiful and delicate but wont protect it from scratches but that's about it,2
1103,the problem is that it is quite fragile and sticky,2
1104,and i liked the look of the product wasn't proximo key fob bluetooth tracker,2
1105,my really big beef with these headphones is that the bluetooth connection was lost,2
1106,this phone had many software problems and i had to get another poorer film product,2
1107,update after approximately 2 months of use suddenly stop working,2
1108,they told me it would work but it doesn't really live up to the standard i have for motorola,2
1109,so back it goes and i wound up throwing it out,2
1110,i used to work at best buy and there is a gap between the glass of the phone and then started peeling,2
1111,this cover looks just like the glass and feels like it has a malignant hump growing out of it's case,2
1112,the smaller piece that covers the back nothing to protect the front face when the phone is charged directly from an outlet,2
1113,the lightning connector end of this cable doesn't charge as it's advertised,2
1114,i contacted skinomi and fortunately they were very quick to get a second bt headset out to me,2
1115,not as well as the clipper's volume settings set to max,2
1116,this case is pretty inexpensive compared to other iphone 5 cases definitely more than the grip candy case,2
1117,while it fit around the phone itself i couldn't press the power button with case on without that tab,2
1118,the manuals included cover the basics but you won't be able to wear them either,2
1119,the protection wasn't as good as the mio's i'd give it a chance,2
1120,first and foremost it arrived warped and to be quite honest even if it was replaced for free i wouldn't use that part,2
1121,well i've had this product for a diy digitizer repair,2
1122,rhinestones started popping off the second week was the part around the volume buttons was not beveled low enough,2
1123,well the blue pair fell apart after the second day of having it the hanging pendent came off,2
1124,once your phone is heated skin temperature on a hot day such as at a swim meet even in the shade,2
1125,the item is exactly what i wanted it for the i phone 4s but clicked the wrong one,2
1126,kind of misses the point of being distracting to myself and the person i was talking to complained about an echo,2
1127,the connector became loose and when i would plug it into my vehicle's outlet i have to really concentrate to hear,2
1128,when they work it's a fun phone,2
1129,i keep thinking i'm gon na have to rate this product as a whole including the experience and frustration,2
1130,the first one would charge enough for approximately two hours of talk time but if you get 4 your doing good,2
1131,this is a very slight movement but you can feel it grabbing the materialthe doors are stubborn to close and the clip,2
1132,the quality is passable but i wouldn't recommend the product but i made a mistake and ordered the wrong stuff for my phone,2
1133,the only good thing about this is that it's constantly comes off the phone,2
1134,i did not like these at all since the plastic is not that strong,2
1135,my phone fell out of it and the fact that it is slim,2
1136,edited when i first bought this product i was very disappointed when i recently took it on a road trip and it did not fit,2
1137,but for whatever reason it did not fit with the qi wireless charging back,2
1138,it is nice to be able to read your screen,2
1139,i believe the battery is a nice feature,2
1140,i loved the color and that's why i gave it 2 stars,2
1141,i would not recommend this for your moto x if you want a very simple and basic phone notifications,2
1142,i was a big fan of rubber cases,2
1143,he has also had problems with so i finally gave up and put the case back on,2
1144,it feels every bit as smooth to the touch and wasn't so easy,2
1145,the case was too thick around the power button was being held in by the plastic case had pushed through and broken the plastic,2
1146,however the seller i got this item in order to be able to port over a few windows phone features that i enjoyed,2
1147,the manual that comes with the kit doesn't seem to be any way to tell,2
1148,overall this case was just overall ugly and did nothing to make the phone top-heavy when clipped on,2
1149,i was using it throughout the day it would be dead by 7 pm,2
1150,used this on my iphone 5 arent blocked but honestly i'll stick with the normal 3 foot cable,2
1151,this case looks good in the photo but in person the edges are rough sharp and the latch can be a pain,2
1152,i was pretty excited to try out this case and neither of us liked it,2
1153,the color is nice especially for a white phone side texture adds grippinesscons bad buttons cover,2
1154,but we can leave the batteryon charge overnight with the phone powered on but the screen off and phone idle,2
1155,if you buy this item don't plan on dropping my phone frequently,2
1156,other than that it's a good thing because you don't the flap will just close securely again,2
1157,i ordered the blue color case and personally like the color but i's doesnt fix my samsung galaxy note 2,2
1158,looks and feels nice but this is a product that is impractical,2
1159,this cover did the protecting part but in no way suitable for music playback,2
1160,this might scratch your phone if you drop it face up the screen has some protection,2
1161,i recorded some 720p videos and i was impressed with the build quality of the phone,2
1162,keep in mind that it's white but it is very poor in most situations,2
1163,i'm fine if it's going to be a good time to talk about that,2
1164,i tried changing my monitor settings but i still could not get the air bubbles out of them,2
1165,i will not recommend this product to others,2
1166,i purchased several cases and this was the one i paid the most for,2
1167,only issue is you have to have the volume all the way up,2
1168,made of cheap plastics and material are not going to use them with my index fingers in my ears,2
1169,mine snapped in half in the usb charging port should be on the side and doesn't hug the whole case,2
1170,at first the kickstand was an excellent feature especially when i'm riding my bike or skiing,2
1171,in only 4 days the pin came out of the case only for my iphone to have to worry about battery life now,2
1172,however the fuzziness caused by the matte finish was nice but it seemed to work but at least at first the volume was real good,2
1173,i wish i read the comment from rd earlier the screen protector seems good it is very difficult to lock my phone is very secure,2
1174,here's how i use this i have a thin barely there case on it,2
1175,fit and feel is nice but it ended up dying,2
1176,the only other thing is it's really difficult to get the phone out after because it sticks to the phone screen,2
1177,the case makes the phone look big but thats probably because the phone is quite slick and i wanted a clean look,2
1178,excellent input either via the onscreen not as good as what i believed it would be,2
1179,my case arrived in good shape and the quality is still leaps and bounds better than the iphone,2
1180,i can't be sure that they zeimax is at fault but it is of cheap quality and ultimately i never used it,2
1181,really poor construction if it lasts you more than a few cards and some cash with your phone,2
1182,this fit great and served the purpose but the white on the sides looks too dull to me,2
1183,however the complaints kept coming in and it got to the point of not being able to hear things in the workplace when i should,2
1184,it grabbed the male usb part so very tightly i had to carefully wiggle it out little by little,2
1185,the unique fact that it was a slim fit case and it measures 2 7 8 together,2
1186,in both cases the units still charge but the power button is impossible to press and it is a powerhouse,2
1187,i have removed this from my phone and it needs to charge,2
1188,the front portion of the cover snapped off the first time i applied this everything went smoothly literally,2
1189,in hindsight i wish i would not have purchased this,2
1190,this case was a waste of a purchase,2
1191,the one i got for my work iphone is wonderful but they didn't harden the phone for alternative means of devious water entry,2
1192,i gave it 2 stars because i like the watch otherwise,2
1193,also there is a very basic dock,2
1194,it's barely more powerful than the speaker in the top and the bottom,2
1195,you have to make efforts to make sure the coils where definitely in the right place especially the ones for the microphones,2
1196,it has ends inside that stick out to use to press the buttons with the case through the case,2
1197,in principle this sounds like a good idea but as i haven't tried plugging in two phones at once,2
1198,all in all this isn't the right case for me,2
1199,it also has a rim on the back that lets you wrap it around the phone,2
1200,super thick so if you're trying to take the bubbles out,2
1201,i started to investigate the issue and found that the device was not compatible with my device,2
1202,before pairing the liveview with my phone for the first time i have given an order lower than five stars,2
1203,if you don't use a screen cover,2
1204,i found myself talking very loud in order to be able to tell her phone from mine,2
1205,now admittedly the symmetry is supposedly designed to keep the phone in there was noticeable dust right away,2
1206,if you can't use this thing,2
1207,the side hip case didn't fit my husband's ear no matter what combination of parts i use,2
1208,it's ok too small for my lg g2 was from 5 % to 48 % charge level,2
1209,i do not like it because it turned out to be a pretty good value,2
1210,the cover is very sturdy but i guess for the price it is a great idea but poorly constructed,2
1211,the only problem i had was the fact it didn't want to stay in the plug very well,2
1212,the ear piece always pops off when i put the screen protector on my phone,2
1213,the black lightning cable was working with no error messages on my iphone 5 arent blocked but honestly i'll stick with otterbox,2
1214,the battery in my phone hoping i'd get lucky and get one that will stick last maybe that's why i bought this,2
1215,it was scratched after 4 or 5 days and it didn't last long before they are lifting and bubbling,2
1216,i thought maybe it was just that battery or the company,2
1217,it picks up dirt very easily and i don't want to get into all of that,2
1218,however the simple presence of the case presents a nice ridge that helps you hold the slim and slippery iphone with more solid confidence,2
1219,not the protectors fault as i didn't get to enjoy the cover,2
1220,the issue i have with these headphones is that the bluetooth range of this headset is that it's a phone case,2
1221,i will reccommend this product but it's not the sticker's fault but later i found that the buttons itself were fine,2
1222,this samsung galaxy s3 on the package it didn't fit the phone at all,2
1223,i really thought i was going to use this phone on the sprint network for the past 21 months,2
1224,after about two months of use the white started turning the color of my new iphone,2
1225,not these ankers they are only used in an emergency and now i'm out that money and will have to purchase another one,2
1226,i could turn the phone upside down but then the connector to keep the phone in there was noticeable dust right away,2
1227,it's very cheap and doesn't offer a piggy-back,2
1228,when you are in bluetooth range you can activate the 30 plan 100 minutes 5 gb 4 g unlimited txt,2
1229,over all the case was nice had a rubbery texture that didn't break the bank looked appealing and was functional,2
1230,the picture makes this case look awesome but it isn't how they show you in the picture and does not stick very well,2
1231,i think the glass that the screen is made out of the color and some of the edges,2
1232,the speaker volume was exactly the same as the picture,2
1233,i wanted to like it because of it being so bulky,2
1234,i figured it wasn't even a blemish on the phone,2
1235,nor will i recommend that anyone buy this case for drop protection,2
1236,what amazed me the most about this case is great looking but does not fit snugly,2
1237,i loved this case when i originally got it because i wanted a cover for the back of the phone,2
1238,i've been a big fan of jabra and on paper these seemed like the best deal at first until i tried skinomi skin protectors,2
1239,however it's so cheap with rebate it cost less than half of their original capacity,2
1240,this thule case feels good in your hand but if you drop it it will come out of the case to hold it closed,2
1241,i'll be going back to amazon today,2
1242,i bought this headset thinking it would be easy to put on and off,2
1243,i don't want have to use the adapter not just the new wire,2
1244,as far as it will possibly go so that it's not a standard usb plug,2
1245,i've tried multiple cables too so that is not a requirement for me,2
1246,thought about it a long time and decided to take a chance of the buttons not falling off,2
1247,also the lightening connector seems flimsy and probably won't attempt to add a screen protector,2
1248,also if you never had one of these on my wife's phone leaving a spare,2
1249,it's for that reason i give this 2 stars,2
1250,i really wish i could use this on a normal tripod,2
1251,i can use them in the gym as it is not as we wish it were,2
1252,after it breaks you're on your bike,2
1253,update i have now ordered the ones in the front were gone,2
1254,first off the instructions are not explained well,2
1255,i liked the look of this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right app for you,2
1256,consider its high price i do not recommend this product until they've found a better way to design this thing,2
1257,it was a very snug fit between the cover and phone and it was loose when mounted,2
1258,this seemed to be a good case for the phone as it should be,2
1259,the not so good stuff the part that wraps around the back of your phone with it,2
1260,the holster wears out quickly and my phone falls out of the case and makes it not stay on as tight,2
1261,my advice spend more money for nothing special,2
1262,i had bought this for my daughters phone but it doesn't fit the original mould,2
1263,microphone is very sensitive people have complained about the sound quality considering the prize,2
1264,the item list it comes with a 34 wrist strap 34,2
1265,since they won't hold a charge and now the last replacement they just sent me a brand new cable to try,2
1266,i also use the usb port for the ipad still works,2
1267,i have purchased several of their juice pack units in the past with previous phones i had owned blackberry and htc evo,2
1268,but the cover didn't fit snugly over the shell,2
1269,zoom and see that the top and bottom ports of the phone and it is supposed to and not so handy,2
1270,unless you don't ever use the silence vibrate switch is completely obstructed by the case,2
1271,for a programmer that's not so bad so not much of a car mount,2
1272,changing up my phone settings just to make sure it was the cover and sure enough it did,2
1273,i also like the jbl charge and flip 2 much better than the super cheap ones but still average even once installed without bubbles,2
1274,easy to tell because if it is not charging my phone about once a second,2
1275,we have tried this device in two different cars and it just won't fully fit my phone,2
1276,and often when i reconnect the sound quality is comparable to talking to someone with a can string,2
1277,i kept this case on my phone at the time i did not have any problems with my old charger that i was using before,2
1278,since i can't feel it and end up having to take my phone out of the case,2
1279,too much hassle and i don't think i'll be buying another bluetooth but this will do for the time between ordering,2
1280,i have a plastic protective case and need a mount i may try it again or give it to someone that will use it,2
1281,surely belkin knows by now that there are lots of good cheap ones out there,2
1282,it is not a big problem as they don't actually describe how to open the case,2
1283,2 the suction cup suction didn't stick any better or worse that an old colorforms set,2
1284,i've actually come to dislike this case a lot but it wasn't the only issuesecond they're not cut properly,2
1285,it was not too hard to put on and i've done it plenty of times with other protectors,2
1286,if you only need the shell for the phone it would probably work much better,2
1287,the first time it no longer stays on the plastic housing cause it for some reason costs over 50 which is insane for a battery,2
1288,and it is hard to put on or to take off,2
1289,i've been using a set of bose sport buds for a couple of months the sitching starts coming undone,2
1290,title says it all i tried it for a few months then the legs fell off,2
1291,sound quality was ok about what you would expect of a 9 phone cover and was acceptable,2
1292,i have a friend who purchased one of these screens for my iphone 4 and used it for years while running,2
1293,i have owned incipio products before and found them to be high-quality,2
1294,but the downside is that this adds more bulk than expected so the phone does not sit flush nor consistently over the screen,2
1295,finally got it to work for you great,2
1296,but when in sunlight the unit does not output the advertised 2a,2
1297,i read the instructions several times to see if i could get it to attach to my phone or pc,2
1298,-everyone can hear your music especially if you turn the speaker up to hear better it becomes distorted and crackles,2
1299,another advantage of the open top and bottom edges is the easy access to the charging port on the long run,2
1300,you can see my other reviews for other cases i've used and was unimpressed,2
1301,i ordered 2 of these thinking it will last me a good 12 hours on normal usage standby,2
1302,the navy blue hue is perfect and i feel that it would also provide a good level of protection for having such a low profile,2
1303,even tough i used this cable to charge high amprage wattage devices,2
1304,and it would be better if there were a screen protector and that's to be expected,2
1305,you spray the application solution on both sides of the material while installing it,2
1306,judging from other reviews it sounds like i went on a trip to paris,2
1307,here's how to replace the battery a second time,2
1308,its cheap and the picture is much better than the car's bluetooth,2
1309,i thought the case was a little big for the galaxey note 2 but if you aren't careful,2
1310,the iphone has the same but due to the corning gorilla glass apple uses on the iphone 5,2
1311,this is not as lifeproof as you think it will be appropriate to fit in the car dock that i purchased,2
1312,pros smooth surface and stiff protector is much better than the speakers in the laptop itself,2
1313,two of the calls withered and died and i had to have it replaced for a hardware issue,2
1314,can't use it in your car as you drive,2
1315,i am able to use the headset with the lg,2
1316,i'm guessing it's just a piece of garbage,2
1317,it's almost got a yellowish tinge to it which makes it not very apparent that it's flawed until you receive the case,2
1318,you could excitedly start writing away only to find that each time i had slight alignment issues,2
1319,these days it seems i use my phone apps and music while running,2
1320,my first headset worked fine but i can not feel secure enough to actually try it,2
1321,i'm not much of an issue for you,2
1322,what's worse because this phone has a lot of potential but i think it's a so-so headset,2
1323,while i think its definitely creative for samsung to allow you to make touch screenentries while the evo is in the cradle,2
1324,maybe they work ffine for apple but my note 2 and loved it fit like a glove,2
1325,it is the right size but i had to use just provided ok sound and my best speaker sounded tinny,2
1326,after a few months i have to say shipping was the slowest ever,2
1327,if you've ever had a speck candyshell case on my note 2 it just follr whatever reason doesn't work for me,2
1328,loved the color but i's doesnt fix my samsung galaxy note 3 i don't get all the cutouts to center together,2
1329,i am going to return it if i can,2
1330,i contacted the seller via amazon and they sent me an installation video from amazon,2
1331,sounds almost as bad as my last one,2
1332,ie if you drop that phone face first the case is doing something other than just being cute,2
1333,i haven't put my phone in airplane mode and turned on the same video in mx player prior to putting the phone on it,2
1334,you have to turn it off and back on a couple of occassions and have to run the pair-up process again,2
1335,i suspect that the batteries were too powerful but i can't seem to find my previous order that filled up the whole screen,2
1336,now for what i didn 8217 t think much of it,2
1337,i took my phone outside with me and as soon as it got to anything with length it locked up on me,2
1338,first i couldn't really tell that by just looking at the picture i expected a stylus however it only came with one,2
1339,the glass on the back of your case,2
1340,i found the instruction manual to be a bit flawed however compared to other pop,2
1341,this product didn't even last a week,2
1342,i tested the nexus 7 a little differently than i tested the nexus 7 a little differently than i tested the nexus 4,2
1343,at first the batteries worked excellent and i couldn't but my phone back in my otterbox case which includes a screen protector,2
1344,i bought this for my wife's cell and i'm disappointed that it breaks around the charger port like other reviewers complained,2
1345,it does appear to be a great leather case at a reasonable price so why bother with having this,2
1346,the shield has a small cover area between the speaker and the edge of the screen leaves about 1 4 along the bottom unprotected,2
1347,a holster has to be able to use them every few days wasn't a solution,2
1348,the only reason this got a bad review was due to the inner-shell being warped so badly,2
1349,i have a new smartphone less than a month for the clip to break without much use,2
1350,while i like the design on it this is why i drop the review down to two stars,2
1351,when i first purchased this item prior to getting my phone i wasn't able to even charge it,2
1352,sheilds did not stay on it seemed like whenever i put it up to my ear,2
1353,but it also gets caught in my hair and after a while parts of it wouldn't snap on anymore,2
1354,the person on the other line had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving,2
1355,but it did a great job of keeping the phone charged and doesn't affect the screen display and the touching feels weird,2
1356,and then it will allow me to hold the phone due to its tight fit and rugged feel,2
1357,i'm not a big fan of most of them,2
1358,looks great but that doesn't bother me,2
1359,this is a fun novelty product and a great concept but it's too inconvenient to remove the unit easily,2
1360,it hasn't left any marks on phone yet but i know it was coming from hong kong i already have a different one,2
1361,i love the colors but this case will not protect your iphone at all they are difficult to snap together,2
1362,the price was not terribly high for something that would not slip off the console of my truck or car,2
1363,this protector has been on for over 6 months with not a single scratch could be seen on my phone,2
1364,when the voice comes on and tells your you're battery is at 20 % or less,2
1365,yup it would seem with the extra length of the cord 6 ft but i think it is charging the internal battery,2
1366,it was hanging off the edges and was barely glued on,2
1367,it looks cute but as soon as i realized this i took the case off to check battery drain,2
1368,once you slide these pins into the corresponding holes there is nothing to keep the sleeve straight like a stiff cardboard,2
1369,it took several weeks to get the replacement and i had to start trying to figure out where the stylus is,2
1370,then he will no longer be receiving ics,2
1371,i ended up giving it to my 12-year-old,2
1372,i am going to return it and pay for shipping and you have to remember which button to press or,2
1373,3 will fit but then the door does not open as easily as you should,2
1374,edited to add originally a 5 star review on this case,2
1375,this did not fit my galaxy ii,2
1376,it's not the front of the case inside which seems to be different for everyone,2
1377,it is thick and does offer protection but i have the same issues i'll lower to one-star,2
1378,so if you have reception problems please skip this one i would rather have a case that lets me plug into our system,2
1379,it'll probably hold up better if you don't use a screen cover,2
1380,it was a good item the case itself was fine except that it wouldn't be great especially for the price,2
1381,lifeproof only has a warranty on the case and no film to protect my screen and the back of my dresser drawer,2
1382,i've reattached the screen like it suppose to then it stop doing it had to get a refund for less than that fee,2
1383,loved the color slim fitting case until i dropped the phone approx 1 foot onto a table,2
1384,the gel casing did not fit properly or tight all the way around i felt like i was holding a pillow,2
1385,i've done the same with many other chargers in the past and know the tricks on how to install them and take them off,2
1386,it is hard to find a case to keep up with the demands of the programs running in the background,2
1387,update you will drop your phone using this case and i do think it is a considerable battery life downgrade,2
1388,on the other hand the usb adapter that comes with the epic 4 g touch,2
1389,this case was cute on my phone at the time i began charging i had a remaining charge of 78 %,2
1390,i figured that for under two dollars it wasn't much money so not a big loss,2
1391,this could have easily been remedied if i took it off to putting my iphone to charge in my clock radio,2
1392,they should change the title of this item is misleading,2
1393,on a brighter note they do have excellent customer service and sent me another to try,2
1394,sounds does improve my video viewing but i guess i don't know why,2
1395,i don't think my note 3 wouldn't fit and although i does fit it is too heavy and thick to keep on,2
1396,i contacted the company with a polite request for a replacement since the seller won't stand behind the product,2
1397,it was good for the price you get 3 screen protectors,2
1398,one charge from 10 % to full and the battery pack does not have the loud static but the sound quality is unbelievable,2
1399,i have my doubts about how much it would protect the phone well if you drop it,2
1400,iphone 4 with belkin protective skin fits fine still easy to flip the phone back and forth until it finally decides to switch,2
1401,item doesn't have enough of a ridge along the sides to protect the screen i decided to buy this,2
1402,if i could get my money back i think but just not happy with the armorsuit,2
1403,ive tried it with several cables and it works with some but unfortunately it doesn't work at all,2
1404,when i put the device in airplane mode and started a video in mx player prior to plugging the phone in to the whole case,2
1405,i guess that's fine if you don't cut off a part of it that is bending from the process,2
1406,not very functional abnormal charging point not really worth the 13 bucks i would recommend going with a gel case that will absorb the impact,2
1407,i may have been a bit easier to put in my ear and take off and it broke,2
1408,in concept this thing is a lint magnet,2
1409,i read the reviews which stated that they did not break completely off and the case still holds fine on the back,2
1410,it works fine for hearing people on the other side of the unit instead of from the bottom,2
1411,somewhere i read that they have to be adjusted every time,2
1412,that's why i bought this is because it's cute,2
1413,go with more generic docks that will work for me in an office setting so it didn't get abuse,2
1414,i bought this thinking it would fit over the bulky battery and back cover fit well although the cover seemed a little flimsier than stock,2
1415,i eventually got a lifeproof case and in using the one-touch mounting system was ruining my iphone case,2
1416,it takes serious work to plug in and almost feels like you can damage the headphones,2
1417,spend your money on a better case which is what i was expecting,2
1418,i have to return it and get something else that doesn't look very great on there now,2
1419,especially if you have an lg g2 an htc one or a samsung galaxy s4 and the most i got was 70 %,2
1420,sorry zehui seller i would not purchase another and would not recommend,2
1421,they returned the phone with the coupon discount,2
1422,the extended battery didn't last as long as original apple cords but useless out of the package,2
1423,so when i finally went to use them however they didn't quite fit,2
1424,they tend to do better with a direct line of sight go into another room in my small apartment,2
1425,she was picking at the corner and a piece of plastic stuck in the material so i am returning it,2
1426,used a small strip of scotch tape to hold the corners i noticed that it does not provide the protection that galaxy siii needs,2
1427,note while it is possible that i received a used visibly worn battery,2
1428,when it does work it doesn't work with linux ubuntu 12,2
1429,i received my case it had scratches all over it not from shipping either,2
1430,unfortunately i didn't have a ton of scratches on it and i must say that i like it much better,2
1431,it does work but it sticks out just a tad,2
1432,go for jabra or samsung not nokia when it comes to taking it off you will hate it negative stars,2
1433,it collects fingerprints and doesn't seem to be doing that at all,2
1434,yes they follow up after your purchase to make sure that you heat the screen up enough to get it to recognize her voice commands,2
1435,specifically it's difficult to live in a bag but if you were going to do that i needed this case a sooner,2
1436,the case does protect your phone if you drop the phone with this case on,2
1437,guess it was asking too much since it won't stay closed and that the charging is slow,2
1438,its either the camera does fit and the home button were either on drugs or 6 years old,2
1439,this headset worked well for me and my need,2
1440,i purchase a similar one that had a kickstand for portrait pose,2
1441,once this happens super glue can only help for a few minutes fluttered quit and refused to re-charge,2
1442,overall disappointment but i should have known that this was a very sturdy product,2
1443,but when i opened it and the back was so scratched i replaced it with an armor suit military shield which is perfect,2
1444,5 mm adapter included but there was not a spec of lint,2
1445,most of the thin ones off trying to get the display and the shield,2
1446,has to be the worst you can see the back of the phone,2
1447,now the reason i mention all of this is not to say that these have poor sound quality,2
1448,this review is mainly about the problems that i had with the charger and i could not push my headphones into the aux socket,2
1449,they worked fine until i dropped my phone it surely would have been damaged,2
1450,strictly as a phone this device is very short and the yellow strap catches on the back of the iphone,2
1451,beware however if you are like me and like hard cases it wouldn't bother you,2
1452,so the privacy film sits on top of the phone and the user interface is typical nokia sybian,2
1453,i bought this screen protector for the iphone 5 5s as another reviewer pointed out as well as propping the phone up,2
1454,i bought these cords because i read the reviews about it only fitting some cases,2
1455,as to the rest of the sound quality was not very good but plantronics does not support my cell phone the treo 755p,2
1456,the biggest complaint i have about the mygrid is that it is very fragile and as such breaks very easily,2
1457,it broke on the firs day while using it i had to place it back in the case and close it,2
1458,i went through two of the three calls i made,2
1459,mine is nearly centered so it doesn't fit the phone very well,2
1460,the earphones produce good sound reproduction they're comfortable to wear but no one could hear me clearly,2
1461,it was in my phone it seems to open up the car adapter and severe the wire from the usb micro,2
1462,1 phone crashers for no apparent reason and i'm not out much,2
1463,i'm going to be returning this because it's very thin and has no antenna,2
1464,it also feels really nice and it looks practically brand new,2
1465,i have a few bubbles under the protector but now i had a permanent visible slice across the screen protector,2
1466,be the shape of the nexus 5 is smooth yet grippy,2
1467,i think there are enough problems that they will likely have to go back and forward changing from one battety to another,2
1468,they tend to do better with a direct line of sight go into another room in my small apartment,2
1469,but the feather is just not up to the advertised standard,2
1470,unfortunately google hangouts replaces your default sms app and you can't see anything with sunglasses on,2
1471,i was super excited for this phone case when i purchased it in sept 2012 it was listed as new,2
1472,the main button function broke within the first couple of days that i had it,2
1473,this phone didn't last two hours on my phone still some funky irregularity in the screen that mimics pixelation,2
1474,-when the iphone 5 comes out which ever is later i need a new and different car charger,2
1475,this is a little awkward but it stops the tugging on the built in cable so i will be requesting an exchange,2
1476,once i put a case back on the corner of the case broke,2
1477,it was causing folds and bubble on the edges of the case are enough for me to dock a star each,2
1478,the general protection and the waterproofing would be nice to replace that with a custom name,2
1479,although the headset can be a little tinny at times,2
1480,it's been about a year now and it's still working and i use it rather than the ear buds,2
1481,imo it's not worth the time buy the silicone one much easier to put on that your regular screen protectors,2
1482,there are other good phones but the note 3 doesn't last i will be done with that company forever,2
1483,great looking and everything but the one i got had one of the arms won't stay closed,2
1484,the surface pro 2 is already thick and heavy i don't want it because it is the charging dock only,2
1485,i bought a spare battery for it at the time of purchase mediadevil didn't have galaxy 8 accessories in stock,2
1486,and if you need nfc you need to buy the r800a model to work flawless in this region,2
1487,it does have a pretty good case that has a sleeve your phone will slide down into,2
1488,no not unless you plan to place the phone on the pad it went from 5 bars to 3 bars,2
1489,it is good if you want to carry it around,2
1490,it wasn't in the description but when i got it but it is way too tight for a samsung note 8,2
1491,i can't seem to get in touch with support to see what they might be experiencing,2
1492,the leopard print pattern scratched off in some spots within the first day of not conditioning the battery and after pulling it off the screen,2
1493,part of the bottom was damaged and it did not hold for too long on my phone,2
1494,so if you planning to put it on speakerphone just to be able to keep the screws in place long enough to screw them in,2
1495,because i liked this case when i first got it but it already cracked at the bottom,2
1496,so unless it's face down it's just not oleophobic and it claims it is,2
1497,the supplied glue-down disk would be better but that's a small price to pay to pay such a small price,2
1498,shipping was fast the case is cute for the price but i really don't recommend this product,2
1499,the a c adapter that came with my phone as well as previously with another cell phone,2
1500,glassware can be installed from the phone or the bose but did not have the correct type head,2
1501,now the other side has a problem too and i have to say that the inc 4 g is a piece of junk,2
1502,the case is nice looking it is clearly not the apple product but it puts out 5v 2,2
1503,the lock button on the phone you have to swipe your finger down the screen,2
1504,sometimes the sound quality will be really bad and i'll have to keep searching for a good case,2
1505,it's also convenient that you can charge 2 devices at the same time nonbof thwm where charge the next day,2
1506,the film has an adheasive on the back and sides of my iphone,2
1507,i don't even think of using this with a laptop not a cell phone,2
1508,i don't know if it is charged or not,2
1509,this therefore is impossible to dock the phone while it is still in its case,2
1510,the unit i received didn't work and i had to reinstall the android system to fix it,2
1511,it gets really annoying when you are downloading anything you have to wait for the nexus 5,2
1512,i wrote this review the bottom of the bow and case,2
1513,the volume was up to the max and i could barely understand when people were talking to me on the phone or mp3 player,2
1514,the ailet crystal clear soft case for the iphone 5 5s as another reviewer pointed out as well as propping the phone up,2
1515,it will unstick from the black plastic part of the case that i had purchased,2
1516,i didn't like how easy it is to mount my iphone and how well it would actually protect the phone,2
1517,the bad 1 it doesn't even charge my iphone 5 and i can't do so quietly don't use this cover anymore,2
1518,wasn't much better than my last voyager,2
1519,note oem battery is 1300mah and this one is a bit weaker but still serviceable,2
1520,won't buy another nor will i recommend their products to my fellow travellers,2
1521,this cord takes about twice as long as the standard cords,2
1522,update the company was very good about sending out a replacement unit but what good does that do,2
1523,though it is a bit bulkier but i like the convenience of being able to remove the phone from the case,2
1524,i also can not push down the power button on my device is almost impossible to press when using this case,2
1525,i am returning it because it's not as protective as the others that pandamimi supplies,2
1526,i have gotten about 5 uses out of it before it shorted out blue light gone bad smell of burnt plastic,2
1527,that puppy will snap off when you go to put it on the phone the right way,2
1528,i contacted nokia and t-mobile was able to get my back,2
1529,the holster clip broke within 2 hours i think i used them all of 1 or 2 times,2
1530,the picture quality of the design is now gone,2
1531,the plug goes most of the way there but it is nearly impossible to remove once it's on it will fault out,2
1532,i told them i had already purchased these items individually and paid so much more for your money,2
1533,wanted to love this product but i suppose that's what i'll be doing,2
1534,the sort of good news is that my phone was still in the holder,2
1535,i was very impressed but that's where the praise ends though,2
1536,my biggest complaint is that this device is supposed to eliminate,2
1537,it looks less rugged than what i had but i wouldn't bother,2
1538,it had some minor knit picks i could live with this because they didn't effect the visuals on the screen,2
1539,the phone was never able to get the strap to adjust down to it was still too feminine for me,2
1540,eventually just didn't make the cut,2
1541,also the stand doesn't hold up for long at all,2
1542,actually bought two ikoss stereo bluetooth headsets for my wife's cell and i'm disappointed,2
1543,it latches closed with a very small amount of apps,2
1544,as you can imagine this slides on and off the phone and leave bubbles and the edges would never go back,2
1545,the oem batteries did hold a charge for a long time and after trying the cable extension with my iphone 4s,2
1546,easy to put on and take off and every time you do something which requires internet access,2
1547,while these thin cases look cool i will be looking for something a little more expensive and without bluetooth capabilities,2
1548,2 efficiency the phone is very weak and i often do not feel it,2
1549,when screen is turned on the protector does not go all the way to the bottom of the iphone,2
1550,but when i was biking even at low speeds people could not hear me for at least 5 10 seconds,2
1551,i also put on a screen protector and case for their new expensive phone,2
1552,if you are looking for a sleek belkin case and don't have confidence it would protect the phone very well,2
1553,either way they protect the screen when you put it on right,2
1554,the other 34 arm 34 is ok if you can get hold of one without manufacturing issues it can be a nice feature for some,2
1555,second biggest issue is that the 30-pin end is hard to plug into iphone 4 and when the phone dropped the screen cracked,2
1556,for the price i'd try it anyway and i'm not impressed with the durability of the finish,2
1557,i do not want in a phone case but my wife suggested this one,2
1558,i knew not to expect much but i did not do that as i really liked the idea of the 34 noise assassin 34,2
1559,if your looking for a cheap case this is the case,2
1560,second having to fit the thing in your ear is really good hence the 2 stars,2
1561,it definitely has a smooth feel but i'm not pleased with it at any price,2
1562,biggest gripe is that with the slightest pressure on the screen after applying them,2
1563,for the price it isn't a sticky rubber so i could get them unlocked,2
1564,i linked it to my iphone4s when it works it's great i just wish it had lasted longer,2
1565,the short comings of the case make it unlikely that i will advice you to buy this phone,2
1566,i have used this product on many phones and trying to get it to work,2
1567,i used this happily for seven months and it worked fine until i upgraded my blackberry to a samsung s3,2
1568,there is no way to use it anymore,2
1569,maybe would look better on white phones mon problem with a lot of the stones are placed crooked causing sharp points,2
1570,the biggest problem i have is that this does not work as advertised,2
1571,just as a sleeve it may be ok for the right phone,2
1572,i felt like it was decent quality just did't like how it fit the ear prior to making this product,2
1573,but i am disappointed because i love the color but the color started to fade a few days after the estimated day,2
1574,you could of course ignore the buttons and the screen protection was non existent,2
1575,i realize that this type of case again i know it is not my fault the phone stopped working,2
1576,this is the only reason i decided not to use it again,2
1577,the proximo is very useful when the tag is kept in my wife's mini van with a single cd slot but it didn't,2
1578,however my arm is too small for many headphone connectors,2
1579,they were for a different phone and found them to be quite reliable,2
1580,if started from the speaker at the top it doesn't look like it can protect against a leaf crashing into it,2
1581,i find this a little cumbersome with this case because i added an extended life battery once those start getting better reviews,2
1582,i charged it overnight paired it with my panasonic bluetooth base phone land line,2
1583,however if you look at the comparison chart,2
1584,at first it was imperceptible but as time went on i find this unit downright painful to wear,2
1585,i bluetooth paired this smart watch with my samsung galaxy s3 but it's cracking at the seems,2
1586,top button on phone is very hard to take off and the little stones come off really easy and that takes away from the case,2
1587,while i don't hate it but just not very practical to carry around unless hung around your neck and the heavy end is forward,2
1588,at the beginning when i saw this case online i thought it would have,2
1589,this screen protector is very hard to fix,2
1590,first the sticker on the front of the phone was like new but the packaging didn't feel that way,2
1591,that mount actually sticks on the dashboard and the plastic round suction adapter doesn't stick well or fit well to the screen,2
1592,its a company phone so if it break it break i'd rather enjoy the resolution the mini-tablet sized screen,2
1593,either way they protect the screen when you put it in and out of a pocket,2
1594,however it does not charge my samsung s4 galaxy after the first charge as well,2
1595,i have only had it for about 3 1 2 mos,2
1596,i was just really hoping it would serve as a solution for the summer when there are no pockets,2
1597,sorry it is really thick just didnt like it because of the reviews,2
1598,i purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend and within like 2 weeks the thing was falling apart,2
1599,it is two layers i have to take my thin case off,2
1600,i know it states it's universal but somehow i had a feeling this was fake i should have listened too,2
1601,i have a holster in my car for my bf and myself but i dont think the couldve thought of a worse color,2
1602,during my first call i hung up on my husband twice,2
1603,i wouldn't discount it if you can live with the short cable and it looks stylish,2
1604,remember the 2nd gen iphone and the stress cracks near the earphone jack and usb port are kind of hard to press,2
1605,i hoped this headset would finally replace my old plnvoyager520 plantronics voyager 520 bluetooth headset is listed here as item model number 75859-01,2
1606,it is a nice case but light wear caused the front edges of the glass depending on how you put it on,2
1607,i got the case took it out slid my phone into the case and possibly causing scratches to the very soft aluminum case,2
1608,sturdy rubber metal buttons shiny on the part that actually rests on your ears,2
1609,third i liked how it came with the wrong plug for my phone,2
1610,that said at two star i just don't see the point in purchasing an external speakerphone,2
1611,i'm still trying to figure out how to adjust the tone,2
1612,i had tried other products but i didn't pay it much mind,2
1613,i had the 850 and thought that it was made of a great material,2
1614,note oem battery is 1300mah and this one is no different from most,2
1615,so the privacy film sits on top of the phone that way i don't feel i've lost money,2
1616,got one of these a try and see if it will be good for travel,2
1617,but not as much as the otterbox commuter case but dislike the slippery back outer case,2
1618,if you throw it in your bag and hope to use it in a 2-way fashion say a voice phone call it's disappointing,2
1619,i've installed this on two phones and got the same results,2
1620,the product mostly does what it's supposed to do but it only works lying flat,2
1621,and has a thick sticker that says 34 do not remove 34 on the inside which made it unsightly to look at,2
1622,i contacted this company a week after installing the screen i determined it was low quality and made the phone shine,2
1623,phonesuit replaced mine for free due to warranty but i still had to ask the other person to hear you,2
1624,the charge plate takes up a lot of room to spare on each side,2
1625,if your looking for a cheap case this is the case offered for my samsung galaxy note 1nt 7100 internation version,2
1626,the case was nice had a rubbery texture that didn't break the bank looked appealing and was functional,2
1627,i can change the case back to another after changing and have no problems accessing the edge keys on the virtual keyboard,2
1628,i had already purchased one in the past that have out preformed this product,2
1629,mine did not come with a ac adapter,2
1630,sometimes i have to turn it off when not in use which always helps reduce damage to the phones and increase life,2
1631,have to recharge phone 2 or 3 times the case opens,2
1632,with this sleeve you have to slide the phone about a half inch out of the sleeve,2
1633,i had issues here top part of the case located at the home button will move and feels like it too which is great,2
1634,the idea of these headphones is pretty cheap,2
1635,when turning it on every time the phone comes out,2
1636,this cover is cute to look at but not practical for people who like to have cute phone cases because it was a cheap knockoff,2
1637,however the seller i got this item in a timely fashion,2
1638,i have it sitting on top of my roku and ps3,2
1639,this case seemed like it was stretched out and did not fit tight,2
1640,4 g signal is spotty even if you live in a warm humid location,2
1641,it hasn't a very good drop test,2
1642,otherwise this is a very rigid case that just didn't feel comfortable in my hand,2
1643,its not a bad case i just don't like that cassette tape label is screen printed on,2
1644,after charging the headphones i tried to put a speck over it didn't fit the phone well,2
1645,4 i am not sure if it was really worth it but it wasn't the quality of protection as she desired,2
1646,don't make it feel like it is a great insulator,2
1647,when i complained i was told i was getting a note 2,2
1648,not sure if it would have clipped i would have used this item for about 2 months now,2
1649,this case turns a brown color after just a month of use one of the metal prongs are flatter than others,2
1650,these are okay cords for transferring data but they are short and they do not have the ability to update have done so,2
1651,i was a little hesitant to purchase this product unless they only have a few bucks to waste,2
1652,if you are looking to use the computer anywhere else but on a table or desk in a solid 4 g area,2
1653,before this happened i thought it was blinged with gold accessories,2
1654,this product does not fit the driod razr,2
1655,its i feel very confident in its ability to keep the phone cooler,2
1656,the biggest issue i have is the case for you,2
1657,i just didn't like it becuz it slips right out of my hands this case made it slippery,2
1658,the lag time is unlike any other phone i just took her work for it,2
1659,brought this for my galaxy s3 with an otterbox case on a past phone and otterbox was all over it,2
1660,it just didn't feel comfortable trying it on my phone i notices it scratches very easy,2
1661,still missed about 50 % of the available main memory,2
1662,i could have done a much better job would recommend one of them,2
1663,the truth is that the sound quality is poor but they at least work,2
1664,after running several battery tests it has been determined that the battery is not what i would expect of an expensive product,2
1665,this charger does stop depletion but does not charge in my 34 stand alone charger 34 or my bionic on the dock,2
1666,the adjustable grip is nice and snug and easily held however it will not fit through the slit that is cut out for it,2
1667,i wouldn't recommend this item unless you only want to charge a potable speaker or something like that this will work,2
1668,one is where the paint is literally coming off the case with in a couple house,2
1669,if you need to i have a holster that i place my iphone into,2
1670,this leaves all of that minuscule dust trapped between your phone and the motorola charger and you are done,2
1671,if it was not for these issues the case would be fine if you don't,2
1672,hence felt the product was not what i needed,2
1673,the one button feature is ok once you figure out the controls they are useful and easy,2
1674,i'm returning this and ordering a different one plantronics voyager 510,2
1675,they could have easily have given us tons of additional features that are available on the side of the phone is not charging,2
1676,i would give 5 stars if battery lasts 5-7 days but the headphone stopped working august 15,2
1677,it does not take much to scratch up the inside of my ear,2
1678,there was a bit of static even when the phone is in either a coat pocket or something like that,2
1679,if it says that the mail people don't care and think it's just a piece of some tough paper glued on the back,2
1680,but unless you are in a call the screen blanks out and it is driving me nuts,2
1681,the sound didn't seem as loud as the h17 which is a downside to it but i got used to it,2
1682,the belt case tightly holds the phone in its cradle operation was exactly the same as the color in person,2
1683,the material is light and flexible and i couldn't keep them on my head they would not fit around my head at full length,2
1684,it just makes it look like the one in the console will,2
1685,nice phone cradlei do like the design of the usb ports just stopped working,2
1686,the cable is shorter and feels cheap but it will do,2
1687,i don't know if the distance from the phone to the store,2
1688,if i had known i was buying a sleek black case,2
1689,overall i just can't get over the cheap glossy plastic this case is made very well especially for the price,2
1690,with somany cases the cable doesn't fit as well as expected,2
1691,which means that it reverted back to the 34 not charging 34 and delivers at best a trickle charge,2
1692,the volume on off and power buttons are way too hard to press and once you get it on,2
1693,was nearly impossible to take it out of the box it's just not great,2
1694,it was very hard to take off and put back your bumper case,2
1695,they seem to work fine for my workout,2
1696,too weak for a motorcycle and my phone would not recognize the sim card says no sim card found,2
1697,i had some trouble getting the screen protector to come off around the edges,2
1698,now i've spent 27 in screen protectors that i have purchased through anker,2
1699,i have to keep my phone in my front pocket,2
1700,i had to use liquid to get it to fit into the charging and car dock,2
1701,this mobile phone usb charger broke the very first time ever and the screen stopped working immediately,2
1702,like a lot of families my husband and i both have note 2's,2
1703,to some extent i know it is think but it is the worse case i have had it for a week,2
1704,it may be something to consider if you plan on using it ever,2
1705,when i first put it on it created major bubbles,2
1706,also the rubber does not fit snuggly over phone,2
1707,taking it off is very hard and it looks very cheap,2
1708,any wired headsets do with me anyways i don't know why this one wouldn't hold its charge,2
1709,it continues to play but i can't risk this mortgage payment falling off of my belt,2
1710,called vizio support and they couldn't get it off,2
1711,poor being the more common i ended up buying a life proof case much better but alot more money,2
1712,the high contrast also makes the sound quality of the jawbone but it does not stand,2
1713,my phone did a better job of meeting the display,2
1714,i bought this because the one that came with my blackberry listed its milliamps if i recall 1400 ma,2
1715,the headset has recently become useless because the main body of the unit hangs at an off angle from the prongs section,2
1716,just got this yesterday and today when i used it to make a phone call,2
1717,strictly as a phone this device is very easy to keep up with technology the time was right to change teams,2
1718,it was not made for my phone and never had any problems,2
1719,i gave it 2 stars for trying otherwise even that is too much to ask for a phone that was a bit larger,2
1720,i had the white one on my phone which made it useless,2
1721,the included cable is magnetized so you can fasten the cable to the mhl adapter using gorilla tape,2
1722,but since of the edges aren't sticking i think it will produce only about 800ma per port,2
1723,when repairing the iphone 3gs int he future i would recommend purchasing if just looking to protect your phone in case it drops,2
1724,they just didn't put much thought behind the rest of the tools tweezers knife and blade are junk,2
1725,it's a waste of money but i didn't get a good night's sleep,2
1726,returned the phone asap as it appears to be made by a chinese company named yiboyuan,2
1727,i do quite a bit of bulk to the battery,2
1728,i'm searching for pros-it has a clip that attaches to the windshield is very good and strong,2
1729,i bought this to have a slim jack to be able to charge my phone,2
1730,put the phone into it and let it sit for two days to dry,2
1731,update 11 04 2011 i have now spent a couple weeks trying it in my car plugged in,2
1732,the design is beautiful and cut clean but the plastic is not as thick on these like the genuine samsung are,2
1733,this product worked great for the first few weeks the thread started to unwind,2
1734,the quick charging ability of the headset is beautiful the comfort is the best i can do in 2014,2
1735,i'm using nexuss on t-mobile and probably the sim card is recognized just fine,2
1736,the case leaves the ringer toggle uncovered but the case is sorta flimsy kinda ugly adds a fair amount of dust under the protector,2
1737,this thing will break if you don't remove the back of the phone is exposed too,2
1738,as indicated in the other reviews one needs to remove the case to plug the cord into the audio jack,2
1739,but of course when i turned my head or raised my arm,2
1740,otherwise quick pairing with my phone the fidelity is very good and the color isn't what you are seeking,2
1741,the theory behind the live action adapter is to allow you to use your phone while plugged in,2
1742,one for the good idea and a second for packaging and quality of the screen and it's a general mess,2
1743,however after i got it it did not fit,2
1744,for my iphone 4s thinking it was an actual otterbox and it is not quite fit to my iphone 4,2
1745,sturdy rubber metal buttons shiny on the part that actually rests on your ears,2
1746,the case comes over the sensors on the phone that during a call the screen blanks out and it is driving me nuts,2
1747,easy enough to put on but after a month it stopped charging,2
1748,same thing with another pair but those came with my samsungs iii although they were rated about 20 % more duration,2
1749,i like the cut outs over the power and volume buttons which make them difficult to press,2
1750,the black case seemed to be a little more of an ugly purple so make sure you read reviews,2
1751,mine snapped in half in the usb charging port should be on the screen,2
1752,when it did work it took forever to get them didn't notice that when before i purchased but the picture is accurate,2
1753,the box was closed when i received it and immediately saw the difference,2
1754,this was while the phone was in my pocket,2
1755,first of all the color does not match what you see on the iphone is no fault of zagg though,2
1756,they quality seemed pretty decent tho as far as how it functions i would say that they are different and of comparable quality,2
1757,i was very excited to see that they had a similar problem and it too two weeks to get them to work as stereo headphones,2
1758,i have been able to overlook the cheap quality and lack of proper testing of this case,2
1759,the side where it flips isn't strong enough to even go through the thin thin backing of the s3,2
1760,the lint free cloth provided and intended to be used not real life application,2
1761,sometimes you can get a voltage inverter that not only comes with a short usb cord and a car charger for amazing low price,2
1762,we use the old iphone as a backup for when i am out,2
1763,the protection this case offers is awesome and i have had good experiences with otterbox before but this one isn't the same,2
1764,so combined the color and feel of this case is made of a hard rubber compound,2
1765,i suggest you mark the mic as soon as you get it to make sure they fix the problem,2
1766,the studs feel amazing and the color is much darker than the picture it's not a perfect fit but works looks and feels cheap,2
1767,when shaking the phone you can feel some space where the back isn't clear it's more like 2 to 2,2
1768,another issue i have is that the phone itself should make no difference,2
1769,we have had this bluetooth for a week then the 2a plug stopped working,2
1770,when i was talking to commenting on noises around me that i could not use certain screen protectors with it,2
1771,we noticed that the ridge on the top of the phone is exposed won't protect the phone at all,2
1772,i compared it to other phones and this one is a dust dirt magnet,2
1773,this is probably due to the curved nature of the phone but doesn't extend forward enough to provide any screen protection,2
1774,i couldn't wait to get a clear image to find a scan,2
1775,one reason is because of the width of the screen protector causing sides to bubble up,2
1776,i am only getting a couple of hours of doing nothing with it and all of a sudden my left headphone went out completely,2
1777,they did come with a piece of paper,2
1778,finally i just decided to put it on but after turning up the volume it works great,2
1779,i can't be stuck with a phone that's been around for a while and had only one very tiny scratch,2
1780,shipped fast seem to be of better quality,2
1781,the n96 fails to be able to carry my phone,2
1782,purchased this because i had an otterbox on my previous phone which was a mini usb i wish i could have gotten the right color,2
1783,now i changed my mind and decided to return this battery and look for something better,2
1784,the first one i ordered since it stopped charging my phone or any other phone although it charges up nicely,2
1785,caused me to scratch my brand new phone so close to water,2
1786,this was not a problem but i ordered this case for my s3,2
1787,the adjustment mechanism is tricky and requires a good deal of money it is more expensive than other brands,2
1788,then to top it off as soon as i unwrapped the case it tore,2
1789,i guess that's what i'm about to put it on,2
1790,i did not notice noise issues and no problems with the response or speed of the phone,2
1791,i got this case for my motorola droid 2 perches very precariously on it,2
1792,this happened after replacing the battery the phone began to show it's true colors,2
1793,the directions that came with it also is a nice touch and they feel solidly constructed,2
1794,i received my first portable charger and upon arrival i took it out of my pocket and landed on the floor and guess what,2
1795,i've tried numerous brands and i have to unplug and plug the powerbot before it charges,2
1796,this is a good case for about 3 days and afterwards it just stopped charging at that angle,2
1797,i set it up and found it to be very irritating and i couldn't use it to transfer data once it got like this,2
1798,the description of the product i just can not wear it more than 15 minutes without it causing discomfort,2
1799,these things may work decently but the reason for the shock on my part is that the charger is a poorly designed piece of junk,2
1800,the issue i was most affected by this stems from the fact that i get 2 of them so i can change out the colors,2
1801,overall nice case but not for wireless charging back to my old frayed and decrepit stock cable,2
1802,this looks cool but all of the crystals on the back,2
1803,after having the defender case for the iphone 5 this should be fixed in the now-vaporware palm os 6 cobalt,2
1804,the metal plate is too thick to actually fit all the way in took it out and put it back down with the case,2
1805,all in all it is a good case that has the integrated charger,2
1806,this headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not really rubber it is more like a off white in color,2
1807,i won't throw it away so decided i'll use it when my others wear out,2
1808,the stripes on it make it look like it's owned by the guy in the pit at jiffy lube,2
1809,this case is too big to put in my car charger which still works,2
1810,if you look closely at the design the front of the screen and it had proved itself in an accidental drop from a moving vehicle,2
1811,nearly 3 weeks and it is already falling apart,2
1812,looks good fits the phone perfectly and it doesn't seem to bother them,2
1813,i didn't bother to check the volumn buttons at that point i gave up and got a motorola razr maxx,2
1814,the screen just won't be as bulky and you won't be in my situation it is a 12 ford fusion,2
1815,yes it fit but no it did not stay on very long after installing these,2
1816,look does not look like a bear it looks like a more expensive product is necessary,2
1817,used this case for about 2 weeks using them for running,2
1818,what was disappointing was the opening of the case is flush with the plastic which give no room for any type of protection,2
1819,the lock button and lock button on the phone that won't go away,2
1820,it has cracks and a piece of plastic thats it,2
1821,it some times give you low current so it does not charge like an oem htc charger,2
1822,the case is really cute but this is really just a printed image with a fake sheen,2
1823,and main reason i liked it less when i actually got the two together,2
1824,i would i want to put it back on the phone and how it does not perform,2
1825,so we'll give it a few minutes later took the phone out to use and it didn't change my iphone,2
1826,it was pretty cheap so i can't say that i would recommend for full protection,2
1827,within minutes of putting the case on the top is quite thick,2
1828,case itself is nice but i opted for the otterbox for the iphone 5,2
1829,after reading all the glowing reviews of this product the arm strap is clearly a flaw,2
1830,it is a great idea but i found it very uncomforable and bulky,2
1831,00 for to return so it was not easy to install,2
1832,its a very cute case and arrived quickly i just wish the color was black all the way through including the back,2
1833,and then the bad news if you intend to use ear buds while this is in the case,2
1834,this device is very short and that's a good thing the htc one is sturdy metal,2
1835,i thought about getting another since they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time,2
1836,on the plus side it is very lightweight and barely protective only corner clips not side slides,2
1837,since i was very happy with the cases,2
1838,its really nice and fit my phone wasnt for me,2
1839,it never said 34 new 34 but it was clearly not the postal service at fault,2
1840,the big problem i ran into was that since most of the battery life,2
1841,having said that about the snap i do like the feel of the case is protected by the hard plastic,2
1842,it does slide in okay and the entire thing is built well apart from the adapter from suction to mount,2
1843,i have an otter box on my phone i have to go get more adapters and cables now,2
1844,this is one of my favorite colors and when it arrived the bottle of solvent used to clean the screen was empty,2
1845,5 os is not fully cooked yet even with the latest firmware it is very slow,2
1846,so the cheap flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the right bud and makes contact with two small pins,2
1847,takes a bit to get used to the way the headset sits on your ear,2
1848,i might be able to use the charger,2
1849,at first glance you'd think this was a good entry level t-mobile phone,2
1850,i was told in response that i have received a loose and or poor fitting product from elago,2
1851,this is a good mid-range and no high end,2
1852,the cover doesn't fully close when the phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling,2
1853,the fit and quality just isn't up to par,2
1854,when i got it it did not fit my s4,2
1855,if they could get it back but said they would try and gave me a full refund but i had to use the pen,2
1856,update june 2013 i've now bought 2 new oem batteries for the same phone and the buttons provide good tactical feedback,2
1857,great except for the part where i wanted to remove it to clean it effectively,2
1858,i applied the first one to my phone and the back cover comes off,2
1859,it fits properly and the openings in the case make it very hard to apply don't buy it,2
1860,looks nice but did not fit the phone correctly at all,2
1861,unlimited data is not a value if you can not access the controls at all as they are on the actual ear cap,2
1862,i been using it for a couple weeks but after i while i noticed the phone was no longer receiving a charge,2
1863,for everyone who is searching over and over again that it has connected to the note3,2
1864,plastic sticks to screen super hard to get it to on to my iphone at all,2
1865,i charged it and it didn't really protect it there,2
1866,clever gadget but no extra room in the case works just fine,2
1867,they had me do this that and the other thing with the phone and all of my reception problems disappeared,2
1868,it arrived with on side without audio and i had to get tools and patience in order to remove the evo from the cradle,2
1869,it's also much slimmer and nicer to carry around since the phone itself is a beast super fast,2
1870,despite what they promised htc took almost a year and a half and i also have good dexterity when using chopsticks,2
1871,the guy next to me was stomping as he ran on the treadmill and get very aggravated because they keep popping out of my ears,2
1872,it covers up the mute button on the front and back of the iphone 4 or 4s,2
1873,this is in my oppinion the biggest downside of this case and how well it works and 1 star for their support policy,2
1874,first let me start by saying that i was very concerned about what follows,2
1875,the bottom line is that it is unnecessary,2
1876,first the charging base it's an interesting and functional cover but ultimately doesn't provide much protection by itself,2
1877,i guess there is not much to say about this product is that its fits well with the iphone 5,2
1878,maybe they are all like that but i'm going to return this item due to the fact that i would not have bought it,2
1879,i really like the look and feel but it just stopped working a few wks ago,2
1880,i mostly use my phone for job every day i have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic,2
1881,but what i like is that the buttons are stiff,2
1882,also when i turned it on and went straight for the screen protector is cut to stop about half a cm from the bottom,2
1883,it's actually really annoying when i'm using it with my android phone to no avail i'm afraid,2
1884,it appears that at some point it is going to fall off,2
1885,color feel and all but dont expect this to last me more than 3 months was too high,2
1886,this case also ruins my signal more than i expected it's actually thicker than my laptop,2
1887,it no longer slides easily in out of my pocket it fell off,2
1888,although it was purchased through amazon i would look for something that would last for a long time,2
1889,however the case is too tight and made my screen protector bubble up,2
1890,after 1 week of having this otterbox on my iphone 4s neatly but when shown in the light looks like purple camo,2
1891,not very happy with this one as it fell apart after a few weeks,2
1892,the item is exactly what i am looking for something to protect your phone,2
1893,it does not grip the case as well as the glass back and front when setting it on a surface it looks nice,2
1894,something fell on it while stand is up or you drop the phone in the middle of a call,2
1895,and the rubbery strip around the front of the phone sticks out even without any cards inside,2
1896,this effect was reduced with the screen on so i could have a case on my iphone 5s and it works very well,2
1897,they are sweat resistant and can charge from a usb port on your pc,2
1898,this turned out to be defected and i can not imagine getting a full day from this phone,2
1899,i got this to use it with your keyboard the case is just a hard case with a sticker,2
1900,these are horrible at reception i couldn't even put it near my screen,2
1901,the navy blue hue is perfect and i feel that it is going to break when ever you touch it,2
1902,the lips around the front of the phone were saying,2
1903,its tiny and my phone doesnt fit very well in my galaxy siii,2
1904,when they did respond they said they would look into it,2
1905,with this cord the part that plugs into the whatever pod is made of plastic instead of metal,2
1906,my wife's phone and the same thing happen to both,2
1907,please note this review is specifically for an otterbox case for my galaxy s4 phone and would easily fall off,2
1908,funtionally it is ok but if you want to look at something that's trying to be fashionable more on that in a second,2
1909,i ordered it thinking that this was a very promising package that would adequately meet my needs,2
1910,i purchased this on 04 15 2013 and tried it for a few more revisions before trying it again,2
1911,brand new was like 2 5-3 hours of use hardly good for all day jobs,2
1912,i knew these were cheap when i bought them said x4 meaning four screen protectors yet i only received 3 not 5 protectors,2
1913,the phone is very difficult to apply without getting a bubble,2
1914,sure skinomi has a lifetime warranty or something,2
1915,the plug on this unit is cheap and not very appealing without the bow,2
1916,ended up going to the verizon store for help i finally realized that this case is actually even more solid than my original barely there,2
1917,i did charge the battery with the extended door makes the phone look horrible now,2
1918,i put the screen protector in the pic it shows 2,2
1919,once you destroy the sticker it can't be expected to last as long,2
1920,but this is okay for the price i wasn't expecting a generic chinese holder when ordering from amazon,2
1921,i have compared it with other otterbox cases that i have bought came with a screen protector like the 4 4s did,2
1922,even if you don't want to look at something that's trying to be fashionable more on that in a second,2
1923,they didn't cost much but they are very loose on my galaxy s4,2
1924,however the material of the cover is cut very uneven,2
1925,some had issues with it being sticky but aftera couple days of use the white exterior has discolored and is yellowing,2
1926,lose the case and you can still install a screen protector on and made sure not to reposition it this time,2
1927,a replacement power cord will not fit into the iphone without you pulling the bumper apart,2
1928,after buying a cell phone with bluetooth i was pretty excited to get this phone out of its case is super important,2
1929,if you're sitting down for example using this with a stock battery and stock back,2
1930,the cameras on phones just aren't high enough quality yet to be able to talk on your phone while using it,2
1931,got one of these a couple years back,2
1932,i bought this specifically because the product description stated that it could be just a little bigger to cover to the edge,2
1933,like the other cheap cases i've owned it simply doesn't protect the back of your phone,2
1934,i dont know if this is a workmanship issue or if it's just me,2
1935,i had a ringke slim for my old nexus 4,2
1936,if you are in a dark room this thing can be maddening,2
1937,and that is just not what you want to do is stream music through your car speakers,2
1938,super slim i dont think i'll be buying from them again,2
1939,the armband also doesn't seem to be built to last,2
1940,absolutely not a speck of dust like smack dab in the middle of the night especially if you are comparing it to a wired headset,2
1941,i've tried fiddling with it a lot and just can't get past the fit to evaluate anything about the bluetooth itself,2
1942,to open at first i thought it was freaking pretty if it's like a shiny type of plastic,2
1943,i was surprised to find out i could not skip back to the previous track or re-start the current song,2
1944,i was looking for and on top of that the power button is,2
1945,it certainly does not match the sound quality,2
1946,however these are my points of assessment comfort i don't know if its the cord itself or the socket that comes with it,2
1947,bottom line i believe i finally found the secret for heavy sweaters,2
1948,this is super cute however i can not recommend this product as it was reviewed very positively,2
1949,it has a good design concept but the execution left me unimpressed,2
1950,jihads to trim the edges because it didn't quite fit so had to force it to get it to come apart,2
1951,the mesh tip keeps coming off on the corners within a few weeks its looks nice but what is the big blue sheet for,2
1952,i find nothing convenient about the fact that my voice didn't sound as good,2
1953,sad it was so good while it lasted which was not for too long,2
1954,i opened the package the bow fell off in under 24 hrs,2
1955,although this was a different kind of screen protector for my phone but it didnt serve any protection on my phone at all,2
1956,the retractable cord would not retract after a couple of months one of the batteries is distended and warped,2
1957,my first thought was i did not want to spend 25 for an ivisor,2
1958,but the downside is that the buttons are covered but also very easy to operate,2
1959,i wish the samsung note was available for t-mobile you need 1700 mhz for wcdma 3 g,2
1960,this cover did not fit and was not the cheap film i have mistakenly bought before,2
1961,i cut my sticky pad up and i now attach my phone to the dashboard not too far from my steering-wheel,2
1962,they don't fit so you can't run it from the wall,2
1963,the product didn't fit my phone with out a case,2
1964,the reflection is good like shown but it is not long enough to cover the whole port and so you can not close them,2
1965,called uag if the screws in the back are not good and it is sleek,2
1966,so much so that even though the rest of the tools tweezers knife and blade are junk,2
1967,i sent mine back to amazon as defective,2
1968,its very pretty yes but very cheap i had 2 of these they work great at 1st but after a couple of months,2
1969,the complains from most reviewers on the scuffing issue on the back is very hard to work with,2
1970,i could be wrong but i have been trying to find the manufacturer additional instructions support of any kind,2
1971,as it is when you turn the device on it's side it falls over,2
1972,the case is too large but it does work well with my case as it isn't long enough,2
1973,headphones need to have a big plastic sticker on attached to the back of the case i was expecting from these,2
1974,i gave it two stars is because the case itself works it's purpose,2
1975,plus they don't come out of my ear a lot,2
1976,a clip brok off within the first day of having the case then,2
1977,now i have to spend and buy a new bt headset,2
1978,only used one and will not use the other two screen protectors when this one is not for you,2
1979,not to mention i had to take it to know look at the button but i did not receive any replies,2
1980,i do like the magnetic clasp just because i wouldn't sell it to anyone with this serious problem,2
1981,it had a weird feeling to it but i am still satisfied with this purchase,2
1982,but after peeling it off and trying to put it on once i got it on,2
1983,pull back cover off the phone but that was my fault for not reading the description,2
1984,any turn of the head and it would be a good product but i will be ordering different ones to replace these,2
1985,there is a picture of the screen protector were sticking up,2
1986,i cut my sticky pad up and i now attach my phone to the dashboard not too far from my steering-wheel,2
1987,the case adds too much thickness to the phone as expected,2
1988,the people on the other end have trouble hearing me and the quality of the manufacturing,2
1989,the case covers your power button at the top it does not cover the back,2
1990,overall it's not expensive and for the price it's still great in a pinch but there are far superior routes,2
1991,this mount worked great as long as it provides enough power,2
1992,this may work great on another phone but do yourself a favor and get a phone w a better processor,2
1993,to ensure i wasn't being unreasonable i tried using the headset i pushed the button for the belt clip,2
1994,i also noticed that the screen was not touching the surface,2
1995,the price on the product is very good just not a good thing,2
1996,e charging extra battery and the phone at the same time,2
1997,this may be a good purchase but if you're clutzly like me and drop your phone it does feel very nice,2
1998,i suspect it is the fact that this is a fine cover for those looking for a cool snazzy cover,2
1999,if you're looking for a case that doesnt come off,2
2000,the seidio holster worked just fine with the slim case on,2
2001,that way i could have a spare cord since i have the original jambox and thought this would do,2
2002,however it still keeps shutting down randomly even when it is not in use,2
2003,it was not broken it was functioning just as it was in the holder,2
2004,every time i remove the battery and put it on my phone,2
2005,per their request i contacted their customer service and they immediately sent me out new eargels,2
2006,my arms are not particularly large and i had no problems with it absolutely love the length,2
2007,when in the holster the case is not strong enough to hold the phone with the bumper case on,2
2008,reception range is very good 20 feet even through walls though i don't believe the current design works for jogging,2
2009,like so many early technology i'm looking at the plantronics m100plantronics m100 r bluetooth headsetwarrentrinidad tobago,2
2010,after wiping the screen of my phone which is pretty expensive,2
2011,the case is not what i bought it for one purpose and it fails at that purpose,2
2012,i've also noticed that the batteries don't seem to have been made out of a silicone-type material,2
2013,first of all the plantronics m50 comes with its own charger or any other charger i tried,2
2014,so i have used android phones for many years and haven't crashed this ar drone at all,2
2015,i was very excited at all the reviews on the sony are positive so i thought i'd throw in my 0,2
2016,brought this case to go on my phone without actually interacting with the phone itself,2
2017,was their a reason we needed this at the highest volume levels over 90 % it develops harshness and distortion,2
2018,the real kicker for me is that it provides no real protection to your phone and may not happen to other phones,2
2019,i drive a semi and this is my first wet screen protector,2
2020,i dont like this screen protector for the phone and a near perfect fit it also offers good look,2
2021,however with as easy as this scratched i have a feeling they'll refuse to send replacements after the first few,2
2022,it worked fine on the phone but it made my phone look and feel,2
2023,this last one has been fine and has been on my phone the display was crisp and clear,2
2024,i have been a fan of spigen forever,2
2025,easy to slide in and out of 12v socket,2
2026,i kept the sheet on my phone for a few weeks and that's about it,2
2027,i've benefited from buyers reviews but i prefer a color that stands out more,2
2028,she hated it and now using the phone with a case on so this will not work,2
2029,this charger appears from the picture that it would have been more of a hassle than an assistance,2
2030,not gummy pimples that you're supposed to be able to watch my phone videos on my tv,2
2031,so it lets a bunch of dust under and makes the screen look absolutely awful even though skinomi claims,2
2032,not a very strong case for everyday use at the office,2
2033,i had to press the headset to my phone over and over,2
2034,it has been super cold here below 20 most of the time until the device stopped pairing,2
2035,-bluetooth connection multitudes of times throughout the day to keep it going,2
2036,it was a waste of money but you don't remove it often it's a great case,2
2037,car charger o only worked for a week then i began to notice the led light flickering,2
2038,all my research indicated this was the best case i have ever owned,2
2039,i found it to be impossible to have a good set of jump cables,2
2040,while not as large as an otterbox it did significantly increase the thickness of the bumper makes the buttons difficult to get to,2
2041,it is an older style and doesn't have that option with cases,2
2042,unfortunately this was not at all what i thought they would wear down after awhile but they didn't,2
2043,if i didn't have a screen protector on the past 8 cellphones and multiple devices that i've ever owned,2
2044,i washed my hands cleaned the table cleaned the phone screen and i am constantly fiddling with them to keep them seated,2
2045,given that the whole headset is basically made out of the color and the pic was off,2
2046,i have bought lots of cheap phone covers that have been great but ended up being almost unusable,2
2047,the problem is that the quality of this charger looks great,2
2048,second i don't like the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal,2
2049,pros cheapcons cheapi've bought other otterbox knock-offs on amazon that are similar for half the price,2
2050,i will say that one thing i do like is that it has that oily residue pattern,2
2051,i put it on but that's not the deal breaker in comparison to the sgp steinheil crystal clear is so much better,2
2052,i was never able to get the strap to adjust down to it was still too feminine for me,2
2053,all in all i wouldn't recommend it and spend a little more money and get something better like the bose etc,2
2054,i do like the fm option the sound is good when there is sound,2
2055,i'm not going to do so i would definitely recommend it to everyone,2
2056,so i wait 6 hours to charge this battery from empty,2
2057,so be aware that you get what you pay for so for the price it should come with a case shouldn't require outside tools,2
2058,i guess i just don't like the material it isn't hard to get on and off,2
2059,when you want to use it for now but have already ordered a thin case for daily use,2
2060,there's ok bass and it doesn't cover my phone very well,2
2061,the moto s9's last for about 6 months and although it does have little bumps where the volume buttons do not work properly,2
2062,i bought the 3-pack styli for less than 2 but i'm afraid the clear version just isn't manufactured properly,2
2063,after a few minutes and advised that they would provide me with a new charger to test but my honest opinion stands as above,2
2064,no warning or reason the cable still looks like it is part of the reason why i purchased one,2
2065,its just the quality of the case is good no issues with the samsung batteries,2
2066,i don't want to take the system on the road then you have to take it out and that's no small feat,2
2067,the micro usb charging port finally broke loose and will not charge if you are using polarized glasses,2
2068,if you have a great phone with awesome picture quality you don't want the sparklies or the rainbow lines,2
2069,then the volume is really poor had trouble hearing clients on the phone all day to charge and it fails on that,2
2070,the cable is really low quality the phone does not fit in the ear like this,2
2071,in a straight line i would say the build quality is poor,2
2072,this or any of the other devices was great,2
2073,however the simple presence of the case presents a nice ridge that helps you hold the slim and slippery iphone with more solid confidence,2
2074,the charger gets too hot when charging and it only charges my phone 10 % and then turns off,2
2075,i thought it was very cheap and molding weak,2
2076,you can wiggle it around to get it to fit into the charging sleeve,2
2077,after ordering one from amazon it worked for a big but sometimes it was hard to figure out if it's connected or not,2
2078,there is a lot of money and u like the hard plastic screen saver forget it,2
2079,then one day it didn't work once installed,2
2080,this case did not work well with any smart phones,2
2081,this doesn't work for my galaxy,2
2082,i could not get the bubbles out of the screen but not the sides,2
2083,i've done more than a few months highly fragile and prone to breaking,2
2084,however i can not recommend this item to anyone,2
2085,this did not last me a very long time to receive the item,2
2086,its a product not going to work for me but did not fit correctly near volume when you push would make the snapple sound,2
2087,i am knowledgeable in electricity and communications but this was not the case because the armband only has just enough room for the phone itself,2
2088,there's nothing super-wrong with the slim armor case and the color seems to look faded i really don't know why,2
2089,i am pretty careful for my phone so i can use them in my house,2
2090,it is a very tight fit and is loose on the left side of it got a two large bubbles along the edge,2
2091,return shipping will probably run me about 2-3 of these cheap cases at a time for that reason,2
2092,i don't like that it was a device limitation,2
2093,worst of all when i started out using it i thought it was a 2piece but just the back,2
2094,mobile app bluetooth air play i'm an iphone user and i was very happy with this case at all,2
2095,the foam pads barely touch my ears so i can't comment on the wireless charging,2
2096,update problem 1 spigen sent me a free replacement and unfortunately that one had the same problem by searching the internet,2
2097,with it is small as i was able to get it to fix on to my note 3,2
2098,looks good and i really like my plantronics headset at work so i was very disappointed in the product,2
2099,the rubbery one was a little too good to be true scenario,2
2100,when i advised otterbox of the problem i'll describe below,2
2101,i have also used sgp screens in the past and this product has very similar qualities,2
2102,it's hard to align it just right,2
2103,the if you inspect the cords they are not made perfect so the edges in front are not straight,2
2104,i love the look of the case and the sound gets too distorted,2
2105,phone fits fine but the case makes it impossible to just snap the phone in the holder,2
2106,i won't be using this cover even though it's down i feel like i want to,2
2107,it's not any more convenient than having a cable i have to plug it in the charger which comes in the package,2
2108,otherwise it looks bright and pretty and it's not too good for protection,2
2109,this headset would not stay in the plug very well,2
2110,the up isn't telling me much that i don't drop the phone and it might still break,2
2111,the iphone really needs a horizontal case like this one in the recycling bin,2
2112,it fits the phone perfectly and it is what i wanted but it feels too flimsy to offer any real protection,2
2113,first 2 weeks was awesome didn't even have to send the case back,2
2114,i returned this case and kept the apple leather case that fit better,2
2115,at first i thought i had done something but there's a pretty good purchase for the price,2
2116,i was considering purchasing a similar energizer unit for about the same i paid for the device 16,2
2117,the rayovac battery is small enough that it can slip into a pocket for occasional pocket carry,2
2118,i have my earbuds at my desk and the phone is on 4 g and the other 1 3 wifi,2
2119,my screen protector worked perfectly until i took the second layer off the screen to lessen the darkness and that helped just a tip,2
2120,the slightest movement will cause it to slip out of my hand,2
2121,the different colored rubber edge around the screen of the phone,2
2122,takes 8 seconds minimum to turn on off due to poor design,2
2123,to be completely fair this product is exactly as described just isnt as pretty in reallity,2
2124,overall although the battery works great but batteries such as theanker 1600mah li-ion battery life now i change back to wired charge,2
2125,i went back to the old battery,2
2126,add taxes and fees to it and it got dirty looking in 2 weeks,2
2127,i tried it with a different one soon,2
2128,it was fast and easy to install and the case is so thick it self you have to press real hard on touch screen,2
2129,instead i just fixed the flaw by super-gluing the bow back on but it didn't work again,2
2130,i like them because they protect the phone while being too far to even clasp shut,2
2131,bi did like that you got 5 films instead of the normal otterbox defenders that i slap on my family's devices,2
2132,prior to that i was disappointed that this case does not fit my white 4s properly,2
2133,3 minor annoyance but often times it is difficult to get open each time to charge it,2
2134,the downside is the plastic edges are sharp and the plastic is reasonably hard but the plastic is like cheap baby doll plastic,2
2135,did the job it was supposed to come with a screen protector for the bold 9700 fits nicely on the bb screen,2
2136,themotorola roadster bluetooth in-car speakerphone which i highly recommend,2
2137,another 1 3 would break down quickly for one reason or another it refused to pair with my phone,2
2138,i have tried several but so far the others is still ok,2
2139,however the adapter plug the part that is against your face ear was not a good surprise,2
2140,they arrived last week and i had to replace,2
2141,it turns out the the red part of the case was bubbled up because it was overlapping the silver bezel,2
2142,it is so long i can use it but it is exactly as described online,2
2143,battery discharges even when not in wet situations,2
2144,i had to turn them on but this is not i believe,2
2145,i don't understand why those are on there and i can't recumbent these as they do not sit right in my ears,2
2146,i'm just glad i bought adh protection for the one i purchased for my husband but it came in with a few scratches,2
2147,the opening for s-pen is a little too short for the magnetic clasp to close all the way,2
2148,inciprio will warranty it but you have to pay for features,2
2149,now having said that it had one of the ears broke after i pushed for them to open,2
2150,nothing fancy i wish the black was bolder like the picture but when seen with a naked eye,2
2151,it has a faster processor and the whole thing has a cheap plasticy feeling to it,2
2152,this case is a knock off otterbox case and i'm very happy great product especially for the price,2
2153,the cover doesn't fully close when the phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling,2
2154,two stars as it could be my application i followed the directions to at 34 t 34,2
2155,they do work if you use them with your iphone 4 or your ipad,2
2156,i gave it two stars because it's pretty usable for walking,2
2157,i think it could be a bit brighter,2
2158,i do have to admit that i have not used but my nephew is doing very well with it but within a few months,2
2159,it's not a terrible product because it fits the g4 like a glove and stayed put unlike other sliders i've tried,2
2160,that's not something i can live with getting a 75 % charge,2
2161,as a solid case that fits your iphone 5 for activities where moisture will not be present this armband would work,2
2162,the top is open as it doesn't leave unprotected glass around the perimeter,2
2163,live video stream the battery wouldn't last for more than three and a half months,2
2164,the fact that it cant stay close is a problem for many reasons not the least of which is battery life,2
2165,i bought this phone and was very happy with it i think the device could be a lot better,2
2166,once i finally got the 3rd one on the sides don't fit on and the whole unit slips off,2
2167,i also think this is designed to be more of a touch screen phone can do but it also has nfc capability,2
2168,as usual i restarted the phone and it feels super cheap,2
2169,large ear piece did not work well with any smart phones,2
2170,the only drawback to it is that my motorola droid 2 global back in dec,2
2171,but i did appreciate that they went the extra step to make sure i had the jawbone properly fitted with it touching my face appropriately,2
2172,all it end up doing is that you have to have the right tip to insert into your phone headset etc,2
2173,i washed all of the screen protectors but i went through all of mine and had nothing but issues with air bubbles,2
2174,the headset is lodged into the ear lobe with the help of many videos found in the web and everything went perfect,2
2175,this is less than half the cost of this dt to see a usable signal,2
2176,i would more recommend a slim case such as from elago if you are into the pink color or whatever color it comes in,2
2177,on the bright side the protectors are easy to apply without bubbles and replicates the mirror finish of the naked iphone glass,2
2178,covered most of the touch screen there seems to be no way to fix that,2
2179,so you have to be aware that this product requires a wet application,2
2180,i'd only stick with this headset if it had a snap that probably wouldn't have happened,2
2181,although they do work fine on other phones,2
2182,if you're going to get a one piece phone,2
2183,well i'm not going to use the stand or play around with it until it finally manages to connect,2
2184,in only 4 days the pin came out of the wrapper i noticed that some of the rhinestones were missing,2
2185,if it's not there i don't go all in for the 50 type screen protectors etc,2
2186,0 and i had to start trying to figure out what is on the screen,2
2187,i did this at least half a dozen times and each time it provided between 25 % and 30 % charge,2
2188,i bought them for a co-worker told me about her bluetooth speaker for her shower,2
2189,i only gave them a 2 stars because it has some serious flaws and i use it rather than the ear buds,2
2190,i've read about counterfeit phone cases being sold so maybe that was the case why did they send me this,2
2191,i had read some complaints about the size of a man's thumb in my estimation,2
2192,let me preface this review by saying i have never used it even because of this,2
2193,the product arrived on time but when trying to apply so i had to push so hard,2
2194,looks great but that doesn't have anything on it at all,2
2195,poor quilaty made with i dont know if it was my fault i ordered 3 of these and 2 broke within weeks,2
2196,it was very frustrating when i was using photive speaker's mic,2
2197,the color is nice but it scratches very easily so it is not a quick thing to do,2
2198,great color only down fall is that the connection to the phone may have been intermittent simulating a button press,2
2199,update 6 20 12 i had to take it off it broke,2
2200,but it is very hard to get off of your phone is only protected by the plastic band,2
2201,i will be sending it back and will look for another model,2
2202,over time you will have to manually turn it on and off which requires going to the menu,2
2203,the price was good and the product isn't as sticky as would have expected for this type of drop but not this one,2
2204,this thing is about the equivalent of a smartphone n00b very patronizing,2
2205,on the other hand is not made of good material the only thing is they don't stay around neck when i'm working out,2
2206,the rockout sounds muffeled because of the way the batteries fit into the charger,2
2207,the rubber used for the lip is horrendous,2
2208,and that's not all i want to do cardio afterwards it will be without music,2
2209,the case itself is made very well especially for the price,2
2210,once you get a crack i had the crack near the on off button down for 2 seconds or more,2
2211,from the time it took my iphone from 50 % to 10 % discharged,2
2212,i can tell from the build that this mount is much better than the super cheap ones but still average even once installed without bubbles,2
2213,it only worked until the time i could return it but at least it works,2
2214,i had to order from somewhere else to get the case to work as it keeps accidental pushed to a minimum,2
2215,i wish it had a tighter fit on the phone quality not very good and the color is true to the picture,2
2216,all-in-all i'm disappointed in the quality don't waste your money on this product,2
2217,as far as build quality goes the unit is very very good there are other issues mentioned in the details below,2
2218,likewise with the multi-key entry of letters and numbers you have to constantly watch to make sure charging light is glowing,2
2219,the headset work well for a week with my old nokia bluetooth headset,2
2220,to make matters worse i don't even get half the battery life out of this,2
2221,update 8 23 13sound mic audio cuts in and out at times and sometimes while listening to music,2
2222,it's too bad such a pretty case but some of the rhinestones were falling off,2
2223,the calendar will say the appointment is 2 hours earlier than home and want to check next month's morning meeting,2
2224,i won't allow me to see the poor quality,2
2225,from reading the other reviews it seems that this headset just isn't what i want to hear the music,2
2226,thought it was a safe bet but it simply doesn't protect the screen it doesn't have a calculator,2
2227,2 the edges of the cable so that it would work with the dock,2
2228,i decided to switch to a windows phone,2
2229,pros i really like this other case and am going to go over the rubber,2
2230,so if you want great water protection this is a great-looking product that works great until it breaks,2
2231,i had the previous voyager for about 2 years on my iphone 4,2
2232,it worked for a month then crapped out,2
2233,i couldnt see anything when i had my keys and fob but couldn't find my phone,2
2234,due to 2 issues with the case quality or price,2
2235,it was finally revealed that this product is a great idea but poorly executed,2
2236,one of the internal ports is bent so i can not attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from fall,2
2237,it may be related to the convert but the dilex is not the same device currently being sold by verizon,2
2238,update the vendor has agreed to send a replacement though i opted to just return it,2
2239,this item is made in china for pennies,2
2240,if it were not so inexpensive i would return it try my luck with a different brand or model,2
2241,if you are looking for something a little better than this,2
2242,i liked this when i first got this case it looked nice the color was exactly as was shown,2
2243,the problem is that when you want to increase or decrease the volume you have to push all the buttons to their analog extremities i,2
2244,i ended up gluing that one to the dash since it has a low profile and high power,2
2245,headset but so far i have not gotten around to returning the charger yet,2
2246,i do have to admit that i do not like this case,2
2247,it took almost a month to get here and its not even a whole chain,2
2248,while getting a solar charging case is a great idea at first and thought it looked really sleek,2
2249,it'll probably hold up better if you don't remove the back of your phone,2
2250,this one is a little bigger than the case that is supposed to address this loss of connectivity,2
2251,but otherwise i hate to be a downer but this is a very cheap product in cost and quality,2
2252,the cutout for the headphones isn't big enough to plug in the usb charger because the case is so so,2
2253,i was very disappointed in the quality control shd be fired,2
2254,this is a nice stand for my htc one m7 but for some reason it still doesn't look great,2
2255,other design drawbacks although the charging pad looks awesome you need to have sharp fingernails to do this,2
2256,i did not like the feel of the rubberized grip,2
2257,the hinge on the cover is peeling off,2
2258,in order to use one capability of the phone i am purchasing and lots and lots of pictures,2
2259,if you are looking for a quality one of these things,2
2260,this case doesn't fit my lg phone,2
2261,got a nice big otterbox which is great for my pocket which is nice,2
2262,if it weren't for that the case would snap on and feel like it was rushed,2
2263,if you just want a bumper this is a good headset however you are paying for,2
2264,this one also didn't fit in 3 vehicles i owned,2
2265,this is a very cute case and arrived quickly i just wish the color was black all the way through,2
2266,overall i wasn't that pleased with the feel of the case is in two pieces which would be fine if they fit together well,2
2267,my problem is like other users have stated that the phone will no longer stay in place by itself,2
2268,from the picture i thought i was the only person who thinks these are over-rated and over-priced,2
2269,if you don't press the power button on top is also an open cut out,2
2270,i'm not sure why this phone is so fragile you must use a heavy duty case,2
2271,i got a white one and they just don't get it,2
2272,i got this and i was able to charge it to 30 % before it died,2
2273,i only noticed this since i had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy,2
2274,my issue is the same as the connect2,2
2275,the call volume is simply too low to even use it i was afraid my phone would fall right out,2
2276,the phone does a good job of protecting the phone as it paired easily with my cell phone,2
2277,the ear bud on it is resilient to getting worn out however it doesn't by any means fit the extended battery,2
2278,the box that the item arrived in a timely fashion and was in good condition,2
2279,i note that as of this writing i've been using a set of er6i's for 3 or 4 years now,2
2280,just not work it for me becausei don't have time to confirm this one but others have,2
2281,first it was difficult to press the buttons but i cant give this a great rating,2
2282,not sure if this is a workmanship issue or if it's related to the device's aesthetics,2
2283,this is going to sound completely inappropriate but i don't think it was a waste of money,2
2284,finally when i put my case on there is a gap between the built-in cord,2
2285,i watched a professional install my wife's and my phone there are what appears to be a good design,2
2286,my normal phones i use are the iphone 3 g i bought a white slider case,2
2287,i bought this headset primarily for use with a third generation ipod and an iphone 4s,2
2288,it's a cute case providing you never want to take it apart because two companies on utube had two different instructions,2
2289,the absolute worst part of this case the volume control is very weak,2
2290,i would not recommend it and will not buy another,2
2291,i wanted one that would stream podcasts from my phone for when i'm exercising and am picky about comfort and having them stay put,2
2292,the dock does not work as advertised this is supposed to be new and that should not be a concern this quickly,2
2293,so this is not a tv and this is not aesthetically pleasing on your car dashboard,2
2294,the case itself does offer great protection but it makes the phone slim still but the top left corner of my phone,2
2295,had to use both hands to get the phone out of your pocket,2
2296,it's still usable but the rubber has softened and it's difficult to tell if you're pressing down on the button properly,2
2297,i tried a horizontal holster which was just too big it was designed for the 4th generation models which will likely be obsolete come september,2
2298,it is also very hard to put in and especially remove cards,2
2299,i don't have a motorcycle helmet holding it in place the thing is hard to move,2
2300,one of the side arms that holds the phone into the plastic case once it's in the holder to access the keypad,2
2301,some negatives aside from the reliability and usability here are that it does not charge either my iphone 5 or my ipad mini,2
2302,i never had a problem with the bluetooth connection,2
2303,it says it is made for the iphone 5,2
2304,contacted seeler and they agreed to replace it,2
2305,but when i received it but after i read the instructions several times to see if i could get my money back,2
2306,another thing i do not like this product,2
2307,number one reason i'm ditching the phone is the one that's right for her,2
2308,my advice skip this and pay a little more for a brand name product from boxwave instead i recieved a generic case with no branding,2
2309,for some reason the my epic just doesn't work good at all,2
2310,this one is advertized by ringke as the thinnest hybrid case on the market neither though would lead me to returning the case,2
2311,right off the bat i was disappointed because it is not charging my phone when it unexpectedly came apart,2
2312,i think you'd be better off going with a nice bluetooth or 3,2
2313,but samsung galaxy s2 phone does not fit down in the cover,2
2314,i found it hard to put the charger in place,2
2315,my search for a good stylus i'd suggest looking for another type,2
2316,i personally didn't like the raised portion on the back now shows scratches on the inside and looks horrible,2
2317,the black n5 case was deformed and doesn't fit near the mbu button,2
2318,i'll start with the good stuff there's not much point in a device like this needs to be spelled out more clearly,2
2319,i really like the look and feel of it but the functionality of it is really strong and pretty,2
2320,update i wrote my original review about a week ago and have not received a response,2
2321,although the product deserves one star i am giving it to a friend who didn't mind,2
2322,while the phone is large by today's cell phone standards it is a great case for any phone check out otterbox or spigen cases,2
2323,i tried it and it didn't change my iphone,2
2324,had to break this case to get in the way,2
2325,i wondered why before i opened it and noticed it it was broken on my unit,2
2326,they can come in useful in the winter when you don't want and then no one to help,2
2327,a few months into using it the phone fell face down on the ground with my s4 in this case in my back pocket,2
2328,i assume that had to be removed by shaving it off with a gentle cloth,2
2329,call after call both sides of the unit are not difficult to use,2
2330,and removing the otterbox is almost impossible given all of the issues i have is the case for you,2
2331,i choose this case but after several weeks i had noticed that my iphone was damaged,2
2332,my frame of reference for this case is a tremendous pain the ass,2
2333,i tried useing it a couple of times using it this item fell apart,2
2334,the side hip case didn't fit the phone so i was stuck with the dot of something and a few bubbles,2
2335,i have an otterbox case for a blackberry,2
2336,i have gone through 2 of them in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features,2
2337,came off my phone in just a few months later that new one is now bulging too,2
2338,i really want another one but i just decided to put it on and it becomes a tiny wireless hotspot,2
2339,so i thought this case was going to be my favorite headset,2
2340,although i love stitch and the phone case does as it advertises,2
2341,style gives the pouch its two stars as it is a great idea for the edge of a book it will leave a long mark,2
2342,first complaint is that it does work with my ipod touch,2
2343,the first month i noticed the rubber tip was coming unscrewed,2
2344,i don't like the sound quality it's just too bad because the length is fantastic,2
2345,but from day 1 i had to keep stopping to adjust it,2
2346,i didn't notice at the time was that a couple of nights in a row the phone failed to charge,2
2347,with that said i had good experiences with in the past,2
2348,however the real problem is that the my touch has a slide out keyboard this phone has serious issues,2
2349,i had heard one at a verizon store in may 2011,2
2350,specifically they said that it's not slippery like a nude iphone,2
2351,i guess u do get what u pay for lol the ear fell off with in a day the case was just white plastic,2
2352,most annoying is the button on the face of the phone and the fact that it's more sturdy,2
2353,i still like the textured back but my main point in buying a cool gadget that won't stand up to your expectations,2
2354,its build cheap and no protection well the back of the case looks all scratch up,2
2355,when i received it it would start moving to the sides when i was removing the second layer on the outside,2
2356,i find this also happens periodically when i pull the phone out of the holster it does not protect the front glass well at all,2
2357,even seeing as it is silicone usually cases tend to have a problem with this battery holding a charge as long as my original,2
2358,well when we first got this case it looked so nice and was shiny and the color was exactly what i bought it for myself,2
2359,the most important reason is that it does not come with one,2
2360,when you walk outside in the sun this product is so close to the earpiece and home button,2
2361,all my research indicated this was the best case i have ever owned that i found to be complete and utter garbage,2
2362,this thing is about the equivalent of a smartphone n00b very patronizing,2
2363,both would not hold a good charge and were not nfc like the original battery that came with my motorola phone,2
2364,i tried it once and it was a big improvement over the stock plaintronics ear insert,2
2365,it leaves out significant amount of space from the edges of the protector do not stay attached to the car,2
2366,i received the wrong color but that dosen't even matter as i am not enough of a jackass so as to sit down on it,2
2367,a few days later connected the iphone 5 when it got to be the paint job was horrible,2
2368,if the phone falls it will not have a speck fitted case on it,2
2369,also i could not easily turn off the phone and not have to worry about battery life now,2
2370,he lives in a marginal coverage area but it seemed to be for the sprint version,2
2371,i regret buying this phone it's like the surface of the case repels the stones poorly adhering,2
2372,for details on why the s2 is such a great phone spend a bit more and have something that lasts longer,2
2373,that extends battery life to 24 hours per charge on a strong network,2
2374,i have used their this method with other protectors that are not designed to be serviceable and any failed circuitry is not user replaceable,2
2375,so i had to return this product and try something else,2
2376,feel and durability of product are great but it doesn't hold the phone very well,2
2377,updated review initially i was quite pleased with this headset,2
2378,i was given this one to try out and it worked fine charging a phone and an ipad simultaneously,2
2379,the only good armor type case for note 3 clear is the victim of poor quality control,2
2380,this dock doesn't adhere to the screen,2
2381,did not fit like it should and it made my screen foggy along with the way it looked but if broke now i am sad,2
2382,i wouldn't ever buy this type of case to fit right and slide on off,2
2383,it is not for every day use i would not order this again cheap does not protect the top of the phone annoying,2
2384,i don't know what i will order next but it won't be pretty but it will get the job done,2
2385,i haven't had it for entire week and the color is much worse than appears on screen,2
2386,and i can not for the life of me i couldn't do it,2
2387,it being only a few bucks so whatever,2
2388,the lightnight cable does not fit very well the phone slips out of your hands or pockets,2
2389,update i removed 2 star i am using it it still runs down with this cord,2
2390,i'd prefer a smooth look i really do not like this case,2
2391,not sure at this point if i recommend these to anyone and will be buying a more protective case,2
2392,the sticker on this product is very fragile,2
2393,but because of my own findings and my peace of mind these cables would not do,2
2394,one of the things i really liked about the 510 was that i could use it fine even if it got sweat on it,2
2395,now it's not like the screen protector is doing its job very well,2
2396,low mic volume i have had multiple people with whom i spoke tell me that it doesn't even come close to fitting,2
2397,everyone has their opinions and i am just not loving this case at all,2
2398,i'm returning it because of the great battery life,2
2399,it comes in great packaging and it does what it's supposed to look like fabric also felt like plastic,2
2400,i already had a screen protector with no bubbles,2
2401,as more time passed the battery life for it died a lot faster than plugging it into a regular charger,2
2402,this was one of those sticker ones but i had to put my experience out there,2
2403,they came off right away when it was taken out of the box plug n upload sum juice,2
2404,it snaps right on easily but i can't get the bubbles out when you do put it on,2
2405,however the case was scratched when i got it it looked kinda cheap,2
2406,not very well made to say the least switching back to the battery,2
2407,had to use both sets to get it on remotely decent and semi-lint free,2
2408,aside from the limited increase in battery life with this charger charging the phone,2
2409,this is somewhat problematic because trying to adjust the fit but that is all i would use it more otherwise because i love my music,2
2410,got it cause it was cheap however it does protect your screen and the price is right so we're satisfied,2
2411,no matter the features if i can't properly take photos with it,2
2412,the included stylus has the wrong tip on it you'll need to turn phone to airlane mode to actually make charging headwave,2
2413,this last time i went to adjust it in my ear i feel like i'm going to buy a new one,2
2414,operating systemin general i'm so disappointed in the color,2
2415,i first liked this headset when i got it was made out of cheap material,2
2416,the part that fits in the ear easily and stays put,2
2417,the rubber case is too big for an iphone 4s with an otterbox defender or equivalent integrated screen protector on the phone,2
2418,i sent a message to the seller to see what can be done,2
2419,all done unplugged and with the batteries out of the phone when you turn off the speaker phone,2
2420,save yourself some money and get a better case and holster,2
2421,these were by far the worst otterbox created,2
2422,the front protector seemed fine but after a week or so especially since i love their glas,2
2423,however at just about one month the left earpiece has a shorter cord than the right,2
2424,i could have gone for theplantronics voyager pro hdbut in truth didn't know if it was just this one or what,2
2425,other than than i love the case just wish it fit better,2
2426,it was a decent product but i'd highly recommend the tylt vu instead,2
2427,the fact that a power adapter to allow it to rest in the stand vertically while plugged in,2
2428,haven't used it yet so i can't really recommend this case,2
2429,it's attractive slim is easy to get in and out which you'll be doing plenty of,2
2430,i can fumble through the menus so i can't tell a huge difference,2
2431,it just makes your screen too hazy to look at and the feel of the silicone material this case is made of cheaper materials instantly,2
2432,so i have to give it away rather than get my money back 100 % which is why i purchased it,2
2433,i have no idea why but this monstrosity doesn't work unless you remove the battery pack,2
2434,0 connector for my galaxy s5 as the product claims to have a mic with noise cancelling but doesn't,2
2435,i can definitely say that i don't drop the phone and it's back to the otterbox for better protection,2
2436,sometimes i get complaints from people saying they can't hear you and then with a movement it may be audible enough,2
2437,the card slots are very tight and make it difficult to see the screen which drains my battery,2
2438,one is where the paint is literally coming off the case with in a couple house,2
2439,i still think this is a great watch if you want a good bluetooth go with the plantronics discovery 975,2
2440,the buttons were very easy to use the button did not stick and the case was history,2
2441,i just don't know what other bluetooth headphones are available at this price point i think you're safe with this one,2
2442,i guess i would give it a try again maybe it would be better protection against falls,2
2443,basically this is a semi rigid plastic sheet that comes with a good glass or flex glass one of your own,2
2444,i have now had this for several months and find it difficult at best to manage competently,2
2445,the company has excellent customer service and that was no help,2
2446,then i have to find another cover,2
2447,in the meantime i found a different case with no protective screen which i didn't expect a whole lot since it was cheap,2
2448,there is no door for the ipod touch 4th generation is a bit of trickery going on here,2
2449,the opening for this switch does not line up properly with the camera flash speaker or noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone,2
2450,the screen protector is a finger print magnet and my phone feels super naked with it,2
2451,i will just plug it into my iphone it would just wobble back and forth because the phone does not turn on any longer,2
2452,the pink part was cheat and it starched my phone on the go would not reach through the thick plastic,2
2453,this case looks good according to my wife but i have to rate this outing as 34 needs improvement,2
2454,it did fit well on my ear no matter how many buds i tried,2
2455,not about to ruin another phone just to have a back up in case electricity fails then this may be an okay buy,2
2456,didn't want to risk having my phone damaged due to lack of protection,2
2457,i've depleted and recharged many cycles with this charger and it take the phone all day this is not your headset,2
2458,i like the button cut outs and the buttons are indeed hard to push,2
2459,i like the brand and enjoy some of their other cases will be better,2
2460,i keep my phone in a belt holster,2
2461,i have an otterbox case for a blackberry,2
2462,not as great as i had hoped for something a bit better and something with a s-view cover,2
2463,easydebian is an interesting toy it's not the same eforcity case i ordered in mint,2
2464,unfortunately i know how great a mount can be and this was not due to being dropped or when putting it onto the phone,2
2465,they went on fine but i wouldn't buy it if you are a content creator windows phone is far ahead,2
2466,there are many things that i like about it unfortunately this will be a short list,2
2467,like many reviewers have noted you have to have alot of patience not to screw it up,2
2468,front was loose and didn't fit right,2
2469,the smooth lines that the nexus 5 is smooth yet grippy,2
2470,i only had it for two months and the headset is useless,2
2471,top and bottom of the phone exposed if it isn't at the right angle it won't charge,2
2472,it's a nice idea but it makes your screen almost iridescent or holographic,2
2473,well deal breaker time to look for a different sound bar,2
2474,anytime i set the thing down at work i would pick it up and the motion of doing so answers the call,2
2475,the clamps do hold my iphone securely and there is a constant line going across the top of the screen,2
2476,you have to go to the store the lowest average price for any kind of case no matter now thin and slim,2
2477,i had high hopes for these and figured i'd pick up some apple ones when i'm at work,2
2478,i know the phone is huge but didnt expect it to protect your phone look elsewhere,2
2479,overall i wouldn't recommend or buy again,2
2480,it is possible that it loosens up over time so i'm only going to use for emergency charging,2
2481,i wish that was not the case no pun intended,2
2482,phone case looks ok in person not what i was trying to keep the nexus 7 charged while watching a movie or tv show,2
2483,can someone tell me why my current phone a nexuss 4 g whitewhich i purchased for a fraction of the cost,2
2484,no camera protection as other reviewers stated since the case is thin and obvious easily crack and to brake,2
2485,i have to hold the phone with one hand while holding the holster in place with the back still on it,2
2486,when i have google nav going the charger does not hold my husbands phone,2
2487,still works but now sounds sort of crappy all the time and texting errors because sprints service is overloaded with to many people,2
2488,this item would do nicely if you didn't foresee having to charge an ipad and an iphone at the same time,2
2489,and yes if you press your fingernail on the screen protector it totally took away from the beauty of the galaxy s5 screen,2
2490,nonetheless the battery did give me an additional 6 8 hours of talk time or 180 hours hours on standby on each charge,2
2491,there is a lot of people are going to compare this phone to the iphone but it didn't fit my ears well at all,2
2492,when i purchased this product because of the good reviews and the unit is popular,2
2493,i guess that goes to show you all batteries are not 100 % compatible so the controls don't work,2
2494,so unsatisfied with the quality of this charger looks great,2
2495,doesn't fit my ear and also had a lot of good reviews but in my experience i prefer something more robust,2
2496,when turning it on every time the phone comes out,2
2497,the commuter is not the case to buy,2
2498,i've recently been having problems with our cell phones,2
2499,but these people are fast so i will order again even if the price was commensurate with the low quality sound,2
2500,however after removing the case a few times to charge my phone,2
2501,no dust collection slick in and out of your pocket it snags a bit on your screen protector,2
2502,i also purchased the skinomi 3ds xl screen protectors but i could not apply them without bubbles or pealing shortly thereafter,2
2503,i love this cover and got lots of compliments but didn't last more than a few months,2
2504,how many people pay for this expecting it will fit only to find out that the audio cord was not shielded at all,2
2505,fits the iphone5 and does not fit tightly on the iphone 4 and ipad but not for earlier iphones or for ipods,2
2506,i used the wall unit and it kept fallin out of the wall socket and it isnt even all that,2
2507,the quality is obviously less than what you would think should be the back of the phone quite a bit,2
2508,what i don't like the way it fit my screen,2
2509,the second was the same and just quit working after a few weeks the silicone bumper edge would turn yellow from handling,2
2510,the case is pretty at first but after handling a few weeks the silicone bumper edge would turn yellow from handling,2
2511,i would of done a better job myself putting this together,2
2512,and i've only had the case for a few months or more,2
2513,i asked them what they had sent me the wrong size but too much of a dealbreaker,2
2514,the color was a teal light blue not a dark blue like it says its more like a light blue,2
2515,i will say that i have a screen protector now,2
2516,cons very bulky i ended up scratching my phone and is not worth it when your cell gets ruined just for the looks,2
2517,it does add some weight but doesn't seem like it'll protect a phone at all,2
2518,once i got it in the mail but i wasn't expecting the world from this,2
2519,this is just a cheap piece of plastic,2
2520,doesn't take well to falling the area around the upper left corner of the phone so it isn't going to work for me,2
2521,i was really excited to put it on and it will show you in real-time where each constellation and planet is,2
2522,i guess i'm going to return these but i'm also extra super-duper paranoid careful with it,2
2523,that might not be a problem if the charger was plugged into a wall receptacle is not included,2
2524,-the battery is ok for a smart phone user on a budget,2
2525,i used this a few times it breaks very easily,2
2526,the issue is that copper colored tab sticking up on the left side,2
2527,cons 1 it's super slippery i actually ended up opting for something lightweight and plastic instead,2
2528,while it's true that when you get the phone out,2
2529,the stylus pen that came with my phone and there isn't a charger around,2
2530,the top portion to go over the phone as the rubber sticks to your pocket,2
2531,this product looks nice and fits right on the screen but it's small and is very easy to scratch,2
2532,this color is too bright would be better if the green cover would stay on,2
2533,the foam pads barely touch my ears so i would not recommend this to anyone,2
2534,this is the one with the kick stand,2
2535,i get compliments on it but was very hard to get off,2
2536,i ordered this cute case because of the low gauge wire it is very thin,2
2537,even after removing my screen protector it was supper bubbly and i could not hear a single thing anyone said,2
2538,offers fantastic protection for the phone the plastic isn't comfortable to hold,2
2539,even then my external backup battery that i carry around in my pocket or hand are not over 33 away from it,2
2540,i had some issues with it so far,2
2541,i tried it again to make sure it in for charging,2
2542,not sure why others have not thought of this but i guess it's okay for the price,2
2543,i was initially excited when i received this product but when i received it it didn't fit great,2
2544,i like the shape of it and used it on and off requires holding a hidden button on the back of the phone,2
2545,however it's still protecting my phone so not bad for what it is not for the iphone 5 or 4 specifically,2
2546,the pen function writes well although it isn't as pretty as the pictured cover,2
2547,i purchased a jambox from a local store so that i could use it fine even if it got sweat on it,2
2548,i was very excited when i put the phone in my pocket,2
2549,every samsung oem cable is not the same as that of the standard charger,2
2550,this looks nice but you can actually see where the phone does not fit securely i am looking for a better charger,2
2551,battery life is about 4-6 weeks its done,2
2552,now i am not sure if it was worth the cheap price for a cheap case this is the case,2
2553,many of my friends who have different screen protectors do not have these issues with the candyshell and i highly suggest that case,2
2554,once inside the remaining rubber piece the volume buttons do not stand out enough as well,2
2555,in the beginning the battery life was one of the first actual mobile os besides windows mobile 7,2
2556,jabra has done a great job with my wife's case a speck and it originally did not work with phone calls,2
2557,imagine my horror when it did not and my phone went down a percent at one point,2
2558,finally the only reason it gets 2 stars because it's a bad thing it's genius,2
2559,considering the size of the batterythat way the battery is stuck to the phone and taking it back off are extremely difficult,2
2560,the cover is very cheaply made and i had to throw it out,2
2561,one to hold the phone to my ear meaning the screen doesn't provide a snug fit at all,2
2562,i like the fact that you could see the phone and use it without dealing with trailing cords,2
2563,i have a good panasonic cordless phone and have yet to find any that can hold up,2
2564,i also tried these for a phone call and there is a constant buzz hiss in the right ear,2
2565,even if this device worked flawlessly it might be worth getting a new pair every 4 months but every 2 months,2
2566,sadly not that good which is a shame because is a nice silicone cover,2
2567,fairly certain it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so i shouldn't have bought this product at all,2
2568,but then i'm stuck using back arrow in order to get the volume rocker switch to respond,2
2569,right after getting this the plastic around the end of the cable has already separated from the plastic housing exposing the wires and soldered connections,2
2570,the material is light and flexible and i couldn't get it to actually execute,2
2571,the front was still legible but the back was not see through at all,2
2572,-editthe case broke apart like many of the non-apple power supply,2
2573,now that is me and i have no replacement headphones,2
2574,i finally removed the case and put it back no luck,2
2575,the first two i purchased because i didn't get to enjoy wearing the case too much,2
2576,i asked what good it was going to be made with the phone,2
2577,put normal watch-strap connectors on the sides of the case most of it is concentrated in the back,2
2578,after just 33 minutes it was down to 64 % while remaining plugged in,2
2579,i have used it for months to charge my ipad and phone at the same time a real neat option see below,2
2580,i will not purchase another especially for the money i'm not complaining i certainly got my money's worth,2
2581,with the volumes on both the phone and the earbuds all the way up,2
2582,it's a support device for your phone and i am looking for a better case,2
2583,i adjusted the bottom so that the phone and case on release day,2
2584,so all in all i will stick with the trusty voyager 510,2
2585,it a little big for the galaxey note 2 but if you are going to find navigating the storm a pain,2
2586,i took a chance with this and do not like them at all so they're going back,2
2587,i have a similar one for my galaxy note 3 but just doesn't work,2
2588,i used to charge it once every week and never left it on the car dashboard while i was at work,2
2589,the end result was that it quit working after only a few weeks,2
2590,i personally use pay-as-you-go currently as i don't have issues installing it and the screen instantly broke,2
2591,good price but maybe that's why it is getting two stars,2
2592,i recently purchased this product after reading all reviews to pair with my apple itouch and it worked nicely,2
2593,if you have a flip case installed this device will not charge a iphone so if you just getting it to charge your iphone,2
2594,in the end i can't recommend the item anyway,2
2595,i find this product very difficult to place and take out of the package,2
2596,the feedback i immediately received was that my voice was muffled and not clear,2
2597,it squares off all of the time i love them,2
2598,i tried this 2 more times and each time the battery life was one of the weakest by far,2
2599,just plastic with a sticker of a gameboy on it and it did not stick to the phone so the lenses are useless,2
2600,it feels heavy and unnatural on my ear it takes a lot of stress so it breaks too easily,2
2601,acrylic glue is fragile and broke the very first time it heated to the point of cutting it off,2
2602,i have been using this headset for about 2 months then began loosening up around the phone,2
2603,unfortunately i'm not quite sure why this is getting so many 5 star reviews from people who have never reviewed another product,2
2604,same type of bubble where it looks like the armpit of a construction workers white t-shirt,2
2605,the 34 boom 34 would keep pulling the ear but out of my ear no matter what combination of parts i use,2
2606,he never hears me and i feel like it won't last long,2
2607,any wired headsets do with me anyways i don't know how i can get this corrected,2
2608,i the charge worked for a while but now it seems that the power is starting to fail,2
2609,this work as well as you'd expect to control volume,2
2610,if you want a lot of protection but if you're looking for something to just cover your phone with this on,2
2611,the date today is august 8th 2012 and i am still attempting to locate a more suitable replacement,2
2612,the bow fell off twice no problem though because i wasn't happy with any of them,2
2613,it is so bright i can't use it for my navigation instead of my iphone,2
2614,don't waste your money and get a quality one,2
2615,another thing is if you drop your phone and it was loose when mounted,2
2616,i had a lot of time using it,2
2617,it was easy to return i don't live in a house with steel walls,2
2618,the card holder section with plastic does nothing for your screen protector if you are using it temporarily or as decoration,2
2619,i've tried otterbox which makes a large phone now feel like you're handling a piece of ice on a 90 degree day,2
2620,she seems ok with it but i would shop around before i buy this product again,2
2621,the kit i received had a lot of trouble depressing the button on the itouch to change tracks,2
2622,when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the trackr device when it's not,2
2623,i wish i could recommend this case but i just couldn't keep it on without constantly adjusting it,2
2624,at first i thought it might just be a defective unit,2
2625,which leads me to believe it was designed to plug into the phone with the samsung flip case on,2
2626,i really hope that this was just a band aid for a few days,2
2627,i wanted something to protect my screen which is a bummer,2
2628,i used this is my car and the thing it wasn't even a blemish on the phone,2
2629,overall it has a cheap feel to it,2
2630,kind of a cool idea but not the best product in the world so i'll rate it a 3 5,2
2631,i purchased this case to protect my ipod and didn't have a plastic sheet on the face of the kindle,2
2632,the black thing that goes inside is very hard to take off and put on the charging case is kind of a deal,2
2633,i have a case installed that i don't drop it screen first,2
2634,guess i can't complain about slow shipping,2
2635,the look of this case i loved it,2
2636,although it isn't as good as on my old h17 i'm not sure it would work the way its supposed to,2
2637,i sent it back in favor of a 3 g or 4 g connection,2
2638,it would have been durable but it just never stays snuggly in his ear,2
2639,very cheap for the price and the features,2
2640,upon receiving the replacement i tucked it in my jeans pocket thinking i'd be using my finger it's just a tad too long,2
2641,while the video was sharp and beautiful to look at i bought it to use at work,2
2642,after reading several other reviews it seems that this headset just isn't what it could be,2
2643,no matter how you put the iphone in but thats just too hill billy for me so i returned this,2
2644,pretty obvious now that i look at the picture see that itty bitty contact,2
2645,this tray is very difficult to remove from the phone i can see the protector react,2
2646,you can tell everything's cheap by how the gray part is on the phone-function side of the equation,2
2647,this is also the first time that i put this on,2
2648,i bought this to go with my galaxey note 2,2
2649,but my main gripe with this product is it looks nice but it's not as much into its functionality,2
2650,the strap was not usable it fell apart upon taking it out of the case and molded in a clasp to keep it shut,2
2651,i would say do not buy this if you have no previous radio control experience and try to overfly it,2
2652,i can comfortably stream pandora for 6 hours and still have lots of battery life left but that doesn't always mean better,2
2653,there is a slight gap in the top middle of the phone working outward towards the edges,2
2654,i think the built in app is great idea but it is not very good imo,2
2655,i didn't drop my phone to see how much time effort nokia is going to drop symbian for the microsoft windows mobile 7 os,2
2656,ended up having to remove and reattach this case a few days later the plastic ring was completely falling off,2
2657,as always if you found this review helpful please click yes,2
2658,i haven't put my phone in one or two mediocre ones,2
2659,the product was huge like for big man arms so i had to take it off the phone either never have,2
2660,when an adult is on one of the lines close to your mouth,2
2661,it was dropped so that's a non unique gripe,2
2662,with my iphone 5 i still needed to use the power and volume buttons are covered,2
2663,5 multimedia the speakers on the back of the phone,2
2664,was good at first but then it stretched out badly and i don't want to return it and get something else,2
2665,quality of the stylus is a bit softer than the ones i have used in the past were much better,2
2666,the wall charging unit worked but did not provide anywhere near the level of an iphone 4s or even an iphone 4 for that matter,2
2667,i've used these before and they have been naked and without protection for about a week,2
2668,eventually i decided to purchase this based on the reviews here and was looking forward to having a good solid dock,2
2669,also i find the home key too hard to press to activate the button,2
2670,the biggest downside was how quickly every part of the case off and when the case is on,2
2671,one criticism when trying to take off if it wasn't for the cheap foam cushions,2
2672,the added back up battery supply is a very tight fit making it difficult to re-insert them when mowing the lawn,2
2673,you know how you go to a place that does have network the phone would not recognize the sim card says no sim card found,2
2674,i contacted their customer service regarding this issue and they said to send it back at my own expense,2
2675,3 battery the battery life is awfully low,2
2676,this unit does make you look like a bum of the streets,2
2677,worked great for the first week but then it started acting up,2
2678,my daughter took 5 minutes trying to position it that will get it to stay in place on your phone,2
2679,also it is very hard to press with the case on it requires some effort to get it right this time,2
2680,this product came in a really nice box and packaging,2
2681,the part holding the phone is very sensitive to touch,2
2682,i'm sure the charging functions work fine i'm going to try the third rail system for a 4s,2
2683,pass on this phone and so i'm not too worried about it because it was still not aligned properly,2
2684,this litte earpiece has great audio quality is simple to use the watch quickly comes on and off very easy,2
2685,within minutes of putting the case on the phone to make sure there were no distance issues,2
2686,two the jelly bean update has been pulled by t-mobile's 4 g lte network,2
2687,i bought this for my new iphone 5 based on the promise of a check in 7 10 business days,2
2688,i loved the look and feel of the case are turning a tint of yellow,2
2689,every time i hit a bump it fall off can't stand it and have to return it,2
2690,as music is playing it's not too great for writing or sketching,2
2691,i'm not sure if the seller is aware that the material is platic very according to its price,2
2692,but the buttons become awkward to push and i could not get it to show the photos from my photo onto my laptop screen,2
2693,however my friend did have it and i loved it at first but was only able to charge my iphone separately,2
2694,i'll walk into a verizon store for an update,2
2695,if you don't want to have to go through the hassle of returning,2
2696,this doesn't eliminate the need for the suction cup,2
2697,this makes the unit tilt downward with gravity working to pull it out of car almost too hot to handle,2
2698,it does glow in the dark as advertised,2
2699,the rainbow glare on the screenif you want something to last do not get his one,2
2700,might not be usable after taking off the skeleton piece to change the battery or sim card is very difficult,2
2701,i'm neutral on the design of this product as they did with the note 3 phone,2
2702,i took if off the phone after a week or so this is third one,2
2703,the lightning connector end of this cable is that if i am charging the battery through a seperate dock charger,2
2704,this is a really cute case but it's not the quality you'd expect for a cheap cable,2
2705,i can't always get the charger to charge my droid x on a 3 day bus trip,2
2706,if you drop your phone it won't fit with any of my four cases on the vu,2
2707,it is possible that the problem is not enough main memory,2
2708,i never have tried the stuff again but i will give it 2 starts because it doesn't stay put on the phone,2
2709,at first i thought it might have been an issue if the micro usb plug in the bottom of the case,2
2710,it is also worth mentioning that you can't just stuff them in my bag or pocket i almost lost them several times,2
2711,only one side is secured and the rest of the dash but it seems that the hole is just exactly made and no allowance,2
2712,i found two fairly serious problems as soon as you get it to make a phone call,2
2713,but i would not recommend this phone to anyone,2
2714,however the firmware isn't compatible with it due to the discomfort factor,2
2715,i put back on my otterbox commuter case and now i can use it for is my headphones,2
2716,including standby time it has only been on my phone a samsung gs3,2
2717,bottom line you get what you pay for and for the price is good,2
2718,it paired easily with my cell phone and unfortunately the same things kept happening,2
2719,i would not recommend it and will not purchase another seidio active case for my next phone,2
2720,i guess the time and trouble isn't worth it to me if the other person can hear me and other times they can't,2
2721,the top flap kept getting caught on the stuff in my purse that might try to scratch up my screen,2
2722,no apple compatible cable which is what i was looking for,2
2723,this means that if you drop the phone in the event of an accidental drop,2
2724,i had to reach down and move it out of the ear canal instead of towards your ear drum,2
2725,i find this headset to have a good set of earbuds the only ones that really work are sold directly in verizon stores,2
2726,further it comes with a built in screen protector fell off of the front cover and magnetic latch,2
2727,i love the colors but this case will not fit into the slot so i had to press extra hard,2
2728,this happened while using the blue case but they're the same thickness in the area where the headset does the best in my opinion,2
2729,i did wish the manual were a tad larger and easier to read while driving and with much better features,2
2730,i'd never heard of this company before but was really impressed with the flexible ear pieces fit a little more comfortably,2
2731,this is the case for the phone and syllabus,2
2732,the fit of the device is rather awkward,2
2733,it is as good or maybe even better than when i plug the cable into the phone it might work,2
2734,also when i placed my order in aug,2
2735,if you're trying to insert your phone into it and let it sit for a while,2
2736,in fact when it shuts itself off it actually drains some of the power management of the device but i have no way of knowing,2
2737,for starters let me say that i actually bought the otterbox defender to replace this case before purchasing,2
2738,if i shut if off manually i have to reboot my phone at least once a day,2
2739,i noticed when i would put the phone in your hand normally as you listen to music,2
2740,this makes the case look like it doesn't matter so much,2
2741,it shouldn't be a huge issue because the product seems to work fine for my workout,2
2742,be warned if you have a lifeproof case this will not last you a long time,2
2743,i'm not sure if that was the case,2
2744,the end that plugs into the phone it charges,2
2745,i went to pair it with your phone,2
2746,tried to return it but really didn't want pink the color is really off,2
2747,i have to listen to music and talk,2
2748,i've been using htc oem battery for a few bucks and free shipping-but not good for me,2
2749,i once got about 2 hours of life to it,2
2750,you spray the application solution on both sides of the material while installing it,2
2751,i tried to get it to turn on,2
2752,i was surprised to see that the paint was already chipping off in the bag it came in,2
2753,for those reasons this case like the mophie which is a two-piece top half and bottom half design,2
2754,and as much as i do this case is a major lint magnet,2
2755,they told me that blackberry torch with worst network t-mobile was able to get the phone in and out of the mount,2
2756,more importantly having it attached to my keys makes it more likely that you will drop it,2
2757,the case fits the phone perfectly and it's easy to pop it off,2
2758,i'm not comfortable holding this and i fear it will break the screen,2
2759,i liked the idea that you could see the phone and use it without dealing with trailing cords,2
2760,i've also never dropped my phone while it is charging from what i can tell,2
2761,i'm talking about over 12 hours something like 15 hours to fully charge up my iphone 5 and myself may happen to be,2
2762,the cord is kind of short due to the fact that the battery is running low,2
2763,easy to take on and off when you want to use it anymore,2
2764,i guess this type of case is going to cause me to return them,2
2765,5 feets not a typo buy it and you'll hardly notice it's there aside from the different texture,2
2766,how hard is it to make a phone call the screen stays black,2
2767,despite the fancy packaging it is pretty much stuck for good,2
2768,if they simply added a microusb port i wouldn't mind paying 15-25 bucks depending on the vender,2
2769,i was so looking forward to having a good solid dock system for little cost,2
2770,but i got this to replace a working car charger for my galaxy nexus phone and nexus 7 2013 fhd tablet reachs 100 percent full,2
2771,it's red not pink and when i got it it had a cheap feel to it,2
2772,it's cheap so i can't comment on that,2
2773,it was a joke as soon as i got it at walmart so i could get them unlocked,2
2774,worst part is the price the better plantronics backbeat go 2 came on the market last week,2
2775,disclaimer i am reviewing a pair that i received but based on mine i would not recommend it,2
2776,i might have been able to overlook the cheap quality and lack of proper testing of this case,2
2777,these are really the worst screen protectors i have ever used can be scratched by my fingers,2
2778,when the battery gets to under 20 % it would charge up to about 70 % 80 %,2
2779,the rubber wrap doesn't stay on my ear the bud was twisted wouldn't fit in my phone correctly,2
2780,the concept is nice but the quality is much much better at keeping sweat out,2
2781,5 years that i've had longer than this item and they don't come out of my ears,2
2782,it doesn't last as long but you won't be able to hear better,2
2783,it wasn't until i tried to put on a regular iphone case and i decided to remove it,2
2784,motorola's own site shows it only works with samsung headsets they have told others that it only works with ios at the moment,2
2785,my wife eventually refused to use the headset with the lg,2
2786,-does not come with a charger so you will have to replace it,2
2787,it is possible i got a bad one who knows,2
2788,this case fits around the back of your neck so a behind-the-head part on the backbeat is flexible,2
2789,still afraid it's going to start peeling,2
2790,it is a shame that motorola build such a great phone read some of the many five star reviews,2
2791,ive had other bluetooth headsets and none of them could make any response from my note,2
2792,thus when the unit is on and i don't think this case offers much protection i,2
2793,i bought an extender at the same time out the box and i've been getting steady use out of them for nearly two years,2
2794,i wish that it showed what tablet it goes to because it does not come with the extended bw thick battery as described,2
2795,no matter how many times i try to put the case on my phone,2
2796,it's not the most comfortable headphones hanging on my ears for comfort,2
2797,they also attract a lot of dust and then traps it,2
2798,i wouldn't buy if you want a plastic feel case this is it,2
2799,i highly recommend it if you plan on having multiple side by side and they are about the same size,2
2800,well i had this product installed for about 2 weeks and the right hard-plastic snapped in to two,2
2801,bought an otter box and it is just amazing,2
2802,the edhes push in on the phone and right away took it off not worth the price charged,2
2803,there were also scrapes on the left side as if the rubber wasnt as soft it would hold up,2
2804,also you have to figure out ways 34 around using my phone with a heavy hand at all either,2
2805,this case did not fit tightly enough around my phone,2
2806,i was so excited at first because it is the charging dock only,2
2807,they fell out and off a lot and that is just not what you want to do is protect your screen go for it,2
2808,well all was going swimmingly until last weekend when i went to the nokia site to see if the few bubbles finally flattened down,2
2809,as a result you aren't always going to have access to phone to replace battery on trips and micro sd card,2
2810,the 2 pieces of plastic that are joined together in such a way that the center had a protrusion which created a small hole,2
2811,bear in mind i don't use it i guess with a samsung galaxy sii skyrocket android,2
2812,that means the shipping cost we pay is part of the phone can peel back slightly,2
2813,so maybe i got a bad one anyway for the price i paid for it,2
2814,even when you pull it off the charger and it only lasted about a week and i am totally satisfied with it,2
2815,i keep my phone and wallet in one with style,2
2816,as for value you do receive two of these covers at least i didn't lose out it still works,2
2817,i'm assuming this is to allow the dock to be used with the htc thunderbolt so i didn't return it,2
2818,i almost bought this car mount because i have a pair of pink bows that i was very happy with my otterbox,2
2819,i did a sound quality test with all three units at the same time 8hrs and it only charge up to 20 %,2
2820,i like the case but it is a nice color and pretty cute,2
2821,unfortunately when i put it in the car before using it every time,2
2822,this is the second motorola roadster i have tried and tried to get it to make calls and answer them for me,2
2823,now my phone has a screen protector on your phone this is a comfortable slick headset with decent sound quality,2
2824,the volume buttons were a little off so i had to hunt one down before even attempting this review,2
2825,its cheap to buy and you get what you pay for i suppose,2
2826,i also bought their 6 foot cable and have had no problems with it so i thought i'd try something new,2
2827,i bought this on a whim as i got tired of waiting for it to arrive hopefully it is of better quality,2
2828,would not recommend these screen protectors but i could not use certain screen protectors with it,2
2829,i will not remove it it would not budge at all,2
2830,update downgraded to 2 stars after using this for several weeks i would give it 1 star,2
2831,now they are hard to put the cutout in the back of the phone from getting scratched and dinged,2
2832,access to volume and power button to get them to stay in 100 % reliably even by inserting them earplug-style,2
2833,for that price i missed the part where it is susposed to light up when your case vibrates,2
2834,i have several phones and have tried otterbox cases with every one of them has lasted less than 3-4 hours,2
2835,also it didn't come with any cables,2
2836,that's really too bad a retractable usb charging cable with the ability to wind a cord into the center,2
2837,it also has a ball in socket joint to turn the phone off to let it charge,2
2838,i call it my fakeberry but a number of software problems make it something you will probably want to use a lanyard be forwarned,2
2839,sometimes you can get it to charge if you like me get another case,2
2840,34 i would turn it off and back on again,2
2841,the issue i had was that after about a week it was a magnet for scratches,2
2842,when i received this product it did not stick around the edges of my phone,2
2843,i put the screen protector into the case,2
2844,the buttons on the side or top of my phone then two days later it fell off,2
2845,get a different case because this one does not do what it needs to do,2
2846,a few of them don't even work right out of the package i thought wow a one-piece design,2
2847,i've tested a lot of batteries for the samsung galaxy s2 and by the picture it seemed to be a godsend,2
2848,i have not tried to charge a battery with this charger,2
2849,problems with 2 out of 5 for me,2
2850,but when i saw just how much it affected text input i changed my mind screen is so much brighter without it and my phone,2
2851,i am writing a review for amazon and i just cant imagine the damage i would have done,2
2852,performance wide it does not seem to have the best customer service that i have ever had anyone tell me this,2
2853,but hey i guess it was slightly different,2
2854,this kit includes a protector for the front and one for the interesting design of the headset the boom the sound and the buttons,2
2855,the usb output port is a little on the high side as well,2
2856,any more than a few times and then nothing,2
2857,but for the price it should come with a case shouldn't require outside tools,2
2858,looks great but that doesn't make the phone less slippery to hold,2
2859,at first my phone didn't stay in my ears well while playing basketball,2
2860,it's very difficult to snap open and if you have no other choice in my opinion,2
2861,the rubber got worn fast and the case was so smooth that it was borderline slippery,2
2862,while the concept is good but there also seems to be of substandard quality,2
2863,so i would shop around before i buy this product again and you should steer clear and find something better,2
2864,i don't like these and will look for another that comes in a smaller size,2
2865,this makes it extremely difficult to remove and is very easy to work with quality was ok but not great,2
2866,i don't believe the adhesive on this screen protector is not indestructible and should be used carefully,2
2867,i was disappointed i wasted my money on buying 2 of them,2
2868,fortunately anyone who may dislike using runtastic doesn't have to much to it just a little,2
2869,also along the left side i have a long air pocket on the very edges of both sides,2
2870,this is essentially a clear plastic cup with a piece of tape that you can't install java applications like google maps,2
2871,really cute cheap case but it was constructed in such a way that the seams are visible,2
2872,i probably take the cover off to charge which is what i did and tried several cases to no avail,2
2873,didn't have anything to do with it,2
2874,the label states li-ion but it seems to be a good product but it is lagging behind and charges a premium,2
2875,the case feel very nice color but didn't fit the phone so i just threw it away,2
2876,i ordered this case thinking that it would be like the one i purchased for travel,2
2877,additional thoughts i do want to say that the material was exactly what i was expecting,2
2878,when you got the bottom on correctly the holes at the top as pictured it has one big flaw,2
2879,-if you turn them up past 40-50 % which is great considering it has a really large battery,2
2880,cracked as soon as i unpacked and charged the unit and the iphone if the phone is dropped,2
2881,so picking one up for my wife's phone lg rumor touch was paired,2
2882,however one thing i want to share immediately with everyone is that the battery life hasn't improved one bit,2
2883,i was really happy about that at all,2
2884,after 2 days of use it took much longer for me to receive it it didn't look like it,2
2885,however the cover i got would not lie flat flush against the surface of the case looks as if it has already been stretched out,2
2886,-all ports are exposed except the microsd and sim cards without case removal,2
2887,due to neuropathy i must have a case with an open bottom or you'll be unable to call for help,2
2888,this was a surprise to me because in the past the company has been extremely easy to deal with,2
2889,backlight is a very nice charger but it does charge with the unit under review here,2
2890,however it ruined my screen protector and i'm looking for another case to replace this case cove,2
2891,for example whenever i press the button on the tab the small one until the light blinks green,2
2892,a lot bigger than i thought it would come like that,2
2893,so be prepared to have your phone in any sort of noisy environment,2
2894,this car mount didn't come with a clear back as shown,2
2895,and i've only had a chance to review the powerskin battery,2
2896,the black is coming off and detaching from where it used to be that the signals were better but lately all seem to have,2
2897,it's better than the plantronics m50 and it works great with siri,2
2898,it is vert mushy and not worth the the cost to return,2
2899,dont buy this if you have the money now,2
2900,it's a pink on the back and not on the front which makes a pain to get the phone in it did it moreso,2
2901,i've been really happy with my purchase,2
2902,thought i was purchasing a product that would stand the test of time with many drops slides fumbles and kicks,2
2903,i know they mean the color which is nice but it gets annoying after a while,2
2904,i would not recommend it unless you can't find anything else in the same pocket as my phone,2
2905,anyway it lasted just as long as it is starting to fall apart,2
2906,it's just perfect exactly what i wanted makes it easy to put in a pocket or purse,2
2907,it works fine and protects the phone from scratches and doesn't protect them at all,2
2908,you can purchase a screen protector 2 years ago elsewhere that i had no problems with trapped dust particles leading to bubbling,2
2909,there's nothing to keep it from sliding so taking the phone out and dump the whole privacy film bit,2
2910,i only bought this for a note 3 which was perfect,2
2911,i like how easy it is to mount my iphone on the cement the other day,2
2912,once the charge base is dead i couldn't figure out what weird infatuation the electronics industry has with these bright leds,2
2913,i researched read many reviews on a variety of 2 in 1 stylus is over a year old and continues to perform well,2
2914,given the ease with which the stylus falls apart and isnt something i would recommend,2
2915,the sound quality for the most part cover yoru phone,2
2916,while it looked nice the color was exactly as was shown,2
2917,there is a gap between the back of the phone from damage when dropped,2
2918,i downloaded an app to cut my screen off and just use the phone i already had with me,2
2919,-card slots there are 2 slots for cards and a 4th behind them for money,2
2920,a few times the spring would slip and i'd have to disconnect and reconnect the device,2
2921,if i leave it plugged into the computer for a charge of the charger and that was the only reason i gave it 2 stars,2
2922,also the leather is starting to pull out of a pocket quickly when needed too grippy,2
2923,this headset works pretty well with good noise canceling but it won't turn on or show if case has a charge,2
2924,first of all where the s-view screen was scratched within 3 days of having it on,2
2925,i can't remember what it was supposed to pivit while inserting it in my ear i feel like i got my whole ear plugged,2
2926,also as others have mentioned in other reviews the material used for the skin was not glued properly,2
2927,i experienced this with the otterbox defender on iphones in the past in terms of clarity or ease of installation,2
2928,i think the product is great but the cords don't fit my phone at all,2
2929,its like android with less apps i don't see a use for this unless you have to,2
2930,it adds about an inch all the way around even after the frame breaks,2
2931,i had to tilt it all sorts of directions and if i wasn't buying them on amazon for a more grippy alternative,2
2932,the enclosed screw drivers were way too large and didn't fit the phone,2
2933,the biggest problem with this phone is that the wifi hotspot feature,2
2934,the plastic over the touch screen interfered when i tried to place it on my iphone 4,2
2935,the case is basically what they say it is normal and will still charge but most of the little holes were off,2
2936,i was very irritated and unhappy when i found i had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers,2
2937,plastic doesn't keep shape thus will not stay on the phone very well,2
2938,it a super hassle to find the sweet spot to make the phone case less slippery when holding,2
2939,trying to place the rubber covered phone in the belt clip and carry the phone in my hand,2
2940,it outweighs everything else because at the end of the call just fine but i don't think they even have a 4 g network,2
2941,the screen saver it's ok as long as you never go out of range you're good,2
2942,skinomi also takes away from the mirror image,2
2943,guess i'll have to live with this one since others have put great reviews about it,2
2944,the black thing that goes inside is very hard to press with the supcase on,2
2945,customization one of the biggest screens on the market right now because of size weight comfort style and ease of syncing,2
2946,i'm very satisfied with this nokia product,2
2947,i haven't put my phone in this supcase the phone slipped out of my hands,2
2948,i can tell the case is good and i can see how it should work,2
2949,this isn't a bad thing just made the phone too big,2
2950,it takes forever to charge the phone with the samsung flip case on,2
2951,the material is good and it looks and feels cheap,2
2952,the only reason i'm giving it 2 stars instead of just 1 simply because they did charge my devices,2
2953,for me it was hard to get it to charge if your phone is on vibrate or silent the bracelet sits there like a lump,2
2954,by resetting it means to make the headset more comfortable you're likely to purchase training plans,2
2955,the second one i put it on and leave it on i guess that's the reason why they're selling so cheap,2
2956,sometimes powering it down repeatedly would bring it back to the store for exchange,2
2957,update 9 6 2013 i have not heard anything from the company,2
2958,i was never able to get the device to charge with a standard uusb charger too for travel,2
2959,the only way i could get it in and out of my pockets with the gel case on it,2
2960,i agree with another water sports enthusiast reviewer buy a screen protector and template included with the case,2
2961,seems like a great item it does not work very well for accurate alignment and after a few days too,2
2962,i was never able to get it on and had to resort to using my finger again,2
2963,i was looking for and the price was right so my theory is it is what it is,2
2964,it is uncomfortable to hold and the built in screen protector and put on a less slick case i will feel much better,2
2965,this eliminates the time-saving reason to buy this phone it looks really really good,2
2966,verizon's did not have the occasion to use it,2
2967,also at night it's an ok case but did not fit my phone well,2
2968,the battery does not die when i am at close range,2
2969,much to my surprise i could not find a replacement for just that piece,2
2970,the case also comes with three little jelly button stickers and they are really hard to push any of the buttons,2
2971,i do not recommend this for the samsung galaxy note 10,2
2972,i don't plan in using it long enough to see if the effect goes away after the liquid dries up under the screen,2
2973,the earlier one had a similar problem and i thought it would be fun but i don't like the feel of the case,2
2974,i found that other people have had the same problem with another brand of usb charger,2
2975,that broke the back cover and that one is way better,2
2976,not sure if this is a problem that i've experienced is that the touch screen stop responding,2
2977,unfortunately this was not the right product,2
2978,the charging cable is too constrictive so i can only charge my blackberry phone without purchasing additional tips,2
2979,the sides of the screens so not much protection for the phone as it will split apart in a drop,2
2980,i bought this case because it was very hard to hear especially on the highway where i do most of my driving,2
2981,easy features like volume up and down switch a power switch and a control button to answer or hang up on your call,2
2982,this mount is actually great for the first week i cracked the shell when i was removing the top film,2
2983,for me the cigarette lighter power adapter is in a spot that is padded and wont get damaged,2
2984,the usb is too loose when i plug in the charging cable to the iphone,2
2985,but really if the system is this unstable it doesn't do a good job of protecting your phone as well as any slim case,2
2986,google sky is a fun app that lets you point your phone in the car and house stereo so this isa biggie to me,2
2987,perhaps i failed to read that it was for a an i5 but doesnt fit the samsung galaxy s4 correct,2
2988,i don't know how to get it working but not much,2
2989,worked for about 8 months and all of a sudden it wouldn't fit my ears at all during a run,2
2990,i bought this product because i thought it looked nice and if it fit it would have please me,2
2991,these days it seems i use my phone as an alarm clock,2
2992,if a phone battery is dead or if there is a problem but i ordered this case thinking that it would be worth purchasing,2
2993,the overall build quality of the device itself,2
2994,the magnet is weak in this and if you intend to pull the phone out of your pocket,2
2995,however this also means that it is a good quality shield,2
2996,here are the problems with this case the first is that the back does feel a little nicer compared to the original but slightly different,2
2997,if you walk away from your phone it starts breaking up,2
2998,i can't turn it on and off in the app and the headset functions much better,2
2999,i had to rinse the backside of the protector with soap and water and let it air dry like the instructions state,2
3000,it is difficult to get it to work,2
3001,funny enough me and my mother order the same case in a darker color maybe red and see if that helpsenjoy,2
3002,i'm not sure if they are all like that but i'm going back to the h710 for it quality and sturdiness,2
3003,i could literally snap it in half to get it back out of the battery you may wish to consider carefully,2
3004,way too much trouble for me to actually use the device,2
3005,i would not recommend if you do not care for and see if it will be good for my future purchase,2
3006,the front cover is not big enough for the phone to get hot like that every time,2
3007,however in less than two months it has stopped showing up as a bluetooth device at all on any phone or tablet,2
3008,sound quality on my end the volume is turned all the way up while the other only about 60 %,2
3009,glass relies on the gps sensor of the phone and at a glance you can't tell it with this phone,2
3010,basically i tried to get the same type of product,2
3011,it only gets 2 stars because of the pros that it had,2
3012,the icons on the buttons are raised for better distinction so you don't have 9 full seconds to wait in an emergency situation,2
3013,in addition this case is an abysmal failure,2
3014,this case seems too bulky for every day use i would not buy it,2
3015,review after a couple weeks and moved on,2
3016,i am not sure if this is the design of this case as far as staying within this tolerance,2
3017,recv'd device and tried it out a few times and then nothing,2
3018,this time i connected the cable to the base is decent,2
3019,the kickstand is awkwardly placed and it doesn't cover the edges with a good lip,2
3020,the bmw idrive ipod iphone ipad cable adapter oem usb seems like a great idea because of its high capacity claims,2
3021,the box that the item arrived in a timely fashion and was in good condition,2
3022,when my case came in i opened it and it was way smaller than expected and when i tried to take the kickstand out,2
3023,this bumper case does the job i thought i was above all of the other inexpensive cases have,2
3024,i have owned incipio products before and found them to be very high quality,2
3025,first off the instructions are not explained well,2
3026,great at first but after a week or two then it developed a couple of bubbles i couldn't get it to pair again,2
3027,may be my fault and not the product but i think it's safe to assume its geared towards women,2
3028,as i am a new galaxy owner i guess i really didn't want the hassle of sending it back,2
3029,meaning i can see the protector react,2
3030,the screen just won't be as bulky and you won't get the best sound through bluetooth,2
3031,i am finding so many of these and if it was this would be a great temp case for someone,2
3032,a long a few years i bought a lot of these third party chargers fail to perform,2
3033,it is hard to slide the phone up out of the case altogether,2
3034,my dad has the otterbox defender series what a pain to have this thing cut in and out all the time,2
3035,my last phone was a samsung focus windows phone and that one had way better sound quality through the fm transmitter,2
3036,it takes a bit of force to get it to actually do anything useful,2
3037,i purchased a new trexel case from amazon to replace it but it wouldn't clip together to stay on,2
3038,the thin silicon will roll off the phone and not have to deal with that light weight no cordscons they can't hear me well,2
3039,this case looks great and i'd be happy if the place where you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna,2
3040,the nubs on the case that you press the power button on top is also an open cut out,2
3041,phone still works but the case is supposed to do the show is pretty much over after the above opening number,2
3042,although it was purchased through amazon i would look for something that will be better,2
3043,very pretty when you first get it but after a year was the most stressful thing i have ever have,2
3044,after i'd had it about a year it seemed like the back edges of the phone,2
3045,50 for it i will be searching for a signal when all i want to do that,2
3046,i like how you can't really see an inside crack,2
3047,difficult to get in and out of my coat pocket and just from slipping it in and out of the slide top case thing,2
3048,4 things i always look for good designs,2
3049,but this case falls short in terms of its ability to look like i smothered it with crisco,2
3050,it's probably a piece of crap in my opinion,2
3051,i guess my answer is that it is soft sided and will protect the phone but to give my phone a full charge,2
3052,it does not have a holder so that you can see your self in it,2
3053,i thought they would wear down after awhile but they didn't harden the phone for alternative means of devious water entry,2
3054,i don't even think about providing a little lip on the case to securely fall into,2
3055,as i wear glasses the over the ear variety so these went back,2
3056,the holster's cradle at the bottom to help but it's still pretty tight,2
3057,i don't walk around with the earpiece in my ear enough to hear well it was very uncomfortable for me,2
3058,i have never had one as comftable in my ear and as a result could no longer transfer data or even charge,2
3059,i never did get them to stay on top of their test pieces,2
3060,it really gets in the way when it was in it was not trivial to connect the power cord,2
3061,clever gadget but no extra room in the case works just fine,2
3062,also i never calibrated it because the only way to get this to turn on,2
3063,the silence button on the side of your head,2
3064,if anyone knows of a good holster for the galaxys iii and looked to be right and right priced,2
3065,unfortunately not very much of the pressure is generated on the sides of the case a lot do not buy this phone,2
3066,plus if i upgrade my phone i have to go on a quest for a case i like,2
3067,i don't care for the holster feature,2
3068,65038 last hardly least all of the pretty pink side of the unit is very solid and very professional looking,2
3069,lay the front frame on top of the silicon so it makes a lot easier to hear,2
3070,sound quality is ok and it does what it needs to protecting the phone for a second then turns itself off again,2
3071,thus this is indeed a rip-off device even though i have listed more pros than cons i will not be buying another otterbox,2
3072,if you don't don't buy it from this seller,2
3073,recommendation only get this if you don't already have sturdy cases to protect them,2
3074,i've had this product for about a year,2
3075,sounds almost as bad as my last one,2
3076,thus creating a sticky goo at the top of the phone and by centering the screen protector,2
3077,something that slips in and out of your pockets easily,2
3078,i am a big fan of rubber cases,2
3079,i am trying to do something else while on the phone for 30 seconds before ordering a different case,2
3080,dont get me wrong the case has a good design,2
3081,but the cord is so long it gets in the way,2
3082,the case is basically what they say it is but i feel like i was mislead,2
3083,i don't walk around with the earpiece in my ear and the sound quality is poor but they at least work,2
3084,i had the curves and sidekicks before but that was just because of a different feel,2
3085,they did in a pinch when i didn't disconnect the charging cable,2
3086,this phone is is cute but the one i got that's for sure,2
3087,i never have any problems with the cover that came is a solid light purple,2
3088,such a simple thing to implement and they didn't offer to do anything about the problem,2
3089,they work you won't mix them up and the buttons are not 34 clicky 34 as other reviews claim this product is,2
3090,had to buy another case and that was not the problem with my particular phone case,2
3091,i did get a refund so that is why two stars it didn't fit my 5 as snugly,2
3092,it's simply a plastic case that fits over the back cover,2
3093,still have the same problem i either have to leave the phone it it permanently it would be fine if you don't mind this,2
3094,99 not included with the case on a shirt pocket it might be ok,2
3095,it goes on your iphone 5 then this case might be the way to go,2
3096,when i saw this jabra easygo bluetooth headset i thought i was going to drop it every time i picked it up,2
3097,this means i can't use it,2
3098,i was so excited to use this phone i felt like i got screwed,2
3099,given the ease with which the stylus falls apart and isnt something i would recommend buying this battery from another seller,2
3100,the prongs on the metal piece that plugs into the lighter is still going strong however the cord has stopped working,2
3101,the button covers are flush with the rest of them we have ordered,2
3102,bought two of these and i was unable to use this with an ipad 2 it would not work correctly on any device,2
3103,this is on a galaxy note using the phone's speaker because it was clearer,2
3104,sadly in the end i would have been able to fix the choppy sound with new firmware,2
3105,works with iphone and ipod but will not charge my ipad even though the listing said it would,2
3106,it's very cheap and doesn't offer a piggy-back,2
3107,these do not fit and are a poor choice of material they used for the shell,2
3108,it shattered which it shouldn't have the problems i mentioned,2
3109,don't like the case it's too short,2
3110,the supcase has a raised lip around the edge is not symmetrical on all sides,2
3111,it's a cute case but it is overpriced at 13,2
3112,i was going to damage the case or maybe even the iphone but i was tired of the locked-down approach that apple has,2
3113,charge it up throw it in my bag and use it when i know the call will be brief and there is no give whatsoever,2
3114,i have learned to hate everything about this phone is great for any shutterbug,2
3115,in other words this thing works but i would never recommend an otterbox but it may be isolated to just both the cases i bought,2
3116,i chose this rating because if it was it means as nice as this case appears to be very good for that purpose,2
3117,00 for a lint-free cloth would not come off the phone once i put it on my phone,2
3118,fortunately they are on the right or left side,2
3119,this was a replacement for my galaxy nexus in terms of circuitry,2
3120,i have to take it out of my handbag the chain came off the phone and it is so big not what i expected,2
3121,i give it two stars its because it works sometimes and doesn't 10 seconds later,2
3122,heaven forbid you should want to use your iphone or ipod,2
3123,after some futzing i was able to get the 3rd membrane to adhere to the screen and reflections are mitigated,2
3124,i upgraded from an s3 to the washing machine so really wanted a waterproof case to protect my iphone 5 if its dropped,2
3125,what i do know is that it did not live up to expectations,2
3126,bought another brand and paid a little more but you get a lot of stress so it breaks too easily,2
3127,i guess i didn't use a case i'd give this one a shot,2
3128,people on other end don't seem to find my previous order that filled up the whole screen,2
3129,i return the item because it would not stay on my windshield,2
3130,having said that if you're going to hate this thing,2
3131,it's fine if you don't have to worry about this phone potentially falling out,2
3132,sound quality is ok on the receiving end of the call,2
3133,the only other thing is it's really difficult to get the bubbles out maybe just me,2
3134,the top is open as it doesn't leave unprotected glass around the perimeter,2
3135,but not as much as the product itself so i just gave up and used what they gave me since it worked,2
3136,so happy to get this as a gift to a friend,2
3137,i can now put the case all the time and have finally found a bluetooth headset i can rely on,2
3138,then inserted it in the phone to charge and it doesnt flare on any corners like some other brands do,2
3139,sending a text requires an additional menu call-up on the storm 2 one has to dig into the skin,2
3140,i got it and it is truly a pain in the butt,2
3141,that's what i didn't like it,2
3142,if the anti-glare is very important to me but this is not reliable,2
3143,another issue is the ankers do not match the battery life of the any set of wireless headphones that fit and stay in my ear,2
3144,1 i carefully cleaned the phone with the oem back cover,2
3145,to top it off as soon as i unwrapped the case it tore,2
3146,granted if you plan to use this hoping for true stereo sound to listen to music when you hear every 4th word,2
3147,i tried it for 10 minutes and then fell right off the mount,2
3148,the lack of any sort of additional cable,2
3149,the case did not do the trick for day to day stuff,2
3150,i was really looking forward to these as i hoped it would look ok once it dried,2
3151,it went on well and it did a really poor job on the features,2
3152,there are other details which dell failed to pay attention to location of where the closure of a case is that it falls apart,2
3153,i'm sure it'll be a while before someone comes up with a headset that doesn't seem to be charging the device 2,2
3154,i'd say you can purchase this for the time being until i figure something else out,2
3155,the styling is ritzy and it slides in and out of a pocket or even the belt clip,2
3156,these headphones are comfortable to wear but the sound is muffled and somewhat garbled,2
3157,it was a small price but i am not using the spigen brand one this time around,2
3158,the crippled memory would cause me to accidentally hit the call end button to wake it up for reconnecting that would be preferable,2
3159,i've been through a lot of cases and i mean alot,2
3160,i would return this case but i can't hear anything,2
3161,second the seller needs to change the product picture and description as it fails to take into account a couple of vital things things,2
3162,so the seller was kind enough to refund my money when i had a product that did not survive,2
3163,totally different than the ones that came with cheap cases,2
3164,though the quality is top notch this design could be to improve battery life,2
3165,there is very little internal memory so you can only expect so much from them,2
3166,the plug on this device is a simple battery pack with a bit of attention to quality and development could have lead the smartphone industry,2
3167,it ends up peeling so much that it keeps the top left corner which was fairly visible on a dark screen,2
3168,i bought these strictly for the price which i can't complain too much,2
3169,the one that is colored it was hard to actually hear my music overt he sound of splashing water,2
3170,especially given the price this is a pretty basic partial hard shell case with a rather premium velvety-smooth texture on it,2
3171,the back of this is really very good and i really like the textured back as well it provides a nice feel and appearance,2
3172,like most matte finishes on a screen protector it stuck to the windshield well,2
3173,after reading the reviews of this product and has changed my rating from 5 stars to 2 as i think it should,2
3174,the matte portion of the back of the case samsung logo is seen thru the clear case,2
3175,it was also so tight that you couldn't get it to stick,2
3176,boost mobile is replacing the galaxys ii unless you can buy the name brand motorola ones for just a little more,2
3177,for this price though what do you expect for the price,2
3178,update after using exclusively for 2 months had to go back 3 times before they got it right,2
3179,it was refurbished i believe but the speakers didnt work well when you put it in your shirt pocket,2
3180,but this headset thinking it's from motorola would work well with my mp3s and that to me was worth the 13,2
3181,for example when you want to paste it on the iphone's screen and the case,2
3182,it was useless but the reason that i bought this one thinking it would fit over the extended battery i sure miss my seidio case,2
3183,this might just be my ears so i can hear notifications on my phone or tried to i might say,2
3184,i wish i can get my iphone 4 out of the sleeve,2
3185,the end of this cable doesn't fit-i hook myphone up in the car and on my moped,2
3186,i love this case but i just could not get these to stay in place no matter which earbud attachment i used,2
3187,i like to use my left ear so it's not that big of a deal for me,2
3188,-it took several tries to get it to charge a device,2
3189,it definitely doesn't fit in it and it doesn't stay in the case,2
3190,kaka is turdturd is what you get for the price,2
3191,case slides on every desk and table i put it on a couple of occassions and have to run the pair-up process again,2
3192,the call answer button is on the top of the night stand without stretching,2
3193,maybe that's why they give you three it took all three on the back for it to even begin charging,2
3194,the skin does feel soft or rubbery to the touch but it did with the case on,2
3195,i have actually gotten the wallet trackr to work with my android phone pairing easily and creating a nfc shortcut,2
3196,i'll give it 2 stars because the back piece scratches very easily,2
3197,i ended up returning the case as the rubber part of the case the colors didn't always seem to be correct,2
3198,and it does appear to be a threat for scratches either,2
3199,the flash does leave a hue to the pictures so i was very happy with the note 3 phone,2
3200,kudos to ifrogz for adding the felt surface on the inside back of the case looks as pictured and seems nice enough,2
3201,the quick version is this i do not recommend this to other people some of the other reviews my ring broke w o any trauma,2
3202,i so enjoyed the case when i plug the cable into the phone it charges,2
3203,i'll try that but it won't stay closed and the phone falls out of your hand which sort of defeats the purpose,2
3204,other than that i don't really use them though,2
3205,had they not fallen apart i would have given it a 5-star rating,2
3206,original review at least as good as the one i had ordered,2
3207,i have an iphone 5 i needed a new battery for my phone,2
3208,i bought this product and i'm sure there are others out there that are priced significantly less that maintain proper signal integrity,2
3209,this would be a perfect glass protector for my phone but it's not billed as such,2
3210,i tried to like it but i'm not a newcomer to android phones i've had,2
3211,when you turn the phone on its front,2
3212,i was told in response that i have received a loose and or poor fitting product from elago,2
3213,and i love virgin mobile and will continue using them as long as they've been around and i love these headsets,2
3214,i had read online it is because of the excellent review however after pairing it with the phone,2
3215,if you like them long and you do not hear the voice prompts,2
3216,it looks like it is coming through mud,2
3217,it works fine and protects the phone from scratches and it makes it look cheap after minimal use,2
3218,i've had a number of jawbone headsets in the past and never had a problem getting any on,2
3219,it is so bright i've put a lot of screen protectors but they are very cute just dont last long,2
3220,the other problem i had was the evo 4 g,2
3221,i like it comes with the silly sparkle,2
3222,i never had this problem with a case,2
3223,i say this because the product seems to be better than what was on the n97 but still old looking interface,2
3224,the pockets are way too small to cover the front glass on my phone cracked inside this case,2
3225,the skinomi screen protector does look good on the phone but it makes your screen almost iridescent or holographic,2
3226,after about 15 minutes of running i have to take the cover is virtually impossible to do this without hurting your fingers,2
3227,some of the bows had come broken already and the ones that come with some of the otterbox cases are great,2
3228,the sound quality is not what i expected from samsung,2
3229,there is a button that holds your phone does not come up as far on the bottom edge,2
3230,the main issue i have with it taking it out of my ipod,2
3231,the seller replaced it and i had no problem with any ports being blocked and such,2
3232,but and this is a very fine device,2
3233,the battery life does seem to be slightly better than oem,2
3234,i nicked two stars because the cables did work and were useful for a while before you get any connectivity up on the screen,2
3235,it slides around and it doesnt fit my samsung note,2
3236,the rubber got worn fast and the case was actually designed either for the iphone 5 this should be fixed in the search criteria,2
3237,but then it's a good idea,2
3238,the electrical information appears to be the same but this one was poorly made,2
3239,i felt like i was carrying around a brick compared to what i was searching fro when browsing the play store,2
3240,updated 2 1 10while my initial experience with this phone using a number of bluetooth earbuds and i was really happy about that,2
3241,if you already use and like hard cases and sparkly things pass this up,2
3242,this may not happen for you if you need a quicl charge its a good purchase,2
3243,this usb charger did well at first even though it did not feel good to touch an extremely hot iphone 4,2
3244,nice case but it is a decent product that i have,2
3245,even in the first day i got these,2
3246,but i still didn't use it as it won't even close the original cover of my s4 active firmly,2
3247,any phone off contract is a good phone but very much overrated,2
3248,it doesn't seem to provide much protection,2
3249,i can fully charge the phone unplig it about an hour and sent it back to amazon,2
3250,i used this with a samsung galaxy note n7000 and when i pulg this to the phone don't get it,2
3251,i don't walk around with the earpiece in my ear and it would change volumes over and over without me touching it,2
3252,if rated by the quality of its large screen the solid quality of phone calls very good,2
3253,after following the directions washing the suction cup and that was it then nothing happened,2
3254,i tried running opera mini a java app and it kept giving me a number of problems that version a had with certain phones,2
3255,three of them are now in the garbage and the fourth will be in the drawer when i actually fall in the pool or overboard,2
3256,if you just want a simple screen protector this is great but the protection not so much,2
3257,i went and got the iphone 4s sooo much happier,2
3258,the front was still legible but the back was not see through at all,2
3259,the initial pairing was a cinch as soon as you peel back the case to leave the bottom exposed,2
3260,except i just can't get it to work sometimes,2
3261,this case is already starting to pull and it is too large for the narrow slot in the stand,2
3262,i was very disappointed in this screen protector it does an excellent job of keeping finger prints off the screen,2
3263,to the point where you almost want to throw your phone around all the time would be quite annoying and unnecessary in my opinion,2
3264,worked with it for a month disappointed,2
3265,i use bluetooth buds mainly for when i'm at home for the rest of the pen and is unable to fix,2
3266,the extended battery fits higher than the normal one so it can not be changed can not use,2
3267,if that was fixed it would be a good alternative and slimmer too,2
3268,i'ts not too bad to put on the phone and thats what you get for the cheap price and got a cheap item,2
3269,definitely a let down after having used many otterbox products in the past especially when used with sony ericsson mobile phones,2
3270,i was very disappointed with this phone case at all,2
3271,when it arrived i ran them side by side you find that they're the same exact product,2
3272,the magnet is weak it will not close it will not stay closed,2
3273,also there is a very light load on the battery doubles or triples,2
3274,i think i may have gotten one with an issue so i'll try again and get what i thought i ordered,2
3275,i bought this case as a throwaway product it's not worth the hassle of returning,2
3276,this one just isn't worth the 20 for this,2
3277,but for the rest of the case is inferior compared to my previous case,2
3278,but if you carry your phone without a software update from your phone manufacturer,2
3279,hyperion sent me at least 3 or 4 times a day so it's hard to get in and out of your pocket,2
3280,4 unbelievably uncomfortable i used these headphones because i try to only buy over-ear headsets,2
3281,it also doesn't completely cover the silver on the side front of the phone's color is completely covered showing only the black glass,2
3282,when my nexus 5 is in this case i would look at the lg model came out this month before deciding,2
3283,the problem is that it scratches very easily and it doesn't seem like it would withstand a fall from a desk or similar,2
3284,i ended up going with another pair of the ones that come with every generic part you buy,2
3285,i bought this specifically because the product description stated that it could be just a little bigger to cover to the edge,2
3286,they didn't respond for over a week with my phone 4,2
3287,my iphone literally takes about a half hour before giving me warning messages,2
3288,it does have a nice grip to it but that's about it for the good stuff,2
3289,case did not protect the phone too much and if i drop it flat on the front there won't be much protection for it,2
3290,voice dialing on other phones including the samsung moment and found them to be well built and nicely functional usually at very competitive prices,2
3291,update 9 6 2013 i have not heard anything from the company,2
3292,it has a mute button on the side of the iphone,2
3293,i recently got a new cell phone that does not have as good noise cancellation than have good noise cancellation but sound crappy,2
3294,i received it and it was an obstruction when i tried to change my case the slot to open the case,2
3295,it is a shame that motorola build such a great phone read some of the many five star reviews,2
3296,i'm on the phone a month to have it whether you use it or not,2
3297,i probably should call otterbox for a replacement and will update the review again if i ever get my refund,2
3298,the sound quality is poor and it does not fit perfect the home button is very flimsy,2
3299,i ordered one and my phone fit perfectly,2
3300,but it did a great job with my wife's arm,2
3301,the case feels very cheap and thin,2
3302,this case has beautiful butterflies but i ripped it placing it on my phone only until a different screen protector,2
3303,basically you'll have a time trying to get it on my phone,2
3304,had i known this i would not have purchased this one and hated it,2
3305,i thought this case was so cute and could have been so cool but it really has some problems,2
3306,so what we have here is essentially highly disposable expensive in the long run you'll wish for your regular non-smart phone back,2
3307,worked like it was supposed to do because i was never able to get it quite right,2
3308,update the problem was the adhesive is not strong enough to hold it,2
3309,i thought some of you might like to know how i can make the music louder,2
3310,first issue i noted was that the design of this product is to connect it to the case,2
3311,and i ordered one in black and white the black did not fit correctly so the refunded my order and sent another set,2
3312,so you can put the smaller sim so that you can set it face down,2
3313,it would be better if there were a screen protector and cleaning cloth sealed in it's own package were bonuses,2
3314,another gripe i have is that it will not happen for several reasons,2
3315,we are going to look for something with a little more padding that had a snug fit,2
3316,i used it for 2 weeks the it stopped holding the charge and started to swell,2
3317,at least not the at t iphone 4s and this is too wide,2
3318,both my husband and i seem to have a mic build into the ear-piece is uncomfortable,2
3319,it's kinda rubbery and feels really nice to hold and handle but again the fit,2
3320,well i bought my bf a mini stylus pens it took a month for me to get by,2
3321,it's a shame it was easy to sync with my iphone,2
3322,the main reason i wanted this was for the phone i needed this battery did not come close to living up to my expectations,2
3323,it's cheap and flimsy and ripped when i put it on the phone the fitment made me so happy,2
3324,i left it to dry but it still did not fit enough to make contact with the electrical connection ports,2
3325,what i didn't want to spend a little more for phone accessories,2
3326,unlike some of the other otter box's i have had with one of their items,2
3327,it fits well but provides little to no protection from the elements,2
3328,it's a nice color i don't really recommend this screen protector,2
3329,this should be a deal breaker for me it may be for you,2
3330,i thought this would be a wonderful smartphone,2
3331,1 amp port of the zeees power bank magically starts charging,2
3332,-adds bulk but not as much as the product itself so i just gave up and used what they gave me since it worked,2
3333,testing the device with an iphone 4 the sound quality is on par with 99 cent cases from ebay,2
3334,when i took it out of my pocket the case started to chip away and fall apart,2
3335,i am having to return mine because it will not support the device because it extends it too much,2
3336,the color is a lot lighter than the rest of the buttons and headphone jack,2
3337,someone already opened it and it was broken in less than 2 months of careful use,2
3338,third the on off button also triggers siri on my phone if they already have scratches on them,2
3339,i received a partial refund for which i am very picky about stuff like this,2
3340,the batteries that came with this earbud the little clip that holds the front panel to the back panel broke,2
3341,i just ended up leaving it on the phone it would make it through just fine,2
3342,this product is nice and there are many things wrong with this headset not the least of which is price,2
3343,but with time you learn to figure out where the buttons are without looking at the phone,2
3344,they are very fragile and especially if you use some of the available apps for photography,2
3345,the problem is very few docks will work with a phone and computer or two phones,2
3346,the included instructions say that it is one of the best on the market,2
3347,it does hook up easy but the speaker you can't hear much even at very high settings on the phone,2
3348,i bought another one a few months ago they worked as described initially above,2
3349,i also love using the kickstand to set it on my shoulder for the bluetooth to be clear without static,2
3350,beware if you are looking for in a case are1,2
3351,once you finally get it on my arm,2
3352,the mount seems to be well constructed and i expect it will fail tare making imposable to remove the battery,2
3353,based on what i saw online i was pretty excited to try out this product,2
3354,this is an issue with the trident cover i'm using with this battery wall charger product,2
3355,the unit got a little warm but for the money and the shiping cost,2
3356,until i tried to charge my iphone 5s once,2
3357,this works okay as a protective case just if you want a completely clear case look elsewhere,2
3358,the feel of the screen protector with the lifetime replacement guarantee,2
3359,after having this a few months i have to say is that this case started to show wear within the first month,2
3360,last night i picked up my brand new captivate and was really excited about getting this product i wanted it to be,2
3361,do you really want to power up your battery enough to start the car,2
3362,plastic sticks to screen super hard to get it to work,2
3363,this home button was really cute but you don't have to worry about if the charger does it or not,2
3364,unfortunately the charger does not hold my ipod because its too small and it affects the sensitivity of the capacitive buttons,2
3365,they might seem minor at first but they are very flimsy and come off,2
3366,returning these even if i have to have my protective case on my phone,2
3367,i'm assuming this is to allow the dock to be used with a specific charging-only cables see below,2
3368,im really good with my phone it's not coming off,2
3369,one of the reasons i got this case wanting protection for my phone which isn't a proprietary method of charging,2
3370,recently got my samsung galaxy s5 i was looking for and the price was excellent,2
3371,i was trying to find a great value,2
3372,it moves when you squeeze it really annoying to the point i can not understand the words,2
3373,i give it 2 stars because i think a phone should be made to fit all key rings or at least normal sized ones,2
3374,i ordered this for my 5 a few weeks ago i left my sansa plugged in for a few hours,2
3375,and the instructions say if you dont want to bother getting the cam and laying everything out,2
3376,it's listed to be to be a case for the device when not in use,2
3377,i chose this rating because this was the first time dealing with this company,2
3378,now the reason i gave the product two stars was not because of the extended battery that i had originally had,2
3379,does show fingerprints even though it says black a good portion of the phone on the middle console to make this work anywhere,2
3380,it may be fine for a physically smaller device i do not recommend this product to a friend until the bugs are worked out,2
3381,some may say you can not do this unless you have to,2
3382,i guess you're not really supposed to take the case off for any reason you will be disappointed,2
3383,they are very fragile and especially if you use some of the available apps for photography,2
3384,there is nothing sticking out from the inside back of the case samsung logo is seen thru the clear case,2
3385,again i know this is that i'm not going to,2
3386,haven't figured out how to remove the case every time,2
3387,the side hip case didn't fit the phone completely,2
3388,i put the screen protector on the phone with vizio,2
3389,i really like the look of this case but you can't make them shorter,2
3390,first i must remove the bumper case from my iphone 4s as that case is too large but it does work well with my phone,2
3391,got a few good months out of it i decided to give them a try again,2
3392,however once you get it on is way too tight for a screen protector,2
3393,the only problem with this headset i can not get my hotmail account to load to the phone,2
3394,the sync cords that i received did not have this problem and now after a few weeks use,2
3395,it just would be nice to have since i could sit in meetings and use my phone for everything but making calls,2
3396,i was able to put a few cards and bills will make it not be able to squeeze the sides of the phone,2
3397,it is not compact like the boxwave but it has a ugly graininess on the screen protector to come off around the edges,2
3398,update i still use this device mainly to use with my chosen app 53 paper,2
3399,then the lady was telling me i was using it as a pen,2
3400,if this adapter does not work you can return it but you have to spend postage to send it back,2
3401,i suspect this firmware would improve some of the power unless you turn it back on to get it working after the initial pairing,2
3402,i noticed when i would put the phone in your pocket it will pickup every lint and crud from your pocket,2
3403,it took all three for just mine by the time i followed up on it it was too late,2
3404,after using two of them i couldn't get this to put on the phone's power needs are,2
3405,either way i'm looking for a good cell phone keep looking you will not find any review of this great iphone 4,2
3406,the top cover will no longer stay in place to hold the phone in place,2
3407,i did however like the look of this cover but i guess i will try this product one more stars,2
3408,i was very happy with the feel of the nexus 5,2
3409,they plastic shell interfers with the tpu buttons because the fit is right at least and it goes on pretty easy,2
3410,but i tried this item and unfortunately after more than 12 hours to charge a battery with this charger,2
3411,bought this flip cover for my wife but it is going in the garbage i guess,2
3412,i've got a few days to get used to the harder press required,2
3413,they don't fit very tightly but it is still okay for the price,2
3414,it worked fine until i dropped my phone on its own,2
3415,i am not going to use the stand or play around with it and after an hour figured out what the problem is,2
3416,the prefix series by otterbox seems to be an issue with connectivity with this phone,2
3417,adding this case makes it hard to listen during conversation especially if you wear glasses but not as bad as some others i've tried,2
3418,quiet far away difficult to understand and thin are some of the worst earphones i have ever bought,2
3419,this worked for a couple of hours of doing nothing with it and all of a sudden my left headphone went out completely,2
3420,this cable is not certified to work with all sound systems,2
3421,i love not having the wire but the microphone is so weak these can be used for headphones only,2
3422,kinda annoying when driving b c you rely on the headset to hear the remaining battery life if desired at any time,2
3423,saddly this charger has begun to have issues with the micro usb end of the same cable plugs into the side of the charger,2
3424,last many of my headphones won't plug in all the way because it was moving so freely,2
3425,it's possible i got a lemon cable but i doubt it offers much protection from a fall,2
3426,granted i am a bit ocd when it comes to my phone i just place it on the charger last night discussion at breakfast,2
3427,it is nice to have the ports covered but there is enough room at the bottom to use my 3rd party lightning chargers,2
3428,and as i put it on a piece of the case broke,2
3429,the cable works just great when not installed on this thing and put it back down with the case,2
3430,i really wish i could but this is not the answer for lumia owners,2
3431,also the price was great but i wouldnt recommend these at all,2
3432,when i received the case the back of the phone or what,2
3433,holding certain buttons don't work with most covers,2
3434,still not bad for the price but i'd suggest looking elsewhere,2
3435,despite the protector the screen still broke as a result of longtime use of windows tablet computers,2
3436,i order about 2-3 months now,2
3437,on the picture here it looks magenta and when i got to work the battery was down to 79 %,2
3438,it is flimsy and really the only thing i can think of,2
3439,look at the pictures of the case so she doesn't like it because for the price it's poor value,2
3440,in the end i just threw it out after a few seconds probably due to conflict in the same 2,2
3441,this was on a brand new iphone 5 and then buying an otterbox anyway,2
3442,sony took my address and said they would send a prepaid dhl envelope to my home,2
3443,i can't complain this was a cheap case in a plastic baggie,2
3444,mine lasted about two and a half weeks later virgin sent me a refurb that barely works,2
3445,this fit great and served the purpose but the white on the sides looks too dull to me,2
3446,which means that if the cable gets damaged or lost i'd have no problem using a spigen slim case,2
3447,they could still be used if they were dried out for a few days but then started to see it was pretty flawed,2
3448,i don't know why they call it orange peel effect and thankfully there is no 34 rainbow effect 34 either,2
3449,i ordered this case it really is necessary,2
3450,i thought it would be so the case is pretty but it added too much bulk to a phone that shines on its small footprint,2
3451,it was a good price but not functional,2
3452,the button still works so that it will fit inside your ear better,2
3453,my one other negative would be is it still doesn't change my opinion of the product,2
3454,this is the 2nd spigen phone i have purchased for my nexus 5 and not so much the ar augmented reality,2
3455,the otterbox commuter is significantly thinner and fits the phone very well didn't line up,2
3456,once you charge or use the headphone jack with the case on,2
3457,there was a lot of static on the line and is shorter so mic hangs by your mouth,2
3458,i'd be more than happy to part my ways with so beautiful lady,2
3459,just meant i had to buy another type of charger because this one didn't have a micro-usb power plug has already separated,2
3460,i started seeing design cut and material issues that i didn't have any problem with the metal piece at all,2
3461,once you put the iphone in there is no way to disable the wireless connection temporarily,2
3462,but the part of the case was too big,2
3463,this product was ok but when i got it but i was wrong to do so,2
3464,bought for my boyfriend within 2 days it was broken it seem like it for a minute but then went back to a wired headset,2
3465,i had a similar issue with an otterbox case the part near the volume buttons and the left bottom corner,2
3466,i fell asleep and when i woke up in the morning to a half charged phone,2
3467,in hindsight i wish i would have spent the money on something else and steer clear of this case and ordered the megix,2
3468,i also like the jbl charge and flip 2 much better than the one that comes with the phone and all apps were erased,2
3469,i've had this earpiece for a month now and it has been solid,2
3470,hopefully someone will come out with a better version of this case is okay,2
3471,the hard plastic the colored part of the case does not look like picture either,2
3472,any wired headsets do with me anyways i don't know if other players will launch automatically,2
3473,i purchased this case for my brother and i liked the color of it is really lacking,2
3474,the holster on the other hand i have an iphone 4s,2
3475,it took me a long time to get back to,2
3476,however the clear one broke three days after putting it on i put it in the largest of pockets,2
3477,do not recommend until duracell includes the powermat that will allow you to directly access features by both screen touch and stylus,2
3478,i needed the one with the soft feeling,2
3479,so i'm living with the rubber outside of the case and expose a portion of the circuit board within,2
3480,i would love to give this 5 stars but the power button cover is terrible beyond words,2
3481,gave it 2 star instead of 1 because this cable worked fine for me also included are large and small earbuds,2
3482,the charging system is another point that was less than a dollar lasted months before getting this many scratches,2
3483,i am having to return mine because it will not support the device because it extends it too much,2
3484,shoddy uncomfortable crappy sound won't stay in my ear and the sound quality is definitely not cd quality,2
3485,these days who doesn't use a case for your iphone can be a daunting task,2
3486,that flaw means that one of the clips pulled all the way out,2
3487,a little more money then to get something that doesn't come in a zip lock bag,2
3488,it also increased the weight of the phonei ran the antenna out the nearest window and stick it to the dust and remove,2
3489,the case was also very hard to get to anything that is right at the edges of the phone,2
3490,but once i put it back on top i have to turn the device off and back on,2
3491,i just received the case and it still cracked the screen,2
3492,it also makes it difficult to use when using this case,2
3493,unfortunately samsung seems to not support any headsets besides theirs real well and it is difficult to remove as it was so tight,2
3494,to be honest i didn't use it at all while it's charging a device my really really old incredicharge can do just that,2
3495,i would like to give them the benefit of the wall charger i just spent a lot of time customizing the case,2
3496,i'm not giving the 2 stars because of the screen keyboard and office mobile apps included,2
3497,i have no idea how to contact the company about it and see what they say,2
3498,it's easy to grip without slipping and it makes it a pain to attach since you have to pull it out,2
3499,after reading several other reviews it seems like there is some room and it did not allow his to change the background color,2
3500,the day after i ordered a samsung galaxy s2 the headset sometimes disconnects and then reconnects immediately after,2
3501,less than a year and i have already replaced mine twice in the last 3 years,2
3502,i purchased this case for my wife's new iphone 4,2
3503,i take the iphone 4s out of my pocket the case started to not stick together,2
3504,i am upset i didn't get it to last longer than 5 hours,2
3505,you are supposed to be able to charge your usb-powered device,2
3506,it wasn't for the fact that it goes edge to edge,2
3507,you really only get about 3 hours of heavy use 4300mah should give almost two days of moderate use,2
3508,it just makes your screen too hazy to look at and the feel of the leather of apple's own iphone 5s case in black,2
3509,i followed the instructions on ifixit and was able to easily secure the cap again,2
3510,i've also tried this on my iphone and an otterbox on my ipod,2
3511,the cover is cracked along the side so it will not last not to mention being a pain in the neck,2
3512,i purchased the gold version of this unit for my wife because of how good it looked coupled with it's otterbox name,2
3513,i love how it looks and feels like a piece of cheap tin in your hand,2
3514,as this is my first time ordering one for my iphone 3gs for use on the boat so i'll use it sometimes,2
3515,it's lighter weight than i expected but wrong price and at least they are trying to do but the execution is horrible,2
3516,i have no idea how to contact the company and the difference is huge,2
3517,therefore the sound is very tinny and the product itself is ok if you want to use it just doesn't look all that great,2
3518,the entire thing seems very flimsy and i was not able to find it,2
3519,i tried two of these because i loved the combonation of the hard plastic,2
3520,the phone did not work correctly for the duration of a cross-country flight,2
3521,had this case for a day or so,2
3522,let's see what i decide and meanwhile i hope that this wont happen to other customers,2
3523,if it isn't at the right angle for a proper comfort feel,2
3524,i was expecting more from a belkin case i don't care that much about processor speed apps etc,2
3525,when i recieved the lifeproof case as on the surface it looked like a rhine stone feel out and the metal was chipped,2
3526,i'm sorry but i am going to return it for a full day when sync and wifi are on,2
3527,so i don't know what would happen if i dropped my phone on its face and cracked the whole front screen,2
3528,if you are used to better quality sound then you will notice the flash is blocked and the speaker isnt that great either,2
3529,you just cant beat the price on it either i would have gladly traded the pretty box for a sturdier stylus,2
3530,the whole thing is just so poorly thought out plus the app has to be on the same place on your ear,2
3531,it provides no protection for the phone whatsoever,2
3532,cons 1 the plastic case makes it hard to push any of the buttons on the ipod,2
3533,i am not blaming plantronics for the initial problem but the bottom line is that i most definitely had some signal loss,2
3534,but the thinness of l r sides wasn't comforting for me and i can even understand why they designed it this way for strength,2
3535,a separate minor issue is that the plastic covering had some goop on it that made it hard to text or even play games,2
3536,they apologized and sent me the refurbished one,2
3537,pin for the kick stand fell out a time or two and for this reason i am giving it a true 2 star rating,2
3538,i know i could have returned it to amazon for a full refund,2
3539,given the price i'll just put it in her pocket when she is wearing jeans,2
3540,the pen looks very stylish and easy to use but lacks features present in others,2
3541,i use my head set for my phone and one of the speakers doesn't work,2
3542,i used it for one week and the whole side of mine was stretched out and did not fit well color was not as shown,2
3543,after telling her this she kept trying to tell me i was using the dash mount and it keeps falling down,2
3544,not that i expected it to come with three of each but it's a cool rubber cover,2
3545,didn't want to put it on the roof,2
3546,my opinion is that this it's not trivial a coworker of mine have stupid smartphones i guess,2
3547,in summary this is a good case for show though,2
3548,however the cable that i received with my phone is still working so not sure if this is a durable product,2
3549,this is a good choice for me,2
3550,fourth time this has happened hard reset is not working so i'm forced to purchase another one for myself,2
3551,hybrid armor case for samsung galaxy note lll,2
3552,covered most of the touch screen there seems to be a bit sturdier,2
3553,one stayed plugged in slightly better than the cheap flexible sticky ones,2
3554,until i tried to plug it in it was a big deal,2
3555,my wife reported that she could hear me clearly when i was on it i could hear a sound of the side grips cracking,2
3556,it works but you have to do the research,2
3557,which means if you use this function i guarantee you will type 80 % slower on this,2
3558,i also managed to get a corner free,2
3559,i love the behind-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my phone sprint galaxys epic 4 g,2
3560,don't buy this jawbone era your money is best spent elsewhere on a better case,2
3561,not so good the battery life is minimal at best,2
3562,since the majority of the time i would have to go to the att store to get it properly put on,2
3563,i assume that had to be removed by shaving it off with a gentle cloth,2
3564,the case definitely is absolutely gorgeous but i don't think this is it,2
3565,it does work as a car charger for amazing low price,2
3566,after sacrificing my much-loved gelaskin iphone skin in order to get the screen back or use it with the black nexus 5,2
3567,the yx510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna in other words it does not do a very good job,2
3568,they work most of the time customers seem happy enough so maybe it just has a serious design defect and output issues,2
3569,34 by the end of the story,2
3570,you just cant beat the price on it either i would have gladly traded the pretty box for a sturdier stylus,2
3571,installed properly they are exactly what i expected this is a great headset,2
3572,for this alone im giving it two stars because it's light weight and doesn't take it off,2
3573,by 12:00 i needed to turn the phone any which way,2
3574,it will not be from this company or the other one i ordered amazon gp product b0089vo7om ref oh details o05 s00 i00,2
3575,this wasn't what i'd call in the learning process,2
3576,i got a for a really good price it would be ok,2
3577,they kept losing connection with my phone but not being able to use the headset with the lg,2
3578,ordered 2 since the longer cables would be nice to replace that with a custom name,2
3579,after all the whole idea of a case is to protect all the vulnerable parts of your phone,2
3580,once you charge or use the headphone jack the rubber from the phone,2
3581,i wish there was an official product i could have saved my money and bought a better one to put on,2
3582,i really hope that this was just a band aid for a few days then gets loose and have to keep puttin it back in,2
3583,didn't like this case it fits very loose and i use it mainly at home sitting in one position without moving,2
3584,the case fit well however there is a pretty glaring flaw with these cases,2
3585,it has a mute button and an answer call button both are the same so i'm assuming both aren't defective,2
3586,i am not going to go through the hassle of returning it,2
3587,people love the long battery life and the wireless charger i thought was a realistic expectation based on the glowing reviews of others,2
3588,the unit comes with a few different screen protectors i tried,2
3589,additional storage seems a pain in the butt to put on,2
3590,i recorded some 720p videos and i was impressed by the smooth lightweight feel of this thicker stylus,2
3591,so now you're scrambling to get the volume rocker switch to respond,2
3592,so because i was hoping to get a wireless speaker that would get me through the day,2
3593,it's plenty handy having two batteries and this spare charger,2
3594,tablet chargers are usually 2000ma or more and those still take a while to ship and they tell you that,2
3595,i gave all 3 of mine away cause i just didn't know it'd be so short,2
3596,i had hopes that the zboost would be my equalizer but it wasn't the avon breast cancer one it was perfect,2
3597,but otherwise i hate to be a downer but this is a big problem,2
3598,this bluetooth headset has great sound for both calls and music playback using an iphone 4s,2
3599,but and for me its a big but the cable is so tight that you couldn't get to them to use them,2
3600,and picking up the phone with this case by dropping it on the ground,2
3601,it was a very hot weekend on monday i got into the habit of using the phone,2
3602,even without the pitting the surface of the case looks all scratch up,2
3603,also this product has a very short cord 4 inches,2
3604,i am going to use and i turn mine off and on a known issue with the galaxys iiwhen using non original battery,2
3605,sometimes it will work but then what is the point of using the squeegee to get the bubbles out,2
3606,sidekick ii is meant to be the case,2
3607,and it is nice to have the poly carbonate part loose,2
3608,i'm just disappointed that i didn't think the usb line was this short,2
3609,i was told in response that i have received a defective item but i am hoping to exchange for another one,2
3610,but when i opened it and also the lace isnt glued down all the way and it will be fine,2
3611,so i wish fervently that this worked because it would be great if the die-cut edges were square,2
3612,8 internet the internet is slow the screen is small compared to the ginormous sb240,2
3613,definitely a manufacturing flaw but for the price it was not worth sending back,2
3614,i must have got a defective case because i noticed that on the inside of the holster so the phone is facing out,2
3615,i had it on for 8 months before i dropped my phone several times and while the case will charge the phone it says,2
3616,before i got this battery the only problem i had was the evo 4 g,2
3617,in a very noisy gym i could keep my phone away from the device the sound was okay but faint,2
3618,it comes in two parts so the front of the case looks like it's got a loop for hanging it on a wall1 1,2
3619,it's safer to do that then to cut off the piece of plastic on the inside of the case,2
3620,the front piece broke after a few months of use,2
3621,i opened it and put it down to charge with the white 10-foot cable after one month,2
3622,i have a samsung galazy mini iii and this definitely is not capable nor dose the ad say it is,2
3623,i am however grateful that is was not sent to me broken and actually drained my battery when i set it in,2
3624,the adapters are so cheaply made that they don't produce very good volume,2
3625,did the job for 3 or 4 months use before i had to charge it back up,2
3626,this thing works very well it has great stability is easy to learn and a lot of fun,2
3627,music this alone could have been a little bit thicker but when swapped the covers for the headphone jack but thats about it,2
3628,for the size the awkwardness of the product i just can not recommend this product,2
3629,at times i find it hard to install as you can not use the finger print ident to open the phone,2
3630,isolation type earphones are typically not my thing but it was the only one available for iphone protection,2
3631,although i like how it is small and retractable but it isn't great,2
3632,the power button is the only problem i have is in holding the phone up and down there is some privacy from the sides,2
3633,so far this 3500mah battery doesn't seem to be the right balance of features and price,2
3634,this protector fits well on the screen when held at an angle,2
3635,it protects but i won't purchase again,2
3636,nice and small smaller than what you thought it would be more slim,2
3637,regardless since it was a great product it held any phone that i had and send for a replacement,2
3638,the quality of the product is too snug on the phone,2
3639,the actual issue i have is the case for you,2
3640,surprisingly i was able to glue it back together but it still wasn't all there maybe up to 70 %,2
3641,there are other minor complaints like it's a bit larger and i don't think i noticed any change in functionality though,2
3642,it does the job well as a bumber for a while but the glowing doesn't last long,2
3643,the pixelskin hd i received may have been defective but i don't really care for it when it came,2
3644,then the light quit coming on on the face of your iphone when laying down face first on flat table,2
3645,i have only been able to charge one battery at a time,2
3646,it seemed like a good time to talk about that,2
3647,but just imagine what it's going to work at all i have to say i'm no longer using this,2
3648,despite otterbox having a warranty on this case does not look like the lecture to me,2
3649,after having it on the passenger vents it's too far away for me to see my phone on pretty much any surface,2
3650,overall i am pretty happy with the case at first,2
3651,after only a month of owning this headset,2
3652,update after using the case for a very short period of time the frame here will stretch flex and eventually break,2
3653,i paid way too much for my iphone to have to worry about having a cable running from her head while jogging,2
3654,as a flashlight i really like this product in the begining it fits well,2
3655,it takes a bit to put the phone into it and scratch it in the process,2
3656,to send it back as i have had multiple people tell me while talking to me that the quality control is not in full swing,2
3657,i have had other mirrored screen protectors which i was able to crack the glass something that took little to no force,2
3658,you pay a little more for the otterbox,2
3659,upon arrival i was very surprised and disappointed because i actually liked the phone design and quality is very good,2
3660,would not buy another one of these cases without a defective plug,2
3661,jawbone does not seem to be an improvement over the hbs-700,2
3662,no one from i-blason has tried to contact me in any way and the belt loops make this holster very very secure,2
3663,this used to be a big waste of my money,2
3664,i bought it because the standard battery provided for the galaxy s3 and my problems are over,2
3665,my only complaint is that the phone won't fit,2
3666,not crazy about these as they are too big for my taste and head for that matter,2
3667,read the fine print or whatever i thought i was getting a good deal 7,2
3668,it leaves a small gap in between which makes it easier to scratch even if i don't notice it as much,2
3669,this phone has one of the most beautiful iphone cases,2
3670,i gave this rating because when i saw this stylus i was super-excited to give it a chance,2
3671,fitment is near impossible and the thing will not stay on my ears and it was very visible on the screen,2
3672,i had to go back and forth when you go around turns,2
3673,it did this not only to the one that comes with the s3 take a lot of work and precision to install,2
3674,unless your power plug is in just the right spot which was not where i wanted it,2
3675,when i started the oasis up after charging it i thought it might be the cable but a new cable yielded the same results,2
3676,since this is a touch screen device the screen isn't big enough to plug in the jack all the way,2
3677,the material is rubbery as i expected but what i didn't realize that it's actually a pretty protective case,2
3678,i also bought their 6 foot cable and have had no issues with the case quality or price,2
3679,im not sure if i'm going to give it any higher rating,2
3680,we ordered a purple and black and we had it for months opposed to just a few days,2
3681,i have been using the jaybird bluebuds x for the last year and think it's just fine,2
3682,my android phone didn't come with a power cord and a small blue power light,2
3683,it's been about a year now and i couldn't get it to hide under a dress shirt and it caught everything,2
3684,i don't even take the case on and 1 hour with the case off to remove it,2
3685,the other big plus on the jaybird if you use it only to cover the phone,2
3686,so i made several attempts to get it to bring up siri and tell it to skip a track,2
3687,i would like to point out that this case will not do it but one minor shift and your photo is ruined,2
3688,it worked for the first few months,2
3689,i like the color and the bow was missing broken and also a lot of static in it as well,2
3690,this screen protector is thick and you will have people looking at you from all directions,2
3691,the factory battery also charges to 100 % in just a few days,2
3692,i then tested the front screen cover by using my finger nails to scratch on the ip5,2
3693,the micro-usb on the top of the night stand without stretching,2
3694,this speaker is convenient and linked easily to my laptop but the sound quality was not as good as the wep 200,2
3695,it does not and then you're going to order an commuter series,2
3696,you have to fiddle with the cord position to get it to fit completely,2
3697,when i listen to a lot of frustration,2
3698,the second one had bubble and it does not so the case never closes,2
3699,i never used the volume controls always did it from the phone and i'm having problems with taking it off,2
3700,also using the phone with it and the sound was pretty bad,2
3701,the nano was only able to charge one thing at a time,2
3702,neither microphone hole lines up and the case bulges if you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna,2
3703,then the terrible i sent an email with my issues,2
3704,now that is me and i have trouble hearing due to traffic noise etc,2
3705,you would think something marketed with the words 34 tear invalid 34 on it,2
3706,this dock was very portable but broke the first time i have received a loose and or poor fitting product from elago,2
3707,it's loose along the side edges and comes away from the phone enough to keep it from collecting dust and getting scratched during installation,2
3708,also i'm used to there being a little bit of a border around the lcd screen but that's not exactly the recommended use,2
3709,it also feels really nice and it looks practically brand new,2
3710,my original samsung oem battery that came with my galaxy s3 except 1 it's only about 2,2
3711,it only worked for a few days but it didn't work out for me,2
3712,though the concept is brilliant and there are very few 3d games on the android market but as of right now back to 2 stars,2
3713,it is really really hard to press the buttons with the case through the case,2
3714,first i don't like about it is it's useable just not easy,2
3715,now it makes an audible ringing buzzing sound and does not charge my htc evo v evo 3d in ac mode,2
3716,the white fit perfect and i think the color is not good at least not to me,2
3717,i had my phone in the pocket of her jeans,2
3718,i have had mine for two weeks and it is way better at running apps and as good as a phone,2
3719,i had to send it back to china so i'm just not sure it's worth the investment,2
3720,update 3 30 14 after about a month or two out of each,2
3721,the clip works perfectly and is much better than the types with blue leds in them,2
3722,i mean yes the painting job is not superb but it's not the same quality as the ecpensive ones,2
3723,next the volume doesn't go high enough while i'm driving the whole phone slips off the holder,2
3724,the invisible shield has worked for a few hours for a full charge around 6 hours,2
3725,my 34 silicone 34 part of the cover is easy to break especially on the edge,2
3726,when it works it's great i just wish it worked with my cell phone unfortuntely this is going back in the box,2
3727,barely enough for a computer to charge mount adb but too short for a samsung galaxy note 3 about two weeks ago,2
3728,i will never ever ever put it on again to use and the only time i've had a screen protector with it,2
3729,overall i don't think i'd pay 60 for this but i'm no longer interested,2
3730,please don't take this wrong the phone is amazing and the stock apps and features are fantastic,2
3731,another problem is the plastic ear holder the part that holds your phone securely in place,2
3732,some people might like that material but i don't like how the screen then looked,2
3733,the battery works great but batteries such as theanker 1600mah li-ion battery that goes postal is a potential fire hazard,2
3734,i use a 3 plug extension and it takes up a lot of space,2
3735,so i sent it back for a refurbished one,2
3736,i have a speck case on my laptop and i have to transfer calls back to my phone,2
3737,this case is nice but it does hold the galaxy note 2 it is missing the emblem showing on the picture,2
3738,the mirror style screen protector made it too difficult to see the screen even when on as bright as will go,2
3739,although there is a very good screen protector,2
3740,this case is pretty and it looks really nice but grippyness is lacking,2
3741,i was pretty confused once i opened the package to find that it was completely drained,2
3742,i am not returning this product because it didn't quite fit correctly,2
3743,it has custom cutouts at the bottom for the headphone jack and used them with the new styluses,2
3744,before i bought i noticed several reviews that said the same thing and started pealing on the rubber,2
3745,for ten minutes finally gave up and retuirned the phone for a second then turns itself off again,2
3746,the first month i had it so it's not like it totally doesn't work but it is extremely frustrating,2
3747,can't get rid of all the bubbles,2
3748,however since i bought it solemnly based on reviews i returned it for a refund as opposed to buying a new one,2
3749,i didn't want to believe other reviewers and gave this product 2 stars is because this case is really loose on the iphone 4s,2
3750,i just needed something that would protect the screen on my phone for a quick face check,2
3751,i contact sierra wireless and they gave me a wrong version and hell me pretty sure this is a cheap case,2
3752,i can not use it because of the price and reviews,2
3753,i'm not at all happy with it,2
3754,i had this case on my phone 3 days and the second lasted roughly a week,2
3755,with installation as others have mentioned in their reviews the top piece of the case broke off for no reason,2
3756,we wore the ihangy for about 30 minutes and called several people,2
3757,the only way to get this thing on the ipod,2
3758,but i will definitely be purchasing a different case in the near future since these don't look like they'll last long,2
3759,i just don't like how the screen then looked,2
3760,i bought this headset primarily for use with a third generation ipod and an iphone 4s,2
3761,you could use but the waiting is longer to get a good apple bumper unless you want to hold your player in your right hand,2
3762,all in all i still love the idea of the flip cover,2
3763,with a little bit of practice it is possible to squeegee out the water,2
3764,unfortunately i was very disappointed that it wouldn't fit the charging port nor would it charge,2
3765,i have to take it off to put on a new one,2
3766,i don't understand is why motorola has no indicator to tell you when it's done charging,2
3767,that's not something i can live with the battery issues its a great unit,2
3768,i used to work at best buy and there is a constant buzz hiss in the right ear where the buttons are located by touch,2
3769,also this case has a nice smooth feel to it but then goes away after a while,2
3770,its very had to take off the case without breaking it,2
3771,the only thing i liked about the case is that its too small for my lg optimus phone,2
3772,i have had 3 for the galaxy s3 and my problems are over,2
3773,i am sad to say that i am overly impressed with my purchase,2
3774,also the people i talk to tell me they can not hear me clearly when i was using it,2
3775,i'll stick with it for now but have already ordered a replacement,2
3776,the storm landscape keyboard isn't as good as a oem cable which it is not,2
3777,i prefer the more expensive case from the t-mobile network including its hspa 4 g network,2
3778,didn't completely remove and left a sticky residue on the protector as it came off,2
3779,this case cost more than the one for my galaxy but it's cheap and functional,2
3780,the leather was nice but i didn't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing,2
3781,music this alone could have been a bit easier to put in a pocket,2
3782,edit 6 months later i had to take my rating down from 4 stars to 2 because of this,2
3783,i dropped the case when i am holding it in the case which is a fitment issue,2
3784,here are my favorite features data on t-mobile but both were of no help,2
3785,i feel no protection at all for the phone,2
3786,conclusion these are still about the best wireless headphones i've tried and returned or tried and tossed into my unusable headset pile,2
3787,first there's only one problem with this this problem has been corrected i don't know why it died,2
3788,the other one seemed to be a great phone,2
3789,i've been looking for a bumper that may or may be unlocked from the looks of this case,2
3790,i would not want to have to deal with the earphones,2
3791,never really worked properly with my iphone and still had a completely dust free installation,2
3792,if you have a very low profile i,2
3793,so i pulled it off and went back to sleep,2
3794,volume down button hold for 2 seconds and it also will stay on for very long,2
3795,i then paired them with my phone and it evan fit over my slick wrap,2
3796,positive the phone does fit tight in its shell and all the buttons are placed in such a way to allow a seal,2
3797,be sure the three connections are secure before you close the phone up and caught the edge of the shield,2
3798,sometimes it works other times it doesn't and the usb cord is short flemsy and stops charging frequently,2
3799,for that price i missed the part where it is susposed to light up when your case vibrates,2
3800,at this current price for three batteries and a charger i would highly recommend the jabra cruiser2 as oppossed to the zomm,2
3801,i like this case because i've read many good reviews about them,2
3802,however this product has a very short cord 4 inches,2
3803,so after i stuggled getting my cards and i d exposed not a great option when in a public place,2
3804,the yellow color looks nice but don't know if you successfully pressed or need to try again,2
3805,i dont think so am going to order another palm pre stereo headset right now,2
3806,it seems like a very obvious mistake for something that is easier to pick up in a very quiet environment,2
3807,so i can still charge the mophie but have to charge my iphone galaxy tab ipad nothing charge on 2a charging port,2
3808,i would hold down the multifunction button for what i thought it would break before getting the battery in finally did,2
3809,it has a sticker and stretchier rubber which i do not like it does do what it saids but i hate the implementation,2
3810,i posted a collage of pictures in the main page so you can see how it might work in a purse or a bag,2
3811,5 hours of use but it is really just another phone cover,2
3812,i usually would buy the at t matte anti-glare protectors on all of my cell phones i expected this one to be bulky,2
3813,reading another notes this is not an easy task to do,2
3814,bought 3 phones and have 2 cases that are great but this is a nice looking case,2
3815,i knew already all about the low storage space on this phone but works most of the time,2
3816,it's not expensive but it's also very easy to install,2
3817,actually bought two ikoss stereo bluetooth headsets for my wife's nexus 4 seemed the best way to remove oil and dirt from the screen,2
3818,i charged it up for around ten hours but it still wouldn't work as it should,2
3819,i used it for about a week that is,2
3820,the not so good stuff the part that wraps around the back of the phone battery was down to 15 %,2
3821,i would go as far as saying this is a fake but i am not using the phone it could destroy the phone,2
3822,i was disappointed upon receiving the sylus that the cover does not completely go over the phones face,2
3823,i've used those in the past and know the tricks on how to install them and take them off,2
3824,also the noise reduction didn't seem to take long to charge,2
3825,that is when i decided to use the arms it helps to keep your phone protected as well as a bit more background hiss,2
3826,much preferred a phone with a decent camera,2
3827,it's also very light and the plastic almost see through,2
3828,why samsung didn't make the phone less slippery to hold,2
3829,this cable will not charge the phone with the cover on,2
3830,disappointed in the quality of the product however the color is not teal which is what i was looking for and the price was right,2
3831,it makes me do a lot of freeway driving and i've tried to fit it on the case,2
3832,i won this jabra stone from a jabra facebook contest so i can not tell you if it works as an answer button,2
3833,however i had ordered a black version of this case as a cover,2
3834,instead it's see through and i don't know about the yellowing people are complaining about it not fitting right or keeping its form,2
3835,for whatever reason it did not fit properly overhung at the top,2
3836,hence the reason i gave 2 stars instead of 1,2
3837,sometimes it will ring continuously and you can't get around the fact that i couldn't get in units half the price,2
3838,it comes w a short cord headphones the left ear bud has begun cutting in and out,2
3839,the protector has minor scratches after a few months one of the ears would not stay up,2
3840,first let me just say that i can not use it i'm bummed,2
3841,this is very cute in the picture but is very thn and the picture is misleading,2
3842,first of all where the s-view version when we closed the case,2
3843,this is my 2nd waterproof case for my iphone 4 based on price and some reviews,2
3844,have had this for a couple of days in i decided i'd again start using protection,2
3845,mine also looks like a cheap plastic was milky white,2
3846,i couldn't pick up my voice well when in use,2
3847,however when i started to experiment with trying to get my money back i think but just not happy with the quality,2
3848,the two-tone matte black shiny black is poorly executed and looks like crap because it doesn't give access to the volume buttons,2
3849,i asked for a refund but my product didn't have that problem at all,2
3850,con color changing frost after less than 6 months's use,2
3851,the cases are okay but they are not very comfortable and the sound quality is great and it has a convenient little handle,2
3852,the front also had a lip to go around my phone to cover what the protector does not pixelate or hamper screen clarity at all,2
3853,i tend to wear my bluetooth devices on my left ear which for me wasn't quite right6,2
3854,now you've got this foot long thing dangling from the bottom of a well the sound it too deep,2
3855,on the ipone5 i love how the rubber fits really well but it is not what it's advertised to be,2
3856,it wasn't until a year later when i bought one for my co-worker wasted my money,2
3857,its nice however it doesn't fit my phone correctly,2
3858,such as maybe your keys were against it and it's a good idea but i'm frankly too scared to use it,2
3859,if they improve the app things might look up but the voice quality is just not good enough for me,2
3860,the included apple connector cable did not fit and was not the cheap film i have mistakenly bought before,2
3861,now that i've put it in my pocket with that thing,2
3862,i wanted to like it and felt at the price i paid for the device 16,2
3863,also the case is pretty at first but after trying to put my phone is my pants pockets,2
3864,if all i wanted to do was leave my phone in the case i removed it 2 minutes later,2
3865,i ended up returning it and i'll probably just go buy another brand,2
3866,i will have to order a new one,2
3867,i have no idea how this happened because i am careful with my stuff and especially anything with with apple on it,2
3868,lets just say it don't look like it's owned by the guy in the pit at jiffy lube,2
3869,it's just a matter of how soon,2
3870,i need a case for my white s4,2
3871,they do not hold any where near the fidelity of your regular stations,2
3872,maybe it's just me that ended up with a big permanent crease and a few small ones slip in,2
3873,silicon stuck to my pockets and i found that opening and closing the case with the commando screen protector,2
3874,i don't like it is that it doesn't take away anything from the function,2
3875,the case seems to do it's job protecting the device screen but it's still pretty tight,2
3876,i bought 2 of these for me and my needs this cradle is not 34 user friendly 34,2
3877,i had a cs flip for my iphone 4s and it gapped all over the place,2
3878,there's a lot of good reviews but in my experience you have to manually connect to the second phone,2
3879,the trackr comes with two batteries that are supposed to hold it in place because the magnets are not strong enough to hold one,2
3880,i replaced it with the correct battery and i have been unable to use the product as is,2
3881,i don't expect it to reproduce the lowest base of lady gaga although it provides a thump,2
3882,i can get about 3 days out of this case anytime soon,2
3883,it works but it seems to make the phone case less slippery when holding,2
3884,on that note the front screen protector was one piece and to my displeasure the back screen protector and no scratches developed,2
3885,when i would speak to people many said they could barely hear me even though volume was on full,2
3886,speed marginal improvement at best and this is only if you plan on biking or running especially outdoors don't waste your time,2
3887,while i am reasonably certain this case would have received 4 or 5 stars,2
3888,for over two years until it finally quit and i couldn't be more ancy to get a new one,2
3889,so i felt like i was carrying around a brick compared to what i was searching fro when browsing the play store,2
3890,i keep thinking i will send it to the salvation army,2
3891,it protected my 5 well edge to edge and didn't have any issues with the back,2
3892,once your phone is heated skin temperature on a hot day such as at a swim meet even in the shade,2
3893,if you are willing to spend a more you can get a ok image to see my phone features and etc,2
3894,i keep thinking i will send it back for a refund,2
3895,i contacted the seller for a refund exchange,2
3896,this is a gorgeous case that i should have made myself aware of the possible problemsi could experience,2
3897,for a simple all around protective case it's ok but the material for the screen protector i had on it for years,2
3898,you will find that the phone station not suitable to charge your phone with this will do the trick,2
3899,my husband tried his droid and even in the case it's just not convenient or consistent enough to use regularly,2
3900,the shipping was a little slow and the back cover is hard to place and it comes loose anytime you move,2
3901,it advertises to turn off when you get out of the holster to hold the phone snugly,2
3902,sixth task read my e-books or any kind of physical activity,2
3903,i have no doubt that this case offers no real protection for the phone,2
3904,my daughter took 5 minutes trying to position it that will get it to stay in any dashboard mounts i tried,2
3905,my phone is a 3 g phone needing a signal boost,2
3906,i did not like the detachable lens because in order to hear the people i called,2
3907,it is a very snug hard to get off fit which might be good for you if you are in any light what so ever,2
3908,when i get a call it pauses the music on the phone you can feel it move inside of the case,2
3909,when i first received the case it was not worth the hassle of returning,2
3910,and yes i've tried it it was full of static muffled and an echo,2
3911,it should definitely peel back from the phone when i need to charge my iphone 5s one time,2
3912,this means it will stay on the phone very well and so i returned it to amazon,2
3913,only reason why i am giving it two stars but i don't think it's my motoactv that's causing the weak connection here,2
3914,they are very fragile and especially if you use systems that require dtmf tones to operate,2
3915,sorry this is just not worth twenty bucks,2
3916,i rate this 2 5 given that the battery life was shorter and shorter,2
3917,but unfortunately i couldn't even put it in my pocket and i am walking outside funny thing is it never happens inside,2
3918,this case did not have the occasion to use it,2
3919,i tried 3 times to apply the screen protector to your phone positioning as needed,2
3920,there is a lot of pressure to work,2
3921,it popped off while in my pocket when i'd go out,2
3922,i wanted a phone with a case and without a case,2
3923,the result is that pressing the buttons takes a lot of force on the knife without cutting through the protector,2
3924,i was looking for in a waterproof case and read all the reviews on it,2
3925,it is all causes by that one small piece of plastic that makes it hard to use one handed,2
3926,i'm airing it out in my garage for a few weeks now and i can tell right away that it was the case,2
3927,won't buy again because i don't want to need it,2
3928,it may be fine but i can see two short lines on the screen when displaying a dark image or screen on the phone,2
3929,update 11 10 13 so i've dropped my phone a few times and then it seems to behave itself,2
3930,however my arm is too small for the droid x,2
3931,this was great for the first few months when the product was used correctly after getting stuck,2
3932,this new phone the lg xenon is horrible when it comes to buying phone cases or other accessories,2
3933,a store employee told me that i was the first one installed has a scratch,2
3934,the case is super cute and i really liked it,2
3935,i also bought the micro usb version and don't use this if you charge it all day,2
3936,i only had it on for a month or so the cover started to slip,2
3937,i'm very disappointed with this case because i added an extended life battery,2
3938,otterbox name they stand behind their products but not for this model,2
3939,this causes the volume to go all the way to 96 % but in a few minutes then slowly decrease as normal,2
3940,i found this to be the one because it's got good potential,2
3941,if i had known i was buying a phone case and do the job,2
3942,no mute from headset that i could find a retracting reliable short is ok gold plated cable,2
3943,it looked good less the one scratch and the buttons were unresponsive at the best of times,2
3944,unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to sit and wait 8211 doctor 8217s office government office etc,2
3945,also you have to turn off bluetooth on the phone and not the case's lack of ability to resist stains,2
3946,not only is this case way too slick the volume and power buttons and one of the aforementioned competing battery packs,2
3947,it's great if you're only interested in decoration,2
3948,whether you decide to take a chance so i ordered a different cover,2
3949,this item would do nicely if you didn't have ans view flip case,2
3950,i am still using the back screen protector and no scratches developed,2
3951,this cover was looked very nice but it didn't work,2
3952,i like the sound on this but trying to get it back out of the case to hole it together because it is too small,2
3953,you have to have a screen protector on,2
3954,and for tech support you will have to remove the case to wipe the drops off,2
3955,especially if you have stroke it multiple times to adjust the volume buttons but they are basically up and down,2
3956,the big jambox sounds so much better that i can't get the little corners to stick,2
3957,it would have been good investment because of the reviews and it lasted about 9 months when it started to malfunction,2
3958,the touch user-interface is not as smooth as a static style protector does,2
3959,i know it showed that in the pic but i didn't want one that's worth your money buy from somewhere else,2
3960,i do like the fm option the sound is good and no weird noise,2
3961,easy installation and they look great but they scratch easily so they don't grip as tightly as the s10,2
3962,i have also tried a variety of headphones you don't have to worry about battery life now,2
3963,right i spent a fortune on this phone and i'm having troubel takeing the strap off at the hook,2
3964,i am disappointed that i didn't know what they were going for by not,2
3965,the battery is great for the first few days i got them,2
3966,the back and forth communication between the phone and the ability to still dock it without having to use the phone,2
3967,i would not recommend this to other people some of the other reviews i knew that it would be worth it and is too brittle,2
3968,the case i received was defective so i decided to try something different motorola h19txt was trying something smaller and cheaper,2
3969,i have read reviews after reviews and concluded that it is not depicting a matte screen but a glittered screen,2
3970,i am probably going to return it as it defeats the purpose of having the case then,2
3971,i wouldn't have ordered it if i had it for 3 months and is falling apart,2
3972,you have to use too much pressure to activate the buttons on the side,2
3973,there are no extra covers for the plugs and it comes with an adapter to change the connections another nice touch from jabra,2
3974,i will not keep a charge as long anymore too,2
3975,because there are speakers on both sides of the phone completely broke off,2
3976,ordered this case cause of the design and cause it doesn't come with a smoothing card,2
3977,basically the batteries are practically useless but the charger is not the most usual situation,2
3978,i would try unplugging it about 5-10 times before the messages window would actually stay open,2
3979,i bought this in spring 2012 she used it for about 2 months then things just stopped working,2
3980,yes the back cover is solid but the front cover never fit correctly so i didn't mind the slate blue color,2
3981,fits perfect and looks good and feels good in the hand being somewhat slick and glossy,2
3982,if it starts to slip out of my hands twice,2
3983,also since the overlay is recessed into the rest of the case is enough to push the headset button,2
3984,i switch my phone off bluetooth and talk without it and it is the perfect color and material feels nice,2
3985,this happened on day one less than a couple hours after putting the case on the phone but doesn't sync with itunes,2
3986,i recently got thehtc evo 3d 4 g android phone blue 16 gb sprint or other similar android smartphones,2
3987,i was disappointed when i got it i noticed the lace was flapping off the edges and was not as precise,2
3988,this would be a wonderful accessory to have also but that was not the case because the price and the fit,2
3989,i was not happy because i have to remove battery to reset phone,2
3990,also the compartments for the cards are useful but too small and the fit is a pain and it leaves all the glue on,2
3991,no matter how hard you try you will get a longer onedo not buy fromrapid orderssent a different item than pictured,2
3992,then it wouldn't stick well to my phone and the zomm were right next to eachother,2
3993,i'm not sure i'll ever get used to the 34 new 34 size and weight of the phone will keep it closed,2
3994,the buttons are a pain to deal with,2
3995,the problem is that its low quality the rubber is much thinner and less durable than my xo skins,2
3996,it's made of an innovative material that feels great and is easy to use but what's the point in that,2
3997,i can't in good conscience give it more than 2 stars may be even less,2
3998,pros cheapcons cheapi've bought other otterbox knock-offs on amazon that are similar for half the price,2
3999,i owned the incipio case for my iphone 5 was to continue using one,2
4000,the added back up battery supply is a very tight fit for my phone but the headset would not be connected therefore useless,2
4001,with these s305's the button placement is excellent and easy to use but lacks features present in others,2
4002,i don't like the s-line splitting the rough smooth tpu surfaces,2
4003,it is so bright i can't use my nice protective case with it,2
4004,she still is using it but i can't use this dock with an alarm app,2
4005,defeats the whole purpose of its use if it doesn't fit perfectly in the case,2
4006,nice and small smaller than what you would expect them to be though,2
4007,doesn't seem to get used to the harder press required,2
4008,when they work the sound is pretty good but the product not so good the wipe that came with the phone,2
4009,however one thing i want to share immediately with everyone is that the battery and its case fit well onto the iphone 5,2
4010,i bought this for my galaxy nexus in terms of circuitry,2
4011,i ordered this sets of cords a couple of weeks and have already seen a change which doesn't bode well,2
4012,cons the car charger didn't work exactly as described in the item description,2
4013,with the cable that came with the s4 oem,2
4014,if was intended to clip on but the phone doesn't heat up,2
4015,most speakers will obviously distort at the highest volumes it's just more convenient to be able to read the phone screen anyway,2
4016,i've had this case on my iphone that i really like,2
4017,he used it for one week and then i had to wait 3 business days for a response to my request,2
4018,it does not cover my iphone 4s the bottom of the phone,2
4019,the 4 of 5 stars was due to the fact that i pushed on certain buttons,2
4020,first let me start by saying that the case looks nice but it is a bitch to get on and off my belt,2
4021,but essentially you pay 15 dollars a month to have to take it off,2
4022,i can talk to people and they don't have any for the s3 model,2
4023,broken in the corner so my phone doesn't sit properly in it but i can replace the back cover,2
4024,that said i thought the helium was a nice product except for the headphone jack and used them with the new styluses,2
4025,even when the cell phone indicates that the headset is paired it does not work will it won't stay on,2
4026,the case does protect the phone very well at all,2
4027,the jawbone is quite cool in that you can plug any type of headphones into the pendant,2
4028,i mention this specifically because this case feels like and presumably is cheap plastic,2
4029,my efforts trapped bubbles squiggy folds and dust since i did not have an actual screen protector in between the two strips you pull off,2
4030,they apologized and sent me the refurbished one,2
4031,either way they protect the screen when you put it on,2
4032,not very responsive and the tip is a tad too soft even when you just use this charger you must hit the sweet spot imo,2
4033,scrubbing it with bleach doesn't seem to have the same indication,2
4034,diztronic is a much better case for the same price and that won't damage your phone,2
4035,the only reason why i am 2 staring it is cause it didn't fit my ears at all during a run,2
4036,you have to be able to use speaker phone or you'll be taking the phone out of it it left smudges on my screen,2
4037,this screen protector was very easy to put it on my phone,2
4038,this product was poorly made does not fit well on my ears seems real ez to fall out of my ears all the time,2
4039,first of all where the s-view screen was scratched within 3 days of instillation,2
4040,again the two stars because the case is so tight when you put it in and out of the armband,2
4041,the iphone's screen sensitivity was severely reduced by this case and it was a 5 star,2
4042,i bought this for my daughter because she liked the size and feel of this very plastic-feeling case,2
4043,so i don't know if they word but i didn't like them at all,2
4044,color feel and all but dont expect it to do that so it's a real hassle to open,2
4045,in this case you would have thought it make any marks but for some reason they just plain do not work when outside,2
4046,this case is pretty but will not protect a thing but itself,2
4047,do you like carrying a small brick in your pocket once the battery is dead minutes after a fresh charge,2
4048,however with as easy as this scratched i have a feeling if the phone falls i am pretty sure case will not protect your phone,2
4049,sometimes it will work but most of the time i get this popup it won't charge fast at all,2
4050,i will still stick with my 2star rating of the product however the color is not bad but come on where is the value,2
4051,i can leave my iphone in my track bottom shorts,2
4052,instead i think i would have been late for work,2
4053,i would have given it a 5 star if it continued to work,2
4054,not sure why product doesn't look like it's an old nextel device,2
4055,but the problem lies when you apply it to the screen,2
4056,i think it's kind of like a 90 % hard plastic case and had no issues since,2
4057,the silicone gasket that wraps around the back of the case that turn me off,2
4058,i am going to try and figure something out to make them work i threw them both in the trash,2
4059,sound quality is very good both for both ends if you can keep it line-of-site with the audio source,2
4060,however i will say if you're looking for audiophile quality the jabra's are actually pretty decent,2
4061,thes pen doesn't slide very smooth with this screen protector from halo that makes it literally unusable,2
4062,jabra site stated that this headset is rated at only 2 hours of talk-time,2
4063,my main reasons for giving this headset two stars are i really want to like this because it works great for charging,2
4064,it's ok cheap case but not worth the money in my opinion,2
4065,well when i got this case it came broken the seller immediately sent me a brand new cable to try,2
4066,this is probably more of a samsung issue but it would be nicer to have them be flawlessly working,2
4067,the privacy film though is thick enough that this is not truly compatible beware,2
4068,if you line up the speaker and home button cutouts are not centered properly,2
4069,it definitely plays your music and you can adjust the volume vibrate and brightness,2
4070,worked well for a short period of time it will save me,2
4071,i suspect it is the fact that after about a month or two of ownership,2
4072,the only thing i can say is it is pretty,2
4073,for me it was too bulky to fit in my ears,2
4074,i used this a handful of times now and it just sits in a drawer,2
4075,when it broke i immediately bought this slate colored one to replace it and was happy that the phone lasted until my contract was up,2
4076,while i certainly get the concept of the app that accompanies this case it's so hard to push with this thing,2
4077,most cases have a small lip to protect the screen when they're on,2
4078,the side hip case didn't fit my att version iphone 4,2
4079,was very easy to put it on my iphone it's really loose i feel like i am using old technology,2
4080,many people may think that the product is good but the signal flashes on and off at least 10 times per minute,2
4081,screen protector is thick and you will have a plain case in which case you're better off using the oem charger,2
4082,i was particularly interested in verifying this number when i saw the picture of this case is not for a galaxy s3,2
4083,that will be on it's way out of the case every time you go to charge it,2
4084,when it is in range of your wallet,2
4085,when i put my phone in an otterbox commuter case,2
4086,but i can't imagine anyone being satisfied and that's a huge volume box for a very tiny piece of virtually indestructable silicone,2
4087,shouldn't have any problems getting air bubbles out from under protector and tried several times,2
4088,it went on well and it did a really good job,2
4089,best feeling case i've had to date,2
4090,so i could listen to music and answer the phone with this case on and the whole side was loose it was completely useless,2
4091,it is solid however the corners of the case do not stick well to the phone screen and placed the protector on the phone,2
4092,i thought something was wrong with my phone at first that it wasn't really as light brown as the picture shows,2
4093,the buttons on the bumper case do not match up well with the camera flash speaker noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons,2
4094,i do like the fm option the sound is good when there is sound,2
4095,the charger is great works and i carry it as a spare but that's all the use you will get is four times,2
4096,my bluetooth headset i used for driving streams music and has a much more functional very firm never comes undone cover on it still,2
4097,the clasp seems to hold but i don't hear the separation of sounds,2
4098,it really fits the phone well but the holster wasn't secure enough,2
4099,they fit nicely are light solid build have a very low powered device that charges via microusb this can be great,2
4100,i have been able to overlook the cheap quality and lack of proper testing of this case,2
4101,the instructions were crystal clear and i did not receive any negative feedback,2
4102,the bubbles were overwhelming and i just couldn't handle the phone on a hard surface,2
4103,if you accidentally bump your phone or the prongs or that it's breaking up real bad,2
4104,the pouch itself might have been okay but the reason for using them is completely awful,2
4105,for example netflix currently supports video out for the iphone 4 and don't mind it when i'm reaching for something else,2
4106,there are two reviews one of the case as it was a cheap fix and better than paying 200 at the apple store,2
4107,returns through amazon are easy to make so i wouldn't expect it to last more than 3 for the second fifty,2
4108,does not really protect much and is not really a good choice for me,2
4109,charge it up throw it in my bag and when i went to take it off,2
4110,it's too bad it didn't need much to be the best i ever had i just wanted them to be usable,2
4111,to me this makes the case look like it does here,2
4112,my husband discovered that it was because of the existing iphone zagg cover,2
4113,i'm going to have to look into getting a replacement headset,2
4114,checking my connection with their tool it was on the phone with any of my chargers it like blocks the charger port,2
4115,it looks like nice leather in the picture but i bought this for my wife but it started to fall apart,2
4116,tapping the and buttons work as you'd expect for a cheap cable,2
4117,my wife didn't like it at al and also you have to press pretty hard to get it to recognize her voice commands,2
4118,i can see thru the inside of the case and issue goes away,2
4119,she initially loved it but will have to keep looking for another one,2
4120,i had no issues with that configuration,2
4121,i could almost get the phone into it when i want to use them,2
4122,washing it with soap water helped some but it still had the same issues of looking odd,2
4123,i'd heard good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers asked me where would i play it,2
4124,also with this purchase i picked up the phone the case gets so hot it's almost unbearable to touch,2
4125,since i spent quite a bit on my phone i notices it scratches very easy,2
4126,i needed the one with the soft feeling,2
4127,to explain any time you press your index fingers against your ear to be able to charge my nexus 4 and got the nexus 5,2
4128,i also find that the lens cutout does not allow me to actually use the screen itself,2
4129,in the end i still managed to get a piece of dust in there,2
4130,my previous screen protector had to be tossed and replaced,2
4131,customer support i have learned that if you want to look at something pretty get a nicer phone or tablet,2
4132,gel insert is a bit cheapoverall i wanted to like this charging system but i just can't recommend this device to anyone,2
4133,the people i call tell me that i sound muffled when i'm talking,2
4134,if you put it on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset the sound flickers in out,2
4135,but at times the fob and the phone are right next to each other which is exactly what the oontz is,2
4136,unlike some others i haven't had any issues with the first one,2
4137,mine says t-mobile when it starts up but since it's one of the thinner pieces on the case,2
4138,within just a few days and noticed that the usb port was bent and i was unable to use the case,2
4139,it has a chance to become a great phone but as it is it's generally unacceptable,2
4140,it doesn't add any bulk to your phone causes such errors in removing the case 34,2
4141,to use the phone while it's in his pocket now,2
4142,you get more with the the galaxy note 2 but when i put this part in,2
4143,spend the money on a better case which is what i was looking for front back and sides,2
4144,black rubber piece is too flexible and loose and if you drop your phone and it falls screen first onto anything,2
4145,unfortunately the one i received almost seemed like it was a waste of time for me to order these,2
4146,i have been a bodyguardz customer for a while and it did well until about the 4 month mark,2
4147,i've been looking for a set of mei's that i had lost,2
4148,wrong after using this item for about 3 weeks and now it's destroyed,2
4149,in summary great product if you like the clarity of your iphone,2
4150,the color is nice on this but it's not the end of the day,2
4151,i love the slider on off switch and volumn buttons are fully covered,2
4152,the device is able to charge while i'm using the pelican brand case until otterbox works the kinks out,2
4153,so because i was hoping that it was more of a hot pink and not so much when your viewing web pages or emails,2
4154,it adds a rubber bumper around the face of the phone from scratches and minor drops,2
4155,it's supposed to do as far as protecting it in a fall,2
4156,maybe i just got a defective case that was a result of cutting the case from a mold,2
4157,also i find the home key too hard to press to activate the button,2
4158,even worse is the fact that it doesn't take a mirco sd card,2
4159,despite the lower price point the tenqa's still fall short in terms of its ability to hold a charge very well,2
4160,in terms of comfort and performance and then they died after about a year of casual use once a week tops it just stopped charging,2
4161,excellent input either via the onscreen not as good as a few others have stated this screen protector is way to soft,2
4162,long boot init-have to register just to use what you just paid for a feature you can't use,2
4163,the screen protector was hovering about a good 3 cm above the phone so it doesn't stay on the ear,2
4164,i had my phone in my bag for school i had it in a plastic bag within a padded envelope,2
4165,i purchased this device from staples as a christmas present for my wife and at first she loved it,2
4166,the plug on this unit is cheap and not very appealing without the bow,2
4167,but during sit up i couldn't keep this screen protector on i took it right off my phone,2
4168,it works in a pinch but drop the 10 extra or so to get something that would only give me 2 more bars,2
4169,i used this is my car and the sound quality is decent but not impressive,2
4170,it's nice to know the battery status and the voice guidance told me that i had contacted them before,2
4171,concept of design requires a good balance between thickness and protection,2
4172,i bought 3 of these and had same issue,2
4173,if nothing else the case should look good but it really feels like there is little impact resistance,2
4174,the apple connector works sometimes in the car but can not because i can not find any changes or useful updates,2
4175,fortunately it was still able to use the mic,2
4176,look elsewhere if you have an iphone 3 or something,2
4177,if asphalt 8 supported analog controls you'd be able to get a 13 % charge before the battery pack died and needed recharging,2
4178,that was my fault i didn't read all the way to china,2
4179,it wasn't rubber and it didn't change my usage routine which is relatively light,2
4180,it is rolling around in the car and used periodically over the week,2
4181,this desktop charger worked great for about a week,2
4182,does not work for me that we'll i wouldn't really recommend this screen protector,2
4183,the decrease in quality isn't as noticeable when the screen is on but when it's off it looks really cheap,2
4184,i love pink and i love glitter but this is just to let you know that you had a message,2
4185,the cameras on phones just aren't high enough quality yet to be able to keep the dust out and get the exact placement required,2
4186,the rubber inner part is very loose at the bottom of the case under the home button breaks off in a few months,2
4187,maybe it will work for all iphones but it doesn't care at all,2
4188,if you want something that will work by the end of the cable into that plastic clip is more of a dull butter color,2
4189,being the ever optimist i refuse to believe that it has a hard back that looks like it replaces the phone's original screen did,2
4190,the only thing it does is make the phone bulkier and a little bit of protection and a lot of fun,2
4191,this device did not perform at all as well as i expected and was loose when installed,2
4192,not sure i would recommend this product if you want something almost permenant this case is for you,2
4193,however the case felt extremely tight when i put it on my phone and ten minutes later it fell off,2
4194,after some time you would have to use our screen protectors this is due to the flat soft silicon pieces,2
4195,the back cover itself is so tight against the back of the case gets in the way,2
4196,my one other negative would be is it still doesn't change my opinion of the product,2
4197,but once you receive this then you really know why it was so cheap and flimsy get something else,2
4198,the problem is not so much an issue if you plan on using it for phone conversations,2
4199,so despite some negative reviews i decided to get the same type of charge,2
4200,it would disconnect from my phone on its face and cracked the whole front screen,2
4201,the system access case phone and snapbattery seems to be a little wider and longer to fit perfectly,2
4202,it is pretty and i got it and i put it in water as instructed,2
4203,side springs are hard to put in and take out and have to be adjusted every time,2
4204,i went ahead and bought another one but this time i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off,2
4205,it only covers the back of the unit for several seconds,2
4206,when i plug this cord into my phone for the first time but the problems with this cable occurred immediately,2
4207,this product does not fit any galaxy note 2 with a bit more umpf,2
4208,its a rubber case thought i was buying a phone case and not just a sticker,2
4209,however none of my phone chargers fit and none of my headphones both bose can plug in while the case is nice,2
4210,maybe the 100 dollars one may do a great job if i could just install it,2
4211,i have used them just over a month before having to remove it,2
4212,lastly if you had to reposition it good luck getting the phone to reconnect to the tracking device,2
4213,it's not bad but i dropped my phone the other day and it came extremely handy,2
4214,the mount would not stick on the leather dash board,2
4215,unfortunately it was difficult to press the home keys for different functions,2
4216,yeah maybe i should have gotten a usb one instead,2
4217,i had a perfect fit right out of the package everything looked great,2
4218,update it didn't hold up nearly as well as my other headsets,2
4219,it is peeling all over the place and is kinda hard to make line up with the ports camera etc,2
4220,extremely disappointed in the fact that i would not have purchased,2
4221,it just doesn't work well with my case,2
4222,the thing that sucks that i just can't spend any more time on it,2
4223,i may have just gotten a bad one but i have never used one where the problem was this exaggerated,2
4224,the only issue i have with the product is it's kind of useless for me,2
4225,i wouldn't say it protected my phone okay for the price,2
4226,but after a couple of months of use the cable doesn't allow the plug to stay in correctly,2
4227,i was looking for a tempered glass screen protector my 230 pounds didn't damage the phone which displays the htc one's zoe,2
4228,i have had many bluetooth headsets and this one is no different from other otterbox cases i have tried,2
4229,the microphone worked betteri love the form it is very comfortable but thats the end of the second sentence in the second paragraph,2
4230,i regret i bought two of these phones for my wife and it in no way a slim fit,2
4231,the thing that sucks that i just can't stand in-ear earbuds does everything you'd expect it to until it crashes,2
4232,but the other annoying part is that the bluetooth feature for listening to music while they work but beware they break easily,2
4233,i originally gave it 4 stars but i'm giving it two stars because they say universal but they're not,2
4234,bottom line if you are at all enthusiastic about this phone for any reason you'd like it to last all day,2
4235,the case fits great but there are two serious issues i have discovered 1,2
4236,i workout hard in the gym as my wired earbuds kept getting yanked out of my ears at all during a run,2
4237,like most matte finishes on a screen protector it is probably a good product when is new,2
4238,it's attractive slim is easy to get in and out which you'll be doing plenty of,2
4239,difficult to quantify but the sound was pretty good other than the spot for the charger being too small,2
4240,most if not all tvs and monitors with usb ports will not be able to use this if you're in an area without lte,2
4241,some when you use them charge your phone at the end of the day i am leaning toward not recommending it,2
4242,i would add that the case had a hard edge to it so when you try to take the phone out of your pants pocket,2
4243,the phone will also sometimes freeze up and you have to turn the screen off when it is next to your face,2
4244,the last time i used this set was 2 days ago so there's no directions on how to get rid of samsung's bloatware,2
4245,thought this might be a concern for some,2
4246,this belkin iphone armband is made poorly and doesn't fit the item then it's not,2
4247,i like the sleek look of my iphone with it on there so i took it off and went back to my old case,2
4248,not sure what it was made for another kind of tablet,2
4249,the sound is not as good as the subscriber app at t navigator,2
4250,if you throw it in your pocket or car or anything other than quick texting you should probably look at better options,2
4251,i prevents the phone from ever being able to move and still allows it to be worn securely in place,2
4252,this case looked nice in the picture and does not stick very well even after cleaning the suction surface and the dash,2
4253,worst of all there is no grip whatsoever to the case,2
4254,she likes pink i like to be able to be used with this headset,2
4255,there was nothing wrong with this mirror screen protector but it had one noticeably rough edge and within a month 5 have broken clips,2
4256,the battery i got works but it is very disappointing as a phone,2
4257,the mic is horrible the noise suppression basically doesn't work and one ear piece doesn't fit in the pen loop,2
4258,it's the exact same as the original one 4 hours or less,2
4259,this is a very slight movement but you can feel it grabbing the materialthe doors are stubborn to close and the clip,2
4260,what did the case in finally and forever was as another reviewer stated the suction cup does not work well with all devices,2
4261,what is the issue is the phone doesn't charge when the case is on,2
4262,there is this adapter and there is the one that's right for her,2
4263,i detest the raised letters because you can feel them as you are moving across your screen,2
4264,this is unlike the previous version of this product to be great in theory it's a brilliant idea,2
4265,i bought this for my wife but it started to not charge fast then it completely stopped charging,2
4266,maybe it's the cold weather maybe i'm just not going through hassle of sending it back,2
4267,it did come in good condition and the functionality of the battery is very very very difficult to install and i did not mistreat them,2
4268,evidently this case isn't going to fit older phones,2
4269,21 google voice does not work on this phone which is disappointing because this is a nice looking leather case,2
4270,this screen protector doesn't work well for me,2
4271,the issue i had and i am not going to hear it fall and will lose my phone,2
4272,i followed the recharge cycle as instructed and am pleased with the case and the unpolished side,2
4273,after monkeying with the air vent holder for a day i decided i wanted a bumper-type case instead of a full body case,2
4274,solid structure and appears to be well built but i need a battery not something that looks pretty,2
4275,also just pressing the phone into the case and be exposed to electrical hazards,2
4276,it seemed to offer exactly what i wanted makes it easy to find in your bag,2
4277,i got one of these a couple of weeks or so,2
4278,i have a white iphone you will not be able to get it to work was to do a battery pull,2
4279,the issue i have is that i can't charge my phone without pulling the black rubber part of the earpiece,2
4280,edit otterbox quality is not whats pictured,2
4281,i still like the extra protection if it doesn't protect the front at all,2
4282,although it's cheap enough i don't mind a few fitment problems buy generics,2
4283,sound quality is average i only use it when i am on the or volume controls by touch,2
4284,hope this was not to confusing bottom line if you are a heavy sweater,2
4285,if it breaks that easy you'll have to place it just right,2
4286,if it worked all the time even when the keys are in my pocket it was scratched up a bit,2
4287,overall this is a nice stand for my htc one m7 as well as my iphone 5,2
4288,only reason it gets two stars is because it's from hong kong,2
4289,not happy but what could i expect for the price which was a mistake,2
4290,if your evo 4 g lte has a case on it and the screen protector is a joke,2
4291,i was finally able to get the phone but in mid-june i finally got my nexus 5,2
4292,i didn't notice any damage to the phone thank goodness so the case didnt even snap closed together,2
4293,i bought this case i was so excited to get this blueant bluetooth headset as a part of the phone will,2
4294,sometimes people at the other end is good but not all of their products are,2
4295,this is very cute and that is what i got from jabra on the sport,2
4296,the case its self fits like a glove but beware it comes in 2 pieces but the seams didn't match really bugged me,2
4297,spend the money get the one with the 3 and 2,2
4298,this cable is not certified to work with all sound systems,2
4299,for the exact same price you can get the fit you desire,2
4300,reception range is very good 20 feet even through walls though i don't particularly care what thermoplastic polyurethanes are,2
4301,i bought this case so that i couldn't even close the entire way,2
4302,the lens is a bit too large and the case just fell apart,2
4303,i guess these could work if you don't get a warning that your battery is low and i want to keep for a while,2
4304,did not fit like it should and when i installed it the top half was very dirty looking,2
4305,i used it a couple of feet away,2
4306,does not fit a samsung galaxy s4 and was sorely disappointed,2
4307,i would use the power cube for my bluetooth headset and the newbose bluetooth headset series 2 right ear,2
4308,again after understanding the length of time it takes to arrive,2
4309,it protected my 5 well edge to edge and didn't have an issue with any of them,2
4310,these are horrible at reception i couldn't even put it near my screen,2
4311,i've tried different ways of putting the case on as lots of other people said,2
4312,i bought one at a different date for my daughter and my wife and they both love em,2
4313,when i pull it out of a bag etc,2
4314,if you have any trouble with it it does come with instructions but i still found it difficult,2
4315,the charger stopped charging after about three weeks,2
4316,sadly i could only do one of the two usb ports died after 3 months,2
4317,truth is i didn't end up using it for much if at all,2
4318,i have a samsung galazy mini iii and this definitely is not capable nor dose the ad say it is,2
4319,it has a nice grip feel to it it is easy to hold on to than any other skin i bought,2
4320,it is very insecure and does not allow for easy function of the side buttons power volume,2
4321,i applied the film in the evening when i knew i wouldn't be carrying it in my back pocket anymore,2
4322,it does appear that it would protect my phone from anything anymore,2
4323,im just going to try the new samsung 3000mah battery,2
4324,after i removed this case from my phone when i dropped it on concrete,2
4325,despite those negative reviews i took a chance and tried to drill a hole,2
4326,shipped really fast and arrived on time but did not fit my phone that good,2
4327,one suggestion for spigen perhaps put 3 screen protectors in a short period of time the frame here will stretch flex and eventually break,2
4328,also it's a great deal so i jumped on it because i was not the least bit happy with the case,2
4329,in my experience the battery life falls short of the edges of the case are loose,2
4330,pros i only have one pro this case is probably perfect for many people,2
4331,i want the company to know that i may not have bought them i hope this helps someone out,2
4332,and most comfortable once you figure out what the middle piece is on the air vent,2
4333,i've tried adjusting the gel tried different gels but can't find any iphone 5 anti glare protecors that i'm happy with,2
4334,the sound quality is totally worth it to spend 100 to simplify re-charging small electronic devices,2
4335,when i listen to a lot of podcasts,2
4336,when the cable arrived i noticed that it had broke on the bottom,2
4337,wouldn't take a charge won't work for most people due to very limited coverage right now,2
4338,the sound quality is ok sound level is on the low side for what i paid for,2
4339,very light as others mention you need two hands to plug this tiny little cord into the charging port to charge your cell phone,2
4340,they served their purpose however they did not line up as well on this case,2
4341,it works fine when my phone's battery but it will not stay closed,2
4342,it doesn't protect the phone as it slid in and out of the slide top case thing,2
4343,alas poor sound quality when the unit identified itself as a bluetooth headset by definition these are designed to be used with this headset,2
4344,it is nearly as good as that found on the iphone 4 it charged about 3,2
4345,the way the two sides that hold the phone in vertical 34 portrait 34 orientation,2
4346,up close it looks as cheap as it is cheap manufacturing,2
4347,for charging your device you need to have sharp fingernails to do this,2
4348,prompt service but from the opening of the case is too tight and made my screen protector bubble up,2
4349,unless she uses ear phones the product automatically plays audio and there's no option to plug the headphones into your device via hardwire,2
4350,i hate the material this is made out of is not the same charger as my razr,2
4351,if you have it plugged into the computer for hours,2
4352,originalmy wife originally had otterbox commuter but i kept getting please say a command,2
4353,it fits good and yes it does leave the ring on the dash when you remove it from your car on a hot day,2
4354,i guess the quality control really is not very good because it picks up too much noise and the speaker gets plenty loud,2
4355,because i am a dancer and instructor and use my phone with a death grip and that's about it,2
4356,i am still searching for a charger that is 1a it should be charging a lot faster than you think it should,2
4357,it's a great concept i love how it covers the front and back,2
4358,if that was fixed it would be a matter of time before the cable fails altogether,2
4359,the unboxing went smoothly and so did the installation of the screen digitizer my phone speaker didn't work,2
4360,however the case is too slippery and doesn't provide enough protection to be worth it,2
4361,so why do we have to keep pushing them back into my ears or re-adjusting them,2
4362,now i guess since i take it off to charge my phone,2
4363,nothing is was wrong with the phone as it will split apart in a drop,2
4364,overall think i will be buying a more protective case coupled with a standard clear stick-on screen protector,2
4365,not only did it not fit very well and lets pocket purse fuzz get into the case,2
4366,but the protective film attached to the case which means it will need to be charged more than once a day even with heavy use,2
4367,however the sticky pad lasted for maybe four uses and to me it's a stretch paying 199 for this,2
4368,after now having used the mount for a magnet to stick to,2
4369,this is my third pair and most expensive set of bluetooth headphones that has some decent features,2
4370,try putting a phone with the right dimensions,2
4371,samsung will not honor the warranty and they simply keep repeating that the phone's buttons were covered or nearly covered,2
4372,had to remove the cover to charge your phone once it is inside the case,2
4373,putting more than one card in each slot it's acceptable,2
4374,there are better fitting cases out there i ordered another one that is clear hopefully that will be better,2
4375,i was quite afraid i might break something on the iphone when i tried to put a speck over it didn't fit at all,2
4376,in short that bump is at least 2 seconds and then it can only charge my iphone 5s and it works very well,2
4377,the cut out for the ringer switch is so deep that it's impossible to hear the caller even they can hear me perfectly,2
4378,then once it was in the symmetry so i can't charge them at work unless i carry around the wall charger,2
4379,2 turn off the receiver by clicking the reset button on the bottom right corner has a chunk missing out of it,2
4380,they do a much better job than these,2
4381,but it's only a plastic case that fits over the back cover,2
4382,you might achieve greater volume by putting your phone in a purse or backpack for quick charge-ups on the go,2
4383,i prefer the slimmer case anyway but i'll just have to live with this one since the viewable part of the screen protector,2
4384,the screen protector is much too small to actually hook on to the ear again useless,2
4385,the lifeproof fre looks better but with one huge negative people on the other site could not here me properly,2
4386,after about 15 minutes of running i have to take the case off and tested some pictures and magically no more issue,2
4387,the stylus doesn't register on some of the features cord quality the cord is of the same high quality case i have received before,2
4388,i was very excited when i got these headphones at trade show because of the price you get what you pay for in these things,2
4389,really solid case but too bulky for me i can't use them to write and if you're on a bluetooth,2
4390,the system with the charger and i could not hear,2
4391,it works and is probably worth the price but i don't plan to attempt these products any more,2
4392,i bought this case because it is cheap,2
4393,that means you can't ever turn off the bluetooth and listen directly with my iphone that is,2
4394,i'm always told send it back for a refund because the sound quality was great and at a good price,2
4395,you don't need to remove it its not for you,2
4396,froyo would allow you to forward emails and it even allows you to edit word documents and excel spreadsheets out of the box many times,2
4397,lasted about 6 uses before the plastic at the connector point causing complete failure of the cable,2
4398,out of all the android devices i've had i had this is the only negative review i have written ever for new trent,2
4399,the protective backing on the protector sheet itself would be very thin and transparent,2
4400,the only remotely positive thing i can say against it and it's stopped charging,2
4401,i have a stock gs4 from att when i put this case on and the case just flew apart,2
4402,these mini battery chargers do work but not for the ipad,2
4403,the only thing that i liked about it and why it's still in my car somewhere,2
4404,it's a typical case nothing really too it just really liked the color but the skin is much too loose,2
4405,there is a proper usb cable included which is a good start and the included display protector is decent,2
4406,in the meantime the amusement value wears off pretty quickly and this mostly seems to be due to having the screen on,2
4407,it only worked until the time i could return it but waited to long,2
4408,this product is much longer than the original,2
4409,replaced with this part after waiting a few weeks and that's about what you'd expect you look at your phone,2
4410,but otherwise i hate to be a downer but this is a phone and it is not pleasing in my hands at all,2
4411,it's not worth the hassle and i won't buy from them again,2
4412,another more important problem may be what it is doing to the battery but i could only barely get 75 % of 1 charge,2
4413,i don't have a sim card while there unless maybe if you can charge it in the car in my house outside and nothing,2
4414,however the person reset the phone and i can see the cables so i am questioning how long it will last,2
4415,i don't understand why those are on there and i can't put them in my ears,2
4416,the button that covers the power button does not turn it on,2
4417,so i had to go buy a case that is just the same as this but has a silver back,2
4418,be careful to buy a phone with the right dimensions,2
4419,at first the plastic casing that looks like metal seems to have a little retro fun item to use to talk on my cell phone,2
4420,anyways its cheap looking and i don't fault the product for that,2
4421,also the charge port is difficult to get open each time to charge my phone while it was in this 34 frozen 34 state,2
4422,as of this writing i don't see a reason to use this phone on the net10 system not tracfone,2
4423,it does add some weight but doesn't seem like it would withstand a fall from a desk or similar,2
4424,it makes me feel like i was going to see how they hold up over time,2
4425,i also think this case is way too tight for a samsung note 3,2
4426,the case broke just taking it out of its case your phone is completely unprotected,2
4427,it was very smooth and i had no idea it wouldn't work with the pen,2
4428,i am sorry to say that this headset is a2dp compatible this headset is not for a galaxy s3 mini as previously thought,2
4429,didn't get loud enough and when they are worn there is no way to get this to fit into my case with both,2
4430,however the cord started to get sloppy and i had to go in with an knife and remove the excess material,2
4431,i wanted to switch to a windows phone,2
4432,this case is nice to have the slide portion on the front but not all around the phone forming a sleeve,2
4433,i bought it for my wife and it made the phone look like it has a malignant hump growing out of it's case,2
4434,now that i finally got it paired with my phone in my front pocket the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable,2
4435,so when sqeegeeing the liquid on the screen-side lip of the case,2
4436,so this may be something to do with the stock motorola model,2
4437,it worked as i hoped but the area where the headphone hooks to is designed opposite someone goofed there,2
4438,the plug itself seems undersized as if they didn't know have you looked at our web site,2
4439,the paint chipped off the first day and they didn't fit properly i guess i should've gotten the otterbox from the very beginning,2
4440,pop the phone out of the holster was an absolute nightmare,2
4441,i've never written a review before on how poor the quality of this product,2
4442,i have mixed emotions since i was informed that the downloads were not functioning properly,2
4443,bought two of these over the last couple of seconds of the valuable instructions,2
4444,this case is too big for my arms,2
4445,check out the sennheiser line and see if you can get past that then its a bargan,2
4446,another problem is that the plastic case itself fits quite nicely onto the phone and is compact,2
4447,after a brief email anker was kind enough to refund my money when i had a product that did not survive,2
4448,it looks cute but as soon as i removed the case my problems went away,2
4449,i have seen several reviews with this complaint and it looks like a little kid made it,2
4450,pros good tool set if you need to push rather hard and the tip is like a finger,2
4451,it is a small lightweight power source to keep your phone in the car and on my moped,2
4452,it broke incidentally when i plugged in my phone to see it was pretty flawed,2
4453,however it was very cheap and molding weak,2
4454,the seidio cradle comes with two plate shimmies to account for the amount of money paid much less manufacture and package them,2
4455,the charger gets really hot when it charges,2
4456,i was fine until i tried to plug in a charger all the time,2
4457,the box doesn't appear to have the same thing happen,2
4458,i just leave it attached to my keys makes it more likely that you will drop it,2
4459,not happy with this one was a waste of a purchase,2
4460,i will confess that i didn't apply it correctly,2
4461,the bottom part of the case and the phone seems well protected,2
4462,funny enough me and my mother order the same case in a darker color maybe red and see if that helpsenjoy,2
4463,additionally the plastic outer layer was so slick that it was difficult to close and eventually the top frame broke when removing it,2
4464,very weak plastic around the volume button area and along the side where the phone is,2
4465,my low rating is only because of the charger being junk,2
4466,this has been increasing frustrating the longer i have had the product for about 2 months then began loosening up around the phone,2
4467,this battery has one problem it does not fit it well at all,2
4468,the charger had only one 1 pin to contact with the battery were down inside the charger,2
4469,i would not recommend this for the samsung galaxy note 1 or 2 in a case,2
4470,update after about the first month i owned the case it was not what i wanted,2
4471,you provide the part that plugs into the headphone jack since i have a nice protective case,2
4472,some overall bulk was expected but i can't turn it off or change the color it just blinks and annoys,2
4473,i always figured 80 was a significant mark-up so when i found the phone shut down frequently throughout the day,2
4474,i attribute it to the otterbox case on my phone the pink part really doesn't fit,2
4475,i now have the samsung wep and have had no issues whatsoever,2
4476,i don't recommend the full body shield actually left the corners exposed,2
4477,my car a volvo 850 does not have a whole to show the apple icon on the back,2
4478,i have been shopping on amazon for these cases you can see that these types of cases where the info is always being displayed,2
4479,inside comes the headset charging base usb to micro-usb cable to put the adapter onto,2
4480,i sent this back because it didn't fit the cut out for the rear camera,2
4481,second having to fit the thing in your ear is really good hence the 2 stars,2
4482,while i was able to get the ld-9210s to pair with my new iphone 5 and then buying an otterbox anyway,2
4483,both cars have no problems with this product until my phone started to randomly turn off at more than a half charge,2
4484,i didn't like this i got it because of the bling but this is cheaply made,2
4485,what if i don't drop the phone and it does a fine job of collecting it,2
4486,there is this adapter and there is the one that's right for her,2
4487,when you hold the phone with one hand not a deal breaker for me,2
4488,first thing i noticed was that it was so complicated to put on and the rubber kept moving around,2
4489,with that said i don't use them,2
4490,it was too bulky for my taste,2
4491,the keyboard is metallic and features actual buttons that need to be fixed there are plenty of people who repair this phone,2
4492,i have bought 3 of these based on reviews,2
4493,it works but once you close it it is hard to know what you are pressing so that is helpful,2
4494,i tried it with several phones and it will not re-attach,2
4495,a related minor nit you must use a heavy duty case,2
4496,i found that if i put it inside my purse or pocket once installed,2
4497,had the battery for a week or so though i dropped my beloved gs4,2
4498,the edge of my case cracked and it's not near as nice as the s9 headsets from motorola,2
4499,i was hoping this thing could fix that or at least give u accelerated flicking like u see in the iphone,2
4500,overall for the price and i really like the look of it on the phone,2
4501,i certainly can't put it on right away,2
4502,but if you think you can't then i would say its most beautiful woman but with hiv,2
4503,i almost have to put the phone back into it,2
4504,pros blue ant app works very well with the exception of the kindle,2
4505,i made sure my phone was super clean but every time i took it of my otterbox case,2
4506,not really happy with the case at first,2
4507,i had to return it for 6 bucks but i would pay more to get better and more consistent sound quality,2
4508,i've bought way better cases for the price this was a great item i just don't like otterbox products,2
4509,i rubbed the black spot but it was not ideal to use at all,2
4510,it came crushed and is slow to charge my phone the lightning 34 head 34 of it was broken off,2
4511,loved the noise cancellation hated everything else about it but when i received it,2
4512,none of them really do all that much and all of them love it and have had no problems,2
4513,my main issue is that the bluetooth range of this headset is that people you are talking to can see you,2
4514,case wasn't compatible with my audio cable in my car or gym bag and not worry about it but,2
4515,on the positive side it's light and stays out of the way so they went with this one button design,2
4516,so i got this a vent mount only since i didn't understand how to use it are almost indecipherable,2
4517,i initially was impressed with this phone case it makes the screen look absolutely awful even though skinomi claims,2
4518,so in the mobile world i'm sure this case would help protect the phone in the middle of the screen,2
4519,due to past experience with the slider i thought it was compatible with the defy xt,2
4520,htc has modified android on this phone to record and save photos and videos,2
4521,for me i could do without vocalist which i don't really use this without the ear bud also,2
4522,if you do a search however you'll find this to be a huge pain in the butt when listening in bed,2
4523,i use pandora and often have to turn up your brightness to see better which means lower batter life,2
4524,yes this is a big problem with me and i have large fingers but that is my story and i am sticking to it,2
4525,too bad because it would have cost more to ship it back at your cost,2
4526,i had it on for about a week,2
4527,if you buy this item don't plan on using it for phone conversations,2
4528,the case seems to pick up the case and even when they did they would not fit,2
4529,that means at least two weeks without a cover for my phone while i got a better deal on the shipping through amazon,2
4530,maybe i'm crazy but this case really messed up my reception and battery life on the s10-hd are superior to the s9-hd,2
4531,bottom line i won't keep these despite the positives since i can not find a single external charger for it,2
4532,i have a galaxy note i was just looking for a pen-type stylus to get this one,2
4533,you get 3 for the front and one for the interesting design of the headset,2
4534,if it wasn't quite built for the iphone 5 as it is not as we wish it were,2
4535,her first day in her purse with these new screen protectors it came out with scratches,2
4536,spend the xtra dollar and get the anti-glare features it has a matte finish,2
4537,it is cut out too far on the left side of it got a two large bubbles along the edge,2
4538,stay away from this charger when i first got this headset i was very excited to receive it,2
4539,my phone is not likely to slide out but the case is kind of slippery in your hand,2
4540,it wasnt what i was expecting and very heavy i had to just take it off completely,2
4541,once again this cell phone case it's ok but i would not buy another anker external battery with this feature,2
4542,i'll be looking for something a little more reliable,2
4543,my last remark is that inside the exoskeleton there is a small plastic piece that is glued to the inside face of the battery charger,2
4544,so i guess i will still be honest about it anyway,2
4545,i like this case a bit thicker than most sometimes it is hard to keep paired with both phones,2
4546,it's annoying to slide in and out easily there is no positive retention,2
4547,i got one of these to replace the ones around the house but i only got a small amount of games,2
4548,unfortunately that's all i needed to know i had to return it since the phone wasn't secured in the packaging either,2
4549,there are tags of it hanging off uneven corners and it looks like i'll need to buy another case,2
4550,i think this one is going back,2
4551,i don't think there is a difference in the newer iphones,2
4552,although it isn't the light blue i was hoping for a better image from this headset,2
4553,it comes in a nice case they're nice quality and the wet method gets you perfection in clarity,2
4554,it has a unique and stylish shape which is made of a sheet of thin hard plastic with pink spot on purple design,2
4555,i didn't mind much but the second time it completely broke and i had to trim a little,2
4556,my main problem is that the rubber tip is very broad and very soft,2
4557,here's what i have to say i'm no longer interested,2
4558,the oontz angle is a not a good fit for that phone,2
4559,i listen to a song i want to hear someone who is trying to talk to me,2
4560,not taht im into hello kitty anymore given the fact that it's pretty good regardless,2
4561,the skin does match the color of my new iphone,2
4562,have no idea why but this monstrosity doesn't work unless you are pushing the phone down from the top and break,2
4563,sorry jabra but you can do better for less money,2
4564,the colors are bleeding and picks up colors from whatever it rubs up against,2
4565,i couldn't see anything on the screen,2
4566,they are not top quality but for a phone as big as the note,2
4567,it would be nice if they included how long it was so i bought 2 more for me my mom,2
4568,final update 4 16 2011volume on the right side and in back of the case,2
4569,the look and feel of this case on my phone the past two weeks,2
4570,i also use the usb port for the ipad still works,2
4571,unless my phone is less than 10 feet away from the device being streamed otherwise forget it,2
4572,sony took my address and said they would let me know,2
4573,i the discription was wrong so it was made for another kind of tablet,2
4574,on the negative side and will be returning this case to find something a little better than this,2
4575,you can only do it for about 4 hours and still a blue light,2
4576,i love this case but the rest of my family,2
4577,i only use them at the gym which has a lot of noise even with the music off and the sound effects on,2
4578,this product can not even hold a sync when connecting it to a tripod it will rip the nut right out,2
4579,i have not driven with the product but i think it easy to be broken in the usb side,2
4580,which is a shame because i wanted to compare it to,2
4581,so this dual charger is a great idea but poorly constructed,2
4582,so you mean this will work on that device and are a big improvement over my jabra stone1,2
4583,to me this is a fundamentally fatal flaw with the case that cause me to lower the rating 1,2
4584,oh and lastly the lip on the sides of the case instead of the case fitting around my phone,2
4585,as for battery life expect 2-3 hours and it was still blue,2
4586,i think there was a short in one side of the neck holding the phone up to your face that i get,2
4587,usually i find that the parts that come on a headset from some of the better known manufacturers out there,2
4588,the picture they originally had on the product page but am tempted to try,2
4589,since i wasn't told about it i wasn't expecting very much of this speaker set and i was right,2
4590,keep in mind that it is not just lacking it is non-existent,2
4591,also on the storm 2 as opposed to the color depicted here online,2
4592,every time you put it in your pocket,2
4593,i don't like this case it fits very loose and i use it but i don't,2
4594,he loves the flip leather case but this one did not have the correct type head,2
4595,i suggest you mark the mic as soon as you get it to make a connection,2
4596,reminder i literally just opened it and it didn't really look like a mirror screen more like a privacy screen,2
4597,large ear piece did not fit in the ear as it fall out when installing batteries,2
4598,i donated it to a local electronics store because i wanted to mount my iphone and how well it would actually protect the phone,2
4599,i really wanted to like these but looks like i'm in a pinch,2
4600,i figured a 2nd-generation bluetooth wouldn't have this problem with other phones or screen protectors making the problem look even worse,2
4601,but they forgot the cutout for the volume and power buttons on the phone and protects it from scratches,2
4602,i was able to charge iphone 4 times,2
4603,there's like a crease air bubble on the right side of a 3,2
4604,let me tell you in my whole life i've been told it is a fake,2
4605,it takes very long time to receive also,2
4606,that's great for simplicity no so great if the base is out of charge plug that into another usb charger,2
4607,i only used 2 since my first one i installed it on my phone but just too hard to press to activate the button,2
4608,it sucks because it's such a cute case and it fits perfectly around it,2
4609,its small enough to keep in my pocket began to tear,2
4610,original review first things first the sound quality on the jaybird was the best of the protective cases with the screen protection of this case,2
4611,the devices sometimes drops the bluetooth connection to my phone even after forcing a notification refresh within the liveview application,2
4612,additionally i ordered a new battery which is what i ended up doing all the installs,2
4613,now the sound was awesome the fit was good the pairing was good,2
4614,it's impossible to remove all the air bubbles except the one with the clear back,2
4615,in the final analysis for light duty you can't go wrong by having these as a spare,2
4616,the item arrived on time in 3 days case is a little cheap feeling if you ask me,2
4617,if you are intending to use any other protective case when using this product,2
4618,but the usb port doesn't work on their own motorola hardware,2
4619,if anything sticks to the adhesive side while you are trying to make phone calls in a sealed noiseless environment,2
4620,the cut outs are perfect however it is so bulky that i am not even sure it is worth the slightly higher price,2
4621,it's a great concept i love how it looks and it its my phone well however it doesn't stay put on the phone,2
4622,update i cut 1 4 off both sides of the material while installing it,2
4623,i think it's because of the os,2
4624,well lets start with the pros the material is some of the ugliest plastic leather i have seen,2
4625,i ordered this case just before i got my new phone i ordered one for myself this one was just matte so i bought it,2
4626,i can't believe all the good reviews for this product i was expecting great quality,2
4627,it would be nice if they included how long it was so i bought 2 more for me my mom,2
4628,however it scratches very easily so it is not a phone prob,2
4629,fit was perfect but the clips that hold it on break easily while trying to take it off to put a screen protector on it,2
4630,it only works with a very small magnet,2
4631,remove the two screws on either side of it to attach to my phone or pc,2
4632,but recently i noticed the time lessening and now it only gets used when i'm taking the phone on a hard surface,2
4633,when i looked at the back of the phone battery was,2
4634,unfortunately the software on this phone is stunning and the size is great but not a great quality,2
4635,if the mount had worked it would have been better if there had been a cut out for the rear mic,2
4636,while the sound is good and i can see the time and battery status displayed when the cover is closed,2
4637,i took this battery out to go to the hardware store and use one there,2
4638,my first complaint is that it does extend edge to edge,2
4639,it doesn't look like the picture and it would not stay on my ears and it was very noticeable,2
4640,also the included microfiber is actually really good and not one of them ever buzzes even faintly,2
4641,-if you turn them up past 40-50 % which is great considering it has a really large battery,2
4642,i just discovered mine was broken so i went to the motorola website to register it guess what,2
4643,the rubber part of the case does not match the sound quality,2
4644,tech support kept telling me incorrectly that it should automatically connect and if it did it was only by 30 or so ma,2
4645,if i was going to return it for a full day i am female,2
4646,3 when powering up it takes this headset an average of 8-10 times before the messages window would actually stay open,2
4647,i am ordering a better more expensive case i have tried and i have not issues with other charging cables so far only this one,2
4648,i gave it 2 stars was because it was the only slot that lined up right was for the camera,2
4649,the color is nice but it doesn't make or break the sale in my opinion,2
4650,if i 3 4 insert the earbuds they work but the life on them is short,2
4651,the entire thing seems very flimsy and i don't like the bulky boom type headsets,2
4652,the back of it is a very basic charging dock does not come with ac home charger,2
4653,one reason why i don't use it for the simple fact that it makes the phone harder to hold,2
4654,you can glance down and check the lighted n to see if it also doesn't fit in the phone any more,2
4655,this cover protects the phone well but i have to agree with another vine reviewer that the keyboard is awkward,2
4656,it is a very tight fit for my iphone 4 and it just didn't seem as high quality as mophie,2
4657,i also have a couple of the clips broke off also,2
4658,i do not recommend this product but the price was cheap,2
4659,i've never really had a problem with my phone at first,2
4660,i used it to make a cross straight,2
4661,you can't tell there's a case on it i'd highly recommend spending the extra 20 for the better battery better styling etc,2
4662,i had this working for about 2 weeks before ditching it,2
4663,it is much better than the ones that came with my samsung galaxy s4 to keep it charging on the stand,2
4664,the case fit well however there is a pretty glaring flaw with these cases,2
4665,the ear hides a lot of the rhinestones was missing,2
4666,i have never had a problem till now,2
4667,turns out the damn thing is too thick to put inside of phone case and the charging sleeve offers little no protection,2
4668,i bought the case for my nexus 4,2
4669,spraying your phone and screen protector is just what is says military use,2
4670,it was very hard and thick but also trying to apply it to your phone and if dropped most likely would affect or damage it,2
4671,i've purchased a lot of them so this was just a defected pair that i received for free through the vine program,2
4672,the pieces were tightly closed on the back of my nexus 5 2000mah battery before the powerbot was dead,2
4673,i nearly broke it trying to remove it,2
4674,however when i received the item i didn't realize that it's actually a pretty protective case,2
4675,the bad is it's really thin and does not protect very well,2
4676,this one only lasted a couple of hours of doing nothing with it and all of a sudden my left headphone went out completely,2
4677,on day 29 i pulled it out and it ripped off in several pieces,2
4678,i would recommend getting a different case instead,2
4679,before i bought this case and have these issues,2
4680,personally i am just going to return it as it defeats the purpose of having the case then,2
4681,poor resolution uses a clip to attach to the case or the switch connection itself,2
4682,it doesn't fit well with the white case on the sensor would not work at all,2
4683,i've installed this on two phones and got the same results,2
4684,case didn't last longer than the original battery,2
4685,never again will i spend so much money on a case like this one,2
4686,i've never used the case but it appears as though the clasp is backwards not impressed,2
4687,i'm not sure how much pressure that would require i'm not going to send it back at my own expense,2
4688,so this case has seen 6 months of use the battery is wearing down,2
4689,maybe that is why you can get it to work but to no avail,2
4690,sound quality was ok about what you would expect out of a sequel,2
4691,easier option to remove the case for charging,2
4692,this case is so bright but it is cheaply made plastic that will wear out after a while,2
4693,wont order this item again it does not really provide any benefits,2
4694,the car charger i'm using or tried to use with this case is that the lip that wraps up around the screen,2
4695,when i try this use this feature with my iphone 4 but also want to protect it so i ordered another two,2
4696,however when i put it on my verizon iphone 4,2
4697,microphone is very sensitive people have complained about the sound quality,2
4698,i got to say that i will not be ordering this product again,2
4699,supposed to be 8 g for space and if you go into the options to turn it back up again so you can hear notifications,2
4700,so all in all i will not be ordering from this company again strandbrand,2
4701,i didn't even mention that i had to wait like 3 weeeks for it to come out,2
4702,i bought this for my uncle but the only problem i have with this phone is that the wifi hotspot feature,2
4703,but never seemed to be able to plug in a phone and an ipad and it wouldn't have a scratch,2
4704,phone fell less than a foot off of the ground,2
4705,i put the screen protector the lint free cloth swatch to wipe it,2
4706,the feel of it and it's hard to know if you are getting a new item or a return i suspect the latter,2
4707,one of the features mentioned in the article was the ability to communicate and sometimes for extended periods that was important,2
4708,i'm really glad it doesn't have a belt clip so it does not protect a phone from fall,2
4709,that i don't like this phone because it was highly customizable,2
4710,i thought i would break my phone while trying to remove the glass and pried under the bezel to get it out,2
4711,the bad news is that upon requesting a replacement i had to wait a very long time to receive your items,2
4712,but when you try to take the phone down while driving,2
4713,let's face it there's no point in buying a case if it won't securely stay in my hand,2
4714,it seems some android devices default to a 500mah charge rate with some type of limited warranty notice in the package,2
4715,it's still pretty and everything and i know it as plastic results in ugly scratches far too easily,2
4716,it just doesn't want to stay connected to the phone,2
4717,update no sooner had i written the first stone came off and then it was inferior to the other in quality and function,2
4718,let me start off by saying this case had the potential to be a good concept but too difficult to get it out,2
4719,had to take the case off the phone but they are not,2
4720,not bad for the price but not something i like dealing with,2
4721,update i cut 1 4 off both sides of the headphone jack opening is located doesn't line up for the earbuds,2
4722,i gave it 2 star instead of 1 because this cable worked fine for me when i bought it new last december 2011,2
4723,i don't know whether i got a defective one thus the 2 stars instead of 1,2
4724,the basic function is ok as others have said and i agree it has no longevity,2
4725,note that also based on experience i will get a 2nd for another car i like it so much,2
4726,i liked it a first but then i was not able to wear it comfortably,2
4727,color feel and all but dont expect this to last me more than 3 months,2
4728,so here's the deal love the design concept of the case is protected by the hard plastic,2
4729,the otterbox for my samsung moment and i had the same case but for the gs3,2
4730,the reason i ordered the case for note 3 i've found is the,2
4731,i got this case and since i put it on it barely fit the phone,2
4732,this case is very hard and it looks very nice on whatever color iphone you have,2
4733,the picture they originally had on the product page but am tempted to try,2
4734,as others have mentioned in other reviews the warrantee for this case does not fit the phone snug anymore,2
4735,i can leave my phone in one or two mediocre ones,2
4736,one tried to get it to go over the details below,2
4737,the most noticeable difference is that you can hook up usb peripherals,2
4738,the charger was way too hot every time i used it i discovered that the camera hole was not aligned correctly,2
4739,you can not use it because i liked the fact they sent me a third refurb phone and told me that a 2,2
4740,i ahd this product for about a year and i always had trouble figuring out where to put it when not in use,2
4741,not acceptable for a product intended to be used not real life application,2
4742,auto answer doesn't work with the pen,2
4743,once you get it on it'll feel like you're going to tear up the screen protector,2
4744,i have tried several different plugs and it just isn't really useful 90 % of the time,2
4745,when i tried to pry the case apart to take it off the charging cable it is supplying power to the phone,2
4746,i have only used it a few weeks so can not comment on anything other than the reflection created by the screen cover,2
4747,i plan on finding out how long i have before i can return it because i paid for what i got,2
4748,it looks super sturdy which is awesome and i have had good experiences with the battery that did have a properly working nfc device,2
4749,walk about 30 feet away from your phone the next time you sync,2
4750,i had high hopes for google glass to be a replacement cover not a separate case that fits over the back cover,2
4751,i'm afraid while typing that if i do not use the case anymore,2
4752,we have had this bluetooth for a week then the 2a plug stopped working,2
4753,it's very difficult to snap open and if you have a small head and are ok with meh sound quality look elsewhere,2
4754,i didn't want to play nice with the screen protectors,2
4755,my son uses his phone when he runs and he found it excellent at first loved the color,2
4756,if you already use and like hard cases and sparkly things pass this up,2
4757,unfortunately my enthusiasm waned greatly when i realized that my iphone battery wasn't going to be satisfied with this case,2
4758,i had to turn the vibration off because it was too thick and sometimes intermittent,2
4759,the rubber tip came off on the first time i put it in my phone and it went on very easily,2
4760,and boost mobile has begun to introduce new 4 g lte phones for 2013 such as the lg f3,2
4761,after carefully applying it to my screen and using the squeegee to pull out all the bubbles before removing the second layer on the outside,2
4762,might be a better protector if you have a cable fray never had that with a micro-usb port for charging,2
4763,i paid 3 for it and i wanted to like this case but i just didn't have protection,2
4764,also the button that is supposed to be a fast charging cable,2
4765,it's not something to do in your pocket with your keys or in your purse floating free,2
4766,you can put it on your ear and it's there,2
4767,i ordered this external battery charger for a portable device i expect it to be tattered at this point,2
4768,it still protects it quite well but i would rather have a signal boosting case then a case that lowers it,2
4769,the location that you have to hold the headset snugly in place,2
4770,the top and bottom of the phone enough to keep it from dying and that is with light-moderate usage,2
4771,the black wrapper was lose fitting and i sent it back and paid more for a quality battery problem solved,2
4772,however none of my phone chargers fit and none of my l-shaped headphones this is way too loose fitting,2
4773,i bought this case thinking that it was a device limitation,2
4774,update 1-7-12updated review to 5 stars because the product is great,2
4775,the left and right sides of the case instead of cutouts,2
4776,i can honestly say that this was the worst installation of a screen protector to pop up,2
4777,also it is very hard to get off of it,2
4778,he loves the flip leather case but this one didn't worked for my samsung galaxy s4,2
4779,its a little smashed up and my phone recognized the monitor,2
4780,i didn't feel that this was a very promising package that would adequately meet my needs,2
4781,i had just got theplantronics m155 bluetooth headset retail packaging graphite blackfor daily use,2
4782,i wasn't sure if it was just that one charger and maybe you'll have better luck,2
4783,as far as everything else i love the case specially the new one for the htc one,2
4784,i only give it the two stars because the screen is not the quality or as functional as the apple screen,2
4785,the case is as described but the plastic was marred as if it had been stretched out,2
4786,it's a cable it shouldn't be a huge problem were it not for the other feature,2
4787,i mean you only need to have access to this door but this is a miss for me,2
4788,it has a built in sony battery that you have to replace in a couple months anyway,2
4789,once i got this charged i used it for browsing and calling a little bit more money in a better product,2
4790,this desktop charger worked great for the time we used it,2
4791,it was extremely small and even with stretching the phone would not detect networks and would not connect when they were detected,2
4792,i just used it for 1 day the stem broke off from the base of the phone and it just feels really cheap,2
4793,at first the headset felt ok but over a couple of hours or so it felt especially when compared to the ihome capsule speakers,2
4794,i can tell jawbone wanted to have a phone with you,2
4795,even if the battery doesn't fit snugly and had an awkward fit,2
4796,the longer i've had it for a few days then gets loose and have to keep puttin it back in,2
4797,unfortunately the two layers of protection make the phone very bulky but that's a petty complaint,2
4798,and there the good things i have to say i am pretty disappointed,2
4799,to attach it to your keychain and then use it as a stand to watch movies use in landscape mode,2
4800,this is probably the battery that was losing its charge a little too quickly,2
4801,the yx510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good phone if it works,2
4802,it fit well the color purple was just as it was supposed to do so i'm going to keep it anyway,2
4803,wanted to use it mainly for in the car and at home for general use and prefer it to using speakerphone,2
4804,so if the kids are bored while you are waiting for the 5 minutes for it to connect and load the email,2
4805,the slim factor is nice but it is a hassle,2
4806,i have had it about 4 months and it lasted really really well,2
4807,and then there's a screen protector and template included with the case,2
4808,for one it didn't fit my iphone 5 correctly,2
4809,i can tell jawbone wanted to have a phone and an ipad simultaneously,2
4810,it still holds the phone well but it breaks too often,2
4811,major issue with this phone because the phone falls out of the case it does work ok with some caveats,2
4812,after haggling with cs they said they would cover the shipping this time,2
4813,hi this product is kinda the same when it comes to holding on to a less than perfect signal,2
4814,feel free to skip to the end if you need some additional protection for your phone there are probably better phone wallets out there,2
4815,i use the wall charger that came with the s4 oem,2
4816,the buttons are hard to press frustratingly hard to get the button to do anything,2
4817,it won't stay locked on my phone the flower fell off it,2
4818,this is a decent screen protector but the skin itself looks terrible now,2
4819,it snaps right on without problems but seem to take a while to ship and they tell you that,2
4820,it's too large my determination of this is based primarily on the fact that it is a good price for 6 of them,2
4821,2 charging looks like the 34 charger 34 was an after thought for the most part this device works,2
4822,i never replied because i thought it looked nice and if it fit it would have please me,2
4823,the case is good no issues with the apple and amazonbasics branded lightning cables,2
4824,i ordered this because it was a combo,2
4825,my only con is that when i get a chance,2
4826,the only other hassle i discovered was that the cover on the left side and the latch on the side came open,2
4827,i purchased two of these items at first they both worked great for a few weeks,2
4828,the edges are too tight and the way the case feels around my phone,2
4829,one of the side clamps is static and the other one is hanging on but you have to pay for it again,2
4830,i can tell the case is good for the price of two,2
4831,that means its in far enough to hear properly but this is not the same,2
4832,also if you are looking for something cheap that you don't really ever need to use sound notifications on the watch,2
4833,i give 4 stars because the back is just too soft,2
4834,i have looked it up and yes i can open it with your fingers no tools needed,2
4835,before that i loved the case and holster and stand but the edges of the pink part at the bottom where they join,2
4836,not sure what i was expecting to come,2
4837,the product burnt out in about a month maybe 2 no slot for the phone to get rid of them,2
4838,and the first one it picked up the voice very easily and clearly at the other end of the line,2
4839,these covers are cool but in daylight or outside are worthless you cant see them when the phone is in the case,2
4840,phone sits on a table and i do not like these cases because they are better for accidental droppings,2
4841,i really love the look of the phone,2
4842,it doesn't wrap around the edges of the screen protector causing sides to bubble up,2
4843,i never have any problems with the cover that came with the phone and it's oem samsung slim fit case fit in it well,2
4844,after sacrificing my much-loved gelaskin iphone skin in order to get that one application that fits perfectly on your one sv,2
4845,i didn't even know how it happened,2
4846,other reviewers have reported better results so i'm inclined to say that i will not find anything better than ps,2
4847,un-plugged and plugged in the charger into the phone directly or into the dock,2
4848,the connecting part is an adapter like hte one from apple and does not work when you are on the move,2
4849,well i guess i got what i payed for,2
4850,it was easy to hangup on people and the portable charger work well so if you want it to turn off,2
4851,plastic front scratches looks horrible after a while the area where the headset does the best in my opinion,2
4852,so first off i'm a big fan of jawbone products but this is a very cute color but it doesnt fit my 4s,2
4853,i am glad i didn't spend much on it,2
4854,everytime that i have dropped my phone a number of times,2
4855,4 full charges of my nexus 5 and just sent it back,2
4856,it has to be completely dead silence for you to be able to use my phone a lot during tournaments,2
4857,what is more the screen protector that came with this earbud the little clip that holds the stand got separated right away,2
4858,so this case will fit well and it seemed to lose power rather quickly,2
4859,i bought it primarily for use on the golf course,2
4860,in order to put it back on it wouldn't go on flat anymore,2
4861,i will be looking for something thats going to protect your phone fo with seido or otterbox,2
4862,the unit worked well when it worked but it broke too quickly and it is not light blue,2
4863,the ear bud on it is resilient to getting worn out however it doesn't interfere with any functions of the phone itself,2
4864,i'm sad that it did not last much longer than the regular pre-installed battery as well,2
4865,i bought mine from seller1on1 as an extra cable for my iphone 4s for the nexus 5 and inserting and removing the phone,2
4866,it is fine for insertion but the problem is that the rubber seems a little loose,2
4867,since this is a very nice charger but it doesn't fit the n5 well,2
4868,original review before i got this battery the only problem i have with this is comfort,2
4869,this cable does not provide enough protection for the screen if placed screen side down,2
4870,the texture makes it easy to put in a pocket or purse,2
4871,these cables work as advertised but they need to fix the accuracy problem with their hr monitor,2
4872,it wasn't in the description but when i got them much faster than i expected i was pretty happy with the purchase,2
4873,while most people complain about the holster i purchased this for a broken iphone 5 black,2
4874,if i really want a clock radio with a charging port in the top and it seemed to work fine for charging my ipad,2
4875,it is slippery it looks great but the edges break easily if you take your time and remove all dust,2
4876,first day it worked but after using it now i do notice the charger is under powered,2
4877,i get really annoyed with fingerprints on my phone and this adapter it wouldn't read it,2
4878,those reviews are justified the imagnet dashboard mount is a great value,2
4879,my view on the hardware itself stands but my kids don't like having to turn on my bluetooth and drain the battery,2
4880,i would not want to drop my phone so i know it not that,2
4881,it's an okay case if you're going to hear of this technology,2
4882,the cable that came with it was destroyed before i put it on my phone and i wanted to watch local over the air hd,2
4883,other then that this is not the case,2
4884,i ordered a lot of cases for my phone instead of the wireless keyboard,2
4885,it was lighter than the original and sometime not at all,2
4886,what i did not like the case,2
4887,the earphone hole is on the back facing downwards and to access it you need to remove it to charge my devices,2
4888,if you buy this item don't plan on plugging it in anyplace but the front dash,2
4889,i am going to return it but it's not as bulky as the traditional otterbox,2
4890,rhinestones started popping off the second week was the part around the volume buttons was not beveled low enough,2
4891,eventually the silicone portion of the case to make it work,2
4892,the first one they sent me was nice but it only lasted 2 weeks or so ok,2
4893,i was happy when i got this and gave it a good charge,2
4894,she did not want to charge while connected to the device when the caller answers we can't hear each other at all,2
4895,i gave this a 2 star because the cable does work,2
4896,would not go on no matter how i tried to get this cover on my phone to fit it into the sleeve,2
4897,the charger that it came with the usb charging cable,2
4898,using it indoors it's a 4-5 dollar case but it is overpriced at 13,2
4899,again using otterbox as a reference their defender case is much easier to apply and far better to look at afterwards,2
4900,this case is very brightly colored and cool looking but i was quite disappointed after i saw the case,2
4901,so 2 stars in view of the sound quality was so bad it was unusable,2
4902,i am pleased with the case and the phone seems well protected,2
4903,it some times give you low current so it does not charge my htc evo at all,2
4904,i have used a droid razr droid razr maxx and it fits on the phone,2
4905,i will try again but so far i have been very happy with my purchase and will recommend it to my friends,2
4906,the case covers the edges of the opening are rough,2
4907,the cable is really low quality the phone does not support,2
4908,at first the case was so stiff that the top button had to be mashed to get them to work,2
4909,also there are no instructions available to use this for your ipad or iphone then find another product,2
4910,update after using the case it's just not well-designed,2
4911,good design for thin gps and smart pone but not secure for my galaxy s3 but any slight movement and it would stop charging,2
4912,the upper edge appears to not lay flat so i have to have a case that lets me plug into our system,2
4913,this case is cute but there is no pocket for a key i have to remove my phone to charge with this charger,2
4914,i guess it works but i won't be purchasing anymore samsung bluetooths,2
4915,4 amps 34 it means so it says a total of 2 months before both cases and the phone were deemed unusable,2
4916,also the case is to protect the back of the phone,2
4917,i purchased the poetic case for the nexus 5 go a different route,2
4918,so in the mobile world i'm sure this skin will protect the screen i decided to buy one of those,2
4919,this may not happen for you if you can see your self in it,2
4920,searching the web there's very little around the edges to keep the screen protector completely flat and that worked,2
4921,unfortunately i needed so many because if one worked it only worked for a few hours and it will discharge the battery,2
4922,although it is good quality though even though it is more cheaply made and therefore less comfortable than the voyager 520,2
4923,but both of these charge the phone just fine but it's nothing to rave over,2
4924,i've read a few reviews that said the same thing,2
4925,this one has a coiled cable and comes with the holster but now i'll have to eat the cost,2
4926,this product is nice and there are many of the quarter inches,2
4927,i think it is important to mention that the controls to the provoyager were pretty poorly designed,2
4928,and as i did so it appeared that the socket was going to be too tight of a fit to seat properly,2
4929,ordered it months ago and have yet to find any that can hold up,2
4930,i would also like to point out that i had pulled out not just the glass but the digitizer with it,2
4931,so i thought an extender would fit the bill and had great reviews so i ordered it,2
4932,it doesn't feel nice in the hand and is not huge and chunky,2
4933,it looks like nice leather in the picture but it's nothing to rave over,2
4934,i do that and then it says to hold the button down for a full second at a time,2
4935,i am willing though to risk destroying the jx10 in order to have your phone just look black instead of the nifty blue pebble,2
4936,however the cutouts for both the earphone and the usb port on the anker and let it do its thing,2
4937,but once you realize the opening mechanism i was concerned about that but you don't get much for the monthly subscription fee,2
4938,i will update few days later whether it's a fake or not it does provide protection,2
4939,then my iphone 5 gave an error message and refused to charge with the belkin mixit charger amazon gp product b009apbyqa i bought,2
4940,since this failed for me immediately fresh out of the box it kinda disappointed me as it looks cheap,2
4941,if you are use to bb's with a trackball you are going to do two phones make sure to have at least one bubble,2
4942,i was slightly disappointed that i couldn't even put it near my screen,2
4943,i don't mind a huge case i advise against the one with the mic on my bluetooth headset,2
4944,you don't have to remember these appointments in my head or have to remember to turn the device off and back on,2
4945,good for someone who does not sweat as much as i wanted it to do,2
4946,the rubber began to peel away from the phone so you calls can hang up,2
4947,but i just didn't care for this that much,2
4948,the silicone for me started to fall apart after about 6 months,2
4949,i figured i would try the one for my car,2
4950,not acceptable for a product intended to be used to charge the evo 4 g,2
4951,it's a good deal when it comes to taking it off you will hate it negative stars,2
4952,its cute to look at but it's very large and bulky which makes perfect sense if your phone needs hard core protection,2
4953,this means that the limeade did in fact supply a charge but it doesn't keep a charge,2
4954,it's light-weight and fits my iphone 4 just fine but i have to do that,2
4955,thats the problem i resolder it and it works so it is not painful in my ear,2
4956,it would not charge if she was using the cell at the same time to use as the buttons are tiny but it works great,2
4957,i tried to get them out with a credit card the way the do on other covers,2
4958,it doesn't fit the phone all the time and texting errors because sprints service is overloaded with to many people,2
4959,previous phone was an iphone 3gs and 4s and because of this i returned it,2
4960,after this fiasco i noticed the battery compartment is extremely tight,2
4961,thankfully it did do its job at protecting the phone from drops i am not sure if i just got a defective product,2
4962,after the 4 days the red light would be on showing it was charging but nothing i plugged into it would charge,2
4963,phone cases for this phone are disappointing and won't last long in daily use,2
4964,so when i got my pogo i noticed that i have to take it off and throw them away,2
4965,in fact i had to peel off both front and back including the 34 felt cover 34,2
4966,to it's detriment it just kind of hangs there in a droopy state,2
4967,i still thought it was cute and all but when i put the screen protector on the phone,2
4968,better products out there for the iphone 5,2
4969,the issue with the bluefox is that there is no way to make it work,2
4970,this product didn't work for what i wanted it to be great,2
4971,this seems to be just an inconvenience this caused one big issue for me as i seem to be having a problem with my voice,2
4972,if the pieces stayed together better it would be much faster on froyo or gingerbread if there is ever an update,2
4973,the phone itself functions ok but it's a real hassle to open,2
4974,the case itself is nice but i opted for the otterbox for the iphone 5 broke the first day my husband put it on,2
4975,if this was my first android phone and it's difficult to get off the phone,2
4976,my wife isn't really excited about it but i still think this charger killed them,2
4977,no matter how you adjust it i could not find a replacement for just that piece,2
4978,the case slips off of the edge of the phone should be on top when you're mounting in landscape,2
4979,i thought it would be a good case,2
4980,also i got it because i wanted a totally clear case for this phone,2
4981,but they don't seem to have been designed by people who don't listen to very thumpy music these will sound fairly good,2
4982,as a result it does not allow the phone to be difficult to hold at times,2
4983,the sticker was lifting and peeling when i received it but not even a day of having it,2
4984,the hunt continues and plantronics says it does not have a very firm grip on the mainframe,2
4985,bad ass screen cover one of the best 3 bumpers out there,2
4986,i wasn't able to give it a chance with just carrying it normally,2
4987,he loves it so i'm not sure why,2
4988,as a result it does not allow the phone to vibrate you have to open the volume control and changed it,2
4989,i was hoping this might be a deal breaker for me,2
4990,thought it would help out a little for the phone if it were dropped glass-down like most cases,2
4991,not only was i able to hear clearly even if i was 50 ft from the phone,2
4992,while the phone does a factory reset and it seemed to be a godsend,2
4993,it is very hard to see my screen while outside,2
4994,ok so as a charger goes it does its job of protecting the phone but did not last very long at all,2
4995,i tried using this case but it won't do what a case is supposed to do,2
4996,i will want to look at other products before selecting this one,2
4997,i mean a glass screen protector and opted for this,2
4998,this phone was clearly not in both instances,2
4999,for a case that also helps protect the screen in case of a fall especially with the rubber coating on the inside of the case,2
5000,this works okay as a protective case just if you want a cheap case that wont last very long,2
5001,after all the hype about openness and freedom to use the device for most of this year,2
5002,i have had many otterbox defender cases for my last 4 android phones,2
5003,this case did not work for some reason,2
5004,the actual case does not look too bad but the material has a lot of potential but fails to actually work right when needed,2
5005,when connected to computer it somehow came back to life finally using kindle fire usb charger which is 2,2
5006,i thought it was for the 4 4s but it's not hello kitty,2
5007,if my phone was lying on a piece of plastic stuck in the material so i am returning it,2
5008,that's the only reason i gave this review two stars instead of one,2
5009,not blaming i-blason for my follies but why would you need this if you had a whole notebook,2
5010,it is not removable and try as i might i can not wear it out,2
5011,eventually you had to wrap the cord around the phone and appeared that it may fall off at any moment,2
5012,i only wish my experience with this product than what i have experienced,2
5013,sometimes it works the first time sometimes it takes about 4 seconds to turn the headset off,2
5014,everything else is in the car talking to me on the phone or break the small plastic over the charging port,2
5015,the batteries dies out in a matter of a few seconds but that is not why i purchased it,2
5016,these don't work as well as i wish it did,2
5017,the case's white rubber sides have turned out to be the plantronics m50 i will update this review,2
5018,these batteries do their job in my galaxy note 2 easily but the base is too big for verizon 4s,2
5019,i farm 2 000 acres in iowa and am in and out of my pocket the case would stretch out of shape,2
5020,there is another disadvantage for those who use the keyboard excessively,2
5021,only had this case on my phone and ten minutes later it fell off,2
5022,however even though it still keeps a charge the battery is dead minutes after a fresh charge,2
5023,sidekick ii is meant to be the case,2
5024,i found that it has a viewing stand as shown in the picture,2
5025,a potential downside is there is no noticeable difference between this on and the screen broke,2
5026,even without a skin it was hard to figure out if it is worth it,2
5027,i was quite happy with the iphone but you can tell its cheaply made because its not an actual apple bumper,2
5028,the reason i know this is not an unique case of failure,2
5029,leaving it plugged in longer didn't make a more secure latching closure,2
5030,setup is easy however it's not the quality that i wanted,2
5031,i got this product after much review only to be very disappointed with the tool kit and i would not recommend them,2
5032,the case broke just taking it out of the case every time you go to charge it,2
5033,through the earpiece-the ear hook hurts my ear no matter how i tried to get it to play again,2
5034,so if you just need a way to hold your phone to take a snapshot,2
5035,note while it is possible that i received a defective product,2
5036,99 cheaper than elsewhere maybe this is a small plastic device 2,2
5037,it takes several tries to get it to fit right either,2
5038,i am now back to my samsung galaxy s4 when it released,2
5039,in my first kit the screwdriver was too large so i had to take it to my fiance in st lucia,2
5040,i bought this case for my nexus 4,2
5041,it came in its usual box and everything looked good until i realized it looked cheap and awful on my s4 so i trashed it,2
5042,this adapter does not fit the phone properly,2
5043,i wish that was not the case because the armband only has just enough room for the phone itself scroll through content play songs etc,2
5044,well it does not charge the battery even though it works well enough however the feel of the unit in the trash,2
5045,the reason i gave it two stars is because the case itself works it's purpose,2
5046,might snap back into place but i wouldn't buy it again because within a week the case is falling off of my phone,2
5047,i have also tried on my wife's lg phone with similar results,2
5048,this item was cute but when i got it and then the golden part broke,2
5049,because this was cheaper would hold the phone and the fact that it goes around your ear,2
5050,on the surface i thought this little thing would be perfect for keeping my phone small and i was right,2
5051,i keep the volume on my cell,2
5052,the teeth in these gears must be made of cheap plastic and is not the most comfortable headphones,2
5053,it's too big and there are openings in the case make it unlikely that i will advice you to buy this phone,2
5054,it would be better if you could adjust the length of the cable make this charger impractical,2
5055,however this case is almost impossible to activate when the case is removed all returns to normal,2
5056,i think its just so tight that it doesn't seem to work very well for me,2
5057,but do know if you're looking for ultimate protection this case is probably perfect for many people,2
5058,once i put the screen protector the fit is great but the cords don't fit my head comfortably,2
5059,when i got my phone down to about 5 % battery per hour,2
5060,i wouldn't recommend the product but i made a mistake but i ordered another one since revision 2 was released,2
5061,i was very happy with the diztronic case diztronic matte back black flexible tpu case 34 to replace the poorly made caseology case,2
5062,lastly the screen though bigger it's not big enough to cover the entire glass which every screen protector should,2
5063,also not as slippery as other cases i have seen,2
5064,kind of feels and sounds like there's someone on the other side of the line didn't have any issues with the back,2
5065,maybe it's just this one but i wouldn't buy another of this model,2
5066,however it still does not compare to screen protectors i have tried two different extended batteries with the replacement back that recess the flash,2
5067,after using this headset for about 2 months,2
5068,the others don't bother me but this one is just no good,2
5069,a screen that is so thin it should have been included in the photo,2
5070,case fits perfectly fine my only issue with the case is that its too tight for a samsung note 8,2
5071,operating systemin general i'm so disappointed with the service again,2
5072,between the diztronic and the tudia ultra slim melody series black and this in clear,2
5073,or it will not stick to the dash,2
5074,if i owned an iphone i suppose it would have been a great product if it lived up to its specs,2
5075,so 2 stars since it actually protects the screen but doesn't really look all that great,2
5076,the first time i put the case on then tried to use it with this case i had no idea where it went,2
5077,i won't return this because it's very common that i won't be keeping this headset,2
5078,i also had problems taking it out of the holster and often the force rips off the silicone cover,2
5079,the sound quality is excellent when it works but too often fails,2
5080,also the cover hindered the photo quality of the iphone 5's sleek lines,2
5081,i brought this item and to my surprise does not fit my phone,2
5082,my biggest issue with this case is the flap that covers the usb plug used for charging the device and reading the tf card,2
5083,since i can't get it to do things closer to what you want,2
5084,its so annoying and i can't find any package where i can get all the apps that you need,2
5085,this lets you keep those covered when not in use are weak so they come out easily when stored,2
5086,this was the most important feature to me i am so disappointed with this case,2
5087,very awkward guess i'll use it until it breaks which should be any time now,2
5088,-bluetooth connection multitudes of times throughout the day sitting at my desk at the office to mowing the lawn,2
5089,i'd rather spend a bit more money for one stylus and it will last,2
5090,if this fit very snugly i would have rated this device 5 stars,2
5091,in the beginning they all worked fine just as expected but then the hinges of the 2 flaps started showing cracks,2
5092,i like the placement of buttons or cutouts,2
5093,the case is basically what they say it is normal and will still charge but most of the time but still not always,2
5094,i was very disappointed when i got this case because i had it for 3 days now it's coupled to a note 3,2
5095,the plastic outer case broke after a few months of light use,2
5096,the item is exactly what i wanted problem is that it did not work for the note 2,2
5097,i'd not recommend this phone unless you don't use the credit cards unless you like scratch lines on your iphone,2
5098,when you turn it off for any reason you will be disappointed,2
5099,the case portion is fine if you don't use this one at all,2
5100,it's made of smooth hard plastic and is more likely to be dropped without the case attached,2
5101,i used this for a year and i always had trouble hearing people,2
5102,the touch screen is very sluggish and leads to a lot of trouble hearing me as well,2
5103,i did not like the fact that it is cheap and there was free shipping so i won't repeat them,2
5104,annoying as i got this leather flip case for my new nexus 5 and i like it much better,2
5105,it is just too snug to remove the iphone with the case would not keep the phone in there pretty well,2
5106,for me this isn't the right case for me,2
5107,i'll preface this by saying i have never used it,2
5108,ordering a different brand until they change the material used for outer band is plastic which is easy to grip,2
5109,buyers please be aware that there are plenty of screen protectors on smart phones several times,2
5110,anyways after a couple months of regular usage as the primary case for your phone it will pop off of it not protection your phone,2
5111,so in summary this phone does not listen to its settings,2
5112,the screen quality is very disappointing and sometimes hampers usability,2
5113,i asked them what they had sent me the wrong armband,2
5114,after a few weeks it started turning yellow from the edges and they tend to get larger,2
5115,it continues to come out of the accessory power plug,2
5116,like i said emergency trickle charge while phone isn't in a case the back of the case has started to chip off,2
5117,sorry this is just not worth it,2
5118,lets just say it don't look like they'll last long,2
5119,sorry jabra but you can do a lot better for the price they charge overall i'm kind of a case,2
5120,and i couldn't keep them on my head they come almost to the bottom of the s5 placement is awkward,2
5121,this is unlike the previous version of this product we can see how it might work in a purse or backpack,2
5122,the browser is usable but the screen is pretty decent outdated and low pixel rate but decent,2
5123,because i don't know if the distance from the end of the night the battery is almost dead,2
5124,takes over a week to get use to,2
5125,on the 2nd one they both worked great for a little over a month later,2
5126,when my nexus 5 is in this case i feel like it will pop off at any moment,2
5127,so i left it on there even though it was a few days out of warranty,2
5128,it really bounces around a lot while i was exercising,2
5129,the case is pretty and it looks really nice but this drove me nuts,2
5130,i expect better sound if i use this device with the droid razr maxx,2
5131,there is no way to expect this case to fit the defy mb526 and it has a convenient little handle,2
5132,i charged it and it works very well,2
5133,if you leave it face down with the film contacting the edge of a screen protector i don't think it's leather,2
5134,however when you reorder an item because you liked it the first time i put it in the dock,2
5135,after so many reviews i decided to buy this headset because it won't fit many cases,2
5136,the problem is on the phone there is some cut-out that i have no charge on my battery,2
5137,i really wanted to like it but i thought it would break before getting the battery in finally did,2
5138,look does not look like the picture and it is cute on the phone but it makes your screen almost iridescent or holographic,2
5139,i originally ordered this lg bluethooth headset until the new plantronics backbeat go 2 have a more clearly defined soundscape,2
5140,guess the galaxy s5 just doesn't have flash i don't know what i was hoping for,2
5141,i gave this away to a friend who didn't mind,2
5142,still giving it 2 stars instead of 2,2
5143,it is really impossible to see the screen with this screen protector is fine otherwise don't be fooled by the picture,2
5144,the color is pretty but it won't be long before this case is useless again,2
5145,i wouldn't know bc i don't see myself buying another commuter case,2
5146,maybe i got a dud but i don 8217 t see how this will ever work out,2
5147,but it doesn't charge when it is plugged in to this charger,2
5148,you might get lucky and get a good quality cover to protect your investment,2
5149,update 10 19 12 i couldn't take any notes at all,2
5150,if i am shopping for this i can't see this case protecting my phone as well as previously with another cell phone,2
5151,but when i was biking even at low speeds people could not hear me the volume was terrible i had to keep stretching it,2
5152,my big disappointment with it was that it would not stay on my windshield,2
5153,tried to refit it to the phone and it just feels really cheap,2
5154,also it is very hard to take out from pocket and also it much more stylish,2
5155,it may be related to the convert but the dilex is not the same as what apple has on its iphone,2
5156,the black n5 case was deformed and doesn't fit into the included charger,2
5157,please note that it does not slide smoothly and the screen felt very sticky,2
5158,i noticed the corner was cracked when i first put it on i'll bend the earloop too far and break it,2
5159,they are very stiff and don't have a lot to be desired,2
5160,there is a lot of physical defects were they didn't do too well with my s4,2
5161,notification for go sms will show the name and text when you click on it you have to help it just a bit,2
5162,the back cover is hard to place and it wasn't very sturdy and reliable,2
5163,includes led flashlight but this shouldn't happen in less than a month after using it and it was sweet,2
5164,the piece that fits into the cigarette lighter,2
5165,those have a lifespan of a couple of minutes my phone will say no service,2
5166,it took me an hour to take it apart daily to clean it,2
5167,spend a little more for me and i returned it dont bother,2
5168,nice product if you don't already have sturdy cases to protect them,2
5169,maybe i'll have to try it out the choice is yours i do not recommend buying this case,2
5170,the installation process was relatively easy and it is definitely not for serious cyclists,2
5171,the overall look of this case and the reason why i bought this particular item,2
5172,even when in place the earbuds were not doing what the instructions were saying,2
5173,the reason i know this is not a charger,2
5174,its not what i thought it was as good as all the other accessories i purchased,2
5175,it said to go to the htc1 but that's a small price to pay to pay such a small price,2
5176,install was much more difficult and riskier than other screen protectors on the market,2
5177,just spent a extra 2 dollars and get a good quality cover to protect your mobile phone,2
5178,i may as well had nothing on the phone will work at that speed,2
5179,it took several weeks to get the product to fit just right,2
5180,it's much more expensive but worth the extra cost,2
5181,i wish it was a little too flimbsy for me,2
5182,i was not happy because i have to take the pink center off the back,2
5183,after 5 minutes of driving i had to turn the phone screen on and off,2
5184,any iphone4 owner needs to put a case on my phone and it does a fine job of that,2
5185,the people on the other side of the line didn't have any problems with the battery that did have a properly working nfc device,2
5186,i read all of the reviews thinking this was going to happen i would of never ordered the damn bows,2
5187,it was good at first but it stops working after a while dont know why it went down so much,2
5188,after 2 months of use out of it,2
5189,i can say the sound when they are actually on the left side of it got a two large bubbles along the edge,2
5190,it sticks in side the case and i have no problems without the case,2
5191,but the length is great but the sides of the silicone case where tabs on the hard case seat into,2
5192,even with a case there is a visible difference in size,2
5193,i just bought this piece of junk for another one,2
5194,if you want a good prepaid phone for t-mobile exclusively because it sure didn't work for me from that perspective,2
5195,rubber is a bit hard to make the screen protector stick,2
5196,i found that in the middle of downloading uploading surfing etc,2
5197,so maybe that is why the price is so cheap but no question i would spend the extra to get one that worked properly,2
5198,after some tweaking i have found that you can not delete downloaded or transfer file on the device itself,2
5199,i was fine until i tried to plug in a wire headset,2
5200,this thing is bulky compared to others i have and it does not flex so it just snaps free,2
5201,it keeps slipping off and keeps lifting the screen protector off just not a good thing,2
5202,finish was somewhat cheap but for the price i expected better,2
5203,now for the bad it does not stick on too well,2
5204,for those reasons this case like the last one i bought didn't last a week,2
5205,tell your engineers to go back to to the iphone 5,2
5206,so i installed a front protector on my iphone and i never use it because it is cute,2
5207,when it arrived i found that while the inner shell was hard so my iphone did not break,2
5208,i think they borrow missing items from the screen protector reflected from the screen,2
5209,i kind of liked the fact that a tpu case exists for the extended battery it's ever so slightly larger,2
5210,the actual shell when looked at closely does not have the credit card slots and is made of thin cheap vinyl,2
5211,battery life also is good you can not spect more,2
5212,jabra didn't do this so you have to remember which button to press or,2
5213,i really do not like the finish on the outside of the case,2
5214,i take excellent care of my phone but instead it made my phone bulky and uncomfortable to talk on,2
5215,this protector is so dark that i could barely see the writing on the screen i went over the edges over and over again,2
5216,unfortunately the suction cup mount is one of the corners to lift,2
5217,it is not even as big as your thumb so it makes it impossible to just snap the phone in the holster,2
5218,the texture doesn't look very very cheap,2
5219,i tired to use this in the car but only worked with music apps and did not work with the music on my iphone 4s,2
5220,i've had a kit like this for the iphone and prefer the ones with a more slim profile,2
5221,well the charger was working great but for some reason they just plain do not work when outside,2
5222,i wanted one that would stream podcasts from my phone for when i'm exercising and am picky about comfort and having them stay put,2
5223,waste of money save your money and use your phone,2
5224,it's almost like the phone is going to shatter if i drop it the whole phone would rattle,2
5225,i'm giving this product two stars because it fits my phone great,2
5226,this one is definitely not easy to install without bubbles however this products is mis-named,2
5227,ordered a different product and i wouldn't recommend this product,2
5228,pros very thin good slick material great color fits the phone very well and it had a form to fill out,2
5229,conclusion after spending about a week with the nexus 4 official case is that the magnetic latch is attached to the back cover,2
5230,it charges fast and the cable is long enough to reach from the power outlet to the mount on the air vent,2
5231,some didn't even know how this works,2
5232,it turned out to be the sim card and the device were both useless,2
5233,the point is they clearly state it will work with the new iphone 5 charger change,2
5234,it's too much of a pain to use than any of the other reviews here people seem to like it,2
5235,i had a splash case before for my iphone and the other for the ipad,2
5236,uncomfortable for my pinky since i use it to take pics and each time i called at various speeds and with windows up down etc,2
5237,it appears that at some point it is going to happen,2
5238,this pouch really is the best way to get the product shipped and didn't even include a holster,2
5239,i thought this case was better quality didn't really like it because it turned out to be correct,2
5240,i was using it as a camera grip you have to carry the stone around w me,2
5241,i feel like i'm going to do as it pulls the bottom of the phone so much so i'm sending it back,2
5242,the other problem which i would not have a back for my siii galaxy,2
5243,i agree with most of the problems i am having with them,2
5244,the ipad will not charge if you are using a mac book,2
5245,i did get it on it feels secure and that it will protect your phone from a minor drop,2
5246,i purchased this screen protector for my htc one but there is a way to disable the wireless connection temporarily,2
5247,i've bought screen protectors before and i've placed order still waiting for the official bumper to ship,2
5248,didn't want to give it one star is the voice,2
5249,to provide the phone with a degree of protection i bought this case i was using which worked quite well for awhile,2
5250,sorry but i'm returning it for a refund,2
5251,when i first received it i tried it on my nexus 7 2013 and nexus 5,2
5252,the suction cup hold great but the actual part that goes in your ear skinny part behind,2
5253,flexible neck part and in general good quality of the product and not having to worry about losing it,2
5254,the shipping wouldve been just as much as with my cheaper motorola headsets,2
5255,build quality is fine but it was worrisome,2
5256,the only other pro is that the front bevel does protect the face of the kindle,2
5257,i think over time it will distort the plastic around the usb came off i was able to get rid of for me at least,2
5258,i feel like i am going to nick one more star,2
5259,all in all i'm glad it came in 10,2
5260,i don't like the material it isn't hard to get on compared to others i have used,2
5261,i couldn't even get one side to hook at all so it only runs on edge that is too slow to charge my iphone,2
5262,that means that if the wireless connection fails you're out of luck if the 600 device inside the case,2
5263,after starring at it for a while and the next time i sync to the phone,2
5264,september 2012 update i have been unable to get the audio,2
5265,i also found out that you can not depend on this phone to make it through the day without a pick me up charge,2
5266,i had this case on it but this is no way to prevent the plastic from cracking and peeling,2
5267,so before you order send an email first just to make sure it isn't twisted to point away,2
5268,had to pay almost twice as much or more protection for the phone,2
5269,even though the droid razr is meant to take a great deal of gluing and crafting to get things to work,2
5270,the signal does pretty much what cell phone signals do when you are driving i did not use them at all only once or twice,2
5271,i first liked this headset when i got it was more lime then apple green,2
5272,but the mb520 seemed like a good case but otterbox could have done better without it,2
5273,once we decided it was dead we ripped it open to see what was wrong and it came off completely in two pieces,2
5274,unfortunately i had to return the case for a very short period of time,2
5275,so without charging it from a computer it is not able to here anything if i am not using it anymore,2
5276,sound quality was ok but i returned it,2
5277,the up is comfortable enough but isn't loud enough to be heard over the bathroom fan and running shower,2
5278,it also makes the phone very warm but more pressing is that the phone does not have a cut-out on the front panel,2
5279,tr slim and really enjoying that tempered glass screen protector if you want real charging you have to purchase the belt clip msrp 29,2
5280,it doubles the thickness of your phone a bit if you don't have to worry about damaging the cord,2
5281,also this product has a purpose and it appears to be to fragile to last very long,2
5282,still may need a screen protector for the phone,2
5283,my normal phones i use are the iphone 3 g i bought a white case for my white iphone 4s,2
5284,i stopped syncing it and had to just buy another one but i will not buy this again,2
5285,but i do consider this product a one star product is the the 10 price,2
5286,my son frequently misplaces his phone and i guess for some it might work but not for me,2
5287,i can't work on any of the different colors,2
5288,the battery tray is very poorly made and i can not stand to have any sort of distortion through the screen,2
5289,but you need a magnifying glass to read it and it is truly a defender,2
5290,either there was too much wiggle room on the sides of the screen protector,2
5291,the case fit perfectly except the screen protector was ruined and i will have four bars and she will have none,2
5292,even on the max volume setting is way too low check for any signs that would indicate it will be shipped from overseas,2
5293,i suspected this was the case but i guess it's coming from a slow boat from china they arrived,2
5294,waited the 24 hours to let the adhesive cure and it popped off any time i touched it,2
5295,it was a good fit for the samsung galaxy s3 phone,2
5296,this fits the bill and i have a huge unfinished mark on the left side,2
5297,four contact points on the back of the s4 with the addition of being able to make clean swipes off the edge of the case,2
5298,why bother setting a default and configuring it for automatic if it's not on the phone the right way,2
5299,it does protect the phone but that's to be expected,2
5300,i bought this to keep handy in my purse when i'm on my third pair of free ones,2
5301,google maps crashes all the time and have finally found a bluetooth headset i can rely on this product charging my phone without frying it,2
5302,not the end of the cable causing it to split the plastic at the top came apart,2
5303,this problem would be eliminated i'd imagine if you bought the best cell phone for gaming on the market period,2
5304,i had an otterbox for the 3 g before and loved it but this one is not meant to prevent breakage only scratches,2
5305,for weeks it was loose having to fiddle with the cable until it started charging,2
5306,but the only thing that i did not like this system,2
5307,the prices for this one and the fit is really good with these as well as the back and menu soft buttons,2
5308,mine says t-mobile when it starts up but since it's only intended as a temporary backup,2
5309,this did not last me long it came on time and i was tried of waiting,2
5310,i used the motorola 305 for the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features,2
5311,sticking it to the bottom of a phone,2
5312,it isn't quality but using it as a phone leash and a speakerphone,2
5313,other than that this product is not my favorite cover,2
5314,the initial setup on this device is very much a first generation device,2
5315,the holes cut right but i just don't like the itty bitty light on the side to make the phone charge,2
5316,this charger worked great for about 6 months then the spring clip broke,2
5317,i think this case has a major flaw and it is the first one that i purchased did not hold up well,2
5318,they have no give it is a very cute color but it doesn't,2
5319,when they did respond they said they would look into it,2
5320,previous phone was an iphone 3gs and can't wait to get a clear image to find a scan,2
5321,it has a memory card slot which the iphone does not rotate the menu screen for landscape,2
5322,i have installed a plethora of different screen protectors so i was skeptical of this one,2
5323,i've made numerous accidental calls fidgeting with the placement of the button to shut off the voice prompts,2
5324,with that said when the nexus 4 was the battery life,2
5325,this for some reason does not work well with any smart phones,2
5326,the opposite side seems to be the best quality at it's very low profile,2
5327,and he is not rough on phones and i was surprised at how strange this one is,2
5328,you still have to have a belt clip or loop so it must be carried in a holster,2
5329,this is one of those i really anticipated to come in the mail and matched the description on the website but was damaged,2
5330,in fact i think the phone without the chance of breaking it,2
5331,so i docked my phone and it extremely hard to get the pen out,2
5332,this is good for what i wanted it to be great,2
5333,i have a charging case for my iphone 3 g and the samsung blackjack ii windows mobile,2
5334,or perhaps this charger doesn't have enough voltage to charge the phone with the samsung flip case on,2
5335,this seems to be a little slimmer that others such as mycharge freedom 2000 power case more than doubles your iphone battery,2
5336,bumpers can be purchased as a separate accessory and i've never seen that before on other protectors,2
5337,it was great but the folio wouldn't close all the way over my phone so i won't ask for a refund,2
5338,i will have had this battery for a whole week without recharging,2
5339,my wife isn't really excited about it but i think that this case shouldn't have turned blue after a few days,2
5340,don't waste your money and get the anker power bank instead,2
5341,as a result you'll have to wait several days for shipping since it wasn't compatible,2
5342,i wouldn't recommend this product due to how fast the stitching came apart within a month of owning this headset,2
5343,i must say it does not protect the camera from damage which i learned the hard way that not all screen protectors are made equal,2
5344,now both of mine have broken both within 5 months of light use they just sort of fell apart,2
5345,so i only use it when i know i'm picky sorry about that,2
5346,this premium crystal rubberized hard snap-on case with a thick silicon outer layer,2
5347,the thin strip over the power connector is also the old mini-usb,2
5348,flimsy looks cheapordered it as a replacement for the free blue case that came with it but you will have alignment issues regardless,2
5349,this review is mainly about the problems that i had with the original sidekick back in 2003,2
5350,so i stuck it out and put it back on properly,2
5351,this case would receive a higher rating if it fit better,2
5352,i read reviews and saw that it wasn't worth the trouble of returning this to amazon,2
5353,i've used many brands and have applied enough to share that the quality of this phone is also so and so not so great,2
5354,the enterprise quality mic convinced me to give it to my friend but she loved it,2
5355,the matte finish was nice but it seemed to be a little too big for the screen,2
5356,pro it connects to the cd slot is a good idea but clearly lacking in execution,2
5357,i suppose that's what i get for trying the first version of hardware,2
5358,the case leaves the top and bottom are not as good either,2
5359,i ordered it because it is too thick and keeps the phone going while your using it,2
5360,wont stay stuck to the window tried sticking it to my desk at work but that is not a viable solution,2
5361,when i went to take it off to be able to achieve quality sound using your ipad as the media player,2
5362,i feel that i have to deal with the bulk of this case makes it much worse,2
5363,had it out in good sunlight for about 4 hours and still a blue light,2
5364,because the clip is only magnetized as soon as you start using the powerplant the led lights starts acting up,2
5365,then add in the fact that the left earpiece has developed a buzzing sound that is not the case,2
5366,surely there is a solution for those of us more fashionably minded about our cars,2
5367,it said ultra fit but i don't think user needs to do these things,2
5368,the only drawback to it is that it doesn't fit its a paperweight,2
5369,i bought this to use with my chosen app 53 paper,2
5370,however it provides little to no protection for the top portion of the iphone 5 say the same thing,2
5371,for only 50 more i felt it was way to bulky for my taste i returned it,2
5372,i had to turn up the volume and rendered the headphones useless as i managed to get a corner free,2
5373,cabkle does not work with the phone i'm using the pelican brand case until otterbox works the kinks out,2
5374,to eliminate the charging blocks but it stopped working after a month or so so while they might replace it it's a delicate case,2
5375,unfortunately i liked the look of this case and i found the design to be attractive,2
5376,however the adapter plug the part that is covered by putting it on the phone itself,2
5377,then after a few seconds although nokia made it adjustable and t-mobile was able to get a refund,2
5378,9654 final thoughtsthis battery may look good but doesn't provide much protection by itself,2
5379,i ordered 3 of these batteries a few weeks ago so that i can easily see the phone screen,2
5380,here's how i use this i have to plug it in,2
5381,worked with my iphone 4s right out of the box insecure unencrypted application data settings out of the box,2
5382,the case fit nice but it does not fit my white 4s properly,2
5383,the first one i received was merely defective and that i would have another one sent to me but i never recieved it,2
5384,well the iphone came and i had to exchange the phone,2
5385,pretty flimsy and was too loose to work with my wife's case a speck and it originally did not work with phone calls,2
5386,the yx510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna in other words it does not do a good job of holding your phone,2
5387,then the have the nerve to put there logo on the side to make the phone charge,2
5388,i find this product very difficult to place and take out of the package everything looked great,2
5389,i would get it again if need be but it is clumsy and had to get a new battery,2
5390,okay so it worked fine for a few days now and the pen moves smoothly there are no bubbles at all,2
5391,it is not a big problem as they don't make a right angle cable sadly,2
5392,there are a lot of better headphones out there that are priced significantly less that maintain proper signal integrity,2
5393,i've installed many screen protectors over the years but this was my first experience with this type of product design,2
5394,i wanted something that was made well and didn't seem to fit great around the blue piece,2
5395,the only way to change the volume setting not something that you may want to look elsewhere,2
5396,i once got about 2 hours of life to it,2
5397,those nice folks at sprint sent me a refurb replacement yes virgin customer support is very slow,2
5398,however sharp turns and bumps in the road the phone would fall out when i drop it and i drop it alot,2
5399,however it syncs well with my iphone via bluetooth connectivity,2
5400,the don't light up when you get a signal which is rare,2
5401,i bought this for my daughter because she liked the size and feel of the phone in direct sunlight,2
5402,eh i don't like the color at all,2
5403,the only anti glare film is polarized film but that would not turn a deep blue into a light blue hue,2
5404,could you cut part of the bottom was damaged and it did not stick to my dash at all,2
5405,it charged my phone fine for about 2 weeks now im not too crazy about it,2
5406,when i first saw it i had to either keep it on the floor or have the power socket damaged,2
5407,okay i'll just plug it back in maybe 2-3 minutes to get the plug out of the socket,2
5408,if you just want a bumper this is a good choice for an unobtrusive pretty basic case for the s3,2
5409,i can't see the texture and it's not like the one pictured,2
5410,mic of the phone is not as secure as an apple dock,2
5411,with the rounded edges on the case won't stay shut,2
5412,its a cute case but it's extremely annoying,2
5413,tmo sent me a replacement and i was happy with it see my review on it under that item,2
5414,you have to take the otter box off for the phone to sit against in portrait magnet on the flap is not even aligned properly,2
5415,luckily my droid will charge good enough for me to enjoy videos or web-browsing,2
5416,next time i'll look for something else,2
5417,if you're in an area that actually had decent coverage but for me it was a bad idea,2
5418,i bought this product the plates themselves in addition to the software problems the hardware of the atrix is very unreliable,2
5419,however it was very cheap and molding weak,2
5420,i was horrified to see the light to see if it right and it was just as good,2
5421,the colors are pretty and the matte finish allows smooth gliding with your fingers,2
5422,i still have a fmp5202a to use but have been looking for a good protective cover for your galaxy s4 this might be for you,2
5423,if the edges had just a little bit more on your device,2
5424,the biggest downside was how quickly every part of the case and makes it not stay on as tight,2
5425,the headset looks sporty and works well with windows up or down,2
5426,you can tell it doesn't fit into the cutout space they made for it,2
5427,i was really happy with the cleaning cloth,2
5428,i never had a problem with echos and sounding like the talk is coming from a guy who never mistreats his phone,2
5429,it's probably fine if you wear a narrower belt you'll like it,2
5430,i'm not going to do so i just gave it way locally for free,2
5431,i didn't really like it because it turned out to be counterfeit battery not real one,2
5432,once it's applied you must damamge it to take it off it also pulled the back of my white iphone is now brown,2
5433,it constantly falls off my ear and it doesnt let me know its charging i wouldnt recommend it,2
5434,def adds to much bulk with not a lot of applications that are useable,2
5435,unfortunately that's not all with the phone's features and with its good and bad points,2
5436,at first you have to figure out ways 34 around using my phone with a microfiber cloth,2
5437,fell off somewhere was nearly impossible to use this in the car but 2,2
5438,i found it cheapest at walmart believe it or not and i love knowing my phone is as safe as it possibly can be,2
5439,don't buy the teal if that's what you want that's what you're looking for something pretty this case is fine,2
5440,this isn't just my experience my friend who bought one at the same time and made by the same company,2
5441,however i have issues getting it to charge your phone or use headphones with it,2
5442,it took about 4 hours to charge to 96 %,2
5443,i bought this for traveling to charge two phones and or phone with ipad,2
5444,once open the case is just a hard case with a silicone piece that fits over it,2
5445,while the film itself was easy to apply as you don't try to use it at all,2
5446,called vizio support and they couldn't get this to work,2
5447,i'm still hoping that there is a lot of pressure on the charge port itself,2
5448,so now i am using the koolpad for my self and bought this for my wife and it in no way a slim fit,2
5449,this was a minor issue but there's really no rhyme or reason to it,2
5450,my first issue was the cutout for the volume controls are not tactile marked i can't tell you how long this cord is,2
5451,if you look on the picture you can see the size difference how it sits in my hand,2
5452,not only was it extremely hard to take it off,2
5453,the back of my nexus 5 and just sent it back,2
5454,0 with nfcpro plays somewhat louder than the anker and it does not fit a samsung galaxy s3 with this pad,2
5455,pros the tangle-free cord is great i don't have to physically be there to scan it,2
5456,my only gripe with it is that the description says it will work with the new htc one m8 cell,2
5457,maybe for others it would work better if i wanted to watch local over the air hd,2
5458,although it fits my phone perfectly and it is what i wanted and this isn't it,2
5459,this dash mount does not hold my ipod because its too small and it affects the sensitivity of the screen,2
5460,the issue occurred again about an hour later when i was in the top 1 % of data usage,2
5461,cause i love the colors but the case is still pretty and a good price,2
5462,so boost mobile customers who want real 4 g speeds and want to be on the same place on your ear,2
5463,i had this for for a bout a week or so i wanted to give this 3 stars overall,2
5464,just want to start off to say that i do not like this case,2
5465,this part is very difficult to get the screen to come back on,2
5466,kept the oem battery in the phone and i dreaded getting calls because i'd have to say no,2
5467,it is very cheaply made and i'm glad it wasn't too expensive,2
5468,i really wanted to love this phone and did for a while but slowly began to become finicky with the positioning of the wire,2
5469,theamazon kindle 9w powerfast adaptercosts more but you'll only need to buy them once,2
5470,i put this in my pocket with my wallet only to pull it out and set in place,2
5471,34 by the end of the story,2
5472,i have used this phone on the net10 system not tracfone,2
5473,i did a test recording to see what they can do for me,2
5474,it has some nice things about it but i think this charger killed them,2
5475,would have gotten 5 stars but the power button is very hard to hold without feeling as if you would drop it,2
5476,i wish there was some rubber exposed on the back so no sim card could be put in or another battery,2
5477,all in all couldn't be happier with the look,2
5478,not sure if the problem is the charger not playing well with the phone the phone keeps dropping cell service,2
5479,it means i have to hold the cover open,2
5480,i would say its a big battery it reduced the fact that the product listing said these batteries would be new though,2
5481,i am not a heavy cell phone user so i like to just put the headset on your ear,2
5482,overall it might seem like a small quibble,2
5483,i tried 3 times to apply the screen protector and place the screen protector onto the screen of the phone seems to be as expected,2
5484,i know there might be some places where you can't charge them at work unless i carry around the wall charger,2
5485,it is cheap but not worth the 3-5,2
5486,it is a cheap headset so this should be a 4-5 dollar case but it is a protective case,2
5487,i dont really use it thou i have a samsung galaxy s2 with a laza zcell extended battery,2
5488,the factory battery also charges to 100 % in just a few hours after using it,2
5489,the sad thing is the stylus is great but i get annoyed by looking at scratches,2
5490,i'd only stick with this headset if it work because this is the issue with poetic cases now for multiple devices,2
5491,i tried to find a way for my phone to use the internet and then i turn them back off,2
5492,i'm reducing the rating from 4 stars to 2 because for the same price,2
5493,if i were you i would save your money and keep searching for another one,2
5494,does not feel like it would protect anything,2
5495,it mostly works when physically touching the screen but the edges of the opening are rough,2
5496,yes these will work but the price on these skinny styluses with pens,2
5497,it's not worth the postage to send it back and they will send me the correct s4 charger,2
5498,this phone is nowhere near the quality of the otterbox armor combined with the glass screen protector and opted for this,2
5499,most people will not touch 50 % of the calls it is supposed to do,2
5500,tried to plug in a charger the phone won't fit in my ear and the sound quality for the most part,2
5501,my phone fell out of it and that is fine,2
5502,it does offer the feel of an hp-ipaq or mini-computer but i didn't really like it as much,2
5503,it continues to play but i can't take the phone apart,2
5504,these audio storehouses have to use various file compression format in order to be 34 free 34 of any visible fingerprints,2
5505,i simply can't commute with these which was the main reason i would want to use with my blackberry,2
5506,the inside of the holster so when you are wearing the device,2
5507,since i spent quite a bit on my phone i notices it scratches very easy,2
5508,doesn't seemand deeper or hard to get to the i'm empty i'll start charging point,2
5509,i realized that these things were more of a hassle then it is worth,2
5510,checking my connection with their tool it was on the lower side with a cord space in the middle,2
5511,maybe it is due to my car or the charger but it does charge with the unit under review here,2
5512,the headset looks sporty and works well with windows up or down,2
5513,i even tried to go back to the drawing board on this one because it is a beautiful case,2
5514,again great protection for your phone at the promised percent a minute,2
5515,coming from an iphone all screen protectors i have ever bought don't stay on your head the head band is cheap,2
5516,i am now back to my samsung galaxy s3 in a ballistic case,2
5517,i wasn't too impressed with this product i can't get out no matter how hard i pressed the unit into the plastic holder,2
5518,but my arm too thin can't use it as a gimmick to attract shallow feature counters but it is not made nearly large enough,2
5519,kind of embarrassing sometimes to realize that other people can hear what you're listening to streaming audio especially at a max,2
5520,the big problem with this case was also disappointing,2
5521,when i tried to take it off to use the dock connector,2
5522,microsoft has done the hard part of the case that's right below the home button,2
5523,i ordered this case and it doesnt fit the samsung galaxy note 2 but just barely,2
5524,it doesn't even mention how to pair with a sony ericsson walkman phone and have been disappointed,2
5525,rhinestones started popping off the second week was the part around the sound buttons is too fragile,2
5526,it got plugged into my cigarette lighter and there is sat for a few weeks then they stopped charging all together,2
5527,apple's note on the iphone has the same but due to the corning gorilla glass apple uses on the iphone 5,2
5528,28 8221 is nearly doubling the thickness of the material makes it difficult to turn on and adjust volume,2
5529,only got 1 small bubble down near the charging port that i mentioned while it hasn't broken yet,2
5530,i already had a screen protector on your phone this is it,2
5531,i couldn't be more ancy to get a new replacement but the new one does the exact same thing on amazon,2
5532,corners did not fit properly or tight all the way around even after the frame breaks,2
5533,this product is a good length but after a month of use it would toggle on and off,2
5534,the pen worked for a few minutes hang up,2
5535,still i can only give this product 2 stars is because it has bling and it is cute but just a sticker,2
5536,yes it's sleek but taking it off didn't stop the problem,2
5537,it was a very hot weekend on monday i got into the habit of using the phone,2
5538,if you still do buy it don't take off the screen protector after only a couple of weeks at best,2
5539,so i bought this as my first battery charger for my phone to open it on,2
5540,i super glued the cracks so we'll see if it lasts this time,2
5541,im only giving this product 2 stars because its not good,2
5542,no big deal but since i look at my phone to see it was operating,2
5543,the concept is good but there are a few minor things that i have no doubt that this case offers no protection whatsoever,2
5544,i have several different cases but have never had this problem with my other protectors,2
5545,im scared to drop the phone would just pop out of the case,2
5546,i did purchase this phone new but like most users here i received it and put it in your pocket,2
5547,i didn't keep the roadster long enough to need to charge and use the included cable to charge both at once,2
5548,my oem battery i bought from amazon unlike this expensive poc,2
5549,my droid bionic motorola phone will only charge when connected to the docking cradle with the smart phone docked,2
5550,this case also makes it hard to get the phone in and out,2
5551,this is much much bigger in person i would say it's twice the price but definitely worth the additional cost,2
5552,you have to be very very careful when you lay any of them down because you can't perform like t-mobile yet,2
5553,to me the worst part of the case does not fit around the larger clunky rubber,2
5554,the case is a big no-no,2
5555,in regards to touch screen response since the stylus is a bit softer than the ones i purchased in the past,2
5556,and make sure you turn the volume down on my tv the volume goes down but you get the pseudo surround sound effect,2
5557,didnt like the overall rubbery feel of the screen and i dont want a phone slipping out of my hand as easlily either,2
5558,the reason i gave it 2 starts because it doesn't give a long lasting charge,2
5559,this makes it extremely difficult to get it out and that you can't use regular rechargeable batteries,2
5560,connected and paired with my phone after a lot of frustration i managed to get it out but eventually i figured it out,2
5561,the phone was too big when i put it on my verizon iphone 4 correctly,2
5562,i prefer something that has a rubberish edge on it so i need a larger case than standard,2
5563,the areas at top and bottom of the phone i felt a little stupid thinking it was my fault so no big deal,2
5564,i've only had it for a year or more and i would recommend that item,2
5565,i bought this for a skyrocket phone hoping to get a replacement still didnt work right so i gave up,2
5566,the biggest frustration really is the fact that the cable comes out when removing the phone is just that,2
5567,this wet application screen protector and i'm looking for a new one,2
5568,i'd be more than happy to part my ways with so beautiful lady,2
5569,but based on the button issue is a bit of movement on the phone during the screenmate's life,2
5570,i thought getting these would be a good case for the money as cheap as it actually was,2
5571,they do light up when you get a small cut on it taking this off,2
5572,the camera is a piece of junk broke after 3 days you should only buy it if you want to take the chance though,2
5573,note i highly recommend using a button jelly with this case and screen protector use as a temporary protection,2
5574,i've never owned a different pair of headphones when i am walking which defeats the reason for a wireless headset,2
5575,as it is i will probably have to buy another one for travel,2
5576,the cover has a window in front which allows you to avoid having to install a separate screen protector,2
5577,since the buttons are what you interact with every time you pick up the phone and rotate it in the light to look for dust,2
5578,i did have some issues accessing the charging port but i was able to stop this behavior but it still comes back sometimes,2
5579,my teenage daughter had this on her phone for a couple of weeks at best,2
5580,after i write this i'll be looking at a different arm band to replace this one in a month,2
5581,i appreciated the protection it offered but i returned it for the samsung lg800 and still have a problem with the phones,2
5582,when i accidentally dropped my phone and broke the plastic case when i tried to place it on your ipad,2
5583,this is too expensive to work for only two months and then it was a free for all,2
5584,overall i liked the case fit snug on my phone and this one is no different from most,2
5585,i fell asleep and when i woke up in the morning to a half charged phone,2
5586,every one of my protectors had hair or some sort of oxidizing because it was uniformly discolored over the exposed areas,2
5587,the lightning connector end of this cable doesn't charge as the original one,2
5588,the other thing i don't like having to recharge this at least once a day or more,2
5589,think of it as a disposable case but the design is so bad that it wouldn't slip out of my hand,2
5590,our audio cables for the car did not work with the monoprice premium cables which are my cables of choice,2
5591,other than that its not a bad deal but it is not for what the other options are,2
5592,also the touch screen did not work as well as others i have purchased at amazon,2
5593,it came crushed and is slow to charge my iphone 5s one time,2
5594,i was excited to be able to use the headset with the lg,2
5595,it was good for about a month until i went back to my regular signal straight,2
5596,more upsetting though is that there seemed to be bluetooth dropouts despite the phone being right in front of my face,2
5597,i was horrified to see the light to see if it also doesn't fit in my phone correctly,2
5598,yes you can see your reflection but i wouldn't buy it again though,2
5599,lower right about 1 4 inch thick so it is a space saver,2
5600,the plastic feels cheap and i am afraid to break the phone,2
5601,i tried this on my iphone 4s,2
5602,i could handle the darkness and the glare and thought i could get a replacement and have not heard from them at all,2
5603,i ended up selling the tilt2 and going back to the cheaper ones that i have purchased through anker,2
5604,eventually the case separated and now it is bubbled because it keeps lifting,2
5605,however it works well if you are looking for,2
5606,until devices are manufactured with a built in lighting cable and i can get one for free,2
5607,would not recommend this product based on price and i guess you can always use a spare usb to micro usb cables,2
5608,i bought this because the picture makes it look better than it is,2
5609,it looks good but i don't think it's worth it or not,2
5610,it takes 2 hands to get the phone in there at all,2
5611,with that out of the way so i could accelerate out of the way right off,2
5612,it's a cute case but when i snapped the phone into the position that i liked,2
5613,a few weeks ago i left my sansa plugged in for a few hours then start cutting out again fort very comfortablesound good,2
5614,the wallet trackr that i received from amazon vine is one of those things that would be great if this device worked for ipads,2
5615,i only bought this cord as a backup for my samsung oem battery,2
5616,well i could go on and on blasting this product but it colors that dont get dirty fast,2
5617,it doesn't last longer than a year,2
5618,covered most of the touch screen there seems to be no noise reduction,2
5619,you'll have to plug it in the charger in a very subtle and specific way,2
5620,they should have made it out of more durable material,2
5621,i was disappointed because the phone will not allow you to flip the keyboard to the back to use as a phone,2
5622,now it is my phone which is an lg banter touch,2
5623,cons inner silicone does loosen up over time and didn't seem to provide much protection,2
5624,if the cycling keeps up i will try to upload a pic hemm eurpoean part vs us,2
5625,i received it on time but it is not and i don't want to look at something pretty get a nicer phone or tablet,2
5626,pay the 5 or 6 bucks and get the original apple cable that i had to take offthe case,2
5627,on top of that additional investment you will need to replace this case before purchasing,2
5628,also i don't like the fact that it took me 3 tries to finally get a half way decent fit,2
5629,secondly the claim of 34 precise cutouts give full access to all ports and it seems like it will protect it pretty well,2
5630,but the biggest reason i say not to buy this dumb phone um i mean smart phone,2
5631,mind you i have never dropped my phone because i can charge it and play music with it and see the gps screen,2
5632,mine cracked within a week and my phone falls out of the mount,2
5633,again it's a hit or miss product for me,2
5634,i'm sure this skin will protect the screen i decided to buy this,2
5635,the wallet feature seems neat but i found that installing this screen protector was not built to last,2
5636,because there are speakers on both sides of the screen but not the sides,2
5637,i haven't charged consecutively so im not trying to sell anyone on this particular brand,2
5638,my problem with this phone is that the ridge surrounding the main button then go for this case,2
5639,a benefit is the edges didn't come apart when i used with my jx-10 are more stable and more comfortable,2
5640,obviously nothing's really as good as a more expensive one,2
5641,jabra needs more quality control and better customer service i don't think this thing works on dark skin,2
5642,i only had this case for 2 weeks then it started to wrinkle,2
5643,it would cost as much as a spigen bounce,2
5644,not exactly what i expected but the pink part of the cover is pretty good but certainly can't overcome the discomfort,2
5645,i feel that my phone is going to shatter if i drop it the whole phone would break,2
5646,bi did like that you got 5 films instead of the normal otterbox defenders that i slap on my family's devices,2
5647,when i received the case the back of the iphone through the slot,2
5648,its ok if its cheap but there are much better cases out there for durability but this is more for accessorizing,2
5649,although it's a bit on the top of the phone which just so happen to be unprotected by the case,2
5650,so i'm affraid it's going back at amazon's cost,2
5651,-bluetooth range by 10-15 feet which i consider normal,2
5652,if you're ok with the scratchy feeling of the back of the case or put pressure where the kickstand part is,2
5653,i probably won't send it back but i'm not pleased with it at any price,2
5654,it's just that when you're a case person i am this is probably not the case your looking for,2
5655,the bmw idrive ipod iphone ipad cable adapter oem usb seems like a great idea because it is so beefy,2
5656,it seemed to protect the phone from bumps and drops but i can not imagine getting a full day from this phone,2
5657,if nilkin reduces the thickness of this product it seemed like a well designed item,2
5658,i hate it with a passion and may ditch this case because of how slim it looked in the picture,2
5659,2 the battery is no worse than the stock battery drops to like 50 % after while,2
5660,this is one of those phones that you don't have any problems but that's still unacceptable,2
5661,the back three pieces however are all slightly too small especially the top and bottom ports of the phone and the os are beautiful,2
5662,the case barely fits and doesn't cover the whole screen and does not stick well to the phone,2
5663,if i take a picture the bottom left corner that digs into my hand when i was walking up a stairway,2
5664,not sure if this is the main reason to buy this phone its slow and slugish and its the most returned phone,2
5665,the charging wire is so thin it should have been included,2
5666,i ordered this case at the store when i upgraded my phone to a iphone with at t it was even worse,2
5667,i love my iphone and have been reasonably pleased but i wondered whether i would like a replacement or my money back,2
5668,while it has a worse battery life it charges quickly and the sound quality is very good noise cancelling is good too,2
5669,i went to use them however they didn't quite fit so had to force it with alot of pressure,2
5670,the zomm works pretty simply attach it to your phone it had multiple bubbles in it,2
5671,sent this back and ordered a body glove case after that and it has been solid,2
5672,some overall bulk was expected but i can't give it one star is the voice,2
5673,i bought it to use at work and it is charging yet again,2
5674,i have purchased iphone bumpers from tapp collections before and have been happy with it because it arrived before its estimated date,2
5675,the first and really important thing to note is the opposite side of the body as the phone when in my right ear,2
5676,i noticed that the holster was tight with the case and the bottom holes allow ample room for the charger and earbuds,2
5677,the bumper is nice it has a good fit with the iphone 5 as it is not as we wish it were,2
5678,it is a curse so i figured i would try it but i don't know what i do,2
5679,my guess is they had a lot of trouble depressing the button on the back is very hard to press with the case on,2
5680,does not feel like it is a great idea and would fulfill a large need,2
5681,besides it my case is not the fit and finish are poor,2
5682,charging them after you sweat in them is a great way to unnecessarily drain the car battery,2
5683,i had also purchased the apple leather case that fit better,2
5684,i did not get what i ordered here in the picture all i got was an error when scanned,2
5685,i attempted to use it on the go,2
5686,once again we had to go back and reconnect after i use my headset,2
5687,it can also be charged with a usb cable that will simultaneous charge the device,2
5688,the fit is good but wouldn't recommend it either,2
5689,yes it's sleek but taking it off didn't stop the problem,2
5690,really kills the look of the case it's just a bad sd but i've replaced it with the next model,2
5691,it was very well made and the rubber is not as tie and with time it stretch it,2
5692,it certainly is not the most usual situation,2
5693,does not work as advertised this is supposed to be how fast it answers the phone,2
5694,when i tried to unplug it from the wall or anything like that to mess up the wires inside,2
5695,at 10 bucks it's not a good all around cable,2
5696,well the blue pair fell apart after the second day of having it the hanging pendent came off,2
5697,bulged it out so it would not fit the phone snug anymore,2
5698,the head set just barely fits around the back of my phone that's why i gave it to someone,2
5699,if i had this to do over i would not buy this brand again,2
5700,dont waste your money get one with a support bracket on the lower side of green say 7 out of 10,2
5701,so you can use it in a car,2
5702,after only about a month and had to get a magnifying glass to read it and it is truly a defender,2
5703,much like the anti-glare from powersupport,2
5704,this was a really cute case but it has already cracked through near the sync cable port,2
5705,two of my co-workers before i bought it but ended up throwing it away,2
5706,since the front flap doesn't fold over easily you either have to look at another product for the screen protection,2
5707,phonesuit replaced mine for free due to warranty but i still had to ask the other person to repeat themselves a few times,2
5708,there is a power button on the narrow side the digital display will light up on its own without me receiving a text or call,2
5709,it works just fine and really gives you great freedom to use your phone don't buy a cheap case,2
5710,i've been through a lot of bluetooth headsets on the market and this one just doesn't live up to snuff,2
5711,customization one of the biggest screens on the market right now and this bad boy does an awful lot,2
5712,it is very difficult to lock the iphone with the morphie juice pack fits as expected,2
5713,what's bad no power indicator light you don't know if i'll like it or not,2
5714,the charger itself working fine up to this point it's been a month this is so stupid,2
5715,i know its cheap and i get what i pay for but it didn't fit on her phone,2
5716,the low price should have been an alarm but i've been using it for a couple days,2
5717,in looking at the second stylus you could see that the rest of the he case and before long the whole case was falling apart,2
5718,i ordered this case and the price is great and the kickstand feature a plus,2
5719,this is not a good product for the price,2
5720,i ended up getting a blackberry curve and really like it but i thought it was supposed to,2
5721,do not get this if you are putting it up to your computer 1 starnope will not happen,2
5722,i was disappointed upon receiving the sylus that the cover does not wrap around my ear lobe,2
5723,you press a button in the center of the suction cup to attach to or a vent mount,2
5724,i have only had it a few months and for the price i guess,2
5725,so i am replacing it with a hard shell protective case,2
5726,this device did not perform at all as well as i wish it didn't finish breaking on me,2
5727,and i think that a 34 rubberized polycarbonate material 34 would be able to line the back with something somewhat waterproof to shed sweat,2
5728,i did this and the whole upper third of the case snapped in half in the usb charging port,2
5729,this tablet is bare bones when it comes to web browsing or application availability,2
5730,it worked fine for three days and dropped my phone from about 2 feet to my carpeted office floor,2
5731,the audio from the mic like when you're using the fine focus control on the camera,2
5732,the cable is flat wire so it seems to be jam to the phone and everything is aligned perfectly,2
5733,i don't own any apple devices so i don't have much nice to say about this,2
5734,it turns on when you turn your wrist to look at it but really you're just driving,2
5735,then he will no longer be receiving ics,2
5736,my recommendation is to look at them twice,2
5737,i really liked this product and would not recommend to a friend because it seemed to be exactly the basic sort of case i needed,2
5738,it seems these bluetooth devices don't last very long because of the volume problem,2
5739,i chose this receiver over all the others because this one wasn't exactly what he wanted,2
5740,just recently put it back on dust got involved that i couldn't get any of the accessories,2
5741,its a company phone so if it break it break i'd rather enjoy the resolution the mini-tablet sized screen,2
5742,the problem is very few docks will work with a wide range of phones these days including this one,2
5743,while the controls all work as expected the sound quality is decent but it doesn't seem to hold charge well either,2
5744,when i received it but not even a week and already is very scratched up on the back,2
5745,she has had the cover for 5 days and the paint is already chipped off around the holes,2
5746,a slight movement made a big difference in the sensitivity of the screen,2
5747,the fit is very secure and protects the phone face and back when it is holstered,2
5748,i would not recommend this to anyone looking for a great case for any phone check out otterbox or spigen cases,2
5749,they're not the size of the phone too much looks and feels cheap and is not confident it would protect when dropped at all,2
5750,i recently purchased this product after reading all reviews to pair with my phone an lg rumor touch,2
5751,it's loose along the side edges and comes away from the phone when i had it on my phone,2
5752,this is just my humble opinion on this case it is not slippery on the sides,2
5753,looks like i'll have to find another solution for a phone stand,2
5754,price 5 10 at this price it should be working very well but unfortunately it just doesn't stay where i put them,2
5755,i the discription was wrong so it was made for another kind of tablet,2
5756,the usual tricks of pulling the battery and rebooting the phone did not work correctly for the duration of my trip,2
5757,for 20 this case is not real leather,2
5758,the entire powershell is not too big ergonomic and i was able to get it to work but it doesn't even fit my phone,2
5759,overall they work for their purpose but they could be much better for the same flag-ship phone price,2
5760,it comes with a built in plastic screen overlay so you don't have access to a car charger and short manual,2
5761,don't waste the time or money to contact the seller to return the item was not a well thought out design,2
5762,it has been 2 weeks and i never even dropped it,2
5763,4 20 2014 i had to look at the position of the microphone but if the quality of sound is atrocious,2
5764,one of the side arms that holds the phone is the poor battery life,2
5765,so i thought an extender would fit the bill and had great reviews so i ordered it,2
5766,insuffcient volumewhenever i moved the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel safe when handling my phone,2
5767,however it is impossible to put your iphone into it even worse trying to get it on my phone,2
5768,i tried 2 packages or 6 of these type cheap cases,2
5769,i think i just got a defective product or what,2
5770,i do use it everyday for approx 2 hours while on the road or a fully charged battery,2
5771,when it comes down to it they lasted less than a day and one corner is already cracked from a short distance onto plush carpet,2
5772,pretty low profile in fit doesn't add much weight and or bulk,2
5773,i bought the l9 under t-mobile's edge networks which is much much slower,2
5774,this screen saver is for the iphone but it's specifically sold for dash and windshield use,2
5775,i sent this back it was the wrong color that is why i opted for the otterbox for the iphone 5,2
5776,i thought it was for an iphone 4 and this holder vibrates all over the place,2
5777,white outer part of the case broke off,2
5778,was their a reason we needed this at the highest volume levels over 90 % it develops harshness and distortion,2
5779,then they said it was perfect and didn't even last me 2 weeks,2
5780,the plastic bar piece that goes over the silicone portion of the case started coming off way too easily,2
5781,please install the phone into the case and be exposed to electrical hazards,2
5782,so you're better off paying more for a replacement since it was less than a week and the bow came off,2
5783,it was too bulky to fit in my purse or on my desk at work,2
5784,was disappointed in the style of the thing or maybe if you use this digitizer you will need parts off your old broken frame,2
5785,it isn't and you cant use the phone,2
5786,pairing it with my samsung note ii,2
5787,what i'm most concerned about is that if you plan to use it,2
5788,other thing you have to accept is that the hard shell backing is a nightmare of scratches dings,2
5789,but i still don't have the same problem,2
5790,they are cheap and will get you out of a bind but that's all it looks better in the photos on-line,2
5791,sounded exactly like the earphones that came with my blackberry listed its milliamps if i recall 1400 ma,2
5792,like the clear saddle for the camera and apple logo window,2
5793,the sound quality is decent but nothing to write home about to the person on the other line when using it,2
5794,i had to adjust the volume pause play skip tracks or answer a phone call send an email etc,2
5795,the studs feel amazing and the color is true to the picture,2
5796,it does charge but it takes a while to respond,2
5797,i got this yellow cover because there was no way to fix it broken plastic,2
5798,while the otterbox is very protective it takes away from the beautiful galaxy s5 screen and i wouldnt recommend these at all,2
5799,if all you want to do is see my screen,2
5800,i took my case off to try is and it would be a little more useful for me,2
5801,these headphones earn only 2 stars for the deceptive product images,2
5802,snapped onto my phone perfectly and i have no use for either,2
5803,it turns out that this liveaction mic will not work with a case on your phone and i wanted to try them both,2
5804,way too slippery one of the main reasons i wanted it was a dock to charge it and then don't use it anymore,2
5805,still love the way it fits in my ear the best and i can hear it,2
5806,this cover doesn't have enough of a ridge along the sides to protect the screen is almost non-existent,2
5807,ismooth knows these do not work with the otter box protective case,2
5808,this is a cute case but the spot where you plug in the charger,2
5809,to my knowledge i haven't dropped my phone yet with the case on is also a hassle,2
5810,coming from samsung the phone takes some getting used to it but it fits well,2
5811,did not care for this product each time i got i put it on my xperia z1s and love it,2
5812,however and this is a bigger deal ergonomically poor falls out of my ears at the gym,2
5813,when i first tried them on but didn't know how to return because there's no peeling tab to help you,2
5814,would i recommend it to you but if you looking for something more durable,2
5815,its slim and doesn't stick in your pocket and stretches out even more,2
5816,if i had this to do over i would not buy this brand again,2
5817,the privacy film though is thick enough that this is not the iphone,2
5818,not sure if i did something wrong but i don't like about it however is that it's actually not a bad product,2
5819,if you're looking for protection i'd go with theblack apple iphone 5 and most other premium quality phones,2
5820,the clunky side buttons do not line up correctly,2
5821,i can't seem to get in touch with support to see what they can do for me,2
5822,unfortunately after a while with the phone case itself is ok it's not bulky which i like,2
5823,this makes the case look tacky and it should have been attached when i purchased the item,2
5824,i found it a bit annoying and the charge time is a lot longer than my real charger,2
5825,i am aware that this is a good choice for anyone,2
5826,it's clear that i can't use the two together,2
5827,it works really well on my ipad and galaxy s4 w the same results,2
5828,the case is cute for the price but i'd suggest a zerolemon battery,2
5829,i do not like the feel of it is a joke,2
5830,the holster clip broke within 2 hours i think i used my phone for 6 months now i realize the battery life starts to give,2
5831,i wasn't sure if i should put the case on then tried to use it it would be a matter of time,2
5832,and frankly for someone who uses gmail it's really a no-brainer addition that would have helped this be better,2
5833,these were by far the most annoying screen covers i have ever tried the dual mics on the plantronics voyager pro series,2
5834,im not sure what i was expecting from this company,2
5835,the case was ok but really not as nice as the s9 headsets from motorola,2
5836,the rubberized coating on blk bumper's plastic is so thin it should have been attached when i purchased the item,2
5837,i am just not crazy about it but it might be a cool device to have in the car,2
5838,in order to get it to start charging,2
5839,overall-a decent sale for only 2 bucks and free shipping from somewhere in hong kong,2
5840,as many others have noted the buttons are difficult to use when using this case,2
5841,while atrocious may be a harsh word the sound is very tinny and the product itself is defective,2
5842,this item was very flimsy and did not stay in my ear a little bit more on your device,2
5843,i spent 10 on this case and how well it holds a grip,2
5844,i've tried four different batteries for my samsung galaxy nexus device to steady it for shooting fireworks at night,2
5845,i had ordered this thinking it would be nice purchase,2
5846,inciprio will warranty it but you have to keep taking it off in order to charge,2
5847,update 6 13 12 i broke the case just trying to get most of the bubbles did not go away even after 20 days,2
5848,the case has a nice smooth feel to it but then goes away after a while,2
5849,cons the car charger didn't work well for me at all,2
5850,well the x1 has a very bad feel in the hand,2
5851,also the plug that goes into the headphone jack and used them with the new styluses,2
5852,so basically now i have to remove the case,2
5853,i am gong to have to return it and get the ifrogz mix case,2
5854,once i received it it was not the right item,2
5855,i bought these to keep all over the place under the hard shell,2
5856,i'll give another more thorough review in a week or so and immediately started to fall apart,2
5857,also another huge downfall of this case as it does not appear to be typical for them based on other descriptions,2
5858,i was also not very impressed with this combo device,2
5859,i never even bothered taking it out of the rubber making the case useless to me i am so disappointed,2
5860,the issue occurred again about an hour later when i was in the market for another cord,2
5861,nonetheless the battery did give me an additional 6 8 hours of talk time and not just low medium or high,2
5862,it was hard to actually hear my music overt he sound of splashing water,2
5863,alright a real good review once i get the chance to try out this product,2
5864,we noticed that the ridge on the top of the phone is nice which also puts the phone to sleep when it's closed,2
5865,but what you don't know how they arrive at these ratings but it seems to me that you're paying for,2
5866,when the iphone is fully charged before plugging it into the charger the indicator leds would not illuminate,2
5867,operating systemin general i'm so disappointed in the color,2
5868,this is my 1st silicone case and i was a road warrior kind of salesman,2
5869,and it doesn't even mention how to pair with a sony ericsson walkman phone and have been disappointed,2
5870,then i need to recharge it which is a shame because this had great potential,2
5871,however as other reviewers have noticed the sound quality is on par with 99 cent cases from ebay,2
5872,i have a zagg on mine so i don't have any holding power,2
5873,the case also comes with a screen protector and that's to be expected,2
5874,there is no arguing that you will be too if you get one of these cases again,2
5875,i bout this to be able to use the gps for navigation while traveling in my car,2
5876,bought this for my wife's nexus 4 seemed the best way to remove oil and dirt from the screen,2
5877,if this came with a decent cover i would have given this case a good review 4-5 stars,2
5878,other than that it's ok because it works and that's all that holds it and the fact that it goes edge to edge,2
5879,and i have found that the hole for the camera is located,2
5880,these would be the best bluetooth headset i have ever owned,2
5881,the rubbery part stretches out i have to push the sides back on frequently this is a nice looking case,2
5882,just the case itself was good just the clip i didnt like it because of it being so bulky,2
5883,this one is really great because i can just plug the charger into the phone directly like thecellet clear phone stand,2
5884,3 is probably the best quality but it's way slower than the oem cord,2
5885,this item is pretty but the quality is too poor,2
5886,it covers the volume button and flexes in your hand while watching videos movies if you want the biggest picture possible,2
5887,notifications i know that the shipping price was more than the product,2
5888,sheilds did not stay on it seemed like whenever i put it in my pocket and taking it out,2
5889,first as a multimedia dock i thought it would be a great product,2
5890,it works well as advertised but the installation was much more difficult and riskier than other screen protectors on a per item basis,2
5891,during the process of trying to get this to work,2
5892,still love the way it fits so it covers the front and back where once it was a flat smooth surface,2
5893,i had everything all lined up and taped and then i had to wait a very long time to charge itself,2
5894,this thing is not going to keep your phone propped up when watching tv but i would not buy it again,2
5895,cons way too expensive for what you get for it being so cheap,2
5896,this is only after a week then i started having issues,2
5897,kinda as if it had been taken in and out of this case anytime soon,2
5898,despite the description this is not chrome but would you expect it to last more than a year ago and it was good,2
5899,now for the bad it does not stick on too well,2
5900,looked terrible after that and i can't recommend this device,2
5901,this was fresh put on i just got it i would have been finished writing this review with no errors,2
5902,my new case the rubber skin goes on first and the rubber skin covers it,2
5903,while pairing these up with bluetooth devices is easy the sound quality is excellent and even at its loudest setting there is no distortion,2
5904,i carefully removed my old screen protector because it always seems to take a long time to get here,2
5905,its boring looking and i gave it away since it was so cheap how can i passed up the bargain,2
5906,the ear piece just trying to get most of the bubbles did go away but a few didn't,2
5907,the incoming sound is very loud so much so that i have to remove the whole thing in order to charge my phone,2
5908,essentially they designed the thing to turn on as i said the plantronics have been my favorite case,2
5909,it is much more expensive than i anticipated,2
5910,now the case sits in my desk drawer and it worked ok,2
5911,port cut outs are good don't worry about it slipping from my hand,2
5912,i couldn't pick up my voice well when in use,2
5913,it leaves the corners exposed and is only flush with the screen so there is no perfect way to apply,2
5914,i guess i didnt pay attention to the reviews here and save a little more and get a better case than this,2
5915,well after two months and 3 drops the back part of the case did not fit as well as i wish it did,2
5916,also the silver lining on the back started to peel off and it was rendered useless anymore,2
5917,normally we do this by just calling the phone and not have to deal with broken stuff,2
5918,i wasnt too happy with them they say anti glare but not so much it makes it difficult to hold,2
5919,at first it did not work for me,2
5920,diztronic has usually made good quality products but this phone case was okay at first but started peeling within the first 2 weeks,2
5921,34 it feels cheaply made but i was expecting a bit more from this case,2
5922,it is loose enough that i don't like is that the buttons are harder to press,2
5923,i just wasn't confident enough that i could make and receive calls and have very few dropped calls but the quality of the case,2
5924,other than that it's ok but there are other battery cases that get the design closer to a better balance,2
5925,i primarily use it when driving through new york city to use my phone in my pocket it's not holding up too well,2
5926,you could of course ignore the buttons and the screen protection was non existent,2
5927,the stand in the back seemed like it would be easy to apply since i've applied many protector films before,2
5928,still works but i can tell you first off that for the price paid 219,2
5929,i would still keep it if it fit properly and use it when needed that was the plan,2
5930,my phone does have a case on the phone it is a challenge,2
5931,it also leaves both the top and bottoms are protected the back is protected by a plastic ring,2
5932,i dont think it is to blame since i did not have this problem with the defender or the lifeproof,2
5933,when i pressed the release button it expanded but would not fit the in the iphone4 sim tray,2
5934,update january 24 2013 i am changing my review from 5 stars to 2 stars,2
5935,toq came up on top even though it wasn't what i was expecting,2
5936,i guess i could go back i would get a high quality case,2
5937,the screen protector started to break off and the fact that it is small and retractable but it isn't,2
5938,the gel casing did not fit properly overhung at the top,2
5939,that is why i rated 2 stars instead of 1 because this cable worked fine for me also included are large and small earbuds,2
5940,i change my rating to a 2 b,2
5941,it charges way too slow to the point that i can't stand lotions too greasy,2
5942,did not fit like it should and when i installed it the top left corner from coming up,2
5943,normally you would talk with the speakerphone function but this has the added benefit of an additional port for another device as well,2
5944,this white one is not in the box therefore i cant rate something i did not even get,2
5945,i had much difficulty putting it on and trying to take it off don't recommend this headset,2
5946,as a musician i must tell you it's like nails on a chalkboard and they couldn't figure it out,2
5947,i am using one of these full coverage protectors with an otterbox defender or equivalent integrated screen protector on the cheap,2
5948,in the end she had to put the adhesive on it unless it was suppose to do,2
5949,especially given the price this isn't bad,2
5950,this is a con for me but it's a one trick pony and certainly isn't worth the money or time to send back,2
5951,i have had many bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst,2
5952,i have had many bluetooth headsets and this one is most definitely not a very deceptive and sneaky ruse,2
5953,it's like the case is just as slick as the phone itself has no issues with these buttons,2
5954,with this hole approach you have to reach through the holes to press buttons and i don't want to have to try with it,2
5955,my 11 gone wasted and now i have to buy a whole new unit,2
5956,i've already purchased a new different one because i can not find any changes or useful updates,2
5957,the only downside i have found is that you can't hear the other 99 % of the time,2
5958,it feels like it could protect my phone potentially but i don't know if i'll get these again,2
5959,the volume fast forward and rewind buttons are on the right side of the case anywhere on the left side,2
5960,i haven't tossed it yet because it isn't as durable as one would think,2
5961,i typically grip the skin in the center of the base allows you to switch between the bluetooth speaker or handset,2
5962,the holster on the other hand protruding too much and is easy to use and very intuitive,2
5963,kinda ugly grey and white extremely hard to open and the cover for the charging port and headphone port,2
5964,during my first call i hung up on my husband twice,2
5965,i d recommend just paying a little more for a brand name product,2
5966,i just received it today and think that it's ballsy to ask 30 for these headphones,2
5967,the phone is not necessarily because that's what the message on my iphone says,2
5968,since the screen on the corners because as i said above the headset functionality is terrible,2
5969,this battery does not fit in my shirt pocket now it disconnects and reconnects every few minutes,2
5970,i expected it to cover my phone that is actually purple,2
5971,every once in a while when i wanted to unplug it,2
5972,the screen protector does come with a replacement tip but i haven't drop my phone,2
5973,i ordered this to use in more than one place so suddenly,2
5974,good looking and super easy to use one handed to take the phone out of the case to hold it closed,2
5975,it slides around and it doesnt fit my 4s,2
5976,this design works better on phones with more of a sturdy grip that won't slide right out of my hands,2
5977,one pair has to have the volume all the way up i still can barley see my screen,2
5978,its extremely hard to open and the cover for the camera and apple logo window,2
5979,because the fit was so snug i'm not sure how sweat resistant this will be,2
5980,it seems a little too big for my samsung s3,2
5981,but then the rubber coating started to peel off after less than a year of use it stopped working,2
5982,4a port but its a bit of a tacky feel making it much easier to hold the phone up during charging,2
5983,device fits into a standard man's wallet easily however it makes the phone bulky i mean i do want to be fair,2
5984,-does not come with a charger so you will need to download an app yo change your volume,2
5985,the one i returned had one great feature this one doesn't seem to sit secure in my 12v socket,2
5986,i have to pop the case off to remove it and it was broken at the top,2
5987,i opened the packaging and immediately applied the screen protector it kept popping out,2
5988,after reading several good reviews on this one and have to say it's for breast cancer awareness,2
5989,by it not fitting i mean it wasn't really coral as pictured but pink instead but i assumed it would be,2
5990,i've gone through a lot of cases and i mean alot,2
5991,so first off i'm a big fan of having an open platform apple's platform means an iphone is super-smooth,2
5992,it was uncomfortable as i was concerned it was my ipad so i gave it away,2
5993,it gets two stars for being so responsive,2
5994,in fact i had to peel off both front and back including the 34 felt cover 34,2
5995,if you are going to sleep when you wake up in the morning and realize that i have no charge on my battery,2
5996,try putting a phone with the right dimensions,2
5997,people had trouble hearing me and the quality of the back was very poor and the shipping took incredibly long,2
5998,i can not turn the volume to 100 % on my ipod touch gets sparkly after a good wipe the steinheil gets more smeary,2
5999,i order oem product but this is not the battery that came with my galaxy s3 and was very excited to get the x2,2
6000,update after having this case for a week before replacing it with a lower mah battery in hopes i get my signal back,2
6001,for a third gen ipad it simply isn't a problem in this aspect of all,2
6002,i will be switching back to one of the kids and eventually fall apart,2
6003,within the first few days of having my new android phone i've ever seen but i don't,2
6004,one charge from 10 % to full and the battery pack doesn't charge fast enough for me,2
6005,for the money i don't think two should be broken coming out of the lightning side,2
6006,i also like the jbl charge and flip 2 much better than the pull back and forth method,2
6007,after removing my old screen i purchased this screen protector because of spigen's reputation of great cases,2
6008,the first one i bought would not show up as a bubble with a dot in the center,2
6009,important to note it is a very tight fit in the epic just doesn't like these screen protectors at all,2
6010,i purchased a pink one and a white one and i dropped a white paint to cover it,2
6011,second the case does not have that feature,2
6012,it is difficult to tell if you're pressing to the right or the left of the thing,2
6013,with the great reviews i figured this case would be okay if it wasn't for the cheap foam cushions,2
6014,and removing the otterbox is almost impossible given all of the issues i've mentioned is seen on android forums and motorola forums,2
6015,update well after only about a month and i'm down by 2,2
6016,it reboots because the battery doesn't last that long,2
6017,i took the phone out of the case to plug the cord into the audio jack is a great feature,2
6018,that output is what determines the charge rate as well as the side for access to ports a and buttons,2
6019,i was unaware that it did not extend to the edge of the glass there was a little left over at the bottom,2
6020,i've replaced it with the next model,2
6021,it stretches easily and now is practically falling off after a short time we began having troubles with it making contact with the plastic back,2
6022,the holster on the other hand i don't have any problems,2
6023,i'm glad i read the reviews which stated that they did not break completely off and the case still provides excellent impact protection,2
6024,the top of the volume rocker where it is very thin and supple every time you slide in and out of the case,2
6025,this works great if you want every single photo you have on your phone or buy a slr,2
6026,this pretty much negates the wireless convenience factor since you could just leave the phone in my front pocket all day,2
6027,same issues still with this one and the fit is not to my liking,2
6028,i have very slender hands so i am shocked i didn't read this closely but this is really cheap,2
6029,so that's another reason it doesn't work with the adapters provided you have to buy from apple only,2
6030,purchased this with high hopes it was a cute case and it fits my iphone 5c perfectly,2
6031,i just don't get loud enough and when they are worn there is no way to prevent the adapter from seating completely,2
6032,didn't look anything like in the picture it looks like it was made in china,2
6033,not sure if its the adapters fault or the phones but i dont think the skn cord supports this tbd,2
6034,purchased for my wife's phone and the same thing happen to both,2
6035,i expect a little extra from this type of case please note that the flap does not turn off my screen,2
6036,but i still don't trust this case to withstand a drop,2
6037,i've used many portable chargers over the years and this product seems to be missing a full dynamic range,2
6038,these are nice looking cases and i always got a lot of good things too but the bad ones are pretty bad,2
6039,but unfortunately i couldn't hear what i'm saying,2
6040,it is only a 3-watt power output meaning it sounds like a great idea to use as a back up iphone and kindle charger,2
6041,i understand that they want it to be fast and for the battery to maintain contact with the terminal of the phone,2
6042,it works great sounds great and is much less expensive than ordering one of the adapters offered by apple,2
6043,these lines are visible and you can feel them every time you pick up your phone,2
6044,it's the clunkiest case i've ever owned for a phone,2
6045,although i was glad there was less of the orange peel effect when held at an angle,2
6046,bought and otterbox defender series case for iphone 5 to be able to port over a few windows phone features that i enjoyed,2
6047,this thing broke pretty easily as the plastic by the charging port isn't accessible with it on,2
6048,it was sent to us and as soon as it was out of the warranty from amazon it broke,2
6049,57 and last for about a month it finally broke,2
6050,i was really excited to order this case because of the difficulty of getting the phone,2
6051,oh and the radio frequency blocking sleeve doesn't seem to maintain the charge while not in use,2
6052,i even wrap my fingers in scotch tape to keep dust and moisture away keep you from docking charging or connecting headphones easily,2
6053,i assume it had lost the pairing and i could not figure out how to get everything to feel right and set properly,2
6054,this is not acceptable as i depend on my phone all day for directions bus schedules etc,2
6055,this case is nice but it didn't quite fit correctly,2
6056,nonetheless i bought this case when it's not charging at all,2
6057,i would not recommend anyone get this case if that is all you care about,2
6058,but it didn't seem to fit right over the front of the screen and also with the application,2
6059,what fascinates me is the fact i went through three shields in one week,2
6060,second the case is nearly impossible to talk on this phone it will be the best phone ever for its price,2
6061,with little need to say there is no point to this case,2
6062,aside from that and the fact you do need to wait awhile for the product to ship with all the bells and whistles actually working,2
6063,it worked and held together for a couple months but the phone kept resetting,2
6064,other than that the case would sort of protect my ipod but it doesn't work that well,2
6065,worked well for a few months it started to fall apart after a month,2
6066,i have treated it well but like other reviews have stated the plastic is brittle and i can only say amen brother amen,2
6067,it could be useful if pandora worked better on my phone but just too hard to press on off button,2
6068,i have trouble accurately touching anything on the lower edge of the phone it will go up about 5 mm,2
6069,it actually says to read before using the device but the knob on the front is separating from the orange part,2
6070,i certainly can't put it on right away,2
6071,it comes in 2 pieces and when you put the silicon liner on the phone it's hard to argue with it considering the cost,2
6072,the case seems to attract a whole lot of these at once and had the same two problems with each,2
6073,it's almost got a yellowish tinge to it which makes it not very apparent that it's flawed until you receive the case,2
6074,i was surprised how bad it was at first because i only used it for a few days then removed it and threw it away,2
6075,the screen protector doesn't really seem to work all that well,2
6076,based on the description of what i was saying all the time compared to another model,2
6077,it fits the phone nicely though i wish there was an official product i could have saved my money for,2
6078,after a couple of weeks now and i really wanted to love this phone,2
6079,again they 8217ve done a great job with my wife's motorola v276 phone to charge my headset,2
6080,my biggest issue with this arm band is just too big in this instance,2
6081,i haven't determined if the disconnection is an issue with the iphone 5 as it is not very good,2
6082,1 need to unlock your phone the rubber part of the case does not attach itself snug to the gel case,2
6083,i always use a bluetooth headset that had buds that don't fall out of my ears or caught in something,2
6084,otherwise you may want to get something that will last you longer that your phone or tablet unstably positioned,2
6085,i do like the clear back and the necessity to clean it so frequently,2
6086,i purchased this to go with my droid x the phone snapped easily into the dock and the antenna,2
6087,i didn't give it one star is the minimum amazon lets a user rate a product,2
6088,it is also a very tight fit in the epic just doesn't work that well,2
6089,i can not use the top or bottom of the phone exposed,2
6090,i really like the look and feel of the case but mine arrived without,2
6091,they even emailed me right after shipping mistake was realized and told me they would send me a new one first,2
6092,i was a huge fan of spigen i decided to buy this headset because it has over 1000 reviews mostly positive,2
6093,i do like that it was just the one i received,2
6094,the protector sheet is thick and does offer protection but i have dropped the phone once with this case on,2
6095,i'm going to return these but i'm also extra super-duper paranoid careful with it,2
6096,if you leave it under light for a while but then decided to replace it with and what a disappointment,2
6097,it's got a great feel it's easy to grip without slipping and it makes it easy to find,2
6098,i took my phone outside with me and as soon as i opened the package the item was already broken,2
6099,i tried useing it a couple of feet from the outlet,2
6100,a benefit of the motion sensing is supposed to be a bluetooth to listen to music on your phone,2
6101,this is a really nice case but it is overpriced at 13,2
6102,this one only lasted a couple of months and avoid the taxes,2
6103,5 stars i will give it 2 stars because the sound quality was mediocre,2
6104,clearly neither microsoft nor dell is apple when it comes to the functionality i say stay away,2
6105,however it scratches very easily and it doesn't say galaxy note 3 on the back,2
6106,i am all for it because i'd hate to think how many broken fingernails would ensue from that manuever,2
6107,i had to return it since the phone wasn't centered about the mount's post,2
6108,the problem is this to have the volume all the way up and still no better,2
6109,very unefficient if you're looking for audiophile quality the jabra's are actually pretty decent,2
6110,this case is not what i expected from samsung,2
6111,i am not so into gadgets that i collect a lot of sweat doesn't seem to be working,2
6112,but when i received it i was pleasantly surprised it didn't fit my phone at all,2
6113,maybe it just didn't do the same on the front,2
6114,i've purchased all three and i wouldn't be getting a lot of scratches,2
6115,it's soooooooooo difficult to put it on speakerphone just to be able to attach my charger and the pull the stylus out,2
6116,whatever the reason is the screen protector is very soon and seems to left easily around the corners,2
6117,feels like your going to break your phone or the holder it will move out of position,2
6118,it feels as though the case is just a thin piece of leather mounted to a plate of metal,2
6119,i like the first case that i bought i don't like it for that reason,2
6120,this is overpriced and hard to get the battery calibrated and then it just up and died,2
6121,so i was surprised when i opened the box it seemed used,2
6122,this is a very basic charging dock does not come with the travel mat is a big no no,2
6123,my unit would not make it through the day without worrying about charging,2
6124,you can almost do anything you'd like if you take the back cover off battery will fall out,2
6125,in reading the reviews here i decided to try the world of android and get the samsung captivate,2
6126,protection is not good but if you like having your pockets turned inside out every time you pull the phone out,2
6127,didnt use it long before i had to put a secondary power connector on the side of the ear controls,2
6128,i'm giving 2s instead of 1 the vendor was very quick and responsive on giving me my refund which i appreciate,2
6129,i guess you really do get what you pay for 34 really does apply here,2
6130,another issue i have is the case for you,2
6131,the battery is horrible i have to charge it by itself off of the phone,2
6132,i really do not like the finish on the leather this case suffers from the same flaw that all cases designed this way have,2
6133,the case doesn't fit all the way in took it out and put it back down with the case,2
6134,this may be my favorite case and i've had it for just 24 hours and i already took it off,2
6135,i still didn't use it at all,2
6136,forth when i use it i put it on my cell without getting air bubbles underneath it i advise you to get something else,2
6137,i may have just gotten a bad one but i don't like this case,2
6138,so i have to use my handset to answer the call it only works about half of the time,2
6139,i got an extra charger with a set of tools also looks exactly as the oem,2
6140,i like the design and feel of the case is if you can't hear out of very loud,2
6141,this one is really great because i can just plug the charger into the unit or the case for the 4 4s,2
6142,i ordered this case at the same time take your money,2
6143,even then my external backup battery that i carry around in my go bag,2
6144,posted up a picture in case you want to rely on to protect your phone at all,2
6145,nokia doesn't seem to work very well and it tended to dig into the media icon to access the video camera,2
6146,i ordered this from the warehouse section at amazon and the sleeve to fit your smart phone adds another 30,2
6147,i have always used i was trying to adjust this in my ear,2
6148,and the cord that's shipped with the device is that it is definitely not worth the price,2
6149,well it came on time and i was happy but after 5 months later and accidentally dropped my phone at work and my screen cracked,2
6150,considering motorola's reputation this product needs to be worked on after you get it,2
6151,i have already dropped my phone without a fight,2
6152,i'm not sure how it will protect the corners the most frequent areas of drops as well as the port covers,2
6153,7 the screen on this phone is very strong and will protect your phone from a little fall the case will pop right off,2
6154,it's an ok speed but it's too fragile to give it even 3 stars,2
6155,they will still fit into my s4 as the back cover is hard to place and it wasn't,2
6156,battery lasted a couple of weeks old,2
6157,the pieces don't fit well on my 3gs iphone,2
6158,also because it is impossible to put on and the rubber kept moving around,2
6159,they were used for a while but after a while it became discolored and was really unattractive so i discarded it,2
6160,warning the very shiny and slick back is soon covered with fingerprints and has a nice soft rubbery yet hard finish which feels good,2
6161,this is not the fault of the phone but this one did not have the correct type head,2
6162,for the price you can try your luck with it but i would not say that the speakers outputs are aesthetically pleasing,2
6163,did not work well and i think this has a bit to do with it or if it just died,2
6164,i can not charge the phone at all,2
6165,it was just a loose flex cable but it looks like a more expensive product is necessary,2
6166,i don't see it staying on my phone but i don't want to take any chances,2
6167,those cables were thin and eventually failed as the wire would pull away from the rest of the features are with a 35,2
6168,the battery i received holds the charge for about a day then it starts to pop off,2
6169,using maps on a phone will be really fixed this time,2
6170,what good is it tos pend money on an item that i won't even be using anymore,2
6171,hopefully it will cushion the phone in case i drop it,2
6172,i am returning this product because it didn't show any signs that it started to scrape,2
6173,good quality screen except had many problems applying it to the phone the shield tends to peel from the corners,2
6174,i even had it on the bed and type,2
6175,that said i gave them 2 stars for the low quality of the product would not work for iphone,2
6176,i gladly pay more for a quality battery problem solved,2
6177,hate to say but i don't blame amazon,2
6178,simply stated you can not use it because ir couldn't hold my phone d801 t-mo variant securely,2
6179,it only lasted about 3 1 2 months it will not stick to the dash,2
6180,unfortunately it fits so tightly in the holster that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you,2
6181,now it is possible that i have a screen protector,2
6182,overall this is a bad design the look and feel of this screen protector but after 5 minutes it kind of gave me a headache,2
6183,i finally tried the connection on my wife's lg optimus that i realized how awful this phone truly is,2
6184,pros looks really slick thick and solid your phone will be helpless once out of this case,2
6185,if you have small fingers and sharp nails then it might be a knock off device not the one pictured,2
6186,due to its lack of any silicone i could not get these to be comfortable on my ears,2
6187,this review is based on my experience with iphone pairing,2
6188,after you use it for about a week after application it already has multiple ugly scratches,2
6189,i contacted incipio and they want me to return the first one and now the second in black,2
6190,here is the bottom line if you do not need a memory card for the phone to get it to fit,2
6191,once this screen begins to peel i will go back to patiently waiting for the juice pack,2
6192,i'm sure it's not a good sign water seepage can end up being a problem here,2
6193,it came in its usual box and everything looked good until i realized it looked cheap and awful on my s4 so i trashed it,2
6194,there is a strange formation on the screen when held at an angle,2
6195,cons don't fit well and they keep falling out they just don't stick or stay put for long at all day or two,2
6196,when i was applying extreme pressure to the connection it would make the case start fitting correctly but unfortunately that did nothing,2
6197,getting in touch with motorola to see if i could get my money back,2
6198,i have a real lifeproof now i bought it in the first place,2
6199,like many of the other generic non-apple lightning charger cables the tip of the stylus is so soft that the fir is lose,2
6200,let's face it there's no point in buying a cool gadget that won't stand up to everyday use,2
6201,spraying your phone and screen protector is just as bad as the oem one i have now,2
6202,after a 2 hour charge i paired it with my co-worker's phone,2
6203,my main problem is that the actual protector is so thin you can hardly tell that this case is so pretty the raspberry grey charcoal,2
6204,conclusion looks nice well made doesn't do anything on my galaxys 3,2
6205,but every time i do the corners of the screen in a nearly erotic fashion,2
6206,t-mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few days i noticed receiver would not sync with my iphone,2
6207,i tried to smooth them out with the plastic card to run over the screen,2
6208,i didn't return it because it randomly rebooted itself,2
6209,i'll still use it but very disappointed i won't be using it,2
6210,selling the charger and battery together is a good idea in theory but its design seems flawed,2
6211,the rubber seemed better than the first one i had,2
6212,update 10 19 12 i couldn't take the plastic poking my fingers so i took it off and bought another case,2
6213,i have this connected to a bookshelf stereo in my kitchen which has a fat 3,2
6214,a companies customer service is just as good as job for a lot less and seems to be made decently,2
6215,i ordered them and was happy with the sound quality on the belkin device was far inferior,2
6216,i take the iphone 4s out of my pocket unlock it then change the volume,2
6217,i can push it away but it returns after a few minutes multiple times my phone restarted,2
6218,the rubbery part stretches out i have to push it around a bit then try turning it on again,2
6219,this is one of my primary uses of this phone the bar is set reasonably high,2
6220,it bends so much that it's unusable,2
6221,it some times give you low current so it does not work will it won't stay,2
6222,luckily there was no water damage to my phone but the cords break easily,2
6223,but in the end it just would have been better off with the 34 commuter 34 case since it's better than nothing,2
6224,their batteries are solid and a great value and performance that matches the claims stated by the manufacturer,2
6225,if you like the glossy look of the iphone4 screen then this screen protector is too close to the earpiece and home button,2
6226,when mounted you can't tilt it so it's not like i had tight jeans on,2
6227,at first when i received it-it is not especially pink in person it is more of a orange red,2
6228,the sound is decent and i like that it helps prevent accidentally pressing the edge of the screen like other products,2
6229,stay in school and don't do this or at least not so badly,2
6230,this screen protector protects the screen but again looks horrible as you can see i have many somewhat minor issues with the phone,2
6231,i will try using the phone while charging,2
6232,still working with it so i can see where this is going to be bulky but this one seems unnecessarily so,2
6233,the headset has pretty good volume it's not the same color as displayed,2
6234,might snap back into place but i wouldn't recommend this but only because of the charger being junk,2
6235,works fine when used with the older 30 pin cable to charge my phone throughout the day to keep it going,2
6236,the blueant t2 endure ear piece did not fit in the case otherwise,2
6237,i'm guessing that this is the case offered for my samsung galaxy s4 and samsung galaxy note 2,2
6238,plus it got very hot while charging which is probably partly causing the intermittent charging issue mentioned above,2
6239,it shouldn't be dead after 1 year of use this is the cable you want to get this protector on,2
6240,its was crack on the back of your phone from scratches but that's about all you can say for it,2
6241,it's actually very easy to apply and fits the screen well,2
6242,a few dollars for a product that is supposed to address this loss of connectivity,2
6243,ive always had good customer service from them but now they are just releasing cheeper makes of thier good products,2
6244,before i bought this item it was not expensive but again you get what you paid for,2
6245,i was so excited to use this phone over current offerings,2
6246,i tried to force it closed and it stopped working a two weeks later,2
6247,contacted seeler and they agreed to replace it,2
6248,i think the product may still have a use in your home or if taking pictures with it,2
6249,this was necessary because it was just so long and i could charge my future ipad3,2
6250,for some reason this case fits a bit too tightly around the case that i had to buy another dual port charger,2
6251,swipe up down side to side it comes apart and rips,2
6252,i got this case today and i will be returning this case and trying something else,2
6253,i have an otterbox case for my iphone 5s and and absolutely well love it,2
6254,i washed all of the screen protectors but i could not remove all the air bubbles,2
6255,when traveling in rural areas data is impossible to find when it is not,2
6256,it is slim and does not add too much bulk to already huge screen phones,2
6257,what i didn't realize giving these up would be such a big issue if the sound quality could have been better,2
6258,i like the idea of this case is nice but i opted for the black high gloss silicone case instead,2
6259,i don't want a replacement of these,2
6260,but failing to last even a single day is too much of a pain to use than any of the other devices was great,2
6261,the dents still really bug me i think they make the phone look good but not worth buying,2
6262,its tiny and my phone doesn't have this function which is a major plus,2
6263,based on hers i ordered one for myself and one for my home phone,2
6264,but i noticed that the camera cut out are beveled to protect the device,2
6265,it won't stay on my belt every time i sit in a chair the case will come apart from the rubber around,2
6266,pros it holds the phone well but holds cards securely,2
6267,when you need to take the unit into a verizon store and buy the real thing i guess,2
6268,update the coating on this case is not a soft cushiony material here that feels like it is yrs old unfortunately it isn't,2
6269,in the end when it turns out that right in the middle,2
6270,the connector just snaps after 2-3 days of average use purported by samsung,2
6271,this charger doesn't seem to be a good concept but it did not sync with my new phone,2
6272,well it came on time and i was happy with the nexus 5,2
6273,imagine if you needed to type an email or text takes real perseverance,2
6274,at first my phone didn't stay in place for you,2
6275,now it will no longer charge up properly and i don't seem to get used to but overall is a pretty snazzy feature,2
6276,the phone seems like it has a lot more protection,2
6277,my bad i didn't read carefully enough,2
6278,sadly this is not a top of the line phone for 2009,2
6279,this was not apparent until you take the case off the phone but that's about it really,2
6280,the product is not defective it is just not worth it to me if the other person can not hear you at all,2
6281,the pen looks very stylish and easy to use with my nexuss on sprint,2
6282,i can only use this headset in a room with nothing in it for good reception,2
6283,so i'm not sure what happened but i bought this quite awhile ago,2
6284,it's so frustrating that it's not connected to any bluetooth devise but keeps the phone from getting a lot of scratches,2
6285,pros when it works seems to have good sound quality and easy to use but lacks features present in others,2
6286,i got all six but the only thing i can use is the cigarette lighter charger,2
6287,i find that this charger doesn't work unless you remove the battery pack,2
6288,you might do well to try these out in a store or something it could save my day,2
6289,but that's not much for the price of this item has increased too,2
6290,sure it's bluetooth but you have to take it back,2
6291,if you are going to sleep when you wake up in the morning to a half charged phone,2
6292,the main reason i got this was because it's one of the worst headsets that i've ever used,2
6293,the phone has several apps preloaded i was able to stop this behavior but it still comes back sometimes,2
6294,overall i wasn't that impressed and found i have no need of a huge beta software file on my phone to fit in,2
6295,oh f these 2 pts cd be corrected then i wd say this is a known issue that can not be downloaded onto this phone,2
6296,i tried again and then the screen would not fit flush it was sticking up,2
6297,since some people did not like the lifeproof fre case,2
6298,the convenience i gain from the recharger does not trump the protection i need with a magpul case for 1 4 of the original,2
6299,i've returned the pen for a refund and just get an apple one,2
6300,i put on the screen protector it was cute it was versatile,2
6301,maybe i just got the case it doesnt sit properly,2
6302,the screen protector doesn't go all the way to zero which makes them useless for the rest of your life,2
6303,i just used it for 1 day the stem broke off from the base of the usb it started to shred,2
6304,it may loosen up a little over time i've only been in the cool phones business for about 4 years,2
6305,the mount worked well for a few weeks now,2
6306,no one i can think of for this,2
6307,i eventually had to throw it away just yet,2
6308,2 when the keys are in my pocket it was scratched up a bit,2
6309,when i put my phone in my pocket it's not holding up too well,2
6310,the warranty i was going to break my phone before i could get it to attach to a belt,2
6311,these headphones work fine when inside a building but for some reason i thought ez guardz screen savers were different,2
6312,this is an inexpensive case but it doesn't care at all,2
6313,i love the style and the color but function was key reason for purchasing,2
6314,its dimensions are such just wide and thick enough that it doesn't charge my phone at least 50 % louder,2
6315,fyi if you are thinking of buying this phone don't last at all,2
6316,the connector is flush with the glass so it provides no protection for the phone but not a strong case,2
6317,only get this if you have the front panel flipped around to the back for normal phone use,2
6318,the bad you have to be very careful how i held the phone or where i placed the phone with the samsung flip case on,2
6319,we will be rolling around in the car and house stereo so this isa biggie to me,2
6320,highs and lows are very distorted probably because you have to charge it by itself off of the phone,2
6321,one thing i didn't like that it is see-through on the bottom of the protectors,2
6322,the exact feel i do not want to lay flat on the desk and a step backwards in terms of wireless,2
6323,i've been using them for years and think they work just fine they seem to be identical,2
6324,so with that in mind i have found this to be the one with the mic on my bluetooth headset,2
6325,i had to struggle to get the plug out of my ipad and iphone,2
6326,just pay some money and get something of better quality,2
6327,i ordered this external battery charger for iphone 3 g,2
6328,there so little they don't tell you how many times i clean it,2
6329,i agree with most of the weight being far away from the device and it would still work,2
6330,i purchased this stylus to update my targus stylustargus stylus for apple ipad iphone was the second stylus i bought for my evo 3d,2
6331,the case seems to pick up a micro sd card for this,2
6332,the company has excellent customer service and that was no help,2
6333,feels cheap and light and once you put it on it created major bubbles,2
6334,the cover doesn't fully come up and protect the entire sides of my phone so i just threw it away,2
6335,i didn't realize giving these up would be such a big deal about it with the seller,2
6336,i would have rated it 5 stars but with its poor battery life i depend on using by bakup chargers,2
6337,this works great if you have a screen protector on it,2
6338,i saw the review is very good that's why i avoided web-browsing altogether,2
6339,that's really too bad a retractable usb charging cable with the ability to take make a phone call well no luck there,2
6340,it's a good case and allows you to charge any other usb device,2
6341,volume power buttons were very hard to see during normal day time hours,2
6342,the picture makes this case look awesome but it isn't the same i feel like it's on fire up to that point,2
6343,the rubberized finish has all rubbed off on the rubber thus removing the whiteness of the case,2
6344,love the idea of the case but it would be nicer to have them be flawlessly working,2
6345,given the price i was so excited to receive this item via vine program,2
6346,the first and really important thing to note is that this headset lasts for only 2 hours without recharging stone or otherwise,2
6347,its a cute case but when i took it out of my pocket all day long,2
6348,the downside is the plastic edges are sharp and the plastic is reasonably hard but the plastic is a lower quality then i expected,2
6349,if you look closely at the tip of the pen was different than my originals pen,2
6350,the rubber is very stiff and they are much better than this hybrid,2
6351,two stars instead of one because it was so cheap and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect ie,2
6352,not my problem but i hope it doesnt have a memory card slot,2
6353,charge talk timethis is the only good thing about this phone is great for any shutterbug,2
6354,i only bought this for a friend and she did not like it,2
6355,i received this yesterday and it works with a direct connection,2
6356,wherever you fall a lot of people can't use it,2
6357,the color is not as bright as pictured and the case is also very thick and bulky,2
6358,-card slots the front card slot is very deep to the point where i can not get my hotmail account to load to the phone,2
6359,now i will say that the sound quality of the device is fine,2
6360,i went with this due to the way this item was cut,2
6361,i use it at the gym and listening to music it was fine most of the time but still not always,2
6362,update the replacement headset was defective out of the box i went through the manual and charged it,2
6363,this case is very cheaply made and nonfunctional,2
6364,i like it but i thought it would look different being leather,2
6365,i tried all the buttons before installing in the ipad and the power button is hard to operate the volume silencer and off switches,2
6366,the bumper look is nice but it's not worth the hassle i ended up buying something else that is larger,2
6367,whatever the reason it's being sold at a dollar store,2
6368,it worked for a month then it would charge my phone and play with my phone on side broke about three months ago,2
6369,so now about that mentioned area of the phone with other bluetooth headsets i can't say too many positive things about this,2
6370,i'd heard good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers asked me where would i play it,2
6371,i don't treat my phone with a microfiber cloth because fingerprints and smudges just won't go away no matter how hard i tried,2
6372,i can take product testing pretty far but i will not go back to earbud style headphones again,2
6373,now the battery case comes off every time i take my phone out the case would be fine if they fit together well,2
6374,i did give it two stars because it worked for maybe 6 months then stopped charging,2
6375,also it doesn't add a lot of bulk to what is supposed to be bluetoothcondoes not work well inconsistent connectivity,2
6376,also they come with htc labeling but i think they are more for an ipad,2
6377,but what is worse is that every time i open the back cover it falls out,2
6378,after ordering a bunch of these cases and this one so far is the worst,2
6379,a small indicator light on the tablet doesn't turn on at all,2
6380,besides that deal breaker it's a great product just didn't fit right,2
6381,i really liked the design and look of the product was no longer illuminated and my phone was no longer charging,2
6382,get what you pay for other than that they adhere well and do the job,2
6383,the rubber doesn't have clean cuts and the plastic is more of a robin's egg blue,2
6384,i wanted a clear snug case for my new nexus 5 and i like it much better,2
6385,12 the icons are weird and not easy to put on and take off,2
6386,the problem is that the cutouts are not in the right place but each one is just a little too rough for it,2
6387,i was also hearing a lot of static on the line and is shorter so mic hangs by your mouth,2
6388,but then it's not a bad case just not well made,2
6389,it was extremely noticeable once i put the phone in your right hand to pull up on the screen,2
6390,this is way too much of a hassle and if i just wanted a slimmer one with a different color,2
6391,that's not what i thought it would be just that light blue,2
6392,my laptop crapped out last week and i had to replace yet another screen protector,2
6393,the draw appears to be too great even when fully charged these last no more than 90 minutes,2
6394,the back worries me a bit because i feel as if i was hearing things through a soup can,2
6395,defeats the whole purpose of its use if it doesn't protect and it cracked within the first month,2
6396,i am fond of using headphones with built-in music player is stuck at 150 % normal volume,2
6397,i kind of liked the fact that a power adapter to allow it to work and finally gave up,2
6398,there is faint noise that the headset makes that is easier to put on but when you want to sync your device,2
6399,it worked out fine for a few hours for a full charge around 6 hours,2
6400,i bought this chargerwith the able of the same brand through amazon k39210us older model of k39256us and i am still currently waiting for it,2
6401,u have to push hard and even then the only option available was return,2
6402,the higher the better which means that it's not a standard usb plug,2
6403,i lost the original pair of earphones for my samsung galaxy s4 i am concerned if it might be damaging it,2
6404,the rubber wrap doesn't stay on the phone unlike some cases that cover a little more of the screen which i will provide,2
6405,the touch is easier to use than the double sided tape provided is very small and hard to use,2
6406,i had a previous version of this product to say 34 for iphone 34,2
6407,however the case felt extremely tight when i put it in my purse or on my desk at work,2
6408,this was one of the first things i made sure to watch the installation video on their website,2
6409,after taking my phone in and out of 12v socket,2
6410,the headphone jack is too small to fit in anyone's ear,2
6411,not sure if in the future i will continue to recommend them wholeheartedly,2
6412,good luck if you have purchased a different case,2
6413,the case feel very nice color but didn't fit the cut out for the tactile button dead giveaway,2
6414,i had trouble with this in the first place this will not work,2
6415,i have to keep re-attaching it,2
6416,the fact that it's not something to do in your pocket with your keys or in your purse floating free,2
6417,how often does anyone open the sim card slot instead of the power button,2
6418,when i'm sitting at my desk and the phone is a little loose,2
6419,the sound was fantastic and when they worked they were great for phone calls and long-term wearing though,2
6420,it leaves out significant amount of space from the edges of the screen protector sit in your bathroom with a hot shower running,2
6421,so i pulled it off and went back to sleep,2
6422,my wife is one of those things plastic does,2
6423,drops the bluetooth connection every now and again even when i am connected the sound quality is mediocre and the wiring is a complete mess,2
6424,i got a full refund a couple of days to see if it also doesn't seem to fit well,2
6425,99 version that seems to be no noise reduction,2
6426,this leaves all of that minuscule dust trapped between your phone and case and scratch it all up,2
6427,regardless it is pretty low quality and does not provide any protection and snaps off very easily,2
6428,working fine with no error messages on my iphone 5 arent blocked but honestly i'll stick with otterbox,2
6429,if all you use your phone to take the call,2
6430,the purple is very light and the earloop isnt even worth the 7 i paid for it,2
6431,my cousin asked to see my phone features and etc,2
6432,product is very cheaply made and would not recommend these to others,2
6433,the case is basically what they say it is not as good as powersupport ag sp which i will wait for,2
6434,listening to music is maybe a little better but they haven't failed me yet,2
6435,after extensive testing i have come to the conclusion that there is no way to prevent the plastic from cracking and peeling,2
6436,the battery life on these is about half of what it was supposed to auto adjust but apparently not,2
6437,i'll probably purchase another pack as a back up to keep ihe phone clean and safe until you get a beep,2
6438,i had bought this for my girlfriend a couple weeks ago and found it shattered in pieces,2
6439,i love the colors on it but i figured i might have to spring for the more expensive apple headphones with mic anyway,2
6440,no wires no plugs just place it on the mat and have them fully charge by morning,2
6441,the only reason i decided not to use the usb port for other devices,2
6442,now it doesn't work on my samsung galaxy 5,2
6443,the case is super cute and the color is basically gray,2
6444,unfortunately the case also makes it a fingerprint magnet,2
6445,it 8217s about the same size as the majority of users are seeing large improvements in battery life,2
6446,they shrunk it due to the overheatinng problem,2
6447,i've tried 3 of these cases and they both failed the same way,2
6448,first i ordered this for my iphone 4 and ipad 2,2
6449,least it charges my phone very fast more like below average,2
6450,wish it wasn't such a cheap plastic case with glue spots on it,2
6451,but the downside is that they do protect the screen well enough and gets scratched to all heck far too easily,2
6452,i was impressed with the quality of this product,2
6453,i was really excited to get this and use it but unfortunately it can't be posted here,2
6454,the usb opening at the bottom bows out,2
6455,i did not like this at at the phone is small and allows dust in the back of my head,2
6456,i am sad because these batteries do not last as long as the original ipad iphone cables,2
6457,i owned the incipio case for my iphone 5s and and absolutely well love it,2
6458,if started from the speaker at the top it does not cover the top or bottom so that when the phone is paired,2
6459,i think that will just take some getting used to how easily my thumbs slide across the surface,2
6460,within the first 24 hours the design started wearing away after having it for 5 days,2
6461,this one is advertized by ringke as the thinnest hybrid case on the market neither though would lead me to returning the case,2
6462,fourth time this has happened hard reset is not working so i'm forced to download an app just to screenshot,2
6463,maybe i should keep this case in a drop even from a short distance fall,2
6464,on my iphone4 the rubber fits real well and it is a much better option imho b00a9lvc2k,2
6465,other than that the other issue is the camera i thought something was wrong with my phone at first that it wasn't cheap,2
6466,it fit well the color purple was just as it was supposed to do listen to music too,2
6467,super fast shipping from the vendor but i don't have to detach anything to access the headphone jack,2
6468,so i decided to get a new one,2
6469,since i also discovered that it will not lay down flat anymore,2
6470,it is rolling around in the car and used periodically over the week,2
6471,so i can live with it i don't want to fry the battery,2
6472,in my view they acted like they had seen these problems with the well-reviewed imagnet dashboard mount for smartphones,2
6473,i wouldn't recommend the product but i made a mistake by purchasing the otterbox,2
6474,that being said i connected the patuoxun bluetooth a2dp is that if i am charging the ipad while using it the battery actually still drains,2
6475,you can open it with a razor and adjust the performance but should i have to do restart the phone every time,2
6476,the phone was too thick with this case on it and the white gets dirty quick,2
6477,i order this for my samsung note 3,2
6478,just because something is expensive doesn't mean it was convenient to use,2
6479,it was much more of a pain to put on and take off,2
6480,i regret i bought two of these guys,2
6481,i have to take my glasses off to do so if i want it to get scratched but not a huge gash where,2
6482,although it is not a very good product,2
6483,i removed it from my car used it at home for another 2-3 hours and it was still blue,2
6484,it says it is because its not anti glare or whatver but for the price that i paid,2
6485,there's really no way to use a hands-free smart phone controller,2
6486,finally i didn't care for it much,2
6487,you can't put in longer cables if you need to use a usb plug rated for 10v to be safe,2
6488,i ordered this from the warehouse section at amazon and the sleeve to fit your smart phone adds another 30,2
6489,i noticed the corner was cracked when i first put this on the phone my phone would freeze,2
6490,unfortunately it was difficult to hold the phone to your face,2
6491,if you don't mind finding glitter all over your stuff this is the case offered for my samsung galaxy s3 fitted perfectly,2
6492,its take about 14 hours to fully charge the battery but leave it in a hot car,2
6493,i sooo wanted to like the logitech powershell controller is that it's easy to find in your bag,2
6494,at first i thought it was very nice,2
6495,it was a pretty case but some of the once i ordered did not work,2
6496,i had purchased from this seller before here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing,2
6497,i just super glued it and didn't use it any more,2
6498,there is a serious safety hazard of having a fully charged phone was unnecessary when i got to my destination,2
6499,it works beautifully clear sound good range and easy to use and apple copied a lot of ideas from it,2
6500,well if you buy one of these for my wife,2
6501,mostly around the volume and hdmi ports was very thin and didn't fit the phone,2
6502,i would order a few at a time because it takes a month to get here and it ships from china,2
6503,no big deal but since i look at my phone all of the time i am done i could get two tickets and an accident,2
6504,once charged the usb end of the supplied ac adapter,2
6505,case has a soft touch that is about as slippery as the iphone itself albeit in a very slim package as represented,2
6506,the sim card keeps falling out of the connection port just because it is less slippery than the original surface,2
6507,at the first opinion i believe that it was a wet application protector before buying my bad,2
6508,so don't activate the app until you are really ready to give this a lower rating for lack of durability,2
6509,this product was designed specific for the sprint evo 4 g lte has a case on it,2
6510,this item has rough edges and broke when i tried to put it onto my phone the case fell off still scratching my phone,2
6511,i tried and tried to get this cover on my screen with all the air bubbles except the one with the soft feeling,2
6512,the case does not fit the iphone 4s without fail,2
6513,i reviewed both of these cases as well if you're willing to modify them yourself,2
6514,the colors are not as vibrant as shown in the photo or remove the photo it's kind of useless for me,2
6515,i'm now using the belkin vue and it's working it just isn't made right,2
6516,however since i bought it in 2006 and i imagine there are alternatives that suffer from none of these,2
6517,but they shouldn't advertise that it fits the phone nice and love the color,2
6518,i love the flat cord it's easy to hold and it doesn't even fit around the sides,2
6519,the phone fits so snugly that it is almost impossible to get off the phone way too easily,2
6520,eventually the silicone portion of the case to use the phone due to its tight fit and rugged feel,2
6521,i even made sure the screen was clear and it was,2
6522,it also fits quite snug in the belt clip was hard n taking it out of the case,2
6523,had high hopes for this case and have these issues,2
6524,unit is pack-ably small charges quickly i charged it for 4 hours at work and it just didn't beep,2
6525,bottom line the inductive charging concept is great but i'm sure it's not a perfect fit but works looks and feels cheap generic4,2
6526,not if your protector begins to peel on it's own you have to push the top left corner of my phone,2
6527,i got this for my wife's iphone 3gs charging i am sure the video was correct but it did not,2
6528,it is a little too bulky for me i can't use them with this,2
6529,when i took it trail running it was all over the place while driving on the highway,2
6530,i always used water apply screen protectors but i could not use certain screen protectors with it,2
6531,i'm returning them today and will be looking for the thinker rubber cases that will actually protect the phone,2
6532,i wanted to like this but stand was flimsy and wouldn't stay stuck to either of our car's windshields,2
6533,-everyone can hear your music especially if you turn it off for any reason,2
6534,i have no issues with the samsung batteries,2
6535,significantly inferior to the earbuds that came with them were way to big for her to hold,2
6536,i am very particular about cases and this one was one of my least favorite,2
6537,i love the form factor of these headphones,2
6538,says its arrived but i have not had a chance to play with this a bit more,2
6539,i had to return it since the phone wasn't in the best shape for a 34 like new 34 device,2
6540,if the case snapped onto the phone it wouldn't stay closed and the phone falls out of the wall socket,2
6541,gave it two stars because they say universal but they're not really for me anyway,2
6542,the zomm works pretty simply attach it to your phone it had multiple bubbles in it,2
6543,no need to turn it on out of the box the led worked well as a flashlight torch even before charging,2
6544,it is so thin and the battery life reception and ruggedness of the s10-hd,2
6545,battery did not last more than a year,2
6546,although the case is hardcore it is way too squishy and the material is a sand magnet,2
6547,it took almost 6-7 hours to initially charge,2
6548,by 12:00 i needed to turn up my brightness on my phone so i never put it on again bought a soft case,2
6549,i also like the dual speaker not stereo when on a call through a headset i do net get a thing,2
6550,remember to remove the receiver case after charging as it is not as we wish it were,2
6551,but several reviews wrote it would fitand work so i got this one and i am not seeing any benefit to it,2
6552,it's definitely worth it to put in a few extra bucks and get a flexible case,2
6553,but now i simply don't recommend the jabra stone,2
6554,overall seems a good product for the price,2
6555,the two screen protectors together make it very hard to slide in and out of,2
6556,it will pop back on again after turning it off,2
6557,this case has vulnerabilities around the top and bottom edge of the screen leaves about 1 4 along the bottom unprotected,2
6558,i get less than 1 hour of talk time before the battery died in the middle of a conversation,2
6559,first of all i went to use them however they didn't quite fit the slot and was getting smashed,2
6560,they work for a few times and the case did not fit tightly enough around my phone to protect it as well,2
6561,why put it in my pocket and i don't have an android device and my father loves his phone,2
6562,instead if being able to lay your hands flat or allowing the outside of your ear canal which makes no sense,2
6563,just put on the clip and plug it into the wall and the phone into the corners that i was concerned about damaging the screen,2
6564,covers the sides and back of the case which lead me to believe it was for another phone and they advertised it for the thunderbolt,2
6565,since manual is poorly written you will need to remove the bottom piece to charge your phone,2
6566,although easy to pair with a television,2
6567,at least if it does not work with my phone,2
6568,but i should say that this is the second bluetooth headset that i broke a couple of years ago,2
6569,updatedthe battery started off providing great indications of a couple of minutes on two cellular phones,2
6570,you would have to take off you're casejust to plug it in the wall computer and car nothing works,2
6571,you need to first press the button once to answer the call,2
6572,hopefully it was just a hair too big so when you put the earbuds together and the magnets grab each other,2
6573,the earpiece and cable feel sturdy enough to last the sound in the left bud became muted or cut on and off,2
6574,its been over a month and it is already faking apart,2
6575,i like it comes with the silly sparkle,2
6576,great price and color but the case is a big no-no for batteries,2
6577,i'm not sure if i got the wrong item,2
6578,i charged it all day a full 24 hours and it's got that smooth buttery glide for your finger ands pen,2
6579,sounded exactly like the earphones that came with my phone didn't charge hardly at all,2
6580,it is a real good chance it will not fit in the tiny hole they left for the jack,2
6581,fits the iphone5 and does not fit snug enough around my phone,2
6582,also i could not easily turn off the phone and the spare battery,2
6583,it requires force to insert and remove my droid x from,2
6584,i have a similar one for my galaxy note 2 and got it plugged in through my receiver denon 1913,2
6585,i gave all 3 of mine away cause i just didn't like that it was a better executed one,2
6586,cover doesn't interfere with any of the 3 sizes to fit properly,2
6587,i dont see how it works with his iphone devices,2
6588,draw back to this case is the plastic screen cover will stick to the face of my iphone then i when by the directions exactly,2
6589,the swivel got flimsy after a few days i realized that the buttons are covered but there is no in-line volume control,2
6590,you can trigger this by pressing the button but i now know button's location,2
6591,i have compared it to the original ipod screen and it seems that the hole is just exactly made and no allowance,2
6592,i've used it for about a year and i've been getting steady use out of them for nearly two years,2
6593,so i thought an extender would fit the bill and had great reviews so i ordered it,2
6594,i think for the price it is probably a good case for the iphone but it just feels cheap,2
6595,it drops sound in and out and i have to unplug and plug in when i want to listen to music,2
6596,the texture doesn't look very very cheap,2
6597,i'd be lucky to get 3 full hours out of them on a full charge indicated defective on our samsung epic,2
6598,there is a serious safety hazard of having a fully charged phone was unnecessary when i got to my destination,2
6599,the 2-material strong fluffy amazonbasics pc silicon case for iphone 5 to be able to see the wire,2
6600,sony took my address and said they would send me packets of 3 for free but it was still annoying,2
6601,the buttons are a little difficult to use with the belkin case but that's it,2
6602,this case would receive a higher rating if it fit better,2
6603,i have found that this case is not so great,2
6604,flexible neck part and in general good quality of the sound was ok but don't expect the clip to last,2
6605,although i generally find kensington products well made i can not understand what i am paying 70 for,2
6606,i followed the directions to a t and it still did work with my wireless charger but it is very slippery,2
6607,unfortunately as many other reviewers pointed out the plastic tabs that hold the cover in place and that did not always work,2
6608,this case on this battery broke at the little tab after only 2 weeks of use thank god i had an extra cable,2
6609,it turns out that in my pocket the blue tooth connection,2
6610,if you buy it you may find it works for you,2
6611,the sad part is that this is good for an emergency when you're out and about and not fiddle with anything,2
6612,2 efficiency the phone is very sensitive to touch,2
6613,i guess it would prevent scratches to the back of it is a smear finger print magnet and not worth the the cost to return,2
6614,so this is why i drop the review down to two stars if you buy the one i did from tx,2
6615,on the plus side it does fit snugly and there is no way around this i've tried,2
6616,it's also a pain to have to carry an extra cable comes with it to be able to use it,2
6617,i never really used these to answer calls so i won't send it back as it is for the samsung galaxy note 10,2
6618,that's really all it is worth and that's the reason why they're selling so cheap,2
6619,i've had excellent success with jabra bluetooth products in the past especially the destroyer they make for the iphone 4,2
6620,this is not compatible as an ac charger with any of my four cases on the vu,2
6621,i gave it a open mind and gave it a try i put the battery in and got a blue light,2
6622,i purchased this because i thought it was going to be brighter too,2
6623,durable long battery life intelligent design regarding the buds and controls as well as the other ones that i have purchased through anker,2
6624,i have a real lifeproof now i bought it in the first place,2
6625,it does give good protection but the button that covers the power sync connector,2
6626,maybe would look better on white phones mon problem with a lot of screen protectors but they are very hollow,2
6627,problem is nobody makes a mini-usb cable which can be connected to it,2
6628,even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone you have to swipe your finger down the screen,2
6629,once open the case is just low quality,2
6630,if you are going to plug a cable in you might as well spend 40 and get something useful,2
6631,i again put the device in airplane mode and started a video in mx player prior to plugging the phone in to the whole case,2
6632,they felt very obtrusive and didn't stay on my phone at all,2
6633,i have tried adjusting the case and there were no letters stamped on the front of the phone,2
6634,this is not a case i will be putting this case in a drawer,2
6635,of it sticking and then it just stops working properly,2
6636,however the simple presence of the case presents a nice ridge that helps you hold the slim and slippery iphone with more solid confidence,2
6637,i am glad this was a cheap case so i can't charge my iphone 5,2
6638,i tried repeatedly for several days with the phone's features for much time,2
6639,i only had this for 3 months or more it sucks,2
6640,well day 3 i finally decided to return the phone and get a cheaper less bulky bumper case,2
6641,i'd have the phone of the desk and the clip broke on me,2
6642,the audio from the mic like when you're using the on screen keyboard,2
6643,i could see a possibility that in taking it out of the box and opted to charge it,2
6644,i bought this a day after i got my case in 4 days including easter sunday,2
6645,0 plug can actually fit in the right side of the face of the iphone has wore down from going in and out of pockets,2
6646,no big deal but since i look at my phone for a while now it has its pros and cons,2
6647,but once its snapped closed trying to remove this case from my phone when i drop it and i drop it alot,2
6648,as soon as i put the case on it so i wasn't expecting a generic chinese holder when ordering from amazon,2
6649,i bought 5 of these one for my work phone and one for my son's evo 4 g lte is really high quality,2
6650,i've installed numerous protectors and this one just doesn't live up to snuff,2
6651,bottom line if you are a picture fan take a lot of work to plug in the audio cable,2
6652,another great thing is that this screen protector is horrible item it bubbles up really bad,2
6653,the current images for this case don't bother with the wi-fi range is really short,2
6654,quietest earpiece i've had in the past,2
6655,first off i do not recommend this product,2
6656,update i still use this device mainly to use with my iphone 4s my macbook pro too,2
6657,it also feels really nice and it holds the phone but should not interfere with access to the volume buttons almost snapped,2
6658,these headphones work as they're supposed to but the plastic makes the images less crisp and gets dinged up,2
6659,fit the phone nicely and i was able to repair it with normal double sided tape,2
6660,and it's barely loud enough if there's no road noise but as soon as it was put on very flimsy,2
6661,so i stuck it out and put it back on again the lip was just uneven,2
6662,the ok glass command stopped working on the phone nowhere else,2
6663,at least w the ismooth i will have a new phone with a bad headphone jack,2
6664,i dont like this screen protector for a few weeks and it already stopped working,2
6665,so i like the battery life and charge it on the go,2
6666,i wouldn't buy another one to try,2
6667,it was cute and all but when i put my case back on the iphone the next song is playing,2
6668,it stopped working after 2 months of use,2
6669,i attempted to use it on equil note,2
6670,when i tried to use it it did not work i sent that one back for a refund because i had not been charged,2
6671,the case provides just enough grip to keep the phone at a decent price,2
6672,this case is slippery when you put it on your arm and it looks even bigger,2
6673,that didn't happen the phone was and still is fine but it does not look too bad but the quality is subpar,2
6674,speaking of sound now seems to be a bit to large,2
6675,it's was used but it should not have failed,2
6676,i dropped the phone it would not close tight again,2
6677,this is similar to the joby griptight smartphone mount and there's no way to turn it off,2
6678,wife cracked her phone with this case on it it's a pain to deal with,2
6679,i will not remove it it would not be as fat as it looks,2
6680,one orb just failed right out of the box insecure unencrypted application data settings out of the box pairing with an evo by htc,2
6681,the batteries are already coming apart and they don't have to wiggle to get to work usually usb headsets are super reliable,2
6682,i have confidence that if i dropped the phone once on my carpet and the case popped right off and the side of the phone,2
6683,i've ordered this a few months i've noticed some problems with it,2
6684,while i can pair each phone with the bluetooth only one of the 2 usb cables failed already,2
6685,i have gone through several black lightning cables in just a few days the paint started chipping off and looked terrible,2
6686,the protector feels great otherwise but even after squeegeeing the heck out of seeing the video game on the screen,2
6687,i really thought about getting a red silicone one but couldn't seem to get things right for the note 2,2
6688,i've dropped it on hard surfaces a couple of times to get it to make sure it stays plugged in just right,2
6689,what i have not like is that the plastic is interfering with typing on the screen,2
6690,charging and audio playback are fine and i can still fit it in a desk dock,2
6691,now at month 8 the battery no longer holds any charge,2
6692,however the next time we took it out if the bag,2
6693,but based on the button issue is a bit of work to do when replacing this,2
6694,i do have a hard time hearing me talk,2
6695,skinomi also takes away from the mirror image,2
6696,i actually lost battery life while running the phone gps with the charger plugged in to use the adapter not just the new wire,2
6697,the wire was enough to reach the pad that holds the phone seems like it has a magnet it shuts so well,2
6698,i am very active so having a case that has any sort of grip to the sides,2
6699,it's a cable it shouldn't be a huge issue because the problem i have with this phone is that the wifi hotspot feature,2
6700,bought this for my wife's iphone 5 dropped the other day and two clips on the front part of the screen looks great,2
6701,it won't hold a charge for about 1,2
6702,you can even have two phones paired with it at the same time as she was charging in car,2
6703,the note 3 version of this screen protector and it's surprisingly not due to the application being crooked,2
6704,also because my phone has both the charging port and the earphone jack is wide and speakers are not covered,2
6705,i left this in sunlight for a full day when sync and wifi are on,2
6706,it looks pretty nice on my phone but it is much easier to apply and far better to look at afterwards,2
6707,k leme try to do this without hurting your fingers,2
6708,i didn't have my husband's case is nice and tight,2
6709,if you can get it on cleanly they work just fine so i don't have an android device and my father loves his phone,2
6710,the bottom of the part that goes into the cigarette lighter detatched and i had to discard it,2
6711,it was okay but does not look like it would hold much or hold up for long,2
6712,won't protect my phone so i'll give it that,2
6713,i bought this usb charger because of the price and they looked awesome and not cheap at all,2
6714,time will tell how reliable it is and how well it works and 1 star for their support policy,2
6715,you attach the power adapter to the back of your neck so a behind-the-head headsets for comfort reasons,2
6716,difficult to insert and remove and i'm afraid my phone will fall out of your ear,2
6717,i was able to get my iphone 4s into this case but it has already cracked through near the sync cable port,2
6718,wireless charging is cool technology but it will need to be charged more than once a day even with heavy use,2
6719,the pouch itself might have been okay but the reason for using them is completely awful,2
6720,rubber falls off and the plastic case that holds the phone in a fall,2
6721,i think that was my fault i did not let them know it was not roughly treated,2
6722,the bubbles and dust came out easily and the wrench is to soft to apply much pressure,2
6723,the dock works but it does not have dust covers for ports,2
6724,i tried to get the same type of cord,2
6725,i was quite happy with the iphone but i am soooo happy to be going back to cheaper screen protectors,2
6726,others may have better luck with it but i would shop around before i buy this product again,2
6727,i didn't like this spray screen protector its not anti glare scratch or fingerprint but it still was a useful screen protector,2
6728,it also have a lot of inward force so the phone is facing out,2
6729,these will certainly protect the screen and one that will effect only a few,2
6730,initially they feel nice kindof like rubber but the hard plastic is very hard with no grip factor added,2
6731,the power button became impossible to operate with the jabra as a music player,2
6732,the item is too small not plus size it can not hold an iphone that has a case on it,2
6733,i thought it would give me the 34 if you want it just for the look,2
6734,the biggest problem i had with this case and why i'm not a heavy app use but have already run out of space,2
6735,well you get the idea down you will be able to without damaging the lenses,2
6736,all of this while the tracker is in my front pocket how i carry all my phones,2
6737,just got this yesterday and today when i used it i discovered that the camera hole was not aligned correctly,2
6738,i discovered that sweat only gets in through the power and volume looks like i got a different more bulkier one,2
6739,the only other hassle i discovered was that the cover on the charging part and it doesn't fit perfectly in the case,2
6740,plus the cord is too short another couple of inches and use thinner material,2
6741,also as mentioned elsewhere the case over the back of the phone and doesn't look attractive,2
6742,also the silver lining on the back started to peel within a day or two stuff collects in it like dust hair and pocket lint,2
6743,i recommend it to you but if you looking for something to last this is not it,2
6744,does not extend far enough towards the volume buttons making it hard to fit into some phones particularly if the phone has a protective case,2
6745,i recommend you choose something else if you need quality stuff,2
6746,if the edges had just a little bit more on your device,2
6747,i will have to give it 2 stars for this,2
6748,update january 24 2013 i am changing my review to 2 stars,2
6749,my experience with this is it's not going to hold up too long,2
6750,faded off after some use did not protect the phone so well that it would take this long,2
6751,and what happens when you have a screen protector,2
6752,but this piece is probably one of the most beautiful iphone cases,2
6753,eventually causing the rubber to stretch out and fall off my phone,2
6754,but ultimately i didn't like the way they designed it,2
6755,even though i've had it for a week it looks old,2
6756,i first thought it was the battery but soon learned that was not the problem with my unit which is hopefully just a defective unit,2
6757,no more worrying that when i take it out of its case your phone is completely unprotected,2
6758,this product does not fit the phone it comes off every time i take my phone out and the case comes right off the phone,2
6759,they will disappear from the phone and the earbuds all the way up,2
6760,the third and fourth i bought because i like the headset so much so that everyone mentioned it,2
6761,this product offers great scratch resistance but using the s-pen access that keeps getting bent back,2
6762,my beef with this product is it was fine at first,2
6763,it's ok if you want to put into it,2
6764,you can press down on the screen but black and it was there,2
6765,after checking with the built in connection pins and not being able to hold the case open,2
6766,although it's pretty and fashion it did not last much longer than the regular pre-installed battery as well,2
6767,searching the web there's very little information and even motorola's own site shows it only works with a handful of apps,2
6768,this case feels like it's going to fly out and fall to the ground,2
6769,and i can not recommend this case as your 34 everyday 34 protection for the iphone the case needs to come out,2
6770,it looks like nice leather in the picture but is very thn and the picture is much prettier the stones don't shine,2
6771,it made the s-pen on the screen is a pentile display,2
6772,when you have a screen protector case is to protect all the vulnerable parts of your phone,2
6773,i end up having to turn my phone so i'll give it another shot,2
6774,basically if you want to switch on the phone from the case to clean it the less it held the charge,2
6775,the slots for your bank cards are sticky also the material feels like it will snap off with very little help,2
6776,i'd return it and get something else,2
6777,that's why it gets the 2 stars i gave are for the compact design customer service,2
6778,am i accidentally pressing the power button really hard to actually get your phone to turn off,2
6779,i mean i will really miss the quality of the case was more slipppery than i'd like,2
6780,its nice however it doesn't change status to shipped soon,2
6781,it wasn't very stylish and didn't seem to help much in daylight,2
6782,i really wish someone could make a case that could actually help you drop your phone while texting or on a call,2
6783,i suggest that you go to your settings and uninstall it,2
6784,please be sure if you really want one then spend a couple more dollars and get something that is a darker color,2
6785,you have to take your cover off to get a better sense of how the watermarks affect text input,2
6786,as it stands i tried it for a day or two,2
6787,i dont think i would like but then i changed my mind and decided to return this product with the protector plastics still on,2
6788,this thing will break if you don't look too closely,2
6789,the skin is so floppy and limp though that it just wouldn't wake up despite having a full charge,2
6790,for less than 1 shipped i figured i didn't have the gameboy logo on the left side,2
6791,not a huge deal but it was a major problem with the one i got was defective,2
6792,these screen protectors distort the screen and give a bit of a lip around the front of the phone to let you know,2
6793,tried several times to remove the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground,2
6794,it charged and it's a question of which would break first the case or my phone because of how slippery the case is,2
6795,gave two stars because i don't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing,2
6796,this is the second charging device to break on me so what i wound up doing after the bubbly results i had with these,2
6797,i dont like is that there is no curve whatsoever for the ear hook,2
6798,i'm a field tech so i often use this when i'm on the phone all the way from zero to full,2
6799,i've bought screen protectors before and i've placed order still waiting for the official bumper to ship,2
6800,i would also like to mention that the company was kind enough to send me an rma for the helium and i bought the air,2
6801,there was a bit of static even when the phone is on my body the opposite of each other,2
6802,i really hope that this was just a defected pair that i received for free from the vine program,2
6803,the idea for this bend is so that you can see the screen because reflecting light,2
6804,for those reasons this case like the last one i got is black and it looks like a snap on case anymore,2
6805,this one does not have the best fit,2
6806,if you try and pull it off it sticks to the phone screen and placed the protector on the glass of the phone,2
6807,i am going to have to buy another one because it just falls off the glass,2
6808,the edges of screen protector won't stick at least on my blackberry the microphone is terrible,2
6809,cheap i end up getting my wife a plantronics m55 for about 1 4 the speed of the oem wall charger,2
6810,i fit medium size women's shirts and could not get the pouch on my belt,2
6811,the bumper is nice it has a good fit with the iphone 5 i took it off my phone before a full day was over,2
6812,so i would say if you're looking for then order it,2
6813,this phone is not compatble with t-mobile and probably the sim card is recognized just fine,2
6814,all in all i still love the bling but needs better quality workmanship,2
6815,was searching for a while for a full case for my note 2 and my girlfriend's gs4 to allow qi charging,2
6816,after some adjustment i was able to get it to work,2
6817,as we all know besides medicore sound quality they are hearing but most think it is ok to presume other phones around,2
6818,i ordered these for a friend and he was not perfect,2
6819,there are far better products out there and if you have to change the battery and the phone at the same time,2
6820,my daughter loved the color but nothing else,2
6821,a good thing about this is that the sleeve is that it is extremely thin which i like,2
6822,i would not recommend this product based on all the reviews of jawbone icon,2
6823,i'm worried i will lose my i d out of it i decided to give it a middling score overall,2
6824,this stuff worked well at first but it stops working after few months of use the outer rubber layer began to sag,2
6825,slippery back i did not find it hard to hold with one hand and unstick the other and finally gave up,2
6826,and on top of that additional investment you will need to replace this case cove,2
6827,it also feels really nice and it holds the phone snugly to your arm the buckle is tight enough,2
6828,if it was not for these issues the case would be a can't miss quality product,2
6829,unfortunately it does not fit my phone well but in a week it broke,2
6830,while i found the nexus 5 version of this product that along with the music charged the iphone,2
6831,pros charges my portable iphone chargercons does not work with my 2008 volvo or my phillips powered speakers,2
6832,so at the end of the case i don't know if it will stretch a bit over time,2
6833,unless the manufacturer of this product in the begining it fits well,2
6834,the volume buttons don't work with this phone,2
6835,if you try and pull it off it sticks to the phone screen and placed the protector on the phone,2
6836,it was hard to get on compared to others i have used,2
6837,did not care for it and i wanted to remove my phone from the my hand when i was walking up a stairway,2
6838,i might have received a defective product but overall i was really disappointed,2
6839,this is good for people who are prone to dropping things,2
6840,it will not work on my iphone 5 running ios 7,2
6841,amazon is very nice to look at and the feel of the phone and an unattractive plastic piece to cover the back,2
6842,if i had to do it again i would go directly to an aftermarket charger that offers more than 0,2
6843,i could have replaced it but reading the other reviews it seems like there is a lot to like about this phone,2
6844,before i bought this case thinking it wouldn't last with heavy use though for the price you cant really see anything,2
6845,the problem is the most important thing on a phone was horrible because it was a cheap knock off of otterbox,2
6846,i had to edit this review as i wanted to compare it to other speakers,2
6847,i replaced this with a halo dry installation screen protector from tech armor and everything is clear and colourful now,2
6848,it takes serious work to plug in the car charger when i am in my car as there is no indicatorit would be worth it,2
6849,it has many cool sensors but you wont be able to save large files from pc,2
6850,i will send it back for a refund either,2
6851,leather fits the phone well and also it has a bad connection somewhere inside,2
6852,this case has absolutely no feel to the power or volume buttons,2
6853,their products are obviously rushed and low-quality and not cut very accurately,2
6854,i'm going to be returning this because it's not worth burning down my home,2
6855,on the positive side the material the case is made of a hard rubber compound,2
6856,battery is same as the battery that came with it didn't help much,2
6857,i really don't expect my electronics to last more than a month to arrive to be more fun than my black hybrid case,2
6858,pebble does not seem to be made of a low quality plastic or vinyl,2
6859,you need both hands to install the phone in the horizontal position only i prefer vertical,2
6860,in 99 % of real world situations just get a charger that meets the usb charging standard if you need one,2
6861,given the build quality i was very disappointed in this product for two reasons 1,2
6862,this battery has no on off switch on the headset if it's out of amazon's return window,2
6863,if that was fixed it would be perfect if it would fit tighter and was constructed better,2
6864,only issue is you have to have a belt clip option,2
6865,the only thing i would like about this product is it looks nice but did not fit with the qi wireless charging back,2
6866,it turns out the the red part of the cover is a hard unforgiving plastic,2
6867,the most important part of this device does not offer,2
6868,if you google the problems of the phone you'll noticed that this case is killing my wifi connection,2
6869,it comes a loose alot and i know it's not my wrist being odd shaped or have blood flow skin issues,2
6870,if you have a problem with randomly rebooting in the middle of his white eyes and they aren't straight either,2
6871,i'm not overly clueless and i've tried several cases on my s4,2
6872,problems with 2 out of 5 star rating,2
6873,push pull shove no matter what you are told to do,2
6874,it is not smooth to get the phone in it did it moreso,2
6875,so i was disappointed because it is not directly in the middle of the screen,2
6876,when you open it and it doesn't hold the phone very well,2
6877,if anything sticks to the adhesive side while you are trying to lay down and i usually ended up with pits blemishes,2
6878,after writing this review only thing is they are totally different than the ones i have got this one was not designed well,2
6879,the only problem i had with the otterbox defender on iphones in the past in terms of clarity or ease of installation,2
6880,i just wish the color was black all the way through i would have given it a 5 star ratting,2
6881,i had both the phones volume and the docks volume all the way down like the top part of the screen,2
6882,the battery i got works but it is very loose and slips easily,2
6883,the sound quality overall was horrible in fact as i write this i have invested 2,2
6884,i don't think this is a bad case but it's not a bad choice but i would recommend looking to a different case,2
6885,i hate phone cases but i've been really happy with my decision to switch,2
6886,this case is very slippery and i felt like i am playing a video game where i can not understand what i am saying,2
6887,after my contract is up i am switching to another case that covers more of the iphone,2
6888,i am very careful about putting screen protectors on but idk what was up with this one,2
6889,the retention clip on the holster is a little too narrow and hard to remove it,2
6890,gave two stars because i got it on it looks dingy and needs to be rebooted,2
6891,and i have to push out the charging cable if there is a replacement all will be forgiven and i will change my review,2
6892,this battery is intended to be used every day,2
6893,the second pair was working fine for about 8 months and while i love certain things about it i don't recommend this product,2
6894,but it may just be me but i would not purchase another case like this one,2
6895,my son frequently misplaces his phone and i guess for some it might work but not for me,2
6896,you can see my other reviews for other cases i've used have not been a problem,2
6897,but it is thin and offers very little protection because of the top and bottom of the phone,2
6898,i'm just trying to figure out where the stylus is,2
6899,problem 1 the power sleep button is impossible to press and it answers without any issues and seems fairly reliable,2
6900,if it worked all the time even when the keys are in my pocket it's not holding up too well,2
6901,the skin case looks and feels great on your phone and it is hard to push it is super slippery,2
6902,they should have designed a better retention mechanism on the eargel with some kind of glue but for some reason it would not register,2
6903,so first i had to buy a new case so i don't have the slightest idea how they ended up there,2
6904,when i first purchased this item prior to getting my phone i wasn't able to give it a try,2
6905,however these really don't work so i'm giving this a two stars because it's pretty usable for walking,2
6906,plugged it into my phone whose battery was down to 80 % after 2,2
6907,too bad because it is probably one of the most annoying features about jelly bean 4,2
6908,it looks and feels great on your phone and it is hard to click back in place,2
6909,my girlfriend used this case for 1 day and threw it in my closet,2
6910,i love that you can see the wires now,2
6911,i purchased a new trexel case from amazon to replace it but it turns out its a nut embedded in the plastic,2
6912,when the galaxy phone works it is a nice looking case is important to you,2
6913,they are getting better apps but you cant press the home button several times after waking up the phone,2
6914,i found them harder to work with than the controls on the sony headset don't control the ipod iphone,2
6915,i like the color but i don't recommend the full body shield,2
6916,i made sure i followed the directions of using soap water,2
6917,it appears to be very sturdy and looks nice but there are others that protect just as well without hindering the hardware buttons,2
6918,this car mount didn't come with a smoothing card,2
6919,it snaps right on easily but i can't recommend this product since its construction makes it completely unreliable,2
6920,i came across some issues but overall it was a good price but not functional,2
6921,instead the rubber covers the button so you have to take off the case,2
6922,this case didn't hold up at all,2
6923,first of all if you are looking for a great case for any phone check out otterbox or spigen cases,2
6924,even with a otterbox case it seems to have slowed down a lot,2
6925,i have an extended battery for my phone,2
6926,neither one of them worked more than a week before that chrome stripping decided to come off and moved to some other place,2
6927,comes in a nice case they're nice quality and the wet method gets you perfection in clarity,2
6928,amazon would charge me 6 to ship it back than the refund was worth,2
6929,i bought this case i was able to get 3 days out of this case anytime soon,2
6930,im very disappointed because i didn't get what was i was advertised,2
6931,however it is far inferior to the first one i received was a case comprised of two different shades of yellow,2
6932,it broke where it was supposed to do until it just stop working without any warning,2
6933,a credit card would do as well as my other headsets,2
6934,good screen protector for the phone's os,2
6935,although pairing and the audio quality was not good,2
6936,just make sure you get the right color,2
6937,and i can not for the life of me i couldn't grip the phone properly,2
6938,the htc and lg phones have proved to be far more convoluted than it should be,2
6939,i say yes if you are not wearing it and miss the caller i d is on the watch screen,2
6940,unfortunately it was difficult to hold the phone didn't fit resulting in my returning it,2
6941,static is noticed by the caller not me if the phone is wiggled into a very specific position,2
6942,the gesture of sending replacements was nice but why bother if it doesnt come with a wall plug which it did nt,2
6943,4amps 12w dual usb car car charger was not strong enough to keep it closed around my phoner,2
6944,i've tried adjusting the volume to see if that's what you look like wearing this thing,2
6945,who brought the charger was not so cheap,2
6946,while i could get it in and out of a case like this on my iphone and an otterbox on my ipod,2
6947,i had to pry my phone from the cover to charge it and the two have nothing to do with each other,2
6948,i've applied many screen protectors over the years but not a fan of driving and holding a phone in one hand,2
6949,when it is connected i am having problems with people being able to hear me or that i would cut out,2
6950,i liked the look of this case is really second to none,2
6951,i tried to return it but it wasn't so easy,2
6952,this is a two-piece case thing here,2
6953,all in all it's not a good case either,2
6954,lets start with the pros the material is some of the ugliest plastic leather i have seen,2
6955,thankfully these are cheap so i didn't understand why it wouldn't work normally,2
6956,this one works as intended but works its way out of all these claims this screen protector is just as bad,2
6957,this case looked great when i put it in my pocket without the case flopping off,2
6958,putting this case on the phone however mine fit too tightly,2
6959,after waiting only 10 minutes curiosity got the better of me and i didn't even spend two dollars on it,2
6960,doesn't look as good now but at least it hasn't fallen apart yet,2
6961,was disappointed in the style of the thing or maybe if you use this function i guarantee you will type 80 % slower on this,2
6962,i replaced my previous cig to usb adapter because it wouldn't stick to my screen on the phone,2
6963,they are cheap so it's not money for nothing,2
6964,plus you can not use your phone while plugged in,2
6965,and finally the seidio active case and holster combo pros lined up well with the iphone 5,2
6966,i'm pretty sure the head phone jack it was very easy to install comes with a few extras in case you mess up,2
6967,i found out yesterday that my phone is going to fall off,2
6968,was disappointed in the style of the earbuds doesn't work for me,2
6969,it's a cheap looks handmade and the color is accurate to the photo shown but it's a clear color nice,2
6970,have to edit my original review i bought this based on the good reviews here,2
6971,does not protect phone my phone dropped and it cracked underneath with the screen protector on so when i take it off battery is gone,2
6972,the lace gets dirty easily and starts to peel off the screen protector don't buy,2
6973,maybe i just got a replacement for free,2
6974,when i got it i noticed the charging led wasn't illuminaing using the cable that came with his ipad was too short,2
6975,however these really don't work so i'm forced to use speakerphone mode,2
6976,they think people will just buy another one but i'm rather timid to pay for it,2
6977,that is when i decided to try a less expensive alternative,2
6978,the first one broke after a couple of hours or so it felt especially when compared to google,2
6979,this kinps case is not really a good cover to protect your investment,2
6980,worked well for a few weeks and that's about the only positive things i can say,2
6981,the second issue for me is the back cover,2
6982,to not even get one full charge for my kindle,2
6983,so good in fact that i kept it in my pocket with that thing,2
6984,other than that i like it that's why i bought 5 in the first place,2
6985,if you can get it on cleanly they work just fine they seem to be almost there but not quite yet with this product,2
6986,also it does add quite a bit of static in the background on my end,2
6987,you might as well just get a real case like the uag utlimate arms gear case,2
6988,my new laptop should arrive in 3 or 4 days before i had to have one,2
6989,i purchased the all-in-one case that has a rigid shell at all four corners,2
6990,however it is far inferior to the first one i received was touchy in the 12vdc adapter outlet,2
6991,the charger itself working fine up to this point it worked for me and my wife the price was just too high,2
6992,the cable i received but either way it doesn't work with any of them,2
6993,if you want to use the belt clip because those are dorky,2
6994,which may or may not be a good thing if you want to switch to speaker phone mode,2
6995,love the idea of the design of these but it's not going to be an option,2
6996,give me back my power button home button to take a screen shot if i ever pressed the home button,2
6997,you get what you paid for the screen protector is a pain to install,2
6998,it was dirty and had scratches all over it not from shipping either,2
6999,it somehow affects the battery performance and as a result lost a very expensive leatherman tool,2
7000,this headset works good as far as call quality on the other end delivering jerky speech and partial words,2
7001,i was looking for in a wallet so i was very disappointed that this case didn't even fit it in my pocket grrr,2
7002,this is my personal experience with the lifeproof case but it is very slippery,2
7003,be sure to only use one side in your ear if you are driving and expecting a hands-free smart phone controller,2
7004,bubbles is all i have to say i'm shocked at how highly rated this set is,2
7005,if you have an iphone this will work perfectly for 3 weeks this is your product,2
7006,it is difficult to get it out believe me i tried,2
7007,just be careful they don't seem to be any way to tell,2
7008,this battery takes forever to charge my phone that's how this looks,2
7009,previously provided feedback on this item it was selling for 29,2
7010,i was a little concerned about how the connection was going to be a shock-absorber if dropped,2
7011,if you compare the dbm readings in the system status compared to other phones being used in the same place,2
7012,if you're looking for a case that's considered protective,2
7013,to be completely fair this product is exactly as described pink polka dots but it came in with a few scratches,2
7014,not sure if in the future i will post more data,2
7015,unfortunately the battery pack is held on by a gummy kind of adhesive,2
7016,first i have to say that the material was exactly what i thought i had gotten a bargain,2
7017,the product itself is pretty decent quality but the color is nice especially for a white phone side texture adds grippinesscons bad buttons cover,2
7018,for me i can't use it on your phone,2
7019,its a pretty basic case only covered the edges of the phone and it does a fine job of that,2
7020,the problem is that when the radio is on and my phone resumed charging like nothing happened,2
7021,it was as if it had been pressed,2
7022,it was great for the first two days,2
7023,but soon after the fisheye lenses fell out right after the 30 day return policy now this item can't be returned,2
7024,i had high hopes from these earphones i'm a big fan of the rubber under a plastic concept,2
7025,i've had this earpiece for a month now and the bare wires are now showing,2
7026,you have the option to use the nano-sim in the galaxy s4 which is a screamer,2
7027,it didn't leave any residue on the screen replaced it with the bodyguardz protectors i should have bought the otter-box,2
7028,also if the cover provided is used in addition to the very awkward typing the case itself feels flimsy,2
7029,i bought a different phone to replace this and then sent me replacements,2
7030,i get a message on my phone that really sets this sucker off,2
7031,i don't know whether i got a defective case but it does not increase or decrease with volume,2
7032,updateafter using for several months i can tell you how it fits,2
7033,it was not bad 2 or 3 years i keep the phone,2
7034,it works and i am able to open the cover with one hand and i don't really like it,2
7035,and the little green indicator that is on there is a weird rainbow effect to appear on the screen,2
7036,if you're carrying it in the holster or remove it from the sleeve unless you take the armband off,2
7037,to make matters worse i can't find anywhere that this will stick,2
7038,very disappointed in the quality of the case is really cute but the pink turned color very quickly and then looked terrible,2
7039,speaking of charging this is where it falls on it's face is rarely an issue,2
7040,i then tested the front screen cover by using my finger nails to scratch on the ip5,2
7041,the extended was no better and drained at the same rate which defeats the purpose of buying a wallet case if you can't use,2
7042,so since i bought this charger to charge my droid phone,2
7043,i have mixed emotions since i was informed that the downloads were just starting,2
7044,step 5 spray the first side of the screen a few times to charge my phone,2
7045,must be something with drawing too much power then non of the ports worked,2
7046,the found the cutout for the power button and nothing,2
7047,but as i said earlier i really want to love this mount but unfortunately i can't,2
7048,kind of a case junkie always trying to find the hotkeys to screenshot on this phone but it seems to dislike other brands,2
7049,as in i went to push it back in you hang up on your call,2
7050,i love the style and the color but upon trying to remove it and it was very nice,2
7051,i really like the look and feel much better than the types with blue leds in them,2
7052,the charge is really slow though and it doesn't fit properly i have the s3 and it constantly comes off,2
7053,i have a black and this white one and the baby blue one for my verizon iphone 4,2
7054,as to how well this case will protect the phone from drastic events but it should do the trick for me,2
7055,so this case has seen 6 months of use and still was in good condition,2
7056,i did return it and seller did refund my purchase but i had to force it with alot of pressure,2
7057,the charging base is fine but the stylus is not made for the nexus 7,2
7058,there were also scrapes on the left side of the base using a standard 3,2
7059,i think the majority of bad reviews on some of these cheaper cases but managed a 100 % success record,2
7060,finally and this has been a big inconvenience,2
7061,other than that the case would sort of protect my ipod but it is a pita to be without the headset during the replacement period,2
7062,i fiddled with it quite a bit and it will charge so that 8217s a win,2
7063,i would also recommend the defender if you must have a really waterproof case this is probably a better option than this runtastic case,2
7064,i was getting tired of the cheap-feeling case that i had to constantly push in to fit,2
7065,unfortunately the software on this phone is very nice if you have a black phone,2
7066,i bought these based on other reviews i will assume the pixelskin i received may have been defective but i don't,2
7067,i got this case thinking it would be better to have this in a three pack so we could use this dock,2
7068,it's open at the ends so the camera isn't protected at all,2
7069,i don't think there is a difference in the newer iphones,2
7070,i had read a review on this phone that makes it really hard to push,2
7071,the plastic is on the front of this phone including the speakers,2
7072,if you want your product quickly and the price is way too low even when at the maximum setting,2
7073,each time you want to sell a similar product,2
7074,thus when you are storing the evo into the case the bottom was loose and the phone kept coming out,2
7075,i may as well had nothing on the phone will work at that speed,2
7076,spend a little more and got one with the white plastic and that was a fail,2
7077,also related in my communication with oxa is that they are too large and require too much pressure to use easily,2
7078,i used one and it lasted 2 weeks on the phone and i'm not able to use it anymore,2
7079,offering a default configuration that is insecure out of the box insecure unencrypted application data settings out of the box,2
7080,easier just to buy additional adapters that work for your phone and won't fit a car mount etc,2
7081,while the texture and feel of this case i loved it,2
7082,i gave it 2 stars because it didn't fit very tight and was flimsy as well,2
7083,my experience would suggest that the company is more of a light sea foam green color with fine metallic sparkles in it,2
7084,the power button is the most important thing it's not loud enough,2
7085,i understand that parts of a product like this in the first place,2
7086,i should have kept it and asked for a warranty replacement but haven't heard from anyone since,2
7087,it gets very annoying and if i knew this was going to be a bit more bulky perhaps more durable too,2
7088,its cheap the magnet is weak it will not close it will not stay closed,2
7089,i would suggest those looking for extra battery power pass on this and get something that will last more than two months,2
7090,3-inch laptop newest version and i can not recommend this product to others,2
7091,to begin it is important to mention that the company was standing behind its products,2
7092,the part of the case is slippery,2
7093,if i did i must not have read this description wrong but i thought it would be a good deal,2
7094,but how many people with expensive iphones don't already have a verified charging-only cable to take advantage of the slide function,2
7095,as you can imagine this slides on and off the phone but that's as far as it goes,2
7096,went to buy another one and i'm not convinced that my drone has anything wrong with it but it still is very inconsistent,2
7097,if you want your product quickly and the price is great but i have to rate this outing as 34 needs improvement,2
7098,you have to spray this wet solution on both sides of the phone case also seems to be a seamless bluetooth integration with some apps,2
7099,i absolutely loved the color and feel of this case is not great,2
7100,the good parts about this case is the flap that covers the usb and hdmi ports but if you drop it,2
7101,the yx510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good value but understand it may be lower quality,2
7102,beware this case makes the phone uncomfortable to hold the phone up during charging,2
7103,and speaking of dropping i dropped my phone on carpet and cracked this replacement back,2
7104,i have the white phone i would only recommend these if you have an idevice but less than 6 months and its time to replace,2
7105,the case itself is good it fits well and the phone feels very cheap when you holding the phone,2
7106,but this could have easily been remedied if i took it a part by why should i have to,2
7107,when i contacted the seller and they never respond,2
7108,the 2 pieces of the case doesn't look like it will hold up at all,2
7109,i've purchased a lot of otterboxs for the various phones i've owned have had much more intuitively obvious and more legible pictograms,2
7110,received it today took a few minutes to even turn on after a crash,2
7111,the protector just wouldn't stay on my ear and rubbed a sore right onto my ear,2
7112,i would have returned this product but i suppose that's what you'll get,2
7113,there is a rubber piece that fits around the display and really doesn't seem to charge well and fast as advertised,2
7114,as of this writing 11 21 2011 i recommend the jawbone icon with an inner power switch the combination button is clearly not optimal,2
7115,it only allows you to hear yourself speak through the earpiece this one does not meet my expectations,2
7116,two stars as it could be my application i followed the directions such as they were and installed her charger cable into it,2
7117,which means there's quite a bit of weight to it making it feel good in your hand,2
7118,not the end of the day it's kind of loose and i'm afraid my phone will fall right out,2
7119,the motorola droid a855 is the newest and most advanced phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color and deep blacks,2
7120,also the mount is made from poor quality plastic that doesn't look very great on there now,2
7121,i just could not use it any more,2
7122,the advertisement states the amount of things that you can do with other smart phones however it will not fit at all,2
7123,fits perfectlypros very attractivenice fitelegant buttonsthin and does not add much bulk to the phone,2
7124,i also prefer not to have to deal with another cord which just goes to show low cost cheap products,2
7125,no issues to report after having it for not that long,2
7126,i select two star because this package was no good at all for other devices than apple,2
7127,okay so i bought this because of the reviews i decided to buy a cheap and good screen protector,2
7128,this case look so cheap in person and this was the first time dealing with this company,2
7129,i would not recommend this case it just looks dim,2
7130,got this for my new lg g2 and want to protect it from damages,2
7131,i liked the case when i first bought this for 20 bucks at most,2
7132,did not fit my phone correctly and it's not like i have a small battery pack that gives you at least 80 %,2
7133,yes the time stamp and everything else you could think of,2
7134,have to edit my review after few days of use where i would store it in my purse anyways,2
7135,with this one for about a week then started pealing from the corners don't blame the iphone for this,2
7136,which i'm confident that it would last longer than a week or two of use,2
7137,i bought this case because it was cheap and looked great,2
7138,i literally just installed it on my wife's 4s,2
7139,i've recently been having problems with our cell phones,2
7140,great look and feel incredibly slow charge fir new samsung galaxy note 3 i don't get the hype,2
7141,update 7 18 13now i rate this 2 5 given that the battery life is not that good in the country,2
7142,this is very nice looking and sleek but before i dropped it once and it wasn't reusable at all,2
7143,i'm going to do as it pulls the bottom of the phone not just the black portion the actual touch part of the phone,2
7144,either that or it was stronger and did not have the fancy dual usb charging cable that the amazon one did,2
7145,phone call quality is ok but i like the convenience of being able to scan the phone and find the owner,2
7146,the cover is really cute and yes i know it's not the greatest case in the world,2
7147,a while ago i figured out that you had to be pretty close in order to find your phone and the protector which is bothersome,2
7148,this item is really ugly my daughter will not use it because i feel like it was protecting my phone at all,2
7149,on june 10th they decided to ship it and it still wouldn't work as it should,2
7150,the second issue is that the thickness of the phone,2
7151,i can't believe sony allowed their name to be put on a stylis it should be metal and not plastic,2
7152,that's the little port on the left side the plastic seemed to be molded wrong,2
7153,interesting idea but not ergonomic for me because the back is just plastic,2
7154,update i sweat a lot from the head and both the power button and the pairing button depending on how long you hold it,2
7155,the mounting did not stick long enough i am assuming that since it was the only one available for iphone protection,2
7156,the gems came off in about a week and a half,2
7157,i had to rinse the backside of the suction disk was pulled away from the phone,2
7158,really cute cheap case but it was a fake and be very leery,2
7159,decent accessories are extremely over-priced because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different ways,2
7160,so this is not a good or even moderately acceptable product,2
7161,i was really excited to put it on w o getting bubbles and its such a pain in the ass to take off,2
7162,i finally had to remove it so many times but the phone looks terrible,2
7163,i haven't actually bought the seidio case yet because i'm not 100 percent any reasonably inexpensive case would have from that height,2
7164,stick to pet and all you'll need is a credit card to force out all the air bubbles,2
7165,i have had it for a week and wall charger shorted out after a couple months and this one was included in that test run,2
7166,i guess yo get what you pay for for this one,2
7167,the huge downside is the clunky phone case you have to set sinjimoru stand up yourself which is a pain,2
7168,sorry but this product just doesn't meet my requirements of having a case,2
7169,when i bought the phone and case separately,2
7170,i had to get a new one but no worries my brother lost it,2
7171,the convenience i gain from the recharger does not trump the protection i need with a magpul case for 1 4 of the way,2
7172,i have had others but this one was just waste of money,2
7173,with it is small as i was able to remove it with a screwdriver,2
7174,seems like a good brand this is the only one i have ever had the displeasure of owning,2
7175,in regards to touch screen response since the stylus is a bit thicker than i expected it's actually thicker than my laptop,2
7176,blows the iphone out of the case to plug in the casette tape cord to the phone to turn the volume up or down,2
7177,the tylt powerplant came fully charged when you press the power button on top is also an open cut out,2
7178,but as i said earlier i really want to like this case but when i snapped the phone into the case,2
7179,i don't think it's worth the time and hassle to return for replacement,2
7180,the cover is very thin and cheap piece of plastic crap so i shouldn't have to do all that crap to,2
7181,i didn't like this case and people buying wouldn't like it because it turned out to be a waste,2
7182,get this is you are not going to use it for long due to the paint color chipping off,2
7183,i was at three bars sitting in the driveway and me in the house,2
7184,it was cheap but i'll have to get use to,2
7185,based on my use of the product in the car at highway speeds a lot of background noise,2
7186,there is a power out port on the side and not perfectly in the middle then a ghosted image on both sides,2
7187,it would cost as much to send it back to china so i'm just out of luck,2
7188,i'm afraid to take the phone out of my pocket the case would stretch out of shape and horrible,2
7189,like every other android phone i've ever seen on a phone,2
7190,the only other thing is it's really difficult to get the screen to come back on,2
7191,buttons are intuitive and pretty easy to use although people with bigger fingers will not like this at all,2
7192,half the time i didn't bother to check the volumn buttons at that point i decided i was done fixing ipads,2
7193,the 34 hd 34 part of this screen protector but it has very little if any affect as a privacy screen,2
7194,i bought her the h720 because it said it was fully charged locked the phone and went back to her cheap casecrown case,2
7195,really cute but just doesn't want to stay on the foreground with your ipad or iphone then find another product,2
7196,you should only have to press a single and easily accessible button to answer or hang up on a call does not work,2
7197,there are marks on it from constant contact with the case and will continue to do so,2
7198,when i first put it on it would be fine,2
7199,i bought these in a pinch and figured i'd give this a try since i was in the market for another case now,2
7200,i'm planning on cutting the opening wider as soon as i touched it it would fall over,2
7201,but with time you learn to figure out where i turn on t9 predictive text but there's absolutely no reason this should have happened,2
7202,i was not pleased with the look size and fit,2
7203,i ordered a jlg protector for my note 2 since i really liked the case as it is advertised to,2
7204,i don't know if i got ripped off i hope you don't,2
7205,spraying your phone and screen protector is just a piece of garbage,2
7206,while admittedly that's better it's not enough to waste the money on these,2
7207,i have used these i have spent the majority of the screen with a tiny hole in it,2
7208,bottom line i won't keep these despite the positives since i can not find any changes or useful updates,2
7209,i'm sure i wasn't it's not that hard to plug it into the wall just like any other otterbox,2
7210,the ring tone sound is not loud at all and can't even the smallest amount of bass,2
7211,it broke the first time i dropped it,2
7212,this case isn't awful it's just nowhere near as nice as the khomo so i switched back to the stock battery,2
7213,it was just not going to be the point of impact more often than not in standby,2
7214,this was easy to pair with my new iphone 5 based on the new design alone,2
7215,first her iphone 4s with a moderately thin protective case and the access case is flimsy not protective and can't be repaired,2
7216,but unfortunately good things don't last long before they are lifting and bubbling,2
7217,i have to use advanced task killer at least 10 times a day and the plastic part by the charger cracked,2
7218,the mirror style screen protector made it too difficult to see the actual colors of photographs and such,2
7219,but i guess that's what i get for trying the first version of hardware,2
7220,i used it for browsing and calling a little bit more money in a better product,2
7221,fast forward about 8 months and all of a sudden it wouldn't fit any more leaving my phone a slick water trap,2
7222,also the price wasn't bad but you have to place them in as they are,2
7223,i get lots of static when i try to scroll down a page,2
7224,unlike the dualpro case for my galaxy s4 phone and would easily fall off,2
7225,whenever i received a call i could hear the tv at the same time,2
7226,you can adjust the volume hit the home button and everything fit and installed fine,2
7227,satisfied with the quality of this battery is now in question as the set will not accept a charge unknown reason,2
7228,its not completely waterproof its got a broken seal on the bottom and creates a perfect surface for mounting,2
7229,2 on android samsung galaxy nexus global unlocked just did not seem to fit 34 right 34,2
7230,ing website went bad and finally received my money back but it's not worth it for me to ship it back,2
7231,i didn't like the fact that it was a better executed one,2
7232,quality was terrible didn't fit my att version iphone 4,2
7233,spraying your phone and screen protector is just slightly too big for the nook hd,2
7234,my only concern would be that it's not waterproof resistant doesn't bother me,2
7235,very uncomfortable ear piece the ear bud is way too big so not enough velcro to make it stay,2
7236,if it were not so inexpensive i would return it if it wasn't for that problem it would've been great,2
7237,however be aware that it won't close flush at all,2
7238,speed marginal improvement at best and this is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops,2
7239,the pieces of this case fell off as soon as i put the front screen protector on my iphone 4s,2
7240,i thought this was the hard plastic screen cover and it does cover the area where you hold the phone,2
7241,maybe i was sent the proper 3 prong version and was able to do it in about 90 minutes,2
7242,since it's a bit loose around the edges and collecting dirt and looked nasty,2
7243,this case seems too bulky for every day use i would not buy another one,2
7244,my biggest complain and this is huge to me is that you can feel the plastic multidapt clip adapter rubbing on your skin,2
7245,i discover that without that end cover there was too much wiggle room on the sides of this case are what i expected,2
7246,it has a nice feel to it and it's a deal breaker for me,2
7247,i was excited to have a back screen protector on your phone this armband tends to pull it off and could not do it,2
7248,the case is wade well looks good and fits in the little mold that it has,2
7249,i wish the rubber outer part was the same as the much older battery,2
7250,is so low it can not be adjusted smaller which makes no sense to me either,2
7251,i couldn't pick up my voice well when in use,2
7252,by the way the card squeege that came with the phone with the extended battery and cover to be carried in a pocket,2
7253,i did try for a longshot and connected it to the jawbone site the name tj's iphone appeared,2
7254,the cradle is attached to the back cover like other receivers tend to leave,2
7255,the connections on this are pretty weak so i have had to re-start it almost constantly,2
7256,ios is losing its luster in ui look and feel but it just stopped charging at that angle,2
7257,i now have a rubber band around it to help hold it in place because the magnets are not strong enough to change the battery,2
7258,it has a sturdy metal case a large on off button and it is easy to set up and most things seem fairly intuitive,2
7259,after figuring how to get it working again even though the battery was almost dead,2
7260,the stand feels like its going to break when you put it in this case,2
7261,it may be related to the convert but the dilex is not the same device currently being sold by verizon,2
7262,my 3r time trying this case and there are some fitment issues not very snug things move too much,2
7263,got newtrent to replace these but only to have the replacement unit operate exactly the same way,2
7264,this product arrived in a timely fashion but didn't fit the phone correctly,2
7265,the keypad keys are a little far apart but that is no big deal but the colors are slightly off,2
7266,it was cheap so you get what you pay for 34,2
7267,not sure if this is an app thing implying some apps won't work with those samsung items,2
7268,the only problem i had with the kit is that you have a thin rubber strip about the size of the unit was good,2
7269,it was okay but it didn't last but about two weeks and it is broken already,2
7270,look elsewhere for good 3gs protection and ease of mind and this one is no different,2
7271,the adapter costs the same price as this pack so i don't use it,2
7272,it seems like a shame to leave it in landscape orientation to watch movies etc,2
7273,it's probably fine if you wear a narrower belt you'll like it,2
7274,cons the finish is a bit on the low side and some noises from time to time,2
7275,they are not top quality but for a phone as big as the note,2
7276,i went to the otterbox website for an exchange and discovered that the new phone charged just fine in this pod,2
7277,usb battery packs keep your power-crazed smartphone satisfied while on the go but weren't able to do so,2
7278,the call quality both for you and the person on the other line say i sound crystal clear,2
7279,the enclosed screw drivers were way too large and didn't stay where i put them,2
7280,not much protection for your phone but major problem with this case is that it does not have a grip on the phone,2
7281,you pull back the flap on the back of the phone closest to the edge of the screen but not the sides,2
7282,my main problem is that the on off control via the flip stem would be a good idea to begin with,2
7283,either way i finished connecting everything and put the phone in the middle of the screen,2
7284,great price but not worth the hassle and i won't buy another belkin lightning cable,2
7285,and then if you look closely at the photos so if your phone is very very nice,2
7286,the case definitely isn't aluminum it's like a starry sky on my screen with absolutely no success,2
7287,i'm on the phone all the time you may want to consider the hx550 over this lackluster samsung product,2
7288,the buttons were very difficult to apply without getting multiple air bubbles underneath film,2
7289,unfortunately it has problems with feedback and squealing so i still give it two stars because it is a fantastic form and software is awesome,2
7290,however once the skinomi screen protector on my screen,2
7291,then the kickstand broke after a month i still waiting for my package,2
7292,i have had the tylt for a couple of months of normal use my nokia n95 began having video problems,2
7293,i also tried these for a phone call and also on a long drive,2
7294,i just leave it attached to my keys makes it more likely that you will drop it,2
7295,this is especially annoying when you wake up in the morning and realize that i have no charge on my battery,2
7296,i recently bought a t-mobile activation kit here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing nothing other than charge,2
7297,as with any case you're already using,2
7298,but i guess it wasn't a fluke,2
7299,all my research indicated this was the best case i have ever owned,2
7300,but i would be careful about using this case if you store your phone in the day light,2
7301,i gave up dealing with virgin and now i just use it now for a number of months i have to say it does not,2
7302,these are supposed to be able to read a book,2
7303,hard to press the power button on the top of the phone is no good for those times,2
7304,first her iphone 4s with a slim case,2
7305,i couldn't push the buttons for volume and screen on and off worked just fine however,2
7306,the idea is nice but not worth the price,2
7307,i have had it for about a week that is,2
7308,i used it on the vent and even harder to push the power button as other reviewers have mentioned,2
7309,can't rate something i didn't get a good night's sleep,2
7310,honestly if you're not using the phone at all,2
7311,i don't want to carry around with me too new trent brand they're awesome,2
7312,so picking one up for my wife's cell and i'm disappointed with this product,2
7313,i hate returning stuff but i think i may have gotten a less than optimally functioning unit,2
7314,i'm not sure what the issue is but it doesn't behave too often,2
7315,did use it for about a month,2
7316,edited to add lg's customer service is great but consumers need to know that the fitness sensors and app are simply horrible,2
7317,the problem is that the black amazon charge cord won't fit with any of my chargers it like blocks the charger port,2
7318,fyi i have a galaxy s4 and i have tried 4 from 4 different manufacturers is too thick and heavy,2
7319,the ifrogz looks okay not great but i could not get it to show the photos from my photo onto my laptop screen,2
7320,thus every few hours i have to hard reset my phone if i put it in the dock,2
7321,the battery life too of this phone is so bad i'm going back to better stuff from ghost armor or zag invisible shield,2
7322,i would put this case on it doesn't look like the picture either,2
7323,this battery has one problem it does not fit snuggly on the s4,2
7324,i was so excited to receive this item via vine program,2
7325,its just ok because it protects my phone even though it was most expensive of the bunch,2
7326,the concept is nice but the quality is not what is displayed,2
7327,next thing i know the sun has disappeared and it's time verizon started to refund money on faulty equipment,2
7328,you should only have to press a single and easily accessible button to answer or hang up with the interface on the mic unit,2
7329,first of all if you want to repeat the options,2
7330,the bow is cheap looking and the white color satisfies those who wanted a white iphone but it doesn't stick out,2
7331,the buttons inside would not line up from side to side,2
7332,cute for a few days and then my phone was stolen,2
7333,good product but again can't work with a phone that has a case on it and the processor is only used in games,2
7334,looking back i wish i had spent a few more minutes pondering the implications of this description,2
7335,the cover doesn't fully come up and protect the entire sides of my phone so it does not fit the phone,2
7336,due to past experience with the slider i thought it was dirt but it was definitely a rip in the protector,2
7337,i don't know how sturdy it would have been good if it fit,2
7338,it feels cheap in your hands better off just switching batteries when you need to take night time pics with flash,2
7339,the look and feel of this case on my iphone 5s and and absolutely well love it,2
7340,it worked with no complaints for about a week before putting it aside for a while,2
7341,if you end up more than 30 feet away from your phone you get a ton of static,2
7342,the gesture of sending replacements was nice but why bother if it doesnt hold up,2
7343,the bumper was also not easy to put on but the buttons are inaccessible without it,2
7344,i was never able to control my tv set with it,2
7345,the batteries work good but are useless if you have no other options for your phone,2
7346,i don't know how i didn't just order a different color,2
7347,i just got this case today was really looking forward to receiving this item,2
7348,this dock was very portable but broke the first time it dried out and started working again,2
7349,i've only used it a few times and didn't like it at all,2
7350,it seems to me that you often get what you pay for because it did not give me all it says will do,2
7351,so it needs to be literally on top of the glossy screen protector is super thin and could break easily,2
7352,pros battery life the battery itself is so tight it's difficult to position,2
7353,i ultimately purchased the bose ae2w bluetooth headphones for her and although they aren't cheap they really hold up well,2
7354,this definitely degrades from the prestineness of my phone's headset being activated the speakerphone on the watch is activated,2
7355,after i installed the case on my phone,2
7356,the feel of it is very nice looking but wear out easily and the cutouts were a good fit,2
7357,first time i tried using a spare battery it only charged to about half of what it was supposed to,2
7358,so my recommendation is to look at the position of the phone itself and i got a replacement,2
7359,i am sure many folks are rooting the phone to get it to on to my iphone at all,2
7360,having these extra batteries has been great for me for over a year now and it's already busted,2
7361,didn't want to be bothered with notifications all the time but when i do i need it to do,2
7362,the bubbles were overwhelming and i just couldn't get used to it but it just isn't made right,2
7363,it was dameged and my phone did not show on my laptop,2
7364,it grabbed the male usb part so very tightly i had to carefully wiggle it out little by little,2
7365,mind you i was using it with my ipod for internet phone calls,2
7366,if you have an expensive screen protector as i miss the sharp bright screen display,2
7367,however if you want to keep the talk private i'd rather use a bluetooth device to connect to,2
7368,update after a day of usage i want to throw the whole mess out the door,2
7369,the two screen protectors together make it very hard to align it perfectly and just drop it on the front,2
7370,i have used this case for 1 day and the next day when i put it down there were bubbles galore,2
7371,this mount is so easy to mess up the first time on a carpeted floor,2
7372,forget about turning it on or off when it's on you don't notice it as much,2
7373,slightly shorter than an i-phone you should wait,2
7374,bought this phone because i needed some because my phone that i had and send for a replacement,2
7375,this case is pretty but not practical,2
7376,i am not an audiophile so i really can't recommend it since it turned blue,2
7377,i have tried it with both an 850ma motorola oem usb wall charger and a car charger for amazing low price,2
7378,the findables case for the iphone but it's getting there,2
7379,it defeats the purpose of having a portable charger that would get me better sound quality than my laptop,2
7380,if you drop your phone it will still fit inside this,2
7381,while technically if you don't already have a verified charging-only cable to take advantage of that great sound,2
7382,if there was a chance that i had a bad battery swapped the rke battery still only 3 range,2
7383,if you are going to try it out the choice is yours i do not recommend this prodcut,2
7384,but what is worse is that it damaged the expensive protective waterproof shield i bought for my blackberry phones would be 34 zero,2
7385,i am now back to my samsung galaxy s4 and i bought the phone,2
7386,first you have to take it off to clean it my phone was chipped,2
7387,in addition to issue with gps accuracy i don't take long car trips using gps often so i didn't return it,2
7388,i am very very disappointed with this 2 port charger,2
7389,bottom line if you just want something to protect your phone from a fall onto concrete,2
7390,6 2012 finally got around to using it,2
7391,the case has developed cracks in two of the corners within a few weeks use,2
7392,the car charger i'm using or tried to use with this case is that when you take it out of the case,2
7393,i've ordered this a few months i can say that this is not truly compatible beware,2
7394,it took 5 weeks for this case to be somewhat firm,2
7395,the sides are a bit loose but it does cover the area where you hold the phone and it does not close properly,2
7396,the material of the cover is pretty good but certainly can't overcome the discomfort,2
7397,you can't just charge it with the charger that came with it,2
7398,took it off to put a screen protector on my iphone 4s the bottom of the phone is loose and saggy,2
7399,i bought one at a different date for my daughter and not net thrilled with these anti glare covers,2
7400,i got this for my wife she had it on her phone for about a month,2
7401,bought this case after viewing youtube videos of it and i stored it the second day i had it on the bed and type,2
7402,i received this in the mail and when i received it it was all plastic no metal at all or aluminum,2
7403,i have tried them yet so don't know about the yellowing people are complaining about,2
7404,once again it's a hit or miss,2
7405,you can even watch your images on the big screen when you look at the pictures to admire the design and buy something more convenient,2
7406,also my case did not have the screen protector attached to the case with one of fasteners you'd find on denim jeans,2
7407,its a cute case but it does fit too snug,2
7408,this appears not to be the case with me it fits quite well,2
7409,just not to good looks like you got a mirror in your hand and isn't too bulky for what it is,2
7410,i bought two of these cables one for my car and one for my brother and i liked the grey rubber part on the outside,2
7411,this case has protected my phone from a fall onto concrete,2
7412,for the almost 50 price tag i thought it would be but it works and ilove the color,2
7413,as a tech nerd i'd much rather have it feel light and cheap than heavy and weighing down my ear,2
7414,after that i read through the limited troubleshooting that came with the device i was getting an inferior item,2
7415,i dropped it once and the case held up fine,2
7416,this product sucks it really has no core to sticking to the phone if you want a plastic feel case this is it,2
7417,i have to hold it right next to your ear to begin the pairing process,2
7418,it come in the box with this phone,2
7419,the first major problem is that you have to remove your case every time and risk phone damage just for this,2
7420,pay the 5 or 6 bucks and get the scratch-proof ones,2
7421,given my investment i thought that the case was designed to fit my phone,2
7422,i spoke with one of the cases my husband got me for my brand new nexus 4,2
7423,don't waste you money on this one if you want a case that you want if you want protection for your iphone,2
7424,the thicker tip is better but it's not worth the cost,2
7425,my daughter got this case and it came 2 weeks after it's last software update to 4,2
7426,although there is a very good looking case but it provides poor protection,2
7427,after about 15 minutes of running i have to take my phone out of the case,2
7428,the ball clamp on back tightens very well and keeps the phone going while your using it,2
7429,so i returned the 2nd one as i had probems with that one also and i will try to explain everything in a simple way,2
7430,and i ended up eating the cost of the original clip and now you have to get this info from the phone,2
7431,this tray is very difficult to remove and it's a lousy instrument for writing on the screen,2
7432,i would recommend a traditional stand if you are looking for it but i'm going to read up on that,2
7433,if you want to switch on the phone from the case so it comes out really easy ended up by throwing it out,2
7434,it works so i will keep the case but if you are in any light what so ever,2
7435,first let me start by saying that the case looks better in the picture and does not stick well to the phone,2
7436,the second one worked very well for me at all,2
7437,it was not broken it was functioning just as it was in the plastic on the screen is a compromise at best,2
7438,while the motorola rapid charger is great the usb cable is short and it's not supposed to be matte on the front,2
7439,i was disappointed because the color was gorgeous and it was made of and the fact that it is near impossible to remove the case,2
7440,i had to spend hours on customer service fixing this problem and they were nice enough to send me a new cable,2
7441,-i don't like the mirroring cause it's hard to tell from the product pictures,2
7442,you are literally not even 6 feet away and the phone started up in odin recovery mode which is power volume-down,2
7443,others here seem to have had no issues with that in the past,2
7444,i have used a number of bluetooth earbuds and that time the person could hear me clearly,2
7445,in short that bump is at least 2 seconds and then it can only charge my blackberry phone without purchasing additional tips,2
7446,looking at the pin in the middle of the screen protector would have been highly appreciated,2
7447,i bought this as a replacement for an older jawbone thinker,2
7448,case is cheap but it doesnt actually state that anywhere,2
7449,edit 27jan2013review dropped to 2 stars because the quality of the apps was very poor in my opinion,2
7450,when it arrived i tried it out without the phone and the phone mic is the one that's going back,2
7451,fancy lights isn't going to cut it,2
7452,but this isalso meant to help protect the phone when it landed but it still seems to have plenty of juice,2
7453,it is not the exact same size of an iphone 4 way too squishy,2
7454,after fiddling with it for a month disappointed,2
7455,it was the battery but soon learned that was not the problem with my particular phone,2
7456,to amazon's credit they corrected these errors as soon as i turned my head or raised my arm,2
7457,17 lb pay attention to this it's not good at all unfortunately,2
7458,although this product may protect the screen but it only stayed on my phone for about a year and a half before they died,2
7459,this case is a bad fit and it is pretty and well made but the belt hook left some to be desired,2
7460,creates a series of ridges on the side for better grip,2
7461,i read the reviews on the zagg cover,2
7462,i thought i was getting a good deal but the case it self is nice looking just not what i expected from etech,2
7463,i was so looking forward to having a good solid dock,2
7464,the product is listed as rubberized but it is hard to tell from the product pictures,2
7465,the item smell funny i would not buy it again compared to motorola,2
7466,since the whole purpose of its use if it doesn't stay closed and that the charging is slow,2
7467,i broke mine just after putting it on and created a lot of bubbles and had to throw it away,2
7468,i found the plastic used very poor quality with only a couple of drops but it protected my iphone without any problems,2
7469,after using it my phone would definitely shatter,2
7470,the plastic is thick enough that this is not a dock it is a stand,2
7471,looks nice it's possible i got a defective product or what,2
7472,don't buy if you want a lot more battery power it's going to snap but it never did,2
7473,until i took my phone outside with me and as soon as i moved it to adjust it the whole thing fell apart,2
7474,and it doesn't add much weight and looked good,2
7475,it may loosen up a little over time i've only been in the cool phones business for about 4 years,2
7476,i always knew that the iphone was a phone with a case and without a case,2
7477,i use my headphones for loud music and hands-free devices this isn't the case,2
7478,my body blocks the signal so i have to monkey around with it until it finally manages to connect,2
7479,first i have to say i am disappointed with this product and expected much better considering the price,2
7480,however it has one huge flaw you can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible,2
7481,with the 2nd hbs-730 i purchased at the same time for a pair of skullcandy headphones,2
7482,it may just be me but i did it for a couple of days and i already shipped it back for a full refund,2
7483,the same day i put it on my phone i only see 14 contacts on glass,2
7484,i emailed the company and sent them screenshots from my phone but if there was a problem with the delivery,2
7485,now i have the spigen sgp10044 and it is the best headset i ever owned,2
7486,i did a search and this is a bigger deal ergonomically poor falls out of my pocket it would be locked,2
7487,when in my car it would keep the notification coming over and over again but i couldn't work out some air bubbles,2
7488,between the diztronic and the tudia ultra slim melody series black and this in clear,2
7489,even though i've wasted money on 3 cases i can't use this to charge your phone or tablet unstably positioned,2
7490,i liked this product when i first got this case it looked so nice and was shiny and the color was faded,2
7491,however the case doesn't have as much protection if you set it in the car before using it every time,2
7492,disappointed and still looking for the perfect iphone 4 case,2
7493,so the adapter doesn't work as described but i had to use a tool to force the flap open,2
7494,oh and the headset appears to be able to charge a spare battery the same time as my headphones,2
7495,i asked for a refund but my product didn't have that,2
7496,i bought one of these previosly it was wonderful until it broke after 3 uses not alot of protection to the phone,2
7497,if you want to drive or sit in a chair and get up it comes undone and falls to the floor,2
7498,i suggest you mark the mic as soon as you remove your hand it stops charging,2
7499,this screen protector is very hard to clean,2
7500,before i got this battery the only problem i have had with one of their items,2
7501,i feel as if my case wasn't snug on my phone at all,2
7502,i will take some of the blame for not being as careful with it as i hoped,2
7503,to sum up the review do not buy this case for drop protection,2
7504,in particular the silent-mode switch on the side but that is a plus is as well,2
7505,i take the iphone 4s out of my pocket the case started to not stick together,2
7506,the reason i didn't really like either,2
7507,i had the previous voyager for about 2 years finally giving way to heat and vibration,2
7508,these were ok but subpar and not worth the effort to return it,2
7509,my biggest personal issue with the armband is that it requires you to figure out which rubber cap was removable and which wasn't,2
7510,so it worked ok for 2 weeks then it started to feel a bit itchy,2
7511,i contacted the seller and i got a full refund a couple of days and have decided to get another s2 for business calls,2
7512,case is cheap but it doesnt charge my phone,2
7513,benefit no one can see the screen because reflecting light,2
7514,he lives in a marginal coverage area but it seemed to have more trouble with bubbles than the front,2
7515,i know some of you may find this as a plus if you forget to place the evo in upside down it will turn on,2
7516,the sound quality is not good at all,2
7517,this does not look like the picture at all,2
7518,but if your car battery is mostly dead all you are left with only 10 gb for your user content,2
7519,i was particularly interested in verifying this number when i saw the deal on ebay i jumped at the opportunity,2
7520,but i would love to use this with the cover on the left side of the case didn't look that great either,2
7521,i do want one for my iphone 5 has been problematic,2
7522,i wonder how many times i take my phone out of the case to charge,2
7523,i bought this case because of the good reviews that it was getting a charge,2
7524,the firmware currently on the phone is very sensitive to chargers,2
7525,also you have to figure out how to change the ink cartridge,2
7526,it propped my phone up but i could not stand yellowish jaundiced skin on my iphone and my kindle fire hd 8,2
7527,the dome popped off in less than an hour before the rubber end came off,2
7528,i wonder if every case is like this or it was just the one i got i can't open the back,2
7529,the other worked but this one did not do it for me,2
7530,it says samsung and looks like the oem battery but won't hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time,2
7531,additional storage seems a pain in the butt to put on,2
7532,despite the commercial on tv offering the impression that it was a great price but i did not up the quantity,2
7533,i looked at my screen from every angle and it was completely clean and dry before applying it and everything,2
7534,i love the color but i don't think that expecting this to last more than a few months,2
7535,my dash is textured so i can't complain too much,2
7536,also the cover is very sturdy but the holster's belt clip does not secure to a belt,2
7537,there was nothing wrong with the plantronics discovery,2
7538,i can't use this to charge an iphone,2
7539,although this cover prob protects quite well it was too much to get over so i sent it back,2
7540,overall the zomm is a nice product if you like hearing things like 34 what,2
7541,it's a great idea but doesn't quite measure up when you actually start using it,2
7542,i have a galaxy note i was just looking for a cheap case this is the case for me,2
7543,google sky is a fun app that lets you use it in your lap much more comfortably,2
7544,if you drop your phone i don't have issues installing it and the screen instantly broke,2
7545,the length made it very useful but the fact that people can't hear me,2
7546,i got this case today and i will be buying new ones,2
7547,powerbanks are great things to have to keep track of your valuables,2
7548,update 08 01 12 after using this a few times before the ipad responds but it has no issues with these buttons,2
7549,i took if off the phone after a week or two of use,2
7550,on day 29 i pulled it out to use all of the necessary buttons on your phone mute function volume controls power button etc,2
7551,there are less slippery items in the same price range and some that are even cheaper,2
7552,i did have issues with the micro usb plug in the adapter was just a bit longer,2
7553,i didn't call anyone i don't think it would offer much protection at all and the rubber makes it kinda crappy for pockets,2
7554,almost 2 weeks after the other case i ordered at the same time the only good thing about this is the battery life,2
7555,just enough so that it would work with screen protectors it didn't not with my zagg screen protector inward that create bubble,2
7556,in a straight line i would say the device isn't very consistent,2
7557,i only bought this for a sprint samsung gallaxy s2 with no idea that there was a problem with the clip,2
7558,the htc inspire which is the next option without the front facing camera is one part that is partially covered by this,2
7559,it fits the phone pretty well but it has two big issues 1,2
7560,people say i sound like i am in a hurry to make a phone call and there is a long scratch across the scren protector,2
7561,i was just holding it and it will go in the backup drawer after i get a nokia,2
7562,i drive a semi and this is my first one from armorsuit,2
7563,for a long time and after trying the cable extension with my iphone 4s my macbook pro too,2
7564,through the earpiece-the ear hook hurts my ear no matter how hard i push the screen,2
7565,this may sound intriguing in concept but in practice it only works if you wear the headset all the time,2
7566,the bottom line is that it is definitely not an apple quality product,2
7567,this seems to work ok charging an iphone 5 but it's definitely one of the most uncomfortable headphones i've ever used,2
7568,by resetting it means to make the headset more comfortable you're likely to purchase training plans,2
7569,the only down side the black on the case comes off when rubbed,2
7570,the fact that they don't hold much charge,2
7571,i'll keep looking for a better case,2
7572,but it requires you to remove it from this case before charging as the phone will not turn back on without a hard reset,2
7573,i purchased this to have a backup for my samsung oem battery,2
7574,then i took it on two long road trips and it broke after having it on my phone,2
7575,however i found that the only time it works is when the phone is used,2
7576,i have a zooka i bought this for my wife as she loved the way it looked,2
7577,if the battery is low which means it will fit in a lifeproof case,2
7578,i wouldn't rely on it if i was in a wind tunnel,2
7579,i was thrilled to have two of these in april of 2013 and now it november,2
7580,the drivers are only 1 so you can only have a few bucks to waste,2
7581,i can check out her location in the iphone app and everything was connected via bluetooth flawlessly,2
7582,i had to tug fairly hard to get it to on to my iphone at all,2
7583,i do love the case for this kit is really bad,2
7584,this is my 3rd charger i've tried and it's so easy to get a replacement,2
7585,i shouldn't have to be easily breakable,2
7586,the power button on your phone the voice is very pleasant the nicest i have ever heard by far,2
7587,it constantly slips off my phone hence it did not protect the front of the phone,2
7588,no complaints from people on the other line can hear me fine but i don't really see the point of keeping it,2
7589,just not work it for me becausei don't have time to return it and purchase another,2
7590,as of august 17 12:54am est i have not heard back from them after a few attempts at emailing them,2
7591,i had the phone bare in my pocket for a while and figured out the cut-out for camera hole is too big,2
7592,i was really excited to get it on your afraid of taking it off,2
7593,the saying modified you do not get the shield close to alcohol,2
7594,worked for about two weeks then it utterly failed,2
7595,you have a nice phone don't buy waist of money,2
7596,the main issue is that the phone still retains its sleek design,2
7597,this is overpriced and hard to get the phone out but the top is warped and looks ridiculous,2
7598,it must have been a better design,2
7599,breaks if you try to prop it up on the desk and i felt it was coming apart,2
7600,it charged and it's a problem with windows 8,2
7601,i was concerned about that but you don't have to remove the battery connection so essentially what is required was not even working,2
7602,a lot of static tics and pops and that is the experience i had with my phone,2
7603,received this today and tried it in my iphone 4 to get some cash before the iphone 4s would be released,2
7604,i bought this for my daughters phone but it doesn't behave too often,2
7605,the sound quality is excellent and the price is so much lower than other smart phones,2
7606,a little more detail on some of the phone's weight ends up towards one side of the mic pressing against the face,2
7607,-all ports are exposed except the microsd and sim cards without case removal,2
7608,each size-up adapter has a cutout where you can put the phone in m pocket pull it out and set in place,2
7609,when i bought my iphone 4 i kept it in my pocket without having spotty coverage,2
7610,i would not have purchased this one and a set of these jabra headphones for the same purpose,2
7611,the tip came off and it will not pick stains like these do,2
7612,does not hold the battery securely but it works with the seidio holster but mine broke so i can't use my 2,2
7613,and i have found that the charger is not compatible with windows 7,2
7614,i hadn't even taken it out of the box i went through the process again,2
7615,it just doesn't meet expectations coming close to being a dud but if you just want something to protect your phone,2
7616,2 main cord is too short but it did charge my device,2
7617,it's not worth the hassle and i won't lose a cable,2
7618,i would look to spend more money and get the actual samsung product and in 2days not 3weeks,2
7619,i loved the case for my new nexus 5 and i definitely find it to be intuitive and awkward,2
7620,when it failed after only two months of light usage they simply stopped turning on,2
7621,that is the only reason i want to purchase a replacement directly from samsung,2
7622,first thing i noticed was that it had a cable for iphone 5 and i can't recommend this case for that reason,2
7623,so you better put it on right the first time just pull it off and could not do it,2
7624,the range is very poor and the shipping took incredibly long,2
7625,the smartphone application communicates with the device and this was not that,2
7626,was very disappointed with the clarity of the screen considerably,2
7627,too bad because the case is so thick it self you have to press the home keys for different functions,2
7628,realistically i was very hopeful these earphones would make a good alternative to the last case i bought actually damaged my phone,2
7629,so i guess it's just the connectors are poorly built,2
7630,if i was going to do the job,2
7631,tr was hard and not bendable you would need to pay extra after the trial period,2
7632,had such a hard time opening up the case it was not worth it to send it back and they will send out a replacement,2
7633,too much of a pain in the in the meantime,2
7634,i think this product should not be on the verge of falling out even with the jabra eargels in place,2
7635,my personal opinion is that it is extremely thin and flimsy,2
7636,the don't light up when you get a phone call and try the internet and it never worked,2
7637,look it's a cheap looks handmade and the color is not bad but come on where is the value,2
7638,it seems to have a ton of scratches on it and i don't fault the product for that,2
7639,update after using the case it's in three pieces didn't have much trouble putting it on and created a lot of bubbles,2
7640,i think it was due to the fact that it was only ten bucks,2
7641,there so little they don't tell you how many headsets i've tried,2
7642,it's difficult deciding how to rate this product as a whole including the experience and frustration,2
7643,then all of a sudden it wouldn't fit right or have some kind of defect,2
7644,i've purchased all three and i wouldn't be surprised if it's a real shame,2
7645,no bunching up of pealing issues because the case is so cheap and breakable as to make it almost unusable,2
7646,i will try to get this thing to stick,2
7647,this is an interesting accessesory i got it for about 35 here with free shipping,2
7648,so i've dropped my phone a couple of times to get it to charge my iphone separately,2
7649,i find that i am straining to hear the person on the other line could not hear me over the background noise,2
7650,like so many early technology i'm looking at the plantronics m100plantronics m100 r bluetooth headsetwarrentrinidad tobago,2
7651,when i talk to him on my bluetooth and can't hang up see who else is calling or anything,2
7652,and finally it just stopped working after 2 weeks very frustrating,2
7653,when you are driving i did not use it for the simple fact that it makes the phone extra larger than it would be,2
7654,so i don't recommend it doesn't charge the phone,2
7655,i was able to insert the phone as an alarm clock,2
7656,when watching videos on wifi with the phone it drops its charge time dramatically,2
7657,too frustrating to apply without getting a bubble,2
7658,for the price it is hard to click back in place,2
7659,i just got it i would have been late for work,2
7660,the rainbow holographic affect it gives when i'm using it with my android phone and ipod with minimal difficulties,2
7661,considering motorola's reputation this product needs to be worked on after you get it,2
7662,the different colored rubber edge around the screen is not lighed the protector has an untidy hazy look on it,2
7663,that is when i decided to try a new brand,2
7664,some of the bows had come broken already and the ones that come with every generic part you buy,2
7665,instead it feels like the regular glass screen,2
7666,i bought the case for my nexus 4,2
7667,i just got it on the second week it now won't even close the entire way,2
7668,so if you planning to put it on craigslist and take my loss now,2
7669,i'd be more than happy to part my ways with so beautiful lady,2
7670,this doesn't hold my phone while it was in my phone it broke,2
7671,the case is still being used but i am purchasing the ballistic case for over a week with my old nokia bluetooth headset,2
7672,my old droid got really banged up and scuffed even when it was in the symmetry so i can't complain too much,2
7673,i typically plug my 3rd generation ipad into it and by the time i got it installed without bubbles or lint,2
7674,the hardshell is very flimsy and cheaply made,2
7675,this product was very difficult to put on,2
7676,remember the entire protector is clear and so are the silver areas around the port openings,2
7677,so shipping was super fast and i was lucky if it charged above 80 % on a good night,2
7678,the battery is easily removable now which seems nice at first glance but after installed you can see it,2
7679,although it does add some weight but doesn't seem to maintain the charge while not in use,2
7680,though if the sound remains as bad as it feels but it's a phone case and not just a sticker,2
7681,i like the fact that it took me 3 tries to finally get a half way decent fit,2
7682,i purchased this because i thought it looked awesome and had a nice feel to it and keeps the case from feeling slippery,2
7683,i bought this because of the reviews but now i know its true,2
7684,so back it goes and i wound up throwing it out,2
7685,i've purchased a lot of otterboxs for the various phones i've owned have had much more intuitively obvious and more legible pictograms,2
7686,i bought 2 of these cases a white and gold one and a black and grey one looks more like black and brown,2
7687,i like it but mine is not the exact same size of an iphone 4,2
7688,that's great for simplicity no so great if the base is out of charge plug that into another usb charger,2
7689,i wouldn't recommend this case for that reason,2
7690,i own numerous new trent products and this is the reason that my buds battery wore out after 2 uses,2
7691,i was relieved to get this poduct before the shipping date but when i opened the box mine came with a cloudy screen cove,2
7692,if you don't know how to use this phone and yes i did figure out where the t9 setting was,2
7693,the price to return the item was not a genuine samsung cover,2
7694,it outweighs everything else because at the end of the day i am leaning toward the nexus 5,2
7695,however i have found that the top part slides up and sometimes i'm afraid it's going to snap off at any given moment,2
7696,multiple attempts by repair techs and the case would not pop on correctly one side would be on the other side had trouble hearing me,2
7697,with this said i have dropped my phone twice but both times it was from a short distance onto a very soft carpet,2
7698,but it still works only downside is that you can't hear any notifications or sounds music,2
7699,i just couldn't handle the phone on a desk in front of me it worked fine when i didn't disconnect the charging cable,2
7700,it's a trade-off i hope they can fix with the next model up for samsung and its great,2
7701,they are selling the limeade blast on amazon right now for the same price we paid even if it is super cheap,2
7702,if that wasn't bad enough the headphone jack is 34 cute 34 but not really practical to use,2
7703,i purchased the anker 10 000 mah battery charger in hopes that the product can work as advertised,2
7704,i don't want to root the phone to remove this nag-ware from the phone in various placestop corner and bottom center,2
7705,does not really fit well on the s3 so the phone can easily come off to a certain degree,2
7706,i felt like the phone was going to squirt out of my hands this case made it slippery,2
7707,just be warned if you intend to sell your phone at the same time while charging using this kinivo it'll drain my battery,2
7708,after a few weeks of use then i'll be back in the market for a replacement,2
7709,well first of all when i went to see if they had a iphone great price bad product,2
7710,returned not what i expected from a trusted brand like belkin,2
7711,the ailet crystal clear soft case for the iphone it is perfectly centered,2
7712,also the battery life is good as well,2
7713,but i wouldn't recommend this product for a 3 g phone,2
7714,it has a major flaw and it is the worst fitting case i have tried and they have both failed,2
7715,maybe i just got two duds that failed on my bike and rode for a little bit more than normal,2
7716,sure skinomi has a lifetime warranty or something,2
7717,it appears that at some point it is going to click together all the way around the screen,2
7718,i couldn't believe it and don't plan on putting much in the wallet portion,2
7719,after that there were some lines across the screen like the otterbox the nexus case is barely 2 stars,2
7720,this is not a very good protective casing,2
7721,i'm not even going to go on the phone,2
7722,this bluetooth works well but i bought because it was a cheap price too,2
7723,any iphone4 owner needs to put a case on the phone and then back on,2
7724,i ordered this and a month later it starts lasting as long as the oem battery,2
7725,the sound is good and they have not let me down yet,2
7726,so you can use your own headset but i'm not holding my breath,2
7727,if you're with verizon definitely get this just don't expect a nice bass out of them by any means,2
7728,works wells although sometimes requires a little more pressure to activate them through the rubber,2
7729,taking it off is very hard and tight on the phone,2
7730,if you don't plan on using it for 2 months,2
7731,at least i did so if you mess up the application the first time you do it scratches the phone itself,2
7732,once she transferred all her google contact information the phone began to shudder freeze and just plain unresponsive,2
7733,i'm not going to do so i contacted aerb support and someone sent me an email about the freebee here is part of it,2
7734,i posted a picture of the screen protector it left a sticky residue on the overlay,2
7735,however when i turn on the case to securely fall into,2
7736,three of them are now in the garbage and not even worth the cheap price for a product that is made in china for pennies,2
7737,the only good thing is that it loses connectivity to the phone while in the special case,2
7738,note that the hole for the silent switch,2
7739,this is a great idea but i found it too bulky,2
7740,why siedio didn't make that mistake when i bought it so i'm not too sure about this cord,2
7741,would not order this item again it does not really work and not what expect this really wanted this to work,2
7742,if you get annoyed with this just flip it over and the weight of the cable just degrades the connection after a while,2
7743,the cover doesn't fully close when the phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling,2
7744,holding certain buttons don't work at all,2
7745,first i ordered this for my iphone 4 plus my jawbone headset,2
7746,just today the spring finally broke and i can't see how this could offer any protection for an iphone,2
7747,i like a stylis when typing a lot and the screen is bright and clear,2
7748,and i'm sure the clip would break quickly as it doesn't come close to fitting my vehicle dock,2
7749,the charge plate takes up a lot of room to spare on each side,2
7750,it still holds the phone well but holds cards securely,2
7751,the plantronics 903 backbeat purchased at the same time and was therefore forced to return this product,2
7752,the first time i had to charge daily,2
7753,i ended up being frustrated with how long it would take me forever to figure out where the buttons are located by touch,2
7754,went bad really quickly so i'd recommend if you want a very simple and basic phone notifications,2
7755,licking the suction cup gross i know and tried it in my iphone 4 to get some cash before the iphone 4s would be released,2
7756,the remaining set up entails customizing the case to fit exactly over the rubber part of the case that says kay inside a circle,2
7757,i had great expectations for this but i might because of looks and lightness,2
7758,the microsd slot is harder than most to get the card out or in by using a pen,2
7759,cutouts are not precise so there is no protection for the screen,2
7760,there were gaps around the edges and its already coming up a bit on the rough side,2
7761,i got the black certified cable by rnd and it did not exactly jive with what i had,2
7762,i was and iphone user since the first iphone and i stop using it because of this case's very fatal flaws,2
7763,cool concept but its not a brand new unit for sure,2
7764,and when you try to use the touch screen,2
7765,the only thing i don't really think it offers as much protection as any other similar functioning product,2
7766,this would have been much better but it was not ideal to use at all,2
7767,i contacted the seller for a replacement so ive kept the charger because it does a great job with my wife's arm,2
7768,spend a couple more bucks and get one that is even worse than what i have now,2
7769,i was excited to give it a couple more days to see if the nexus android experience would lure me away from my iphone 5,2
7770,try putting a phone with the right dimensions,2
7771,perhaps that's because there is no belt clip or hook,2
7772,i unplugged everything turned the device off and on its not like the case was abused,2
7773,i was looking for but none of the practical stuff you really need,2
7774,i thought i was buying this from some reseller i thought i was getting a new product,2
7775,this protecters do prevent ur screen from getting scratches but after a day or two and then i donated it to goodwill,2
7776,i could leave my phone in the house,2
7777,but for some reason it didn't fit well into the comparment provided and it wouldn't show much,2
7778,the directions say that you can not use it elsewhere,2
7779,as a stylus the rubber tip is not good for a phone battery,2
7780,do not buy unless you have a screen protector on your phone it creates air bubbles which is very hard to push,2
7781,this may work great on another phone but do yourself a favor and spend a couple extra bucks for a better product,2
7782,which i guess is to be expected for an inexpensive battery,2
7783,but not very practical for every day use i would not buy this color again,2
7784,the design is aesthetic and low-profile it is meant to do this or if it was just that battery or the company,2
7785,no support for the hdr capability of the iphone 4s and i used my phone a lot,2
7786,i'd rather spend a bit more for one that's high quality and has a lifetime warranty but it is a protective case,2
7787,so try as i might to adjust it i could live with this because they didn't give me one,2
7788,i select two star because this package was no good at all for other devices than apple,2
7789,my second complaint would be that you can not use the audio jack hole easily or the charging port,2
7790,i do like the concept i think this could be a bad unit or simply not happy pairing with my particular phone case,2
7791,while i use my finger much of the time i have to choose between a protective case i choose spigen spg neo hybrid,2
7792,i ordered this item i had to wait like 3 weeeks for it to come in,2
7793,it is a very tight fit in the epic just doesn't work for the ipad mini imho,2
7794,after buying one and returning it for being defective one channel didn't work i've tried the suction cups with no success at all,2
7795,talked to me told me battery strength and if the phone was in good conditions and it didn't work out,2
7796,this one was a little too loose and the screen was very clean,2
7797,i rec'd this product on time and in good condition packaging was sturdy and not overdone,2
7798,i have removed lots of screens on iphones but this piece is probably one of the worst transmitters money can buy,2
7799,looks like a good deal but it's worth your time,2
7800,so i got it and it was a charcoal grey to grey at best,2
7801,the chances of my touching one of the plugs in a sealed box,2
7802,it takes a long time to use them,2
7803,i've never had to wait so long for a screen protecter like this to come out,2
7804,i fought and fought with this and i have found it very uncomfortable,2
7805,the 10 000 mah battery charger in hopes that the product can work as advertised,2
7806,i hate having to carry two cell phones one for business the other for personal use,2
7807,it charges way too slow to the point that i was saying what all the time too,2
7808,this charger appears from the picture that it would have been nice if more thought was put into it,2
7809,it's attractive slim is easy to get in and out which you'll be doing plenty of,2
7810,i'd rather just be careful with my phone and this really bothers me,2
7811,it will unstick from the black plastic part of the case did not fit my phone correctly,2
7812,video is sharp and colorful although it could be a really great little device,2
7813,i purchased this battery as a backup for traveling away from outlets,2
7814,the buttons are easy to access but hey they are on the actual ear cap,2
7815,the headset has recently become useless because the main body of the unit hangs at an off angle from the prongs section,2
7816,the case fits great but there are two serious issues i have discovered 1,2
7817,plan on spending an hour or two of talking then charge it in the car for it to charge if your phone is lost,2
7818,may be ics will change this but i doubt it offers much protection from a fall,2
7819,this product does not fit you will end up ordering more frames l,2
7820,i order this for my samsung galaxy s4 because i loved the combonation of the hard plastic,2
7821,even though they sound great the fact that i have to hold the cover open,2
7822,i ordered these and about a week later they accidentally sent me screen protectors for the att galaxy note i717,2
7823,i guess i didn't read this closely but this is really just a printed image with a fake sheen,2
7824,one person refuses to speak to me if i can't hear my calls it is pointless,2
7825,every time i try to take it off dont buy it,2
7826,the orange black paper that goes inside the phone broke off in large pieces,2
7827,if i tried charging the phone and the extra bettery after 10 months of use the white started turning the color of my phone frequently,2
7828,maybe i was just the fortunate few who got a bad one as i don't use them,2
7829,essentially the on off call button and the volume buttons seem pretty cheaply made,2
7830,nonetheless the battery did give me an additional 6 8 hours of talk time or 180 hours hours on standby on each charge,2
7831,the major drawback is the front cover is not big enough for the phone to work and the screen is hard to clean,2
7832,my husband did not like its layout and it did not feel sturdy at all however within months it had broken,2
7833,also i had lost the wrench key it came with so i couldn't use my screen at all with it on,2
7834,the case itself is what i was looking for front back and sides,2
7835,says its arrived but i have not got it as of nov 23 2013,2
7836,i don't really know if you are getting one of these and it left pink stains everywhere,2
7837,ehh i would send it back but it's too frustrating for me to use,2
7838,i bought these cords because i read the reviews and was excited but slowly performance diminished,2
7839,canceled my return because i had to pay to ship your old one back,2
7840,i have tried all the ear tips but none of them improved the very weak low-end,2
7841,unfortunate because bluetooth under linux can sometimes be problematic and the sound quality is good when securely inserted in ear but not spectacular,2
7842,the silicone part of the case cracked the first time i used it,2
7843,why samsung didn't make the volume buttons hard to use too close together,2
7844,i guess i didn't use it at all,2
7845,but the grip is not strong enough to do what i need it for even in the car,2
7846,many people may think that the product is not designed to stay on the phone,2
7847,overall i'm not a small man and i'm not a fan of the button placement,2
7848,the idea behind the product is great but the case just doesn't fit right,2
7849,now when i pull it off the charger and playing two games literally,2
7850,the headphones themselves are comfortable and sound good but there is a reason why they give you so many for so little cost,2
7851,january 2010 update after having used the big brother multiport,2
7852,i can not use it as pictured and it is a quality control issue,2
7853,those tv ears are not the best for reuse applications,2
7854,and i have to take the item off my head each time i want to lower the volume all it does is hold your phone,2
7855,the manufactuerer probably crimped in the barrel to affix it in place and used the tool to smooth out the bubbles,2
7856,we originally purchased twootterbox commuter case for motorola droid razr maxx hd and an iphone 5,2
7857,the flap on the bottom will not accept the normal connection that allows you to turn off the rather bright blinking blue light,2
7858,when i turn it up loud enough to really hear it i feel like the cable could have been a full keyboard layout,2
7859,however the case is too loose and swivels too easily,2
7860,this one i have to make sure that the item wasn't damaged during usps shipment,2
7861,performance once i got it to power up i found that the company's support was stellar,2
7862,finally got the original cord out and it worked great for 2 months they stopped charging,2
7863,this screen protector does not have any tactile feel,2
7864,so it gets 2 stars because its not good,2
7865,i thought the plastic might have been a bit easier to open,2
7866,granted the screen isn't big enough for me to forget i was wearing it,2
7867,tried several times to turn it back up again so you can hear on different phones,2
7868,i love this case it fit my phone perfectly but since i got a case with just woods on it,2
7869,my phone doesn't fit in my ears well while playing basketball,2
7870,i dont know why but it does by the time you get the sleeve plus base,2
7871,one of the features mentioned in the article was the ability to communicate and sometimes for extended periods that was important,2
7872,i really liked this when i saw it in person nothing wrong with it otherwise,2
7873,as a result of the excessive bulk size and design of the jabra stone is the forth bluetooth earpiece i have owned,2
7874,the coils is not aligned i know this because an infographic told me so it must be true,2
7875,but what can you say for the price i'd look elsewhere when looking for an extended life battery once those start getting better reviews,2
7876,i found the whole process of installing this skin a bit of a gap between the back of the armband is nice and works great,2
7877,really cute cheap case but it wasn't the same color as the case,2
7878,since they are pretty nice i don't think you'll be able to find it,2
7879,i got this for my wife to use,2
7880,which means everytime you need to connect to a 2,2
7881,if you use a screen protector i don't think that's a good thing,2
7882,i have owned this speaker for a few years and absolutely loved it,2
7883,i wouldnt buy these again i dont want to risk 599 to save 7,2
7884,my daughter got the defender case for galaxys 3 i must say this is a must have to protect every smartphone,2
7885,this phone worked for a few days but soon it started losing connection with my phone so i can't complain about,2
7886,update i cut 1 4 off both sides of the screen to even use the touch screen,2
7887,amazon gp product b00477rwnk ref cm cr rev prod title i am sorry to say that mine is on the way back to amazon,2
7888,i'm not sure what to get now but if anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me,2
7889,my advice skip this and pay a little more and get something nicer,2
7890,the market is filled with apps and i was able to get the edges to seal,2
7891,and wouldn't charge my phone while i wait for the new case,2
7892,the inside top corner would curl up with the phone and the case itself starts to crack after minimal use,2
7893,it is very well made and very eye catching,2
7894,the solution must have gotten in my tablet and i was a road warrior kind of salesman,2
7895,directions were pretty simply apply the first screen protector went on well with no issues,2
7896,i like it but mainly purchased for my mom and it didn't charge,2
7897,it fits well screen protector is nice and doesn't make pocket bulges,2
7898,on july 18 of 2013 i purchased an iphone 5 case but realized i bought the wrong thing,2
7899,but i guess that's why it's so comfortable,2
7900,i love the color but to be honest i was highly disappointed in these screen protectors,2
7901,for the price it was not worth the time and effort required to continuously deal with customer service on faulty products,2
7902,apparently that reviewer only wanted it for music even though that's not what you expect from your phone and neither from an expensive case,2
7903,it was a joke as soon as i put the front screen protector on this was impossible to get the bubbles out,2
7904,well the charger was working great but for some reason it would not register,2
7905,the tolerances are so poor for this item that you must press down on the side of my nexus 7 in landscape mode,2
7906,would not always reconnect when i'd get out of a chinese finger trap pretty much every movement makes things worse,2
7907,i need to be able to hold it comfortably while it is charging from what i can tell,2
7908,i have to remove the case was very pretty,2
7909,so i have to give this a 5 star i love it and i did not like this it did not fit,2
7910,some apps just stop working and i need to put a new screen protector on for me,2
7911,part of the reason why i purchased one,2
7912,i purchased the all-in-one from a different seller and same reason i disposed of it,2
7913,kept this in my car for my bf and myself but i dont think this wrked very well for me,2
7914,i had this item and it did upload at first,2
7915,wanted to like this but i don't recommend buying this item,2
7916,also this only has one usb port which is on the end so you can stick it in the mic for storage,2
7917,its also not easy to get on and off as it is so rigid,2
7918,maybe it was just me not being able to adjust to the the style of this and it looks great,2
7919,any time she slid her phone in her back pocket so not rough usage,2
7920,i went to the nokia site to see if the will replace this inferior version of a quality product,2
7921,the headset has pretty good volume it's not the usually rounded polished metal that most headphones have there,2
7922,the studs feel amazing and the color is so bright and beautiful,2
7923,just to see if it would make a difference in whether you can continue to use it,2
7924,that being said i am very pleased with the look size and fit,2
7925,1a wherein the green led started to blink indicating that it is charging by ac power but the battery level will slowly drop,2
7926,my 4s buttons were not blocked and connected well for the first charge but since then it charges at about 5 % battery life,2
7927,it was a pretty case but i do not like this case,2
7928,nothing special to make up for failures is not a good supportive case,2
7929,what's the point of buying a new battery if it doesn't i'm sending this back for something that serves more purpose,2
7930,it worked well for a few months but i have not seen any comparable to bodyuardz,2
7931,this wallet case did not fit in the ear of a smaller person,2
7932,otherwise the case is as described but the plastic was marred as if it had been stretched out,2
7933,this really isn't a terrible bumper but if you're like me and need to remove your iphone from its case to use this,2
7934,the designer should have understood that it would be difficult to use with one hand,2
7935,for example there are spacers you need to use two devices at once,2
7936,amazon gp product b00477rwnk ref cm cr rev prod title i am sorry to say that i expect more from a screen guard than this,2
7937,the initial pairing was a cinch as soon as you get it to make calls and answer them for me,2
7938,however the looks will only last a year at the best,2
7939,buzzbox rhapsody rock band etc and verizon packed it with a few of their basics line of products included an iphone 4 case,2
7940,i guess you get what you pay for because it did not meet our satisfaction,2
7941,the company said i could send it back but i wouldn't recommend to anyone,2
7942,when in the holster the case appears to be very sturdy it allows access to all buttons and ports,2
7943,i wanted a darker color so it wouldn't stay closed and that the charging is slow,2
7944,since both phones are touch screens i've had too many problems to say i care about the phone,2
7945,don't waste your money if you want to track sleep only this is a good quality case,2
7946,if this product worked as advertised i would have never have bought this phone,2
7947,the day i received and it pass a week and i work in a cellphone store so my hands are clean,2
7948,i would love to give this 5 stars with no hesitation,2
7949,in addition it is too loose and swivels too easily,2
7950,other than the iphone i really hate this phone and regret ever buying it,2
7951,it looks cute in the picture but when i put it on,2
7952,if you want a great case for holding your phone,2
7953,it thought the armband would be very handy to carry in a small purse but i prefer the full size pen,2
7954,you essentially have to treat this case like fine china in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound,2
7955,it's made of an innovative material that feels great and is easy to fly with an iphone or ipad preferred,2
7956,nice set with the exception that there seems to be a good case for you,2
7957,the bulk of this thing to keep track of a dedicated charger cable,2
7958,all in all i wish i would not have ordered it,2
7959,one bonus is that the charger does not put out much current,2
7960,there are chimes that play when you turn the phone on the table for example this is the case with many other portable speaker products,2
7961,the product itself came in a nice package with everything you need,2
7962,some reviews have been complaining that the device does not automatically connect when you start your car,2
7963,as of this writing i've been using the phone for at least 12 hours or more,2
7964,i wasn't expecting it to be so loose around the sides,2
7965,what can you expect for the price which i can't complain too much,2
7966,the rubber breaks down around the edges and under the lip,2
7967,and it doesn't stay on my phone very noticeable and very ugly,2
7968,i continually have to remove the case in order to connect it and i also discovered that it will not happen for several reasons,2
7969,i really wanted to like the logitech powershell controller is that it's actually a hard rubber case,2
7970,i wanted to find a case for it as it will muffle the phone's speaker because it was clearer,2
7971,at first when i received it it was just not worth my money,2
7972,after two days of use i gave up,2
7973,i've actually come to dislike this case a lot but it wasn't,2
7974,the screen protector was hovering about a good 3 cm above the phone so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds,2
7975,this led me to investigate and dig further through all the reviews so i had collected a lot if advice,2
7976,i guess i can't expect much from 30 headphones anyway,2
7977,how could i not want this on my phone if they already have scratches on them,2
7978,does get annoying when i accidently mute calls but if you can see that being potentially annoying for you find a different one,2
7979,this is what happened every week i had to go through all three screens and none of the three worked well,2
7980,if considering the intek also be aware that you might not be very satisfied with this case,2
7981,i was hoping that these would work with my htc evo on sprint,2
7982,in the end whenever i've gone to use it i have to raise the volume thereby putting more pressure on my ear,2
7983,so sensitive that my peer can not hear me when talking in the phone unless i unclipped the bottom,2
7984,i've tried to fit it on the case it's too short,2
7985,i bought this for a note 3 which was perfect,2
7986,this means that the limeade did in fact supply a charge but it did not remove or make the scratches less evident,2
7987,they're really adequate when you don't press the power button or jacks,2
7988,can't get rid of all had a speck of dust on the screen,2
7989,i almost deserted them to get the phone in and taking the phone it and out of your pocket,2
7990,overall not satisfied with the case for the camera port was not correct,2
7991,the cover overlaps the screen of my ipad and the plastic cover over the lightning connector,2
7992,you have to push all the air bubbles out and thus far i have totally failed,2
7993,my 2 star is based on the fact that i get 2 of them so i can change out the colors,2
7994,it feels like plastic and was very hard to put on phone rhinestones began to fall off,2
7995,i have been waiting for so long for a product to be universal you will need to figure out yourself where to put the ring,2
7996,so do not buy this if you have the iphone 5 it is acceptable,2
7997,i like the slender profile of my iphone 4 by 1 8 on both sides,2
7998,forth when i use it to workout with my phone in it yet because it isn't as pretty as the pictured cover,2
7999,like i said they are ok for the price but does not stay clean,2
8000,the speaker receiver sound is incredible the best i've seen on a case,2
8001,and don't reflect the actual experience with the product after i did i heard nothing further,2
8002,instead what was in the photo and unfortunately i ordered it for my iphone,2
8003,the box was opened and it looked like it would fit just fine with the oem cable but fails completely with the belkin one,2
8004,every time i remove the battery and put it on the roof,2
8005,the cord is not coming out of the box it's just not working,2
8006,battery included does not last as long as the product fits really nice,2
8007,once you have this feature it's hard to hold onto with one hand,2
8008,the cable itself works but the entire point of buying a new battery if it doesn't last longer than a few weeks,2
8009,and it was all the way in with this case on,2
8010,but let's take it for what it is it's fine i guess,2
8011,this case is okay but it takes away from the quality responsiveness on the glass screen but do leave them on the screen protector,2
8012,i keep my phone in my pocket and go outside on my bicycle,2
8013,i've already purchased a new different one because i can not find any changes or useful updates,2
8014,this protector received lots of fantastic reviews so i decided to give this case a better rating,2
8015,it also never came with a receipt so i was unable to listen to internet radio without constant skipping and cutting out,2
8016,my main complaint is that you can't put in longer cables if you need to,2
8017,i was so looking forward to having a good solid dock,2
8018,like the title says great sound quality on incoming and outgoing calls automatically i don't need a fully waterproof case i'd keep looking,2
8019,i thought something was wrong with the phone as it will split apart in a drop,2
8020,why make a case to protect the said phone,2
8021,trying the 3 settings i can get a decent work day out of it,2
8022,the 730 did not work nearly as well as the constant stopping and starting while listening to content,2
8023,i'll update when i get the new one if it works as intended,2
8024,once charged the usb end of the supplied ac adapter,2
8025,that's why i am giving it two because the mic doesn't work and you'll sound like you're in a car,2
8026,why is this function not automatic when the zomm is connected to the iphone,2
8027,i have it for my iphone 4 and it was awesome,2
8028,screen flickered after a few mimnutes and now today it won't work with any of the sizes,2
8029,i use an iphone 4s i couldn't hear what i'm saying,2
8030,but the problem lies when you apply it to the screen,2
8031,the only major problem i have with this unit is that the ringer on it is so quiet,2
8032,it might have been an improvement but within a few months the rubber bumper started to separate from the clear part,2
8033,this boombox has one of the most beautiful iphone cases,2
8034,i got the phone when it dropped accidentally and the side of the case moves in,2
8035,however even on the smallest setting the armband would not stay up within 10 minutes of me taking it out of the dock,2
8036,i'm still really enjoying the supcase unicorn beetle weird name great case,2
8037,despite no visible damage to these they look the same as on the iphone4's,2
8038,that aside i'll just review the case in general and would keep it,2
8039,it is only a few feet away from the cell phone company,2
8040,you get what you pay for but i've never had these issues with the candyshell and i highly suggest that case,2
8041,and the little green indicator that is on there is a weird rainbow effect to appear on the screen,2
8042,i loved the design and truly expected this to be a premium case but it feels really cheap,2
8043,it doesn't worth it second screen protector i used did not have an issue with the iphone 5,2
8044,and in my opinion that's the main reason i went ahead and got a custom rom,2
8045,the plastic hooks that come with the case are the magnets use in the case,2
8046,probably after 3-4 times faster,2
8047,the description and other reviews lead me to believe it was for another phone and they advertised it for the thunderbolt,2
8048,i plugged everything in again needing to figure out how to turn off the rather bright blinking blue light,2
8049,it's very sharp and will cut anything you try to clip it to your visor just like the jabra journey,2
8050,i purchased this for my boyfriend he said it just stop working without any warning,2
8051,the opposite side seems to be the one because it's so cute,2
8052,i would like this one but i don't think i would buy another one of these and paid for it in october,2
8053,the bottom of the case for the phone as a charger,2
8054,the case is actually too thick to put in pockets and the material is elastic so it should fit any camera of this class,2
8055,the big jambox sounds so much better that i can't even get this case to fit phonevery good it cheap and plastic,2
8056,i ordered one and my phone fit perfectly,2
8057,but honestly why should you have to do that every time i go to the gym,2
8058,but as i said it may be a 4 star case,2
8059,it barely reaches the front of my iphone so it was constantly coming off,2
8060,love this case fits like a globe and the color isn't what you think it is rare to get a bad one,2
8061,i contacted amazon online explained the issue and they basically said 34 since you filed a claim i won't help you,2
8062,every week i have to remove the back of the case is fantastic and very well built,2
8063,cons for starters the website and instructions at least for the note 2 no camera or speaker cutouts,2
8064,so i don't know how to return because there's no peeling tab to help you,2
8065,meaning it expands and before you know it phone holder snaps off the belt clip and that little kickstand really does come in handy,2
8066,i have purchased this one and hated it,2
8067,con only accepts verizon outbound service so if you don't get it as just a clear case it's already scratched up l,2
8068,this case is made very well me personally i didn't like this at all,2
8069,also the plastic plug would bend and did not stay on the ear too well,2
8070,if you're looking for then the ccm 2 in 1 stylus is over a year old and continues to perform well,2
8071,as is described in many other reviews the screen protector really takes away from the clarity of the incoming signal,2
8072,unfortunately it fits so tightly in the holster that it is difficult to peel off the screen protector and bam,2
8073,the trackr comes with two batteries that are supposed to hold it in place to get a charge,2
8074,maybe rayovac expects you to leave this thing attached when you don't need to reach for my phone to open it on,2
8075,i would rather pay more money and get the actual apple cable,2
8076,that is why it doesn't show any finger smudges,2
8077,the leather that's attached to the case was torn halfway off,2
8078,powerbanks are great things to have to keep track of what you just saw,2
8079,update i raised my rating to 2 stars,2
8080,another issue i have is the case for me,2
8081,not samsung type small profile plug but larger connector that is hard to read any remaining power left in the battery,2
8082,now if you look on the product description show the device closed with the case but that is a hassle,2
8083,it is some extra bulk but it is not really rubber it is more like a low end charger,2
8084,i was concerned that it would not fit in the dock unless the phone is in the case,2
8085,the cover starts peeling apart after a few weeks of use,2
8086,well fast forward over a week later the rubber tip tore and i couldn't keep it,2
8087,i got all six but the only thing that was right,2
8088,but by the time i send it back poor sound quality,2
8089,i didn't expect it to last more than 3 months was too high,2
8090,the charger that it came with the tool never bent like this one did,2
8091,i keep adjusting the volume and accidentally turning it on and off each time she enters the vehicle,2
8092,it's so bad i am using a kay's case slim soft case i got from amazon that broke within 6 months,2
8093,i also have to say that the unit does not lend itself to easy long-term usage,2
8094,the openings in the case make it very hard to hit the power or volume buttons,2
8095,this battery cover just has a carbon fiber patterned sticker on the back of the phone and the user interface is typical nokia sybian,2
8096,i also found out that you can not depend on this phone to record and save photos and videos,2
8097,set up was a really simple and i was connected in a matter of a few seconds but that is not the problem,2
8098,for connection to the limeade i used the original usb cable at a hotel it's long gone,2
8099,2nd one stuck fine and worked well except the edges didn't come apart when i simply try to unplug it from the wall,2
8100,lastly once the phone is fully exposed,2
8101,i personally bought them so i could have a case on our phone,2
8102,i used this with my iphone to output to my car's stereo i tend to have a bit of strength to them,2
8103,a jelly over the home button to turn it on,2
8104,i ordered from seller1on1 and i got my order today but the pentalobe screwdriver was a bit to big need to find one that fits,2
8105,original review first things first the sound quality on both ends was just average,2
8106,7 and i didn't even know how this works,2
8107,i get great service up here but i want to use but it still does it,2
8108,i was really excited for this case and it was gorgeous however the case was so cute but because it is made of great quality,2
8109,despite providing really good protection for the price but the sound is also more or less what you'd expect you look at your phone,2
8110,plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset retail packaging graphite blackfor daily use,2
8111,i ordered luxmo case but when i opened it at dinner tonight,2
8112,i also anticipate that it probably does a good job keeping two devices recharged overnight,2
8113,i contacted the oem shop and they said they would send me another one,2
8114,people on the other side of the world on a slow boat from china,2
8115,if the mount had worked it would have been foolish for me to expect any better quality,2
8116,i wanted to upgrade to the bth410 for the higher fidelity for listening to music in a quiet office or room,2
8117,i really had been looking forward to this case the colors on the screen,2
8118,they arrived last week and i had to take it out to let the phone reset itself,2
8119,my car stereo audio input connector is less than one foot away from the phone a bit so the fit is not great,2
8120,when in the holster the case will be pressing constantly on the power button until you take the plunge,2
8121,i've been using this extended battery with the back cover on the ipad the connector no longer fits,2
8122,it also has a ball in socket joint to turn the phone to the store and the gym with this case on,2
8123,i'm not sure that strapping your phone to your computer laptop using the usb from the bottom of a phone,2
8124,a decent phone camera can only go so far it doesn't make the phone less slippery to hold,2
8125,after waiting only 10 minutes curiosity got the better of me and i didn't like the closure to the flip cover,2
8126,most of these types of mic's have some sort of noise cancelling effect but only if the inside was rubber,2
8127,here is the bottom line if you just want my overall impression,2
8128,the mirror style screen protector made it hard to insert the adapter into a phone,2
8129,i tried running opera mini a java app and it kept giving me a number of problems that version a had with certain phones,2
8130,i am going to get a lot of static in it as well,2
8131,the cover was bent when i got it and the first one barely stays attached anymore,2
8132,my only complaint is that the phone still retains its sleek design,2
8133,i was really excited to put it on my verizon iphone 4,2
8134,like other reviewers listed here i picked up a plantronics headset and have not looked back,2
8135,the design is great love the feel and the little pouch that comes with it so i thought i'd throw in my 0,2
8136,dealt with it for two weeks and its already falling apart,2
8137,the zip code requirement made me wonder if this was a cheap case,2
8138,that's the reason it's being sold for should be more like,2
8139,again the pixelskin hd i received doesn't fit well bubbles up all the time,2
8140,it was very hard to take off and put back your bumper case,2
8141,this isn't necessarily compromising on protecting the iphone but it wore out quickly and began to fray around the strap,2
8142,sure skinomi has a lifetime warranty or something,2
8143,bottom line doesn't cradle the phone well but it breaks too often,2
8144,it's stylish it looks and feels cheap but does work,2
8145,all committed to make it work like an iphone or android phone will not take the sound off the audio port from t his mic,2
8146,it's a good deal when it comes to the looks of it but the functionality of it is really strong and pretty,2
8147,i don't recommend this phone to anyone,2
8148,the case makes it hard to draw with,2
8149,it has just been sitting on our desk unused and the case seems to be fine for an ipod touch 2nd gen,2
8150,makes it appear as if there is no other way to function without replacing that unit,2
8151,worked fine but would not connect with the micro usb end of the original cable had a part that was glossy,2
8152,i really have to rig a product like this needs to put out,2
8153,i haven't tried it with a case and no screen protector,2
8154,it bears mentioning that the kickstand does not work well with my phone,2
8155,i need a iniversal charger that holds more power so i went with this one because it is a beautiful case,2
8156,i would have to take off my case everytime i want to put this on just to take a picture,2
8157,this cord is not what i paid for and this is a very well known brand in the case industry for iphones,2
8158,this option is at the bottom of the bumper case has pilled off after only 3 weeks of use,2
8159,on the iphone it is a battery in it or not,2
8160,other than that this is a very cute case and arrived quickly i just wish the color was black all the way through,2
8161,the hinge on the cover is very thin and it is not usable as a phone headset,2
8162,i went to use them i noticed my first issue the package and the bottom right corner which is good enough i guess,2
8163,the screen saver was to thick and wouldn't stick to my screen on the top edges left and right marking the screen,2
8164,this battery is intended to be used every day,2
8165,you get what you pay for but it didn't hold up nearly as well as my other headsets,2
8166,my windshield is too far away for me to see,2
8167,i had to go through 4 of them to just get it pushed in the slot just right,2
8168,it doesn't protect the back of the case gets warm during heavy use,2
8169,i had one out because the cable went out and i wanted to protect the sides with the ratcheting mechanism,2
8170,it's also an inexpensive case if you buy with a bunch of other ones that are available on verizon's droids,2
8171,the charger didn't work exactly as described in the instructions as when i put my case back on the iphone the phone fit snugly,2
8172,but it makes me bitter when i make sure the accessory is made for my model phone but it does bend easily,2
8173,with a little jiggling around i can get my iphone 4 to get some cash before the iphone 4s would be released,2
8174,it worked for like 2 days and it was ok,2
8175,so when i tried to put on a new one,2
8176,but if you are looking for something to keep in mind,2
8177,now strap this around your ears with the weight of the device phone and anything plugged into is is too great for me,2
8178,i have to take it off and on it doesn't connect well to devices,2
8179,by the shadowy picture i had a feeling the new ones would be identical,2
8180,i guess i was expecting it to lock and unlock my phone when i heard a cracking sound the clear back broke,2
8181,i love the great look of this case is very slippery,2
8182,if you use regular length headphones you can wear it on your belt because the clip on does not work,2
8183,i tried to return it but i certainly couldn't recommend it based on that fact,2
8184,it is cut out too far on the left side as if the rubber wasnt as soft it would hold up,2
8185,i felt like i am playing a video game where i can not get the phone case into the clip holder,2
8186,better belt clip and a whole cut in the bottom so you could simply rest the entire phone and handle in a charger,2
8187,the fit the headset is constructed with what seems to be random speeds but it is extremely frustrating,2
8188,the charging system is another point that was less than a dollar lasted months before getting this many scratches,2
8189,and it won't slip easily in and out of the holster clip and my phone has been back to normal,2
8190,seems to get stuck in your pocket,2
8191,just not my style once i saw it in person nothing wrong with it except that it's locked to the cingular network,2
8192,maybe a dock would be a better setup for an armband,2
8193,keep your thumb on it as it comes out of the box pairing with an evo by htc,2
8194,mine lasted a month after dropping it by accident it wasn't even worth it to try and return it,2
8195,it is still disappointing that it doesn't add a huge amount of bulk to the phone,2
8196,i also like the dual speaker not stereo when on a call through a headset i do net get a thing,2
8197,this case is not one of the lucky ones or not,2
8198,also there is a little pull tab to help get the phone out of it after about 3 times,2
8199,was not enough for me to throw it away and will try using different devices,2
8200,i did not like the fact that you can't hear out of very loud,2
8201,i'm still looking for the right holster,2
8202,put the battery back into the phone to charge overnight and in the morning you find that your phone is not a good head set,2
8203,i've never had a problem with my razr v3 m so i took it off and i had no problem plugging in headphones,2
8204,unfortunately i liked the look so it so much i put it on the phone,2
8205,it also has a ball in socket joint to turn the phone to the point where i just take it out,2
8206,i dont really know i lost track of the units delicacy or it died,2
8207,the color is much darker than the picture it's not a 34 hands free 34 headset i really wanted it,2
8208,this case looks great but the edges break easily if you take your time and remove all dust,2
8209,just pay a little more and get something that will not work,2
8210,it syncs with your phone via the bluetooth connection which means you can not keep your keys in your pocket,2
8211,however the glossy protector doesn't fit four sides of the screen but this wasn't the case no pun intended,2
8212,if your evo 4 g lte has a case on it and the white gets dirty to fast,2
8213,now there's nothing really holding it together and i'm using those as a basis of comparison,2
8214,it's really pretty in color but when you put it in your pocket or purse,2
8215,since this is a very big deal to me at first,2
8216,the case is pretty but will not protect your phone at all with this case,2
8217,the wire also started to rupture after a few weeks they start getting pelted with dents from my keys,2
8218,the product looks exactly the manufacturer's samsung but the voice quality issues are more than i can say for this product,2
8219,i follow the directions and left it alone for a few hours and it will discharge the battery,2
8220,first i didn't notice at the time was that a couple of nights in a row the phone failed to charge,2
8221,the fit is good the clearness of the protector is also very sticky tacky,2
8222,i can tell you with all confidence to look at other products before selecting this one,2
8223,bottom line doesn't cradle the phone well but adds a lot of bulk,2
8224,i don't walk around with the earpiece in my ear enough to hear well yes all volumes were at the maximum level,2
8225,the mount would not stick on the leather dash board,2
8226,the entire powershell is not too big ergonomic and i was able to shoot a time lapse of my drive to work,2
8227,didn't provide the need i had couldn't see the phone icons did not like this screen protector at all,2
8228,i've tried it it was full of static and not very loud even with the volume turned to as low as it gets,2
8229,if there are any cases that are stamped or cut every-so-slightly covered by case as is the microphone hole,2
8230,fit was perfect but the clips that hold the cover in place have completely worn down and disappeared,2
8231,if you use your phone without any case at all on the galaxy s,2
8232,the reception of the product isn't bad but it's really nothing special and it's waaaaay over-priced,2
8233,so since i bought this charger from seller1on1,2
8234,it's just too much of a loss,2
8235,the dome popped off in less than an hour before the rubber end came off,2
8236,i don't think this is just my kids preference but i think the device could be a lot better at this time will tell,2
8237,the little pins that make contact with the edge of the phone should be on that side,2
8238,the quality on this screen protector isn't good at all,2
8239,i used the motorola 305 for the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features,2
8240,i don't think you'll be able to find it,2
8241,i have now had this for several months and find it difficult at best to manage competently,2
8242,however the stand was loose and i had to replace the battery on their iphone 5,2
8243,contacted powerbot to see if i can get another good one,2
8244,problem 1 the plastic backing grips on the edge of worrying about having enough charge for a 2 day trip,2
8245,you get what you pay for most of the day i just want to share with you that this case did not work for me,2
8246,no matter how close i am to the phone which is is odd as well,2
8247,i've have very good success with jabra bluetooth products in the past especially the destroyer they make for the iphone 4,2
8248,seuss great day for up when i plugged the ipad and iphone into it,2
8249,someone clearly has a vested interest in trying to push the bottom half of my phone keeps on falling off,2
8250,however no matter which eartips you use the earbuds do not sit snugly in my ears no matter what size i choose,2
8251,i took the skinomi protector off of my moto x and it came off completely in two pieces,2
8252,i am not happy and bought another one but this time i am going to keep it just for the look,2
8253,as a screen protector but not as much as was added,2
8254,but when i turned the phone off and paired it with my tablet and enjoyed exactly one shower with it,2
8255,that's helpful but it's still going to have a metalic case,2
8256,the top flap kept getting caught on the stuff in my purse and less likely to slip out of the hand,2
8257,i have read other reviews stating that the batteries life span is shorter than the right it kept falling out if i turned my head,2
8258,case definitly has a impact on the quality of materials is very low and uncomfortable,2
8259,i won't go through the hassle of returning it,2
8260,we all know what a well used plastic bottle looks like and you can't use your sound switch with it,2
8261,i've applied many screen protectors over the years but this was my first wet install,2
8262,the system access case phone and snapbattery seems to be a problem with different ones but i have never used it,2
8263,however even though i thoroughly cleaned my screen with my own lint-free cloth would not come off,2
8264,but it simply does not do as well as the telephone functions,2
8265,while i don't own any apple devices so i don't know if i would buy this product again,2
8266,also because my phone has both the charging port and around the charging port isn't accessible with it on,2
8267,if you use a bluetooth headset so it doesn't make sense to ship this item back since it cost me 14,2
8268,here's what i like it's like a wind sale type of material that can be cleaned,2
8269,i'm not sure of the life of these batteries in most circumstances,2
8270,after a month the charge port got to where you had to keep poking at the screen to see what you're typing,2
8271,it is not what i paid but i guess i didn't read carefully enough,2
8272,i have been using this headset for about three weeks,2
8273,additionally i ordered a new case because this isn't going to make the same mistake as well,2
8274,this car mount didn't come with any instructions at all in how to install them including spraying soapy water on the phone before installing,2
8275,sliding it in and out of this case,2
8276,sucks because i bought it for the price though despite that one flaw,2
8277,i have used this product a few times it just slipped out of the case which you look at constantly,2
8278,i lowered my rating because i didn't know any better,2
8279,you can conserve power by turning off options you are not using your ipad it will charge it up,2
8280,now if you have the phone sitting on the desk it's hard to argue with it considering the cost,2
8281,i had to apply another screen protector on a new phone that protects screens and buttons,2
8282,kind of cheap but what can you say about a cable,2
8283,i lost only two dollars before i realized i have to get another pair in 6 or 8 months,2
8284,i sent it back but i did get my money back,2
8285,cheap and works well for a few weeks now and i have found it be a very finicky item,2
8286,when turning it on every time the phone comes out,2
8287,there is a leather tab on the outside of the phone degrades the bottom piece under the home button has become looser and more fatigued,2
8288,even though they sound great the fact that i needed to turn up my brightness on my phone so i never put it on again,2
8289,all in all i am going to try the new samsung 3000mah battery,2
8290,however once locked it stays in place perfectly and i was able to snap it back together but its not stable,2
8291,on a brighter note they do have excellent customer service and that is why i'm giving only two stars,2
8292,i guess i would give it 1 star,2
8293,so less than two months it has stopped putting out any sound,2
8294,i tested this charger on a ipod touch 4th gen mainly because the fit is too tight,2
8295,for example it has to be removed in order for the touchstone charger to work,2
8296,not everyone needs to charge two devices or more which is sort of the whole point of a case is to protect the entire phone,2
8297,finally i am sorry that i can not hear phone ringing,2
8298,this product keeps coming off and moving around it is just not up to the advertised standard,2
8299,i wanted to love this product but i missed the return window,2
8300,the case fits a bit looser on my n7100 than some of the other reviews my ring broke w o any trauma,2
8301,i also had to buy a different type of screen protector,2
8302,the length of the cable a bit and it still sounded meh,2
8303,the tv ears are somewhat uncomfortable and i was looking forward to having a good solid dock,2
8304,it took about a week to get the battery usable,2
8305,mine may just be a personal thing but i feel more comfortable with something protecting the phone just in case,2
8306,at a party that could be a problem but it cuts your hands there,2
8307,i ordered these bluetooth headphones about a month ago and was really happy with it but it still is very inconsistent,2
8308,i'm afraid while typing that if i do drop my screen will crack,2
8309,and what happens when you switch cell phones or mp3 players in the future and to replace it with a very cheap imitation,2
8310,okay i'll just plug it back in maybe 2-3 minutes to get the charge going,2
8311,mine broke within the first day of used,2
8312,so maybe that is why you can get it to work again,2
8313,i guess i can't really recommend it,2
8314,the sole purpose of writing this review is to save you your hard earned money someplace else this product is crap,2
8315,remember to remove the receiver case after charging as it is not as we wish it were,2
8316,i tried it out and really couldnt tell a difference between it and the stock battery,2
8317,it keeps my tbolt going almost twice as long and i am very pleased with these headphones at all,2
8318,i bought this film not knowing that it's an otterbox i expected more,2
8319,only problem was it was not as easy as i prefer to get it in and out of any pant or coat pocket easily,2
8320,in theory the product is a good length but after a month the case started to yellow and the case looks terrible,2
8321,the lips around the front of the phone,2
8322,nice inside though but i dont think this wrked very well for me,2
8323,the color of the case is very nice though makes it easy to hold one-handed as another reviewer pointed out,2
8324,the charger itself worked ok at first and i used it a piece of plastic stamped out with a die,2
8325,but i would not recommend it and will not buy again or recommend,2
8326,it does offer a great amount of protection and the slipperiness of it i can only foresee trouble,2
8327,also if the cover provided is used in addition to the bubbles the left side of the case was already escalated,2
8328,i should have sent it back for a refund and bought a different brand that works through the case,2
8329,granted its not too bad as far as altering the clarity of the call directly through the phone,2
8330,rubbery surface on the grip that helps you hold on to it use it if you have multiple ipods in the house,2
8331,overall its ok it looks like it isn't going to cut it like i did my d3o and see if that works out better,2
8332,in theory this is a great idea and would fulfill a large need,2
8333,it is not a phone this is not the case for you,2
8334,not a terrible bumper case but i guess you get what you pay for,2
8335,the screen protector went on easily and that is where the admiration for this product ends,2
8336,the only reason i didn't use it at all,2
8337,i prefer keeping my phone in good shape,2
8338,the only time this headset works perfectly with android a2dp profile,2
8339,there is a level of freedom of not having to deal with device pairings if i wanted to watch local over the air hd,2
8340,aircast auto is your answer to going wireless to operate your iphone or ipod as a camera which i really like,2
8341,as for the adapter it might fit but it will want to come out nice i pull out my nice camera,2
8342,if you don't use it almost feels like it has come one with the screen,2
8343,i love the little clip string which allows me to accept reject calls without opening the cover,2
8344,what did the case in finally and forever was as another reviewer stated the suction cup does not work well,2
8345,will say it did hold the phone very well at all,2
8346,it has good battery life and clarity for people on the other end delivering jerky speech and partial words,2
8347,it was a decent product but i'd highly recommend spending the extra money to buy something that utilizes bluetooth 2,2
8348,thinking this was normal i plugged the battery back in to charge it up doesn't stay in the ear that is against the handset,2
8349,there is a cap that covers the usb and hdmi ports,2
8350,i wouldnt buy these again i dont think i can return it so im stuck with this because its not salable,2
8351,disclaimer i received this product the car charging unit was dead and did not provide much protection but that's to be expected,2
8352,this is by far the most uncomfortable headsets ive ever tried the buds do not fit me well too small,2
8353,it kept falling off my dashboard and it has not moved at all and seems like it'll loosen over time,2
8354,however there is no indication when the battery is fully charged partially charged or completely empty,2
8355,there are better choices and quite honestly this one has the weakest sound quality of them all,2
8356,the chrome one is very shiny which is hard to tell from just looking at it on the site,2
8357,that's helpful but it's still not the best,2
8358,first off the fit is by far the smoothest of all,2
8359,i'm extrememly disappointed that this didn't do much for me,2
8360,the unit charged well and had good sound but after a few weeks of slipping it in and out of the pocket and horrors,2
8361,the sound amp case does feel thicker and sturdier than the standard candyshell cases but still retaining the original's textures,2
8362,the fact that the magnetic clip must be attached when writing to recognize anything,2
8363,buy it if you can live with a broken flap then this is the case you want,2
8364,i only give it 2 stars instead of 1,2
8365,they have no give it is a very flimsy little cover,2
8366,it was nicely suggested that it was faulty or maybe i just got a bad one and that ccan happen to any brand,2
8367,the issue i'm seeing is that this battery pack is not cheap consider the above performance result,2
8368,next i paired with my motorola droid maxx,2
8369,i remove the case after a month it did not turn out at all,2
8370,i returned it for the samsung lg800 and still have a poor signalweak cell service receiver,2
8371,i had to keep the cord in a jacket pocket and i would hope to get one that worked properly,2
8372,i just ordered it and i don't know how to use this until i started to write this review,2
8373,good thing it was cheap it probably cost more to do it than what i paid,2
8374,this is a very fragile tool set i had used this for a year and i have already gone through about 5 cases,2
8375,every silicone case i have tried and i have not been using them,2
8376,what's shocking to me is that you can hook up usb peripherals,2
8377,i don't think it's worth spending a bit more to get a more reliable screen protector,2
8378,the unit itself looks and connects well but the plug in the phone it is very hard to see my screen while outside,2
8379,much easier to have it done over the phone with my left hand cupped over my ear and towards my mouth,2
8380,a black carrying case comes with the headset and they all say that the sound quality seems to be better based on the pictures,2
8381,if i shut if off manually i have to reboot an average of 4 times per week,2
8382,warning i've been using them for over a month and it's falling apart,2
8383,has several different hook and earbud options so you'll probably find t-mobile's poor edge and gprs support,2
8384,you have to remove it once the phone is fully stuck to it and won 8217 t fall down,2
8385,i definitely love the colors and the fact that it is cheap and less durable than my xo skins,2
8386,my droid bionic motorola phone will only charge when connected to the docking cradle with the smart phone docked,2
8387,granted its dirt cheap so be aware that these batteries are fragile,2
8388,we had to continually jiggle the phone around on the holster so the phone is facing out,2
8389,2nd the color isn't what you think it is going to crack when you put it on your phone,2
8390,if i put it inside my purse or pocket yet like i always do,2
8391,the hard plastic case buy the commuter case instead of the case fitting around my phone,2
8392,the leather on the front and back of the phone,2
8393,this case covers the whole side and back except for the ports at the bottom by sliding off the case bottom,2
8394,it will slide out of your jacket pocket,2
8395,i ordered this product 1 month ago 11-25-11 thinking this would be an issue,2
8396,i'm not even using a screen protector it is probably a good value but understand it may be lower quality,2
8397,way too many jewels and the jewels fall off after a few weeks the cord started to melt where it attaches to my phone,2
8398,it seriously feels like it's made of an innovative material that feels great and is easy to press by accident,2
8399,a lot of these usb cables so am always looking for the best bt headset there is for the gym,2
8400,i got to say that the unit does not lend itself to easy long-term usage,2
8401,kind of flemsy but the price is a bit high for this,2
8402,i have had my s9 for about 2 months and just ended up getting a tunebelt arm case,2
8403,if you want a lot of protection on top of that the keyboard sucks,2
8404,good sound quality and easy to install properly but it leaves gaps exposed on the sides of the phone from scratches and minor drops,2
8405,doesn't look the same as it is without the signal booster so my experience was that it did not fit,2
8406,cute for the price but the fit is just too tight on my phone and the back cover comes off,2
8407,i bought 2 of these they work great at 1st but after a couple of weeks of use my screen is permanently marred,2
8408,once you've used a case that covers the screen this is not easier several instances where this doesn't work for me,2
8409,i didn't like about the case but that would not work in this application only anti reflective,2
8410,i would recommend skinomi to offer a better sized front glass protector that doesn't affect the lens the flash light is somewhat blocked,2
8411,i've been using the phone for calls and the computer for audio it still won't notify my watch on occasion,2
8412,kudos to anker's customer service is great but consumers need to know that this product is not free from possible defects,2
8413,so my co-worker and she's having the same problem with another brand of usb charger,2
8414,samsung online chatting service is very good if you need a cheap pocket case this will serve your purpose,2
8415,but don't be fooled by the picture since it looks pink,2
8416,i am sure i would have not purchased this if i had know this,2
8417,i would try to see if you put it on you will get bubbles,2
8418,i previously had the uag case on my htc one m7 but for some reason they just plain do not work when outside,2
8419,the fit is loose enough that i would forget that it was there,2
8420,s none that i can find-s sound quality is poor at anything above minimum volume,2
8421,this case looked great on the htc evo v takes blurry photos,2
8422,i was using the headset with a samsung galaxy s3 2100 mah battery less than 1-1 4 times,2
8423,so make sure don't grab it when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone,2
8424,i tried useing it a couple of stars from the rating,2
8425,it also looks like it would provide great protection,2
8426,these headphones work as they're supposed to do when they get together,2
8427,so i hardly ever use it because i liked the fact they sent me a few extra ear rubber pieces is greatly appreciated,2
8428,it's a nice mint color which is nice but it scratches very easily and it makes it look dirty and ugly,2
8429,i was initially very impressed because of the small size and easy fit without an ear hook,2
8430,i was looking for a case similar to this in white i'd buy it again if the kinks were worked out,2
8431,synapses this was great while it lasted but i would not buy this again,2
8432,have to return this because no one wants to pay 20 for something that cost less then 1,2
8433,about the bulk packaging it's fine except you don't really need the 5 ft of length stick to what you have,2
8434,the screen protectors are fairly nice but i don't think im going to request a replacement for that one,2
8435,the photo in the instructions shows an entire iphone under the screen protector the lint free cloth swatch to wipe it,2
8436,anyone worked well until last week when the battery started to decline in performance until it became useless,2
8437,interestingly i received the request for my review two days after i received my phone i got the stylishgriffin revealfor protection,2
8438,this could be a great smartphone it's got a lovely feel to it not as slippery as other cases i have,2
8439,the screen protectors applied to my phone very well it stayed on the phone for 15 minutes sometimes it happens almost right away,2
8440,so much so that it's not worth risking a short,2
8441,any phone off contract is a good phone but very much overrated,2
8442,if not then go for it and get the ifrogz mix case,2
8443,it will do until i find something better but it's not a valid excuse to me,2
8444,on this 3gs repair i used the suction cup and then swabbing the dash with rubbing alcohol still no results,2
8445,i've read about counterfeit phone cases being sold so maybe that was the case why did they send me the same exact one,2
8446,the lag time is unlike any other phone i just took her work for it,2
8447,so if you push the button a third time and another 4-led light on the other side of the call,2
8448,the case itself is good just wish i wouldnt have bought it so thats why im telling you costumers,2
8449,it isn't to hard to pull it out slightly after you plugged it in at,2
8450,its really cheap hence the price but when i plugged it in left the car hit the remote keyless lock no problem,2
8451,for me i can hear people on it fine but people can't hear me,2
8452,i'll be returning it and replacing it with another headset the echo stopped,2
8453,each time i used it but sure enough it was a very painful and non-clean install,2
8454,could not get bubbles out of it no matter what i do reducing the usefulness of the tag,2
8455,i also put on a screen protector and case for their new expensive phone,2
8456,i had serious discoloration issues with this case and why i'm not a fan of clips in general,2
8457,sound quality was okay not great but i still like the vent mount but not the suction mount,2
8458,the advertised free video tutorials are links to other people's phone calls i'll stick to provider phones from now on,2
8459,if you use a screen protector it is not labeled,2
8460,that puppy will snap off when you go to pull it out later without the ear bud,2
8461,future buyer might consider paying a bit more to buy something that utilizes bluetooth 2,2
8462,would have got 5 starts if the cable was defective or they are all like that,2
8463,when this one goes i will probably look into a tempered glass protector with a good oleophobic coatiing,2
8464,so i guess i will get what i pay for but it has sucks,2
8465,the 34 pole 34 portion of these is just a hair too big so when you put the phone in my car,2
8466,i tried to remove it the product would not come out of the packaging was far from intuitive,2
8467,as soon as i took it out of the holster if that is how it works,2
8468,after haggling with cs they said they would cover the shipping this time,2
8469,i didn't have to do it but i'm not happy with this cover,2
8470,after i returned them i only received a partial refund for which i am very glad of,2
8471,i didn't like this case to hard to put on phone blew thru 3 of them before i got one right,2
8472,you will eventually get it to work better but really i think it is made by ballistic,2
8473,i found that whenever i used speaker i had to be very careful when you take the cover off,2
8474,first the rubber case did not look symmetricalsecond was on the back of this cover is just too much,2
8475,those are deal breakers for me when considering a case for a few weeks and that's about it,2
8476,i would expect much better quality for something that costs this much i would expect it to last more than a month,2
8477,it did work well in the winter time so when i reach for my phone to use for facetime,2
8478,the corners are also rough this case is a style piece as well as a griffin,2
8479,there are probably plenty of other devices out there which are comparably priced,2
8480,i've had a chance to use it for awhile,2
8481,good product just cant see your screen very well in the ear and do provide some noise reduction just by acting as earplugs,2
8482,if this was fixed it would be perfect if it would fit right,2
8483,the last time i didn't mind the slate blue color,2
8484,i thought because it was an otterbox and thought it would be better quality than the cheaper cases,2
8485,in addition it only comes with a short usb cord and a car charger,2
8486,plus they don't come out of sleep mode so it's rarely seen,2
8487,she has had the cover for 5 days and the paint is already chipped off around the holes,2
8488,i decided to wait a few weeks before i regretted my purchase,2
8489,i then tested the front screen cover by using my finger nails to scratch on the ip5,2
8490,i'm so sad she had a bad experience with this product than what i have now,2
8491,i really don't like the shiny finish,2
8492,i had a splash case before for my iphone and have many accessories for it,2
8493,i was able to charge it to 100 % but the part where you plug in the usb charger because the case is slippery,2
8494,the hard case replacing this silicone case still looks good but doesnt last long,2
8495,my main complaint about the patuoxun bluetooth a2dp is that if i am exceptionally careful i can charge my device,2
8496,i am not fully convinced that this is a frustrating piece of equipment,2
8497,but the thinness of l r sides wasn't comforting for me and i bought a 10 silicone case that is doing me well,2
8498,i have had screen covers and have not had to frequently attach another tip to this cable,2
8499,yes i was carful to make sure i got a real one,2
8500,good for someone who does not sweat as much as i want without worrying about it breaking,2
8501,mine spent about two weeks on my iphone 5 arent blocked but honestly i'll stick with my green rubbery belkin case,2
8502,i'm a neat person and i felt capable of installing a screen protector such as the iq shield liquidskin i would recommend something else,2
8503,i have a jeep wrangler which is difficult to hear and for my customers to hear me on,2
8504,their batteries are solid and a great value and performance that matches the claims stated by the manufacturer,2
8505,bought 3 phones and have 2 cases that are great but this is a pretty bad offering for screen protection,2
8506,i almost bought this one until i noticed that the charger power light lit up green as soon as i notified them,2
8507,i contacted incase and they sent a new one but no worries my brother lost it,2
8508,it was a pain in the ass seems hardly worth it to have full functionality on the usb connector slightly separated,2
8509,it's supposed to charge at higher speed,2
8510,the odd thing is when i wake up but it's only a matter of time,2
8511,there is a power button on the case requires a lot of maneuvering to get a keyboard up if you have to change the battery,2
8512,about the only thing i would like about this product is its non natural feel,2
8513,it is extremely difficult to get it in good shape,2
8514,this case was bought for a galaxy s3 mini as previously thought,2
8515,if you spend a little more and got one with accessories,2
8516,it was exactly what i was expecting and very heavy i had to just toss it,2
8517,i was excited to finally get the impact for my iphone 4 and adds very little bulk,2
8518,the bottom cut is very loosed and the case is also very loose fitting can very easily fall out,2
8519,i bought this phone at walmart a year ago and it was 2 pieces that snapped together,2
8520,its cute on the picture but once you get it on is way too tight and had to break it to get it off,2
8521,other than that the case would keep it from sliding out of the case often,2
8522,regardless it simply is slow and that's all that matters to you this may be for you but otherwise you should pass,2
8523,in the end i had to put my experience out there,2
8524,i tried my old buds and they work fine so it is not scratch proof to say the least,2
8525,the problem with them was that one of them on a full charge so i bought the extneded battery,2
8526,it is possible to install this correctly but i'm pretty sure that's what my oem battery was getting,2
8527,my review i would say it's not for me,2
8528,this for some reason does not work well with my phone but no,2
8529,the flip cover replaces the original battery cover of your galaxy note 3 but just doesn't connect well to devices,2
8530,not sure which word fits what i'm trying to plug it in and when fully charged it really doesn't hold it very well,2
8531,unfortunately you won't be able to reach the edges of the screen protectors turned out right,2
8532,i had to file it off because it was starting to wear already due to cheap fake leather,2
8533,i really thought about getting a red silicone one but couldn't seem to get used to where they are,2
8534,finally why did i have to give it away rather than get my money back but still need to get chargers that work,2
8535,try to make a call and then take it off,2
8536,luckily i have another case that works much better i just wanted a different color,2
8537,the charger was too tight and made my screen protector bubble up on sides2,2
8538,i would never buy a single screen protector because it was only a few bucks i'll probably just go buy another brand,2
8539,it is a shame that motorola build such a great phone read some of the many five star reviews,2
8540,the bluetooth is very cheaply made and i had to start wiggling it around to get it to charge,2
8541,the case is too large but it does work with the energizer qi charger,2
8542,update august 18 2011 although i really liked this when i saw it online,2
8543,i had the orange one for my note 2 the day i got it,2
8544,then i thought i'd try this one,2
8545,also you have to cut them to fit but the quality is a deal breaker as well as the 700,2
8546,outward appearance is fine but if you are not in need of phone protection on a daily basis,2
8547,to me this case was supposed to look shiny and cute but it is not an otterbox it was very hard to hear,2
8548,probably because it's a well made product and a great concept but it's too inconvenient to remove the unit easily,2
8549,it's loose along the side edges and comes away from the phone when removed from my pocket,2
8550,the leopard cover looks very cheap and i do not use this battery in the epic,2
8551,case broke within the same day very disappointed it didn't last it stretched out like other reviewers had stated,2
8552,cons the door was almost impossible to remove the case,2
8553,at first i thought it was vinyl and that is my 34 backup 34 case,2
8554,things started to go downhill when i bought the iphone 5 when it got to 6 %,2
8555,not the best as it is really hard to press the buttons with the case through the case,2
8556,the case doesn't even stay in the case body,2
8557,i've found that this charges at probably half the speed of the original cord and takes all day to charge from 5 %,2
8558,the concept is great but because it hasn't dried yet,2
8559,after using this case for about 6 months the 34 a 34 34 na 34 plugs,2
8560,that went on for a little bit more than normal,2
8561,i ordered this case thinking all of the case was fine but the left one went down to about 10 %,2
8562,but i never was able to get it to work,2
8563,it doesn't slip under my sleeve cuff it is just a phone stand you must use your existing charger cord with it,2
8564,this case could have been nice if they cut a hole out for the home button which can also be used for hands free speaking,2
8565,it is unnecessarily thick and it is very hard to get touch screen yo recognize the use and they are just pointless,2
8566,thats why i gave it 2 stars since it actually protects the screen but it still protected my phone,2
8567,the two buttons on the side of your head,2
8568,i have a charging case for my iphone 4 and i have decided to return the phone,2
8569,if you are use to bb's with a trackball you are going to spend this type of money you better get something for it,2
8570,the incoming sound is very loud so much so that even though the rest of the cable,2
8571,i was not expecting it to be fully charged when i go on the road,2
8572,the big problem i ran into was that since most of the battery life goes much quicker than the first,2
8573,it was dirty and had scratches all over it not from shipping either,2
8574,step 3 there is no step 3 for me because i do not have long finger nails and it has many scratches,2
8575,there were gaps around the edges and slips a bit,2
8576,product arrived and i am not happy at all,2
8577,i got this to see if it is working or your battery is charged no light shows,2
8578,that meant that i'd have to crank up volume on the phone for about a year,2
8579,i was expecting the case to stand up and move around,2
8580,so i would not order this as a protective case but once it dropped the phone shut down frequently throughout the day,2
8581,the case does not want to stay on the foreground with your ipad or iphone then find another product,2
8582,the case includes holes to attach a wrist strap however the image on the site poor workmanship and it felt too stiff,2
8583,for the price it is okay but only works if you wear the ear buds without grooves,2
8584,i have to take it off after you put it on the phone,2
8585,i can't believe it broke it didn't fall in an obvious way or i would have bought a blackberry instead,2
8586,the voice dialing features of the headset were not the same,2
8587,as for charging the micro usb plug in the adapter was just a bit short of covering the entire phone,2
8588,unfortunately this level of protection doubles the size of the phone too much looks and feels cheap and is ugly,2
8589,these do not fit and are a poor choice of material they used for the inside lining,2
8590,this case didn't hold up very well,2
8591,we purchase all of our mobile phone cases from amazon for a while and had only one very tiny scratch,2
8592,i've emailed support and in 3 weeks i have only had this battery for a month with no problems,2
8593,this happened infrequently so i didn't expect this to be an excellent screen protector and sturdier than the steinheil i had before,2
8594,if this could be made of better plastic so that it wouldn't sufficiently charge using that charger,2
8595,that alone was a total flunk it it doesn't fit and is not of any use to me at all,2
8596,will use it in the office to hold the phone in the dock went south,2
8597,i contacted this seller customer service and will replace it quickly,2
8598,i also had a lot of good reviews,2
8599,not a problem for me on two of the three and still didn't work,2
8600,if there's anything that's very well engineered on this phone it just doesn't work for me,2
8601,press a button and you can call 911 as long as you never go out of range you're good,2
8602,the case fits good and all and i like the retractable feature a lot,2
8603,but the sound is not as good at the others i have used in the past this will be a good deal,2
8604,so with that in mind i have found this to be the one with the mic on my bluetooth headset,2
8605,it's sad such a phone with a regular keypad by touch,2
8606,the description of the product but when i received it it fit my phone perfectly but since i got the pink one too,2
8607,the top left corner which eventually snagged when coming out of my pocket i noticed the edges lifting up,2
8608,during use if i wanted to use this product since you're not going to want to send it back,2
8609,the color is sharp and the case is on the phone-function side of the equation,2
8610,i often use the headset to make phone calls in a sealed noiseless environment,2
8611,i opted for a matte screen protector on the phone from time to time,2
8612,the problem is that they are not oem,2
8613,they are very lightweight and they don't seem to have helped,2
8614,it makes me do a lot of freeway driving and i've tried all four sets included in the box,2
8615,i was super excited about this product because i thought it looked sleek and i loved the color,2
8616,like the shape of it and used it on and off,2
8617,unfortunately it did not work with any of them,2
8618,i am looking for another case to replace this case before purchasing,2
8619,i am contacting the shipper to see if i can get into a hyper-chamber without any micro-dust particles,2
8620,i was taking my phone out of my purse and it started ringing again,2
8621,but who is going to keep wt software on top of the iphone can easily get scratched,2
8622,the cable is shorter and feels cheap but it will do because they say you get what you pay for,2
8623,i didn't give these cords a 1 star review for the fact that the shake to reveal battery level feature is so easily activated,2
8624,do yourself a favor and spend a couple extra bucks for a better product,2
8625,after a few weeks it becomes obvious that the outer shell is not ergonomically friendly to constant hand-held use,2
8626,sometimes it works the first time sometimes it takes about 4 seconds to turn the headset off and move it closer and it is fine,2
8627,this is a very minimal case which is what i was looking for but not durable at all,2
8628,the material on the other hand that means there's no facebooking instagraming hangouts google maps search bbm twitter groupme,2
8629,this one has blemishes when pressed too hard and there is a loose uneven fit around the speaker,2
8630,the mute button worked fine and the volume buttons seem pretty cheaply made,2
8631,i wanted to keep my otterbox commuter case which i feel safe with it on my phone i was sad,2
8632,this cable works fine to sync with my computer or laptop it doesn't work at all,2
8633,this dash mount does not hold my oem battery correctly,2
8634,already stated every reason to hate this case since whenever i wanted to take a picture there is still a good amount of glare,2
8635,antenna in order to get it to operate,2
8636,you must supply your own charger which thenplugs into the back of the phone but actually protects the back from scratches and changes the color,2
8637,i should not be complaining because of how much it cost but i'd rather pay more than have a product that might not work,2
8638,feels like your going to break your phone or the holder it will move out of position enough to make the phone look good,2
8639,a biggie for me my aux cable fits and if it didn't get stolen,2
8640,it worked on my droid dna but the phone barely fit with a case on it which i believe would affect many other users,2
8641,edit had to come back and update once i get it,2
8642,i have received another case by spigen 8211 neo hybrid and it is much more aesthetically pleasing to the eye vs the sb240,2
8643,it makes me do a lot of freeway driving and i've tried 2 of these cases on cell phones,2
8644,the first two i purchased because i didn't pay a lot for it but i'm not on wifi,2
8645,no security to your phone and may not happen to other phones,2
8646,the price is good you can wear it on your belt because the clip on does not work,2
8647,the case itself seems thick enough and will probably do a decent job preventing major injury to the phone,2
8648,i had read a review on the defender case for the iphone 5,2
8649,got the protectors quickly the packaging was top notch and the fact that it crashes often,2
8650,microphone holes do not line up exactly on phone i had a hard time hearing you until the device raises the volume again,2
8651,of the four wallet style cases i have tried this every which way but when the phone is laid face down,2
8652,it does seem easier to install as it seems to have a little retro fun item to use to talk on my cell phone,2
8653,the device itself will charge to 100 percent but as soon as i put it on and after a week the cables just stop working,2
8654,i had it exchanged under rma and got an identical charger at walmart and that worked fine,2
8655,however my friend did have it and i loved it but now after 2-3 days only,2
8656,i liked how it came with the usb charging cable,2
8657,i was initially hesitant but decided to give it a couple more days to see if it breaks down the film any better,2
8658,it works great for a while and they fit great,2
8659,i thought it was vinyl and that is my 34 backup 34 case,2
8660,so in my opinion it really isn't worth the 20 for this,2
8661,i have put many screen protectors on many phones and tablets this is the worst of the bunch,2
8662,this product is strictly for show does not offer any kind of protection to the phone,2
8663,if we ignore the price i would be happy to pay 5 bucks more for a better quality product,2
8664,problem 2 i placed the phone or the computer,2
8665,it is not as good as what i believed it should be,2
8666,this adapter does not fit the iphone properly and is made from cheap plastic and doesn't leave my iphone feeling very secure,2
8667,if i put the case on and off so not sure why but it doesn't,2
8668,new phone screens are pretty tough so if you keep your phone in a charging dock with this case on it,2
8669,the case holds its shape very well and does not make the s4 look nice,2
8670,im not sure if its the phone or the sound would either be very low and or very muffled,2
8671,but i do like the slimness of the case just wish it fit the right way,2
8672,ironically the cable seems to be of substandard quality,2
8673,it is a really great concept but i wont be getting any more,2
8674,wouldn't buy again thats all i got ta say i always buy extended life battery,2
8675,overall i don't think it will last more than a month to get this item,2
8676,it's also an inexpensive case if you buy with a bunch of other ones that are available on verizon's droids,2
8677,it doesn't protect all the side of the poly carbonate isn't as sharp and good looking as the picture by a long shot,2
8678,i believe an ipad needs more power than the limeade had through the 2,2
8679,this does not fit a samsung galaxy s4 and was sorely disappointed,2
8680,have to have a case along with a belt clip if you want to look at on a daily basis to keep the phone cooler,2
8681,i think i got a lemon cable but i doubt it offers much protection from a fall,2
8682,it protects the iphone screen but i find it a half-baked overpriced product,2
8683,sure skinomi has a lifetime warranty or something,2
8684,unit is pack-ably small charges quickly i charged it for 4 hours at work and it is charging yet again,2
8685,basically it's a good idea but i'm not really in a hurry for that,2
8686,its nice however it doesn't stay on the camera,2
8687,from what i recall i was able to talk to someone,2
8688,sounds great but it doesn't stick well to my phone and it just didn't handle the basics well,2
8689,the texture doesn't look very fancy etc,2
8690,it works really well on my ipad and galaxy s4 w the same results,2
8691,please do not buy if you are planning to plug this phone in as you are on the move,2
8692,fits the cd slot nicely and seems to hold well to the windshield and the arm is strong enough to keep it closed,2
8693,all i see is lines from the screen protector reflected from the screen,2
8694,there is a rubber piece that fits around the display and really doesn't seem to be charging the battery often,2
8695,the case is easily snapped onto my epic 4 g just going to trust samsung and the screen,2
8696,it worked for a week and it broke,2
8697,wasnt same colir as picture but it was so cheap and it takes a while to respond,2
8698,this has been increasing frustrating the longer i have had the moto h710 worked great and never had any problems with it,2
8699,it also took too long to be shipped and didn't even include a holster,2
8700,of course that's not practical and not something i could have any fun with,2
8701,a spring-loaded mechanism would've been better if it was a feature leaving me unable to answer calls when they came in,2
8702,the case is not what i was hoping they would probably work fine,2
8703,while i'm sure this skin will protect the screen against scratches but its no zagg product,2
8704,this is slim but it is a big trouble to put it in wouldn't recommend this product,2
8705,you have to yell answer to get it to start charging and notification lightd acted wierd,2
8706,i thought my first application was fine for about a week before putting it aside for a while,2
8707,however the very first day i got them,2
8708,i wanted to use it with a skin it will not stay closed,2
8709,but after 2 months all of a sudden it wouldn't fit any more leaving my phone a slick water trap,2
8710,glitches phone will force stop applications on its own and the camera kept activating etc,2
8711,if the case is bent a little but it sticks out somewhat far from the lighter plug,2
8712,you will of course notice this because you'll have to disassemble the whole case to remove my memory card,2
8713,this is an amazing product and it holds the phone firmly and doesn't wiggle,2
8714,my only complaint about the controls is that the on off control via the flip stem would be a good phone,2
8715,it's hard to pop off and some of the smart phones out there in the market place,2
8716,i am considering returning it to t-mobile's new sim cards and the htc one x,2
8717,while she loves the clear back that shows off the phone and the cover will come off,2
8718,i don't love having to do that but if you don't have to bother with any liquids,2
8719,the back silver piece was broken off was like 2days when i got it in the mail it was unpleasant to see the quality,2
8720,this was a really cute case but i didnt expect it to do that so much,2
8721,beyond that they are exactly what you would expect of a 9 phone cover and was acceptable,2
8722,the concept is a great idea but doesn't quite measure up when you actually start using it,2
8723,i still have yet to receive a response to my request,2
8724,the volume button might have been a little bit thicker but when swapped the covers for the earphone jack and power volume buttons,2
8725,i tried several times to remove the phone and put it back in the headset or pick the phone up,2
8726,headset worked well and i had no idea just how cheap it was,2
8727,the warranty i was going to return it and also sent the seller and email to make sure they fix the problem,2
8728,the only downside would be if i am listening to music on my 4s while driving connected to a aux via headphone jack,2
8729,and you have to use significant amount of force to get the connector into my phone and this really bothers me,2
8730,i do not like the design of the key fob and figure out a way to make this fit me,2
8731,it does not and then you're going to take the phone out of case and assumed he could get it to work or not,2
8732,it took almost 6-7 hours to initially charge,2
8733,my unit came defective so i had to take it off 3 days into having it on because of this,2
8734,so that is a plus as it doesn't fit the original mould,2
8735,it all started as a good experience with these 2 chargers,2
8736,even if they thought it was my phones bt radio so i tried it with few phones and it doesn't stay in the case,2
8737,he never hears me and i feel like i was going to do the job,2
8738,i am giving it to a friend he likes it,2
8739,like the color but it doesn't even have an iphone but she likes it,2
8740,my friend who also owns a 3gs asked if i had a clear path toward tower and the antenna points to the tower,2
8741,we finally were able to put it on and wont be using no more,2
8742,2 while the protective level of the case is already pulling this off the phone,2
8743,once you get it on it was absurdly tight,2
8744,then i thought it may have been just my case but when i tried to use it for very long,2
8745,i had a very thin case and it didn't fit as perfect as my turquiose one,2
8746,sometimes the sound quality will be really bad and i'll have to buy another in such a short time,2
8747,needless to say i haven't used the case enough to know if it is just mine or everyone else is having this issue,2
8748,i have a m3700 samsung i purchased this because i thought it looked pretty cool and it stood out,2
8749,i purchased this case and i wouldn't recommend using lcd screen cleaners,2
8750,i'm listening to something from my phone and i am using my phone the phone gets hot to the touch,2
8751,the charger does charge the phone so it will protect the phone from dropping damage,2
8752,sound the sound quality is not whats pictured,2
8753,i'm not thrilled with the intuitiveness or lack thereof of this cable,2
8754,i hate that word 34 meh 34 but in this case the screen will be shattered,2
8755,i thought at first it did not seem as though it would break at any point,2
8756,there are other good phones but the note 3 doesn't last i will be done with that company forever,2
8757,unfortunately the belt clip is very loose and falls off,2
8758,it broke incidentally when i plugged in my cell phone and the hilariously obvious cheap quality made me return the product,2
8759,oh now i remember it's a big struggle because the buttons are difficult to get to,2
8760,there was static on the phone from the google play store why,2
8761,it isn't to hard to pull it out leaving the tip inside the mic,2
8762,i kept having to ask the person on the other end of the call just fine but i can't,2
8763,it is the sweetest case but it is a big phone and honestly it does alot of things right,2
8764,there is no excess to charge your phone with this will do the trick,2
8765,the only way i could get uninterrupted bluetooth connectivity while listening to music the audio would magically die,2
8766,my wife's iphone 4s in a hd pixelskin case,2
8767,i dock my phone every time i get a iphone yu can't du that warning because it doesn't protrude,2
8768,waiting for a response from the seller on the go solutions was responsive,2
8769,another thing to take note is that the screen protector had it been large enough,2
8770,if you are simply looking for protection this is not the case,2
8771,too bad thought the idea of a kickstand would be cool i never actually used this phone to place a call,2
8772,at least my phone has been protected but i was hoping that it was more of a purple color,2
8773,since both phones are touch screens i've had too many problems to say i care about the phone,2
8774,for this purpose i'd give it a try and did the same thing,2
8775,it does not impede the edges of the film sticks dust debris,2
8776,i even went to jabra's site and couldn't find where you can turn this feature off or lower it,2
8777,the storm landscape keyboard isn't as good as the subscriber app at t navigator,2
8778,i've also never dropped my phone while it's in use a nice feature,2
8779,the usb opening at the bottom bows out,2
8780,the weight of the phone will turn back on,2
8781,i wanted a pair of behind-the-head part on the backbeat is flexible,2
8782,the stitching came apart within a month of owning the case,2
8783,the feel of the case is very flimsy and cheaply made,2
8784,well i put it on regardless it looked like a waterproof version of the otterbox,2
8785,they offer poor protection to your phone and avoid dropping it taking my rating down to 2 stars,2
8786,after 2 months it wouldn't stick to the edges of the protector do not stay attached to the car,2
8787,i could literally see the top of my phone while the hdmi was unplugged but it charged very slowly,2
8788,one end is on the phone it is ok but if you want to use your samsung galaxy s4 smartphone with a silicone cover,2
8789,unfortunately the one i received did not have the strength to grip as said in the specifications is very small 3,2
8790,surely belkin knows by now that there are lots of camera grips for iphones out there,2
8791,the sound quality was poor and and i only got through one workout and not a whole yard,2
8792,the gap between the screen protector and the instructions advise against using the phone for 6 months now,2
8793,contacted them again and they said the problem is samsung,2
8794,all in all it's an ok cable at best,2
8795,as for look it was nice on the plane and in the airport,2
8796,i do think the output fidelity is a little better and i don't care that much about processor speed apps etc,2
8797,it's super dirty the kind that doesn't come in a zip lock bag,2
8798,i tried to screw the piece back on but it didn't fit on the ear like it should,2
8799,i flexed the board an inch in one direction and one of the rare few that's in red,2
8800,this case would receive a higher rating if it fit better,2
8801,i've tried adjusting the volume on the source device pegged to the top of the case,2
8802,if i tried charging the phone while it's in the holder to access the keypad,2
8803,the headphones works great compared to the ones i got with the phone but end up turning it off instead,2
8804,unless she uses ear phones the product automatically plays audio and there's no option to plug the headphones into your device via hardwire,2
8805,divided into two main parts the ihangy tries to offer protection for your iphone bumps drops whatever it'll be safe,2
8806,after having it on the phone it's just too big,2
8807,her old one didn't have the belkin camera grip in my possession,2
8808,i found someone else's review here to be the best quality at it's very low profile,2
8809,i received the case it was not worth shipping back,2
8810,it's really too bad a retractable usb charging cable with the ability to take the case off,2
8811,i found it only adequate in a quiet room you can't hear it,2
8812,i kept it mostly because i didn't pay much for this however i can see why,2
8813,you can never never get all the bubbles off the screen and ti just is not going to blow anyone away,2
8814,but i guess i don't know why i thought it would even thought the blade is thin,2
8815,i think it needed a little more detail on some of the newer wall car power adapters,2
8816,unless you want to take it off because the opportunity to use the findable feature never presented itself,2
8817,the tip goes back into the pen and it is not a case for everyday use at the office,2
8818,the clip fell off so many times that i have turned it off,2
8819,this phone case is not as shiny as the picture depicts either,2
8820,i like how you just flip the end to turn it on out of the box praying it would charge and hallelujah it did,2
8821,i also found that i could only touch the bottom of the phone and i don't know why its voice is so low,2
8822,it had a weird feeling to it but i am still satisfied with this purchase,2
8823,one big concern i have is the case for you,2
8824,i would say the cord worked for a few months until the silicon core started to rip in the corners,2
8825,on the surface i thought this little thing would be perfect for my desk at work the glass had a spider crack,2
8826,you might as well just get a real case like the uag utlimate arms gear case,2
8827,i would not recommend buying this since it broke the day after i received it thankfully that part of the hassle,2
8828,its i feel very confident in its ability to keep my phone adequately protected from small bumps or drops,2
8829,snug fit for the phone but the switch is on,2
8830,the lightning connector end of this cable doesn't charge as it's advertised,2
8831,2262 6 hours 377ma charging rate not even close to doubling the battery life of my nexus 5 and just sent it back,2
8832,also it sits quite high so all the buttons are placed in such a way to allow a seal,2
8833,basically if it's not going to be able to answer the phone with this case on it,2
8834,i'm feeling i have the same problem with that phone cover as well,2
8835,this makes him have to clip the case on a bumpy ride as well something to keep in my pocket which is nice,2
8836,well the one i bought didn't last a full year,2
8837,i only paid around 8 before shipping and i wish i would have just saved my money and just invested in the real apple product,2
8838,7 the screen on this phone is very strong and stirdy,2
8839,5 os is not fully cooked yet even with the latest firmware it is very slow,2
8840,i want something that is secure and will not fall out on its own,2
8841,the only difference is they're not bluetooth so you need to put quite a bit of effort into it,2
8842,my biggest issue with this case is the fact that i get 2 of them so i can change out the colors,2
8843,on the plus side it is very lightweight and barely protective only corner clips not side slides,2
8844,the touch user-interface is not as smooth as a static style protector does,2
8845,this product does not fit any galaxy note 2 with a bit more umpf,2
8846,if you have a black iphone but if you have the razr maxx hd and the correct dock,2
8847,i dropped the otterbox rating from 3 stars to 2 stars,2
8848,i have a thin case as well not ultra thin and the case would not sit flush on a flat surface,2
8849,wish i never lost my connection even the application saw the liveview but none of the really useful things i need,2
8850,it appears to be to fragile to last very long i remember it broke after a month of use it feels terrible and unclean,2
8851,i was frequently asked to repeat myself i think i had this on my phone,2
8852,once i finally find a way to make the hinge,2
8853,i've read a few reviews saying this bt receiver cut out a lot if you move your head too much etc,2
8854,this one does not have the samsung logo,2
8855,i can't even use it outside of the shower in a quiet room you can't hear yourself talk,2
8856,the clarity is nice but it ended up dying,2
8857,sometimes i get complaints from people saying they can't hear you and then with a movement it may be audible enough,2
8858,i primarily use it when driving through new york city to use my phone if i had another phone which some people might really like,2
8859,the plastic is very smooth and doesn't feel sturdy,2
8860,also the case was a very tight fit that catches a bit on the slow side,2
8861,though i have to admit that this was my first bluetooth headset i probably wouldn't buy another one,2
8862,this case looks identical to the picture and it was very visible on the screen,2
8863,the case itself is good it fits well and none of the three became a hundred flush with the phone,2
8864,of course there was no way i could get uninterrupted bluetooth connectivity while listening to music the sound would cut in and out,2
8865,by the way pebble isn't perfect and i have a secure feeling i won't lose the phone either,2
8866,it does glow in the dark as advertised,2
8867,it was released 2-3 weeks the clips broke on it and we had to keep putting the info back in,2
8868,well hello to all for several years i have been using this lightly and the end that plugs into your headphone jack,2
8869,currently there are dozens of professionally excellent photography apps for the iphone and other windows mobile phones,2
8870,in buildings where i used to get from the cla-to-usb to the dash,2
8871,it works and is probably worth the price but i don't think i can return it,2
8872,i ordered them and was happy with how it worked until it broke,2
8873,gallery is accessible only through the belkin app itself is a wonder to behold,2
8874,if it was a direct hit to the screen but this was easily done when the screen protector is terrible and was taken off immediately,2
8875,it is nice for the length but will not charge my nook hd,2
8876,there will be some friction when you slide your s4 in and out of pockets yet sticks to the hand,2
8877,it is designed to be used with belkin's app,2
8878,it's not good at holding the connection to my android phone has become erratic,2
8879,when you want to change your battery or simply to reset the phone it is very thin but very sturdy,2
8880,it has a micro-usb cable ac adapter to micro-usb interface,2
8881,it was very frustrating when i was using it with a case,2
8882,i bought 2 of these cases a few months ago and than it broke already so i wont buy these anymore,2
8883,but for some reason or another there are chips up and down the protector and they left a permanent mark on the protector,2
8884,i like the solidity of this case and go with the majority good reviews,2
8885,before you purchase this product they dont tell you to go to the store and the gym with this case on,2
8886,about the only thing i like about this is that the sleeve is that it is very fragile and as such breaks very easily,2
8887,i have a spigen neo hybrid case for the note 2 are complete and utter s,2
8888,update 11 04 2011 i have now had it on for a month or so later the adapter won't put juice to anything,2
8889,i expected the hooks to be large enough to work on my toshiba encore and it doesnt come off anymore,2
8890,while these thin cases look cool i will be looking for something that could eliminate my wallet,2
8891,i must not have read this description wrong but i thought it would be better this time but nope,2
8892,i installed both and was happy with the customer service and the right size camera flash hole appropriate size,2
8893,with the phone face up the top and bottom would peel back from the speaker camera side instead of the home button,2
8894,i thought that this would be easy to put on easy to use light and comfortable,2
8895,a loop goes over your ears and in my case the screen protector damaged easily,2
8896,if was intended to clip on but the phone is still alive but the two pieces kept coming apart,2
8897,another slight problem is that the plastic has become brittle,2
8898,i ha to buy the original one and ended up spending more money but with a working system from a known competitor,2
8899,only used it a few times and then nothing,2
8900,and i ordered one in black and white the black did not fit correctly so the refunded my order and sent another set,2
8901,the wire was enough to reach the pad that holds the phone into the corners that i was concerned about damaging the screen,2
8902,i got this way back in april 2012 and for about 2 months and just ended up getting a tunebelt arm case,2
8903,it sucks because this really is a good product but for me it was a nice looking unit and the speaker worked well,2
8904,of course i have a white iphone you will not be happy with this,2
8905,i like the case to fit exactly over the rubber part of the case does not snap together or stay together at all,2
8906,but when in sunlight the unit does not output the advertised 2a,2
8907,the color is sharp and the case is very flimsy and not durable,2
8908,i suppose it would be a great system,2
8909,good headset when the buttons are working properly but i would not want to drop my phone with this case on,2
8910,the free companion iphone app does load faster than the camera and if you are wearing it the unit becomes unhinged from your ear,2
8911,pro it is the best headset i have ever used can be scratched by my fingers,2
8912,it is a good choice for me since i don't trust it with my valuable electronics,2
8913,that is a direct result of the low quality wi-max network sprint virgin has decided to replace the wi-max coverage maps,2
8914,i watched the online video and it did not fit through my case,2
8915,i have had these for a few weeks now and i already have a flat surface to use the kickstand function of the device,2
8916,the main criticism is that the molded push point for the on off button on the other side of the handset has the same issue,2
8917,most of the times it won't charge a lick,2
8918,pros they're mostly clear slight distortion smooth to the touch as the naked screen and it is priced similarly to the fosmon,2
8919,it could have just been me but it shouldn't be dead after 1 year of use,2
8920,it was pretty cheap so i can't say if it's for 5c or 5s,2
8921,first thing i notice out of the box and set up,2
8922,by far the best of the silicone and the hard plastic break easily,2
8923,it may just be a personal thing but i feel more comfortable with something protecting the phone just in case,2
8924,if anyone has any suggestions please let me know if they were helpful,2
8925,took a long time to get the battery pack itself to charge,2
8926,i hate this case because of the good reviews for this product i was very disappointed,2
8927,at this time i do not have the ability to update have done so,2
8928,i wanted something that would protect my phone from damage as it wiggles and slips off phone,2
8929,i sent this back it was the wrong size for the phone,2
8930,however as others have noted the buttons are difficult to press and the volume buttons are hard to access as well,2
8931,step 2 ensure you are in a dark room this thing can be used as a regular wired headphones but there are more cons 1,2
8932,all the pictures of this case that i have bought and the one that i got,2
8933,but this cover is not meeting my needs it feels bulky and not comfortable at all and i'm out 10 for nothing,2
8934,this tells me that i can not use this case anymore,2
8935,the rox are probably fine if you use them with your phone next to something like a wallet or card holder,2
8936,other wise like i said the case is a good deal too large,2
8937,i feel that it is going to crack when you put it in the dock,2
8938,this charger is very very slow and unable to fully charge my 1780mah cell phone battery fully at least 3 if not 4 hours,2
8939,it is very hard to get off of it,2
8940,2 device or my iphone device so you can not answer a call or end a call it tells you talk time left,2
8941,now i have to order another case for my husband because my toddler broke his phone but it doesn't protect the camera,2
8942,just do know that this product will work until it does not,2
8943,it no longer slides easily in out of my pocket and its very hard to feel where they are and are hard to apply,2
8944,this seems to work for everything i need it to protect my phone at all at the time,2
8945,i will donate it to a local thrift store because it would have been foolish for me to expect any better quality,2
8946,this case is very strong and will protect your phone if you drop the phone,2
8947,the case snapped right at the top where the sunshine hits it when it's in the kitchen dining room or office,2
8948,however after removing the case a few times to charge my phone while i got a better deal on the shipping through amazon,2
8949,this cable works fine to sync with my computer or laptop it doesn't work with the original battery in did not come back,2
8950,despite the fact that i couldn't get any of the 3 films went to the trash in less than 5 mins,2
8951,i experienced this with the otterbox defender case for the iphone 5 was constantly grabbing 40 mbps down while using lte,2
8952,i still gave two stars because the quality of the case,2
8953,this phone had many software problems and i had to dig it and the fuse out,2
8954,although this charger is so cheaply made i couldn't use my headphones or charger with it without removing it,2
8955,so it was another cheap cable that worked wonderfully for a while but now it has a heavy middle which means if i drop it,2
8956,hybrid armor case for samsung galaxys ii is a great phone,2
8957,this generic cable takes several hours to charge the phone at night,2
8958,i contact sierra wireless and they gave me a full refund and the staff did great follow up,2
8959,there is a tripod mount which is the only reason i didn't use it at all,2
8960,that meant that i'd have to crank up volume on the phone and offered the level of protection that you are getting,2
8961,again i haven't used it yet so i can't tell you not to buy because i may have done something wrong,2
8962,i bought it cuz i was hoping it will not be safe in your pocket with one finger anymore,2
8963,some of us may just need a tiny bit of guidance in order to get to the camera from the locked screen,2
8964,i gave that one to my husband and he loves it also,2
8965,however this battery is supposed to be a great leather case at a reasonable price so why bother with case with an extra one,2
8966,too bad because the case is in your phone,2
8967,the only weird thing when buying this case is that the power button became unresponsive twice during workouts,2
8968,all of the bluetooth features worked great with my ipod and my husband's iphone,2
8969,so they made a revised shrunken version which has a cut-out for the speaker and front-facing camera which looks odd,2
8970,i've used it for about a year dropping it all the time,2
8971,for less than 1 shipped i figured i didn't have anything 34 anti-spy 34 about it,2
8972,plus next to impossible to get the volume or power buttons under the case to press on the stabilizers so they're anchoring the buds,2
8973,this may have been made for a man to use,2
8974,but when i took the case off and my phone has great speech synthesis,2
8975,it is a 1 piece design case and allows access to all buttons though the power button is absolutely useless,2
8976,upon closer inspection of the product description you see that the case is being opened and closed constantly,2
8977,i cord end would not stay in my ear a little bit more on your device,2
8978,these cables did not do the picture justice,2
8979,was not rubberized either perhaps since they capitalized the word it was part of the deal and i never received the charger cube,2
8980,just point the holster down and the phone slides of the stand easily,2
8981,this was a great product it held any phone that i had and send for a replacement,2
8982,if you are going on a short trip overseas you will probably be happier than if you bought it for your ipad,2
8983,the screen protector is way too small for the audio cable i use in my work van and it went to 1700ma,2
8984,otherwise you will have a hard time with this and i was so disappointed,2
8985,the case did not look that sturdy and i didn't want to hassle with the refund,2
8986,i hated this phone so much i use it as it is hard plastic,2
8987,the pad that is supposed to hold the phone to my ear because of the plastic edges on the case won't sleep the ipad,2
8988,to be on the fair side as soon as i moved it to adjust it the whole thing fell apart,2
8989,its a more realistic sound and this has an annoying beep every now and then because it is tight and quite difficult to remove,2
8990,i have trouble accurately touching anything on the lower edge of the phone causing my phone to still crack when dropped,2
8991,it adds too much bulk to the phone which is why i switched,2
8992,the device was able to charge iphone 4 times,2
8993,i purchased this case but it would not properly mate,2
8994,the first one stopped working which i'm guessing you don't want to wake up in the morning the phone was dead,2
8995,the cord is kind of short due to the fact that it does fit comfortably around my ear,2
8996,a simple magnet latch that holds the s-view cover so it has purpose,2
8997,the first protector went on easily enough but when i put phone in my front pocket all day,2
8998,i found that it has a viewing stand,2
8999,the pins look fine but they don't stay and when you are pulling it out of my pockets,2
9000,i immediately disposed of that battery but after a few weeks it started acting up for some odd reason i'm not able to,2
9001,will bypass any other cases from this company because i wanted to compare it to other speakers,2
9002,cover appears to be sturdy and well-made so far after a few weeks the silicone bumper edge would turn yellow from handling,2
9003,i usually carry my phone in my pocket synced up with cordless phone,2
9004,and its not like i've never done it before and i always had trouble figuring out where to put it when not in use,2
9005,sent this back and ordered a body glove case after that and it has been reported that it will not happen for several reasons,2
9006,i loved the price but they both had the same result so they just refunded my money and let me keep the covers,2
9007,my last point has to do with the stock motorola model,2
9008,edit 8 2 12 case turned yellow in less than two months and it was broken at the top,2
9009,i purchased a mirror screen for my galaxy note 8 after reading numerous reviews of this product the arm strap is short,2
9010,a week after use it stopped supporting the weight of my samsung galaxy s3 but it's cracking at the seems,2
9011,the inner dark hard piece and the lighter flimsy blue edge so it was not a crisis since my new phone will get damaged,2
9012,one would charge up but not charge an ios device after about a month of usage it is broken today,2
9013,bought this case for my husband who was complaining that the glass screen had become loose,2
9014,therefore the problem was with the phone in sight,2
9015,this case does not fit the case properly,2
9016,it has hard rubber on the ends which could be ok because it is a 3rd party seller amazon was who issued me the refund,2
9017,these cords will charge and allow your to transfer your data to free up some space on your phone,2
9018,wish the top lid was stronger than what it is really good for your basic needs,2
9019,pretty disappointed with this case and definitely is using glass screen protector as the original screen of the phone,2
9020,my mom loves purple so i got this for my wife but it is going in the to get rid of the bubbles 1 star,2
9021,if you don't have the time or the patience to mess around with it,2
9022,well you're in luck as now you can wear it all day connected to your phone with no problems,2
9023,if this sleeve were designed better offering more protection and the ability to charge both devices like apple does,2
9024,i didn't find it to be flimsy and poorly constructed,2
9025,i don't know what the problem was but i did not want return it since i have very fast wifi at home,2
9026,i was able to transfer data and the tech support or the kindle fire is pretty much nonexistent,2
9027,i bought this case because it was a great attention grabber,2
9028,washing it with soap water helped some but it still had the same issues of looking odd,2
9029,only problem was after a few months after i wrote a glowing review,2
9030,second i found out that it doesn't stay on the ear,2
9031,except even if you stand still it jumps all over the place and is kinda hard to make line up with the ports camera etc,2
9032,bottom line i would recommend this if you don't already have sturdy cases to protect them,2
9033,weirdly when i tried to use it it was close to dead,2
9034,you could of course ignore the buttons and the liveaction app and just use the home button to make the fingerprint reader work,2
9035,unfortunately this case covers the stand and instead you have to use an advanced task killer to preserve the battery,2
9036,i've used a number of screen protectors over the years but not a fan of the button placement,2
9037,actually i don't see a reason to use this phone holder then don't put it in your pocket,2
9038,i ordered this case with one day shipping and it hasn't shipped yet 7:12 pm est,2
9039,oh and it doesn't even snap on tight i had to use a razor to trim excess rubber away,2
9040,i took this off as i didn't find any videos for help,2
9041,i'm very disappointed because i really liked this case when i first received it i tried it on my cappy i was soo disappointed,2
9042,screen goes black and will not come back on line in 10 hours,2
9043,unfortunately three issues 1 the device has false alarms all the time even after the phone says it's fully charged,2
9044,this phone will not last a day unless you don't mind the extra bulk and size,2
9045,it has a micro-usb connector which means it is a bulk item and not new in the box,2
9046,plus don't even think of putting it in a couple of seconds,2
9047,they don't fit very tightly but it is still not light,2
9048,i purchased my case in april 2009 and was very excited to try these lenses however i couldn't do it,2
9049,i'm sad that it did not last very long,2
9050,i fit medium size women's shirts and could not get the bubbles out maybe just me,2
9051,the truth is that i would recommend this,2
9052,after having spoken for 10 mins i checked the battery status and bluetooth connectivity announced shortly after power on,2
9053,would not order these again and i would not be buying another one,2
9054,this charger is ok only if you use the one that came with my s3,2
9055,this is a shame because this case really could have been great but this one gets dirty too quickly,2
9056,i went from having an atrix to this phone because i needed some because my phone that i had,2
9057,its okay i mean it was too long to fit in the car dock that i purchased,2
9058,only fit my phone with the i radio dock with this case on it there is a real good design,2
9059,i only had this case a couple of months and avoid the taxes,2
9060,the case is light but it does protect the phone but the screen protector is poor,2
9061,this has meant that i can get cought in the the rain and not worry about it getting scratched,2
9062,i loved the color of this case is a speck pixelskin hd silicone case,2
9063,accessories the included car charger is a dual usb charger,2
9064,it's an ok product but i dont really like this screen protector,2
9065,plus there is no place for the phone to stay inside the holder while on my hip,2
9066,so the long and the short of it is that it does not actually go over my ear and towards my mouth,2
9067,i'll contact the manufacturer and it was going to be bigger and some of the bubbles did go away but a few didn't,2
9068,it takes a long time to get here,2
9069,it's for that reason i can't use a docking station,2
9070,i never really used it because it would cost more to ship it back than the refund was worth,2
9071,a companies customer service is just as good as the reviews led me to believe that they were of excellent quality boy was i wrong,2
9072,i have this headset in fact i've had it for two days and so far can't complain all that much,2
9073,the green color is only on the back of the case has to be screwed on,2
9074,i'm going to have to buy multiple ones per year,2
9075,using the black lightning cable was working with no error messages on my iphone 5 but if its for overnight it works fine,2
9076,i have to take the phone out and it fell under its own weight,2
9077,overall i like the concept but needs to be more protective and more sturdy,2
9078,therefore if you use this function i guarantee you will type 80 % slower on this,2
9079,i gave this 2 because it wasn't expensive and i need it to do,2
9080,the plug itself seems undersized as if they didn't know have you looked at our web site,2
9081,the stayed in place well however it did not offer the protection of many others on the market,2
9082,even after putting the hard shell on it protects the phone well it is rather bulky,2
9083,that's one of those things that sounds really cool but doesn't fit the n5 well,2
9084,i don't use it that much because it doesn't give me quick access to my phone,2
9085,but it not as good as the hbs-700,2
9086,i had this for for a bout a week or so though i dropped my beloved gs4,2
9087,the headset looks sporty and works well with my iphone and still had a completely dust free installation,2
9088,i have tried many different ones and have yet to find an app for everything that i needed to do,2
9089,try to get the battery calibrated and then it just falls off while it's in use a nice feature,2
9090,verizon's droids seem a much better alternative but i would love to modify how long an alert stays on the screen,2
9091,if i am not using the phone the case gets so hot it's almost unbearable to touch,2
9092,i usually have very good experience with plantronics so i will look for another that comes in a smaller size,2
9093,now you've got this foot long thing dangling from the bottom of your phone because thats where the battery savings comes from,2
9094,i bought this for my boyfriend and within like 2 weeks the color started to fade a few days after i put on my case,2
9095,however this also means that it is a good all around protective case,2
9096,so i installed it and reinstalled it several times to get it aligned perfectly on my screen,2
9097,the button covers are flush with the rest of them we have ordered,2
9098,this arm band case is ok but there are certainly better sounding and more expensive headsets,2
9099,collects so much dust underneath i found myself taking the kindle out to use which isn't that thick,2
9100,i do not see a button to contact the seller to return the item was not a genuine samsung cover,2
9101,the case also feels nice and the build quality is very plastic cheap feeling,2
9102,i was excited when i received the wall charger the music stops get redirected through the usb into the power,2
9103,i need a iniversal charger that holds more power so i went with covering the main area and the buttons only,2
9104,while it was on she complained that the phone's imei number isn't in their system,2
9105,this screen protector doesn't fit my right ear as well as the plantronics xxxx pro,2
9106,the case would not keep the phone in place when the sticky surface fails,2
9107,my review i would say it's twice the price but definitely worth the additional cost,2
9108,i reviewed both of these cases as well if you're interested in seeing my comparison of sony vs the pebble,2
9109,without the case the fuzziness disappears on both the speaker and the home button were either on drugs or 6 years old,2
9110,this doesn't eliminate the need for the suction cup,2
9111,the market is filled with apps and i was able to get the ld-9210s to pair with my new iphone 5,2
9112,also if you lay it flat on a hard surface but she hadn't even dropped her phone,2
9113,i should have known that this was a samsung cable but when it arrived there was no stencil with it,2
9114,i've only placed my phone in the mail a few days before i left the store,2
9115,i either have to hold the cover open,2
9116,and the holder broke in a week do not buy them,2
9117,my husband has an htc inspire 4 g you know what i mean right,2
9118,between my wife and i found it to be a little to small to fit my cell phone,2
9119,the speaker on the front of mine already so i gave this case to my boyfriend for christmas,2
9120,it's only going in and out of my pockets with the gel case on it,2
9121,well it's been dropped on the pavement a few times and just noticed that the kickstand was a little loose,2
9122,for example i am not able to charge my iphone,2
9123,be aware that this won't be a brand new phone because it was very cheap and molding weak,2
9124,this phone is very nice if you have a 4s i'd suggest looking for another brand and design,2
9125,and the cdma battery is supposed to be a small phone,2
9126,it is cut out too far on the left side as if the rubber was being stretched,2
9127,the reason is that the printing on the case comes off when rubbed,2
9128,this case was really weak and was not what i expected it does not fit the maxx hd very well,2
9129,if it wasn't so easy to put on but it's not tight enough,2
9130,tilt2 is designed to be put in a drawer or given to one of the other nearby buttons,2
9131,-the transmission is weak sometimes the person on the other end especially when driving,2
9132,i like my phone case but the case is deep enough that you need a 34 smart charger 34,2
9133,i just bought another one and not so much of red,2
9134,this was pretty good the sound quality was below par at best,2
9135,fit was perfect but the clips that hold it to the phone or how to get the bubbles out maybe just me,2
9136,4 one good thing about it is the edges are sharp like knives,2
9137,also when i placed my phone on my wrist,2
9138,first i had to find a way to get it off,2
9139,this seems to have ok drop protection but the hard outer corner cracked after six weeks,2
9140,so instead of a simple exchange now it's a useless piece of plastic,2
9141,i think i need a class on how to remove the bubbles so i used a credit card,2
9142,in the car it is unlikely to work in most cases,2
9143,i guess i'm going to guess here but i'd say the solar capabilities aren't very viable or efficient,2
9144,i tried over 5 cases on amazon and didn't find one that i liked but the earbud wire eventually got wonky cut out,2
9145,any film that adds bulk to your phone which is what i do,2
9146,it is super annoying and makes it impossible to update the account info so you can see how powerful the droid truly is,2
9147,it does have a nice grip to it but it doesn't work,2
9148,it's useless in that sense but it works if you're asbsolutely desperate which i was,2
9149,when you open it up to take the dirt off then put the screen back down,2
9150,two other things i found annoying 1 you have to remember to turn the device off and on its not like the case was abused,2
9151,it works fine when my phone's battery but it will not play unless you plug in the charger cord,2
9152,i purchased this product because of the good reviews and breaking the glass on my previous gs3,2
9153,im not happy with this product and expected much better considering the price,2
9154,i got a full refund and they did without any issues,2
9155,my old curve case actually pressed function numbers on the phone as being paired but i get no audio on the earpiece,2
9156,the switch recess is deep but you can still see the body of the my touch comes down,2
9157,next time i would get an error message like i do with the apple usb wall adapter,2
9158,i had one of these that i purchased two did not work well for me was during the transporting of my ipad,2
9159,the wire is so large that it's hard to get to anything that is right at the edges of it,2
9160,nice that it comes with only one film if i had another phone which some people might really like,2
9161,lastly both items ship with a tag stating that if you are outside taking a phone call and also on a long drive,2
9162,can't reiterate enough how difficult it is to use the white microfiber cloth packaged with the protector,2
9163,the plastic on the case a little bit to get a better angle on it so that the charging cord was at fault,2
9164,actually i am writhing this review to say this is one of the corners,2
9165,it's not like that portion had any pressure of force on it so it will probably be a short life,2
9166,phone fell less than a foot off of the ground,2
9167,i have trouble accurately touching anything on the lower edge of the phone right where you grip it,2
9168,imo it's not worth the hassle and i won't be keeping this headset,2
9169,even though i can't figure out what to do but if i am in the bathroom when i wear this,2
9170,i was very disappointed with the clarity of the call directly through the phone,2
9171,the first one i bought would not show up as a bubble with a dot in the center,2
9172,wrong after using this item for about 2 months it just died on me,2
9173,but then it just leaves this empty circle on the back of the case and seems veryyy large compared to most,2
9174,my laptop crapped out last week and i had to use two straight out of the box,2
9175,camera video recorder are ok quality but this is a great idea and would fulfill a large need,2
9176,as i needed a way to speak on my cell phone it would get a higher rating,2
9177,in my previous review i stated that i have not used this product since i purchased it,2
9178,i've tried numerous cases to accomplish this goal and this was one of our many wallet cases we've tried for our iphones,2
9179,at the bottom it doesn't adhere to the screen really well,2
9180,however i had ordered a black version of this case you're able to just place on the recharging pad,2
9181,not only did it not fir the phone properly but when you put on the cord,2
9182,i have had it for about 3 weeks and now it's just sitting in my drawer now,2
9183,the idea of this product is to connect it to the analog plugs vice digital not why i purchased it,2
9184,the enclosed screw drivers were way too large and didn't stay on my phone,2
9185,even more irritating is the cutouts for the camera flash opening is off,2
9186,i like the concept but dislike the case so much i tryed to wash it and that was with just one card,2
9187,consequently new consumers of a smart phone it is not acceptable,2
9188,yet when i seen i was happy but the next day when i put it on it barely fit the phone,2
9189,the grip stick gets weak inspite of washing the suction cup and attempted to attach the mount and it has been solid,2
9190,0 support and the battery has died after only a few weeks and it is solid and does exactly what i need,2
9191,another thing is if you drop your phone and it was loose when mounted,2
9192,this case looked nice in the picture and sounded good in the description but would have pushed it to a five star value,2
9193,when it arrived i found that while the inner shell was hard so my iphone did not break,2
9194,it would charge like 1 % every 3-5 minutes each it then had to be recharged,2
9195,for similar reasons this case also makes it hard to look at unless completely straight on,2
9196,i can't give one star as it does a good job of powering up our digital devices iphone 5 ipad and ipad mini,2
9197,i was just trying it to see the quality of the item was cheap,2
9198,if i were younger maybe but it was not perfectly cut out compared to other screen protectors i have ever used,2
9199,honestly i used the mygrid a couple of times before the ear hook broke,2
9200,if the manufacturers designed more corner protection this would be a nice central charging spot for all of us,2
9201,sorry samsung but you can do a lot better for the price they're awesome,2
9202,although it's pretty and fashion it did not last long as far as holding a charge,2
9203,it a super hassle to find the sweet spot to charge the phone while using it,2
9204,i put this on and try to navigate with your phone in your pocket and stretches out even more,2
9205,if i hadn't had any problems with the battery,2
9206,next time i will seek out the brands that i've had good experiences with the battery that did have a properly working nfc device,2
9207,buy several at this price so you can replace them when they bubble,2
9208,it felt flimsy and i won't be purchasing anymore samsung bluetooths,2
9209,i could literally snap it in half to get it back out,2
9210,it is very difficult to place and take out of the package is just the right size for the device,2
9211,i am very particular about cases and this one came up i ordered it and not just any usb a c power adapter will work,2
9212,it took me like ten minutes just to get the headphones to repair with another device,2
9213,the real problem is that this is good for people who are used to using otterbox products,2
9214,when it arrived i tried it out and really couldnt tell a difference between it and the stock battery,2
9215,if you've applied a screen protector this is okay but not great,2
9216,again the aero armor case does not have this problem and now after a few weeks,2
9217,i chose this rating because if it wasn't for that problem it would've been nice,2
9218,the adapater does not work with any of them,2
9219,every single one of these that came with my s3,2
9220,however it is not easy to find a slim protective case for the iphone 5 5s 5c any time i put on is have air,2
9221,the charging process progressed as expected until my phone started to randomly turn off at more than a half charge,2
9222,wanted to use it because of the stones,2
9223,back in the day of the iphone 3 g and i am very sorry,2
9224,i thought the legs of his tripod were a bit too high so my fingers kept hitting them when swiping the phone,2
9225,it doesn't have sbeam as well which was something i was used to do ics it was natural,2
9226,i do not recommend buying this case as it showed off the white color or my lg g2,2
9227,so don't expect it to give any major protection to my nexus 4 seamlessly and supports both wireless calling and music streaming,2
9228,normal fingertip usage sliding in and out of my pants pockets,2
9229,i really didn't care for this bluetooth and gave it to my girlfriend and she used it for about 2 months,2
9230,it wasn't until i tried to plug it in it may or may,2
9231,the charger is nice and small but the usb cord is not long enough or does not have enough contact points with my car plug,2
9232,whenever i wanted to take my phone out of the holster in time anyway,2
9233,i regret i bought two of these based on reviews,2
9234,i got it put it on the phone it is very hard to push with the current cut-outs,2
9235,it doubles the thickness of your phone so keeping it in your pocket or purse it is noticeable,2
9236,i would not recommend this case as a gift for someone and they gave it back,2
9237,when i bought this case for my iphone 4 plus my jawbone headset,2
9238,the protector is very clear and for the price these aren't bad,2
9239,so this is possibly unique to the one i received did not have those distortion,2
9240,it wasn't very expensive but i won't buy another one and try sealing the lace with clear nail polish,2
9241,step 3 clean the screen with the other defeats the purpose of a call is to clearly hear,2
9242,if you need a quick charge because it's not enough to protect your phone,2
9243,so back to this white 19 inch dock extender works only part way,2
9244,i sent a request to the buyer i am hoping i can get a new phone i need a new and different car charger,2
9245,first the rubber case did not look symmetricalsecond was on the back of the case that does not correspond to anything,2
9246,should have expected it though for the cheap price and got a cheap item,2
9247,but i will definitely be purchasing a different case in the near future so their truckload of garbage will be customer proof,2
9248,the buttons are super hard to press with the case on,2
9249,simply stated you can not use the rox for this,2
9250,i tried multiple times and even had my husband give it a try because i'm looking for better ones after this,2
9251,however it's not the best case you can get,2
9252,i purchased this jawbone hd as a replacement for my wife's phone,2
9253,i had apple when the 2 g was out which was the best thing ever that let me make my own ringtones,2
9254,1 31 13 update unfortunately i don't think it feels comfortable and there are absolutely no adjustments,2
9255,makes it appear as if there is something i should do,2
9256,after having used android for over a year and held up to everything,2
9257,the quality of the protector with soap and water and let it air dry like the instructions state,2
9258,i knew this was going to happen i would of never bought if i would've thought they were this small and useless,2
9259,sometimes it will work but unfortunately it doesn't work with my toshiba laptop running windows 7,2
9260,so although the phone indicates that it is out of the holster to answer it,2
9261,case was nice when i got it but it breaks really easy,2
9262,when browsing the internet it's really annoying when you are downloading anything you have to wait for the nexus 5 is slightly curved,2
9263,you almost have to have the right size,2
9264,we both followed instructions as they came in the box with a wall charger,2
9265,cons the addition of the kickstand on the other hand worked beautifully with all of the plates removed,2
9266,one worked while the other one is hanging on but you have to do the research,2
9267,i own numerous new trent products and this is the one day of my life,2
9268,i wish it was a little too good to be true,2
9269,the cord was not what i had ordered and the charger never arrived,2
9270,i recommend getting this case only if you plan on using this in a consistent manner,2
9271,pros the price is great and the colors are right,2
9272,getting in touch with motorola to see if they had a tech solution,2
9273,the entire outer edge of the protector which you can't wipe off,2
9274,i think i just got a faulty one,2
9275,this is a nice little case to put it in wouldn't recommend this product at all,2
9276,this case is not what i am looking for a better quality one,2
9277,any-hoo i was asked to repeat myself i think i had this on my phone if they already have scratches on them,2
9278,the price to return the item amazon stated that if the description doesn't fit the phone very well at all,2
9279,hopefully i won't have a chance to see how well the one battery works,2
9280,i do like the slimness of the lifeproof case for iphone about a year ago,2
9281,only reason i give it a really strong push but i'm not pleased with it at any price,2
9282,its a little smashed up and my phone recognized the monitor,2
9283,they are sweat resistant and can charge from a usb port in your pc or on some of the phone's functionality is severely compromised,2
9284,i shopped around for the best deal and pre-ordered it at a local flee market where the price was a lot cheaper,2
9285,i have had mine for two weeks and it broke at the bottom,2
9286,i put it on my arm has to do with rock from the 90s-00's,2
9287,the only problem with this headset is that the music is clear and plays normally,2
9288,problem 2 the silicon liner is not a perfect fit on the phone for 15 minutes sometimes it happens almost right away,2
9289,then you'll need to replace it if you don't ever go outside then get this phone you'll love it,2
9290,i used to work at best buy and there is a gap between the back of the case,2
9291,i tried several times to remove the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground,2
9292,truth is i didn't end up using it for much if at all,2
9293,it was not made for my phone and one for mine,2
9294,i have one already and it works great but it is really just another phone cover,2
9295,there are still a few glitches with symbian that need to be fixed there are plenty of other better cases,2
9296,i'll preface this by saying i have never used it,2
9297,overall this is an ok product the reason it gets 2 stars because its not good,2
9298,i did the same with the power button described in other reviews so i won't comment on that,2
9299,for an inexpensive cover it's doing the job but i don't think the hole is big enough2,2
9300,i was surprised to see this case from a distance it looks really cute,2
9301,i love the color of this case is cracking around the button cutouts,2
9302,but it simply doesn't protect the phone at all,2
9303,thus i couldn't really tell that by just looking at the picture of how it should sit on the phone and you're set,2
9304,i admire them for making the stickiest suction cup i have ever seen other than the dollar store chargers,2
9305,i think it was due to the fact that my unit has stopped charging other devices,2
9306,powerbanks are great things to have to keep track of which ones were charged and which ones were used,2
9307,i like it comes with the silly sparkle,2
9308,i loved the size but there is a way to disable nfc on the holder instead of turning it off completely,2
9309,i have no idea why they don't hold much charge,2
9310,why put it in my pocket with that thing,2
9311,i ended up ordering the speaker adaptor with the cord that plugs into the house outlet but that defeats the whole purpose,2
9312,i was concerned that it would not stay on my phone,2
9313,i take care of my gear but for some reason now there seems to be a trend with these holsters,2
9314,but it doesn't look like the phone would be enclosed all the way around even after the frame breaks,2
9315,other than that they might be good for you if you're very very careful but i was pretty disappointed in these for the price,2
9316,the hiss is also audible when listening to music is maybe a little better but they haven't fallen,2
9317,this is a bad design the look and feel but also does not have the juice for how expensive it is,2
9318,the only thing is i'm trying to be from the futureeeeeeeeee,2
9319,the holder will open wide enough for the phone on the higher 2,2
9320,second this protector isn't for you fort i was willing to put up with having to contact them,2
9321,i found it cheapest at walmart believe it or not and i love knowing my phone is as safe as it possibly can be,2
9322,but when i really looked at it i found that i was disappointed with the results,2
9323,the good news about this item is that the case is specifically-cut for access to all buttons and ports,2
9324,the matte finish is nice at times but it really presents a problem when you live with 3 cats and a dog,2
9325,i got these batteries 4 days ago and its already cracked,2
9326,besides the fact that it didn't work for me,2
9327,not after a couple weeks of non use,2
9328,it's ok if all you really want to power up your battery enough to start the car,2
9329,to me this is a fundamentally fatal flaw with the case that should have been molded into case to begin with,2
9330,was their a reason we needed this at the highest volume levels over 90 % it develops harshness and distortion,2
9331,i don't know the technical mumbo jumbo behind bluetooth but it feels like it can be rip off at any time,2
9332,i tried the samsung s4 with and without the case with a metronome app and then netflix both at full volume,2
9333,even when in place the earbuds were not very comfortable we both prefer the over the ear loop must be removed for charging durable though,2
9334,first the reasons why i only give it the two stars because it breaks easily and doesn't work with linux ubuntu 12,2
9335,the suction cup is amazing though that's the best i can offer these is a below average rating,2
9336,so i would always have to check my phone to see if it will be good for my future purchase,2
9337,i want to like this because it works great for a while and they fit great,2
9338,the screen protector is totally exposed due to the fact that my unit has stopped charging other devices,2
9339,5 months and won't stay even on both sides so i'm constantly worried if i drop it,2
9340,if you set it face down if you need to charge your smartphone one or more times per day,2
9341,it worked on my brothers ipod but would not work on their s4's at all,2
9342,this device is theoreically exactly what i want to hear after spending 70 on a bt headset,2
9343,i attempted to super glue it but it was too slick for me,2
9344,plantronics m155 marque bluetooth headset retail packaging graphite blackfor daily use,2
9345,just to keep your phone protected as well as a home button flanked by menu and back keys,2
9346,the case was hard to get it to operate,2
9347,when that happened one of the pieces got lost so i wasn't the one i had for the iphone was easier to carry,2
9348,my wife eventually refused to use the headset and i got stuck with it good thing i paid with a gift card,2
9349,1 the suction cup suction didn't stick any better or worse that an old colorforms set,2
9350,but when i put it on the roof,2
9351,the first thing i noticed was that it wasn't an apple product,2
9352,i've tweaked mine and added 3rd party programs but you can't get into the club with it they think it's a weapon,2
9353,the item looks great fits the phone only this is after a couple weeks the whiteness started chipping off and looked terrible,2
9354,however it does not fit tight on it so when you try to take a picture,2
9355,i was so excited for this case to come in,2
9356,the problem is that these things must ship from the other side of the call can barley understand me,2
9357,i guess i didn't read this closely but this is really just a printed image with a fake sheen,2
9358,i tried again to install the case but it was a gimmick that wasn't all that useful anyway,2
9359,before that let me say this i will never ever purchase any product from a company that i like,2
9360,this 3 m natural view clear protective cover is crystal clear and does not distort the screen image at all,2
9361,i've used a variety of screen protectors over the years and has never cracked any of them she is a gentle child,2
9362,the battery charger did and i have used it to charge my phone to see it was operating,2
9363,i bought this thing 2 weeks ago and now the battery will not charge through the defy xt,2
9364,if you really need a case with more of a taper to them,2
9365,kaleidio tm refined hybrid t-stand case cover for samsung galaxy note 1 n7000 and samsung galaxy note 2,2
9366,the gray rubber trim separated from the frosted plastic back on the edges of a wet-application screen protector that i had installed,2
9367,i really liked these at first the price is right even if i have to pay to ship them back,2
9368,all i am saying is that this is not real leather,2
9369,as mentioned by several others you must remove the phone's battery prior to applying the screen protector and the edge of the phone,2
9370,the poor build quality combined with the buzzing noise makes me think that the design for this phone,2
9371,while these are easy to use i like the idea in concept,2
9372,the phone has a little cut-out in only about a month of using this bumper case the thing started to tear apart,2
9373,this item doesn't hold well in putting in and out of the belt clip component,2
9374,i have to wiggle the phone for at least 12 hours or more,2
9375,the issue is that it comes with only one power clip so technically you can't charge it means can't use it,2
9376,probably the most uncomfortable pair i have ever owned that i found to be complete and utter garbage,2
9377,there are no openings at the bottom for the lightning connector,2
9378,i like speck cases so i took a chance on it anyway because i like the larger display but have been disappointed ever since,2
9379,i order this product a few years ago,2
9380,if it were thinner and the cut out on the top corner,2
9381,the charging base is fine but the wall charger works slowly but it works,2
9382,i bought this because it seemed like it would work if used carefully,2
9383,needless to say i went back to my old evo 4 g from 2010,2
9384,the only ones that i have had to put in the battery,2
9385,my dislike is that i would recommend for full protection,2
9386,i have mixed emotions since i was informed that the downloads were just starting,2
9387,but then if i went for a run it would start cutting out if i was more than 10 feet away from the adapter,2
9388,iliked it but it came with a nice carrying case and a handy extension cord,2
9389,none of it matters when the item breaks less than a month for the clip to break without much use,2
9390,it was a beautiful case protected the phone and the charger has to be hooked up to a usb port on your pc,2
9391,luckily both times it dropped a short distance onto carpet so that wasn't the case,2
9392,if i wasn't physically holding it into my ipad it would not charge my ipad even though the listing said it would,2
9393,the reception of the product is too flimsy to keep the phone at a decent price,2
9394,as well the case is pretty much useless because i can't lay down in bed with it on,2
9395,it had the exact same problem with the voyager pro hd,2
9396,it's also one piece of glass on the front of the phone won't be use but nothing more,2
9397,the silence button on the side does not work at all in portrait mode my phone keeps tipping over,2
9398,she likes pink i like to be seen as on the phone instead it has a micro-usb input to charge the charger,2
9399,i have a friend who purchased one of these when it first came out and now it just flops around the phone,2
9400,update on 2 22 13 after a few more 2-week waits the new cable arrives surprise,2
9401,3 lack of volume and next track previous track means i have to whip out the phone,2
9402,i paired the watch with my phone it's not coming off,2
9403,i have not tried all the various functions of this phone but it does not extend forward enough to protect the phone,2
9404,i know they are plastic but hoped they would last longer or be better but they don't last very long,2
9405,not a very strong case for everyday use at the office,2
9406,i have to keep doing the process over and over again will not save the screen,2
9407,update tried the seidio waterproof case didn't like the texture there were no major scratches,2
9408,fortunately it looks like i've found a few other nice replacements,2
9409,this unite stopped working just a few weeks the cord started to come out of the accessory power plug,2
9410,-card slots there are 2 slots for cards and a 4th behind them for money,2
9411,a month later this one's freezing up too and i have to push it back in you hang up on them,2
9412,i love the little clip string which allows me to accept reject calls without opening the cover i will give it a try,2
9413,i was first introduced to the poetic brand when i bought my iphone 4 i kept it in my pocket,2
9414,also the case is not very durable either,2
9415,i just retired my blackberry and it charges it just fine but i can't understand what they're saying,2
9416,if you use your phone a lot or work in a place with 13 million people,2
9417,the seller has offered to send a replacement from b n p,2
9418,still that's a minor issue since you only really need to plug it in and run a cable from the unit to your speaker,2
9419,2 batteries and no way to change it,2
9420,i do not recommend this device and give it a 2 start review,2
9421,i bought two cases and both does the same thing we're returning it,2
9422,instead i am going to try the motorola slim pack goo,2
9423,overall i like the idea of loops as well as a bit more background hiss,2
9424,trust me you dont want to deal with hassle should they refuse,2
9425,i get about 8 hours of time before it does other than that it works ok,2
9426,they worked fine until i dropped my phone several times and there has been no damage so far,2
9427,hard to press the volume button at all,2
9428,the material peeled off on its own at all times,2
9429,luckily both times it dropped a short distance onto a very soft carpet,2
9430,the only way a samsung galaxys lll would fit in this thing and i listen to music and even make calls,2
9431,did not return because it just felt like too much work and i did not like it as it would not charge,2
9432,all i need is to protect my screen and the back of my phone and this one is no exception,2
9433,it worked on my brothers ipod but would not work for me because the unit sticks out towards the front a lot,2
9434,despite the convenience of being able to see my phone and have it hang down while i'm taking a picture,2
9435,i switched back to original battery because i don't think it's leather,2
9436,i finally took the case off and let it sit much longer,2
9437,i returned it to amazon but it just wasn't what i thought it was blinged with gold accessories,2
9438,what in the world would i pay a premium for it doesn't make sense,2
9439,i have people complaining that my voice is either going in and out or that i sounded like i was in a tunnel,2
9440,this bluetooth works well but i'm sure there are higher quality ones,2
9441,i've used these kinds of screen protectors on smart phones several times,2
9442,someone clearly has a vested interest in trying to push the bottom half of the screen,2
9443,posted up a picture in case you want to carry your phone naked this is the next best thing,2
9444,this seemed the ideal case in my case the screen protector damaged easily,2
9445,i like the design of the batteries is distended and warped,2
9446,we have tried several devices and they will not charge using the built in cable and makes it easier to break,2
9447,i have to hold the play pause button to turn it on press the button and touch slide the finger on it,2
9448,how could i not want this on my phone and makes it almost impossible to type on this phone,2
9449,it's counter part at the top of the usb port and the top edge of the phone,2
9450,gps 4 10 i have a 3 year old throwing it down the stairs,2
9451,i have 3 different phone holders and this is my least favorite by a very wide margin,2
9452,i have owned otterbox commuter cases for both my iphones and other models the one that came off,2
9453,the cutouts are different and the protector does not cover the top or bottom so that when the phone is in the case,2
9454,overalli can't really judge because i don't know if this is oem or not,2
9455,lost the pearls the first day i thought to my self,2
9456,i had used it for a few days it no longer works,2
9457,and indeed the screen protector is totally exposed due to the fact that my wife insists on turning on the speakerphone every time we talk,2
9458,battery life seems to be ok however it does not adhere to the screen,2
9459,what made me set this aside and find another case is that it doesn't fit the phone,2
9460,this case is nice and slim and it looks great,2
9461,the next thing that confirmed that it was a slim fit case as per the title description,2
9462,it is not that easy to slide the phone out of the case often,2
9463,let me preface by saying i've had a screen protector with it,2
9464,i will try switching pockets or phone orientation to see if that was the case why did they send me this,2
9465,when i gently bent the metal back it was just the right size for the phone,2
9466,the voice dialing features of the headset were not the same,2
9467,this means it is not compatible so i left the phone on and doing the initial setup i opened up the camera,2
9468,right on the charger the output is listed on the charger as 1,2
9469,overall i like the concept but needs to be more protective and more sturdy,2
9470,the part that goes into the back of the phone,2
9471,it seems as though i'm shoving them into my ipod and i'm afraid my phone will fall out of it,2
9472,65038 i love the usb cable that came with his ipad was too short,2
9473,its been over a month and they are completely useless now,2
9474,there is a lot of dust during installation and ended up bending trying to remove it the first time it was dropped,2
9475,you should only have to pay for shipping and you have to turn it off,2
9476,i know that it is actually plugged in,2
9477,i left it on and was only able to charge my galaxy s3 i was only getting about half an amp max power,2
9478,likely be returning this case to the market,2
9479,the battery part of this works really well as a spare battery alternative ie keeping a bunch of charged spare batteries around,2
9480,that's the little port on the left side as if the rubber was being stretched,2
9481,i returned this case and kept the apple leather case that fit better,2
9482,they worked for a few minutes hang up,2
9483,the color is perfect the only thing is it gets scratched so easily,2
9484,i reviewed both of these cases as well if you're interested in using them to listen to audiobooks while i shower,2
9485,the only downside i have found is that you can't just charge it with the sun so i left it on,2
9486,another thing i just didn't care for this style for my phone,2
9487,it wasn't worth the trouble of removing it every time i picked it up,2
9488,these products are 10 or 15 more expensive than this case but i can't hear anything on the very next call,2
9489,my son uses his phone when he runs and he found it excellent at first loved the color,2
9490,love the idea of this case but when i took the case off and when the case came it had a horrible smell to it,2
9491,i use an iphone 4s i couldn't hear out of very loud,2
9492,in fact if you're not a clean person,2
9493,it looks great but if you have a case on,2
9494,i got this case i was so excited when i got these headphones at trade show because of the price 25 bucks,2
9495,i purchased the gold version of this unit for my wife because of how good it looked coupled with it's otterbox name,2
9496,when sliding the phone out of the case it's self but when i removed the case and put it back on every time,2
9497,anyway when i received my droid incredible 4 g lte the maximum current i've seen the connection to my samsung galaxy s3,2
9498,it does protect your iphone if it have protective case,2
9499,this case offers fully wrapped coverage for a slim case that easily fits in my pocket,2
9500,since then i've picked up other cheap windshield mounts and i don't really recommend this product its a very good case,2
9501,the diztronic was pretty nice in every way until i tried to plug it in it was already having problems charging my note 2,2
9502,it does work but it does not extend forward enough to provide any screen protection,2
9503,now its just an annoying piece of plastic that makes it hard to reach for the volume buttons,2
9504,i have used their this method with other protectors that are not designed to be serviceable and any failed circuitry is not user replaceable,2
9505,and it's barely loud enough if there's no road noise but as soon as i received it and immediately saw the difference,2
9506,i'm not pissed because i didn't clean the screen well,2
9507,i was disappointed to find out too late that the cover over the siii with the extended battery,2
9508,as to the wireless leash reminding me to take my phone out of the case which is a pain,2
9509,it was very cute but the bow fell off within 2 days of regular handling,2
9510,in fact i can't even get a lock,2
9511,the frame portion does look a bit like some kind of robot,2
9512,they were comfortable enough for me to make a perfect fit,2
9513,i took the case out of it's back,2
9514,the aluminum band feels as if it will scratch very easily,2
9515,we both got our protector and i ended up eating the cost of the part,2
9516,it worked great and he loved it but broke in less than a month and the outer hard case edge broke out,2
9517,i liked the look and feel of this screen protector and the case would not come off,2
9518,once placed on the phone it is a challenge,2
9519,i was completely satisfied with quality of the case is protected by the hard plastic,2
9520,i'll just check my texts at red lights or when i'm trying to love these headphones but they are a goofy fit,2
9521,when i saw this jabra easygo bluetooth headset i thought i'd give this brand another try with a different vendor,2
9522,0 and i had to return it back because i felt it was way to bulky for my taste i returned it,2
9523,so if your looking for a cheap case this is it,2
9524,the earplugs are not comfortable and i tried all the various ear pieces but none of them improved the very weak low-end,2
9525,5-2 charges out of it then,2
9526,because there are speakers on both sides of the material while installing it,2
9527,what made me set this aside and find another case is that it doesn't even have one,2
9528,not the end of the good things i have to say about the way this disconnects alot i dont doubt it,2
9529,the case looks great but doesn't provide much protection by itself,2
9530,needless to say i went back to using the original battery,2
9531,the qc on these product have a lot to say about this particular battery pack come almost to a screeching halt,2
9532,the bottom line is if you can get them on right,2
9533,the stock earbuds are pretty awful as we all know that cds are museum pieces,2
9534,the good it's a micro usb cablethe bad it's not what i thought it would be,2
9535,i like to put my phone in the day light,2
9536,i used the case 4 days a week and i may get an additional hour of life out of it,2
9537,the metal grommet has fallen out of the case and the crack in my phone,2
9538,this is with the volume turned to as low as it can go its still loose even with the strap tightened to its max,2
9539,2 days later there were scratches all over the back plastic and it didn't fit the way i was treated by by amazon,2
9540,as for the adapter it might fit but it will want to come out nice i pull out my nice camera,2
9541,personally i am just going to stick on but it did and i sent it back to amazon,2
9542,i am able to open the cover with one hand and unstick the other and finally gave up,2
9543,while the build quality of the product durability and it is difficult to remove without cracking,2
9544,i keep thinking i will send it back for a sony over-the-ear headphones,2
9545,they think people will just buy another one from this brand,2
9546,but unfortunately i couldn't even close the entire way,2
9547,this is not as lifeproof as you think it will be a product that i will buy again,2
9548,the phone stays out more than any other i've found for the razr line of phones,2
9549,i thought by ordering from the site i would get a rinky-dink cheap one so i wouldn't really recommend this case,2
9550,my wife isn't really excited about it but i still think the good outweighs the bad,2
9551,i really don't know why people are still putting the speakers on the phone is broken in 2 diferent places,2
9552,if you have a great phone with awesome picture quality you don't want to take my phone out of it,2
9553,it is great as far as protecting it in a fall,2
9554,i switched to cimo s-line tpu case amazon gp product b00ax49vbw ref oh details o00 s00 i00,2
9555,i wouldn't recommend this case unless you really need a very long battery life,2
9556,it makes the phone extra larger than it would be to break the headset but that's a lie,2
9557,or when you pull the phone out at least not in a manner that balances the imperfect cut to lines of the phone,2
9558,there is a level of freedom of not having to deal with this headache for about three weeks,2
9559,too weak for a motorcycle and my phone would no longer connect to it,2
9560,not gon na bother getting a new one right after it,2
9561,it worked for a little bit now the pad won't charge my note 3 and it completes the look and functions i want,2
9562,ended up purchasing the ocho lightning to usb car charger for iphone 4 3gs ipod so this is a good deal,2
9563,sometimes it will ring continuously and you can't use the wallet function,2
9564,it is just another screen protector and not the actual screen i'd say it's more worth 3,2
9565,it is kind of cute it is very cheaply made i can not understand the other party,2
9566,these things may work decently but the reason for the incredibly cheap price without proper software,2
9567,at first case appears to be very sturdy and looks nice but does not have a problem with that,2
9568,the battery will last since i can't stand to listen to it for very long because of the volume problem,2
9569,it is plastic and looks rather cheap and the color is much different in person than how it appears online,2
9570,the ringke only covers the back of the outer case 3,2
9571,update i removed the case from the first will not fit in the case,2
9572,no difficulty either in the usability of the screen once you have it on the device,2
9573,on october 20 i returned the phones to radio shack for a full refund as it meets none of my expectations,2
9574,i'm now using the belkin vue and it's working it just isn't getting the juice into the batteries,2
9575,these screen overlays don't seem to be a problem,2
9576,snugg is worse rubber these are next and the boxwave is by far the most extreme loudest earpeice i have ever put to my ear,2
9577,but the face plate that holds the two pieces together is very easy to grip and keep your grip,2
9578,seems to be a lip around the edge is not symmetrical on all sides,2
9579,this was the best case for my sensation i did not want return it since i have very fast wifi at home,2
9580,so really only works well if you can stand having dirt trapped underneath,2
9581,it is a small solid package but adds quite a bit of bulk to the phone and taking it back off are extremely difficult,2
9582,if you use the one that came with my phone wasn't as clear as one of my previous motorola's,2
9583,i'll walk into a verizon store for an update,2
9584,but i've gone through a lot of cases cover up,2
9585,wasn't a huge fan of spigen i decided to buy one of those,2
9586,the first time i got out of this charger was,2
9587,i contacted customer service and they asked to send the phone to repair due to damage on the button,2
9588,-all ports are exposed except the microsd and sim cards without case removal,2
9589,just want to start off to say that i won't be using it,2
9590,great if you want a lot of extra effort to swipe and select apps,2
9591,the last case that i purchased did not hold up like i expected it to,2
9592,my husband did not like its layout and it did not exactly jive with what i had,2
9593,finally i am sorry that i can not use it to move between apps,2
9594,the back worries me a bit because i feel as if my case wasn't too carefully handled,2
9595,it was also so tight that you couldn't get it to actually execute,2
9596,the body glove makes no pretense of being anything other than a drop onto a soft pillow,2
9597,the camera lens isn't even flush with the glass so it provides no protection whatsoever to the front,2
9598,2 while the protective level of the case is nice came with a nice screen cleaning cloth and application card and the cutouts are correct,2
9599,because sprint virgin has already decided to close its wi-max network is likely to be totally shut down,2
9600,edit about two weeks after using it i use it on my phone and ten minutes later it fell off,2
9601,it's a great deal for the price and i really like the way they designed it,2
9602,the phone is difficult to pull out of the holster it does not protect the front glass well at all,2
9603,i have not driven with the product but you live and learn,2
9604,the rubber on the top and bottom halves of the casing,2
9605,however they just didn't put much thought behind the rest of the package is rather minimalistic,2
9606,this case on this too much just because it's not even metal but a carbon cast finished with aluminum powder,2
9607,fortunately this was my free case from apple and i can see how high a margin these lifeproof guys are getting,2
9608,i left it to dry but it still did not adhere to the screen very well and above allit is a fingerprint magnet too,2
9609,silicon stuck to my pockets and i found that the speaker volume was exactly the same which leads me to the bad,2
9610,i couldn't walk for than 20 feet away from your phone it starts breaking up,2
9611,of course i have tried cleaning bleaching and other methods to get rid of a million different cords but,2
9612,somehow i ordered two of these and both had bubbles,2
9613,after sacrificing my much-loved gelaskin iphone skin in order to get the volume rocker switch to respond,2
9614,since the price was so low i did not make public my experience with this product than what i have experienced,2
9615,the first month i had it so i wasn't expecting anything great,2
9616,the extra money would be worth it to spend another 2-3 hours with normal volume,2
9617,i'll still use it but very carefully,2
9618,if the case snapped onto the phone it would make it through just fine,2
9619,they even emailed me right after shipping mistake was realized and told me they would send me a complimentary bluetooth headset,2
9620,superior sound quality durable and the controls are very easy to activate through the cover,2
9621,this isn't an issue because i can just hang them around my neck put on the ear buds,2
9622,last many of my headphones won't plug in all the way because the pedal was blocked by the mount,2
9623,1 amp output this charger does not charge fast at all,2
9624,connected and paired with my phone after a lot of effort i was able to wash off what the hell could that have been,2
9625,buy from the store and make sure it's in there or it will just fall out,2
9626,the others didn't work at all with youtube anymore,2
9627,i'm about ready to put it on the stand base i normally use to charge my phone,2
9628,although a piece broke off but i just super glued the stones back on,2
9629,pros the case does protect your phone if you are just looking for a pen-type stylus to get this one,2
9630,jihads to trim the edges because it didn't protect my phone so i had to use a knife to get it apart,2
9631,it takes all day to charge with this charger,2
9632,besides it was a pain to put on,2
9633,g4 features air gestures this works with a very limited number of games it's currently compatible with it's just not that impressive,2
9634,it gets really annoying when you are using a mobile phone if you truly need to be stationary,2
9635,it's too bad such a pretty case but some of the rhinestones were falling off,2
9636,the basic function is ok as others have said and i agree it has no longevity,2
9637,well that's what you want that's what you're looking for rugged get one that isn't defective,2
9638,as i mentioned i can not use it i'm bummed,2
9639,i installed one on my phone and totally destroyed it,2
9640,no clicking feedback from the button because half your thumb is pressing on the case which makes the case mostly useless to me,2
9641,i didn't give this product 2 stars is because this case is really nice,2
9642,as stated by others it takes some good force to snap it in securely so it doesn't pick up my phone,2
9643,your mileage may vary but in my opinion is still cheap,2
9644,the charger worked once and died and wouldn't take a fall very well and protect your phone nicely this is not for the spontaneous,2
9645,the devices sometimes drops the bluetooth connection to my phone is lost and then that the connection is re-established,2
9646,the lack of any sort of additional cable,2
9647,my suggestion is to look for something to remove the rest of the tools tweezers knife and blade are junk,2
9648,in summary this headset isn't for you,2
9649,i had problems typing and it made it very frustrating to use the home button to make the fingerprint reader work,2
9650,if all i wanted to do was leave my phone in one or two mediocre ones,2
9651,but wow are they short they barely reach to the top of your right ear pulling upward while you open your jaw slightly,2
9652,i thought the color looked great but the buttons were far too loose and the sides did not hug the phone like it should,2
9653,makes it appear as if there is no battery present and momentarily when you plug it in to this dock the music shuts off,2
9654,within a few days i noticed receiver would not sync with my iphone 4 from at t,2
9655,this item is well made and fits the phone well and also it has a terrible and strong rubbery smell,2
9656,the first problem is that it makes the phone look ridiculous but it helps greatly,2
9657,i'm mad and disappointed with this product if you like hearing things like 34 what,2
9658,unfortunately the two layers of protection the kickstand started wobbling within the first few days i got them,2
9659,this is the last time i didn't mind throwing them in the trash and had to read the sub-titles at the gym,2
9660,i tried using it on a call it's a bit larger and i don't wear tight pants,2
9661,shipped really fast and arrived on time but i wont be risking my nexus in it,2
9662,you need not worry if you are running ios 7 stay away,2
9663,i have owned a lot of headphones with built-in holder black which will work on the new ipad,2
9664,the case is cute but i wouldn't recommend this product since its construction makes it completely unreliable,2
9665,i love the print but probably wouldn't buy again but the price is right but it didnt protect very well,2
9666,if protection is all that you need then this product is on track to be a remarkable one,2
9667,they denied the claim because this is not a bright pretty red polka dot case,2
9668,i thought this case was so cute when i saw it didn't protect my phone,2
9669,another flaw is that the sides don't fit completely around the phone leaving the silver ring exposed,2
9670,i'm now going to be looking for something better and i really can't recommend this to for anyone,2
9671,if this product worked as advertised i would have never have bought this phone,2
9672,other than feeling like i have to yell answer to get it to on to my iphone at all,2
9673,i've returned it and will go back to the product i used before,2
9674,i only gave it two stars because i got it on it was also not clear at all on which film you peel off first,2
9675,needless to say i am disappointed in this item because it would not let me into the settings menu,2
9676,the ear hides a lot of the s4's special features require the front facing camera is one part that is partially covered by this,2
9677,or perhaps this charger doesn't have the best sound quality of any bt device i've used,2
9678,fortunately it was still able to pair with it easily after this,2
9679,i bought this phone at walmart a year ago and it was 2 pieces that snapped together,2
9680,it's a semi rigid plastic and after a while it became discolored and was really unattractive so i discarded it,2
9681,its the tacky rubber kind of case and it is still as strong as the day i bought them,2
9682,i ordered this for my galaxy s3 gt-i9300,2
9683,i ordered this hoping it would be it is very thin but very sturdy,2
9684,after that there were some lines across the screen like the otterbox the nexus case is barely 2 stars,2
9685,not sure what i expected but these are a big improvement over my jabra stone1,2
9686,the reason i gave it 2 stars because it failed in the first year,2
9687,one more thing i noticed is that this case did save my phone which is an lg banter touch,2
9688,i'm going to be returning and going with a different brand and those survived,2
9689,i bought this item it was not expensive but again you get what you paid for with this case,2
9690,dont waste your money get one with a support bracket on the lower side of green say 7 out of 10,2
9691,not loving it but it doesn't fit an otterbox like you would expect from a mirror if that makes sense,2
9692,it looks and feels cheap definitely not something i would have on my bike for sure,2
9693,it's not difficult but i definitely need to use two devices at once has a 2,2
9694,i was recently on vacation and used my phone all day i don't need to bring a separate cable which is awesome,2
9695,the charging system is another point that was less than a week later that is quit working permanently,2
9696,i keep it in a protective case although the case would have been perfect,2
9697,it was thicker than average and when i plugged it in to root it and to transfer a few pics over,2
9698,better off paying the more money and get the anker power bank instead,2
9699,i am constantly washing my hands all day too which is really disappointing since that's exactly why i got it,2
9700,also the case is to protect the back of your phone from scratches but then looks like crap you almost need a screen protector,2
9701,the tail would never stick so there was no need in me keeping this one,2
9702,about the only thing i would like about this product is that it is definitely not worth the price or hassel of buying it,2
9703,this tpu case adds a lot of weight to your iphone,2
9704,nokia blew it on this one if you want it for a short period of time is the separation alert,2
9705,i found it nearly impossible to get your phone out,2
9706,also it is a very tight fit for my phone sprint galaxys epic 4 g,2
9707,it had some minor knit picks i could live with this if i could make a call,2
9708,but the stupid thing won't hold a charge as good if not better than jlg,2
9709,it's not like horrible horrible but it's cheap and flimsy and ripped when i put it in the charge it says not charging,2
9710,this tells me that i can not use it elsewhere,2
9711,again i was better off doing my own research on how to remove the case it uses a different charging cord than the phone though,2
9712,the clunky side buttons do not line up well,2
9713,i love the look and feel much better than the actual product,2
9714,while the controls all work as expected the sound quality is low especially outdoors and there is quite a bit of background work,2
9715,i have always applied realook screen protectors for my evo 4 g every few months,2
9716,the only think i dont like that when you try to put it on the tab is hard to come off,2
9717,i wouldn't want a snap to possibly ruin the front of my iphone so it was constantly coming off,2
9718,the case portion is fine if you dont mind the size the color is cool,2
9719,those that i call need to be able to send those files wirelessly,2
9720,this is the first time that i put this case on it won't protect it just looks nice,2
9721,i bought the incipio-sa-378-dualpro-samsung-galaxy dp b008nblvgk that one was simple and exactly as advertised,2
9722,my friend broke his within the first 2 months that i had it i had to super glue it but it was too late,2
9723,when she is in the car talking to me on the phone or mp3 player,2
9724,next thing i know my ipad doesn't respond to any amount of coaxing,2
9725,also the cover is very thin and i wouldn't be getting a case like this one in the dust,2
9726,much like the motorola i wanted to like this headset but in the end i got what i paid for as the old saying goes,2
9727,great price and color but the case is not equal to the authentic otterbox cases,2
9728,the reason i got this one was because i wanted a totally clear case for this phone are very hard to press,2
9729,i can turn off the flashing blue i am using a kay's case slim soft case i got from amazon,2
9730,this case was so hard to remove from your phone that you do not want on the lyvehome device,2
9731,this gap needs to be shortened to only allow access to the phone's speaker because it was clearer,2
9732,the blue tooth sync worked fine but some of the once i ordered did not fit my iphone 4s all that well,2
9733,mine gets over heated only charges my phone lg g2 for a few minutes until the next time,2
9734,the screen is on you can still tell that there is a four second delay after each photo,2
9735,maybe sell or give away i know i won't be using them anymore,2
9736,the stylus and pen work well enough that i can't take points off when i have no problem with this at all,2
9737,when i tried to apply this once and it had a few major flaws 1 it covers the power and volume covers,2
9738,i asked what good it was going to be a bit sturdier,2
9739,i like to look and feel clean i wouldn't recommend using this on your phone unless your ok with buying more,2
9740,could have been more clear that it is not depicting a matte screen but a glittered screen,2
9741,also the cover over the power button is very hard to get on straight and want stay on,2
9742,people sounded ok to me but i never recieved it,2
9743,the smooth matte color is nice but shows fingerprints too much,2
9744,frankly it's not worth the hassle i ended up buying another more expensive case,2
9745,i had connected it to my keychain and in installation,2
9746,the worst part about it was that i can only charge it using the cable provided by apple,2
9747,this was ok cheap but does the job and cheap enough that i wasn't that impressed and found i have no need to upgrade,2
9748,my wife thought that the case was meant to be 34 slim 34 but it is quite big and bulky,2
9749,i would buy again as it left bubbles all over the screen protector which the aluminate back hold too tight,2
9750,the phone was delivered on time but it does update as you drive down each block,2
9751,perhaps if you have long strong fingernails you could apply enough pressure to turn the phone on the higher 2,2
9752,edit i have now been using the tech armor screen protector kits are my benchmark for what a screen protector would have been highly appreciated,2
9753,i was very excited to get this to work for me long term,2
9754,it doesn't come close and i'd recommend a samsung or a motorola over this any day,2
9755,i was not a heavy user but the battery was much better than the oem's cable,2
9756,i was constantly having to clean my screen and remove any dust,2
9757,i probably won't send it back but i am not impressed my samsung is still connected to the phone,2
9758,the capitative touch simply did not work for some reason,2
9759,also at first the case seemed to be a perfect solution,2
9760,the case was a little loose almost never use it give it away to a friend who doesnt let these things bother him,2
9761,i really hope they come out with a better version of this case you're able to just place on the recharging pad,2
9762,i ordered 2 of these thinking it will last me a good 12 hours on normal usage standby,2
9763,the part that covers the power sync connector,2
9764,i really liked this screen for the first week it seemed to always be interfering with itself,2
9765,they are a very tight fit for my iphone 4 and to my lenovo ideapad z570 laptop computer,2
9766,and i am not even sure it is worth the slightly higher price,2
9767,getting the case back off was all but impossible i thought i was getting a good deal but it's worth it,2
9768,the cord worked fine for a few hours for a full charge around 6 hours,2
9769,it was really nice not having to worry about screwing up my new phone's charger port,2
9770,so i wasn't planning to use this with a 30 pin cable and a mini-usb cable,2
9771,i just got it so i will definitely give it a try as i have been for the whole season since january,2
9772,features welcome to google townthe droid has a lot of potential to make a great niche device,2
9773,i knew this was a poor replica of the original as soon as i moved it to adjust it the whole thing fell off,2
9774,i want something that is easy to put together and has a nice glare on it from any light around,2
9775,its a great idea but the device i received appeared to have been damaged and reassembled,2
9776,it has to be paired whenever you switch bluetooth devices it doesn't seem that people come back to amazon to change their reviews often,2
9777,tabs to align screen to phone are difficult to remove and it's a good length more than suitable for most of my uses,2
9778,these screen protectors were very cheap and had to be replaced 5 times and repaired twice,2
9779,connection the device automatically connected to my smartphone but it doesn't really fit and it isn't really worth the bother to return,2
9780,after just a few minutes of my 30 minute commute or if it is the device phone carrier or user error,2
9781,the item came quickly was impressed with the look however i quickly realized that there was no sign of life,2
9782,unfortunately the case also makes it hard to reach for the volume buttons being backwards would recommend a slightly higher quality of a receiver,2
9783,i bought these headphones because i like to look and feel but it just stopped working,2
9784,the first unit didn't seem to take long to charge,2
9785,i would recommend getting some at at t or sprint for a few more weeks now i lowered the rating to 2,2
9786,all in all if you need this case it does have a thickness to it so it does protect the phone very well,2
9787,unit is pack-ably small charges quickly i charged it for exactly 30 minutes stopped the video and disconnected the limeade,2
9788,i've inserted mine maybe 20 times and one of the batteries so that they can confirm if the battery is good or not,2
9789,if the manufacturers designed more corner protection this would be a genuine nokia accessory but i bought two of these based on reviews,2
9790,in light of this i was able to remove it with a screwdriver,2
9791,pairing the headset is a bit tricky to install and i did not hesitate to get a replacement,2
9792,the cons had to watch a youtube video to tell you how to hack the phone but it looks so much better than this,2
9793,i had the belkin 050 essential case for my 4s and 5 which arrived at different times,2
9794,i tried it with without the case with and without the spacers,2
9795,the zeimax did come with the correct connector but it didn't quite fit my droid razar maxx,2
9796,mine worked fine for a while but then eventually failed,2
9797,just know that this isn't even close to truthful,2
9798,sadly we are going to look for a replacement asap,2
9799,i only purchased this to have a spare battery when your only able to charge my iphone,2
9800,the suction cup hold great but the actual part that goes in the jack so it is always there,2
9801,maybe the looks are not as sleek but i do not know why more phone covers are coming like this,2
9802,maybe i'm crazy but this case really messed up my reception and battery life on the headset has greatly diminished in it's capacity,2
9803,i'd always used water based installed screen protectors so i was faced with trying the new one,2
9804,despite multiple attempts of fixing the shield to the phone the side opening to control the volume a little too much pressure and goodbye,2
9805,edit 03 02 13 okay i've had this case for a week or so,2
9806,the top and bottom are very loose and the cell phone is about 50 % thicker than before,2
9807,so i like the battery life but not at the cost of bulk and weight,2
9808,it is awkward putting the iphone in and out especially out are very labored,2
9809,in addition they can not be too close together or the phone will not turn back on without a hard reset,2
9810,my square device will not work with a screen protector,2
9811,my only gripe with it is that if you go to far from your phone it will slip out of your hand easier,2
9812,it is two layers i have to take it out of my pocket,2
9813,then it guess what you said 9 out of 10 times i use it my battery will run down fast,2
9814,well it was great but it just would not charge with the phone,2
9815,the included directions are among the worst i've seen for any non-beta electronic product,2
9816,i would get a pink cloud around the side of the unit is your answer and hang up button,2
9817,wish i could return it but at least it was the right case that it would have been cool if it was hot swappable,2
9818,bottom of the case that cover the headphone jack and used them with the new styluses,2
9819,figured i'd try this protector anyways and i found it to be frustrating to use,2
9820,otterbox and ballistic make some very nice durable cases that have a rubber slip inside a plastic case,2
9821,the case is is meant to be super thin and maintain the lines of the galaxy phone instead of squaring it off like an iphone,2
9822,the screen protector is loose and does not fit the phone we bought it for even though it was most expensive of the bunch,2
9823,it turns on when i open the item there are clear ear wax on the ear buds fall off easily without much cause,2
9824,i didn't really like this case its sleek and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the battery,2
9825,good this screen protector will protect your glass and it fits very snug around arm and around the phone,2
9826,i do not turn it on so for 25 it's so much better than any other holder in this regard,2
9827,and not easy to put on and remove so if you are watching a movie on the phone everyone can see,2
9828,i really needed it and as a result it does not allow the phone to be fully refurbished,2
9829,i've had 2 of these they work for a few months then it simply wouldn't come on anymore,2
9830,there is a constant buzz hiss in the right ear or possible a limitation to using a device in that ear,2
9831,adds a lot of bulk to the phone and roll the protector down,2
9832,i am very disappointed in this product and the whole concept seemed really cool to me,2
9833,i wanted a darker color so it wouldn't slide out of your hands or pockets,2
9834,the pieces were tightly closed on the back of the cover has fallen out,2
9835,maybe i just received a bad one but i don't know whether its the service or phone,2
9836,i have tried all the ear tips but none of them improved the very weak low-end,2
9837,disappointed as i really like the look and feel but it just stopped working after 2 weeks and i am very disappointed,2
9838,this arm band case is ok but there are other issues mentioned in the details below,2
9839,and you don't know if it's just really cheap,2
9840,this is on the other hand i have a couple of different jabra stone bluetooth blueteeth,2
9841,i did not have any problems with the h710 what so ever,2
9842,what good is that i would not trust this seller again,2
9843,i really loved these headphones the battery lasted long the quality of sound and i'm fairly tolerant of low quality earbuds and headsets,2
9844,some were very well taken care of iphone for only a few weeks usage to do it,2
9845,well my first gripe is that the video suggests that you install the screen protector on your phone this is very awesome,2
9846,like i said i used canned air a credit card and it totally scratched the screen protector with the included solution,2
9847,my evaluation is coloured by my experience with the product after i did i heard nothing further,2
9848,speed marginal improvement at best and this is only if you plan on using it as a mobile hotspot or watching movies,2
9849,i really wanted a sliding keyboard and at the time it was the only type available for the nokia e7,2
9850,21 google voice does not work on this phone which is disappointing because this is a third generation design,2
9851,putting this case on the case broke within 2 months of purchase,2
9852,its a great headset clear sound great battery life but the max volume setting there is little to no unnecessary background noise,2
9853,this indicates to me that some of the cut outs for the speaker and camera and the entire screen was out of line,2
9854,the earbud gets mashed into my ear over the course of a 10 minute drive spanning 2,2
9855,touch bluetooth and phone at the same time would not fit,2
9856,including standby time it has only been on my phone a samsung gs3,2
9857,i currently use verizon phone so i don't think it create that much of a difference,2
9858,i do not find this to be a premium case but it feels really cheap especially when plugging it into my devices,2
9859,and it doesnt work tried both ports and made sure the charger and usb are firmly seated,2
9860,upon careful inspection i notice that the clamping action on the phone is 1,2
9861,but it is longer far cheaper and a nice way to keep the cell phone away from your ear,2
9862,therefore i can not use the flash on your phone the sticker does stay on the home button,2
9863,i couldn't vouch for it because i wanted something like the life proof without paying the actual cost,2
9864,it does glow in the dark as advertised,2
9865,i did not like was the fact that the magnetic clip must be attached when writing to recognize anything,2
9866,now the other side has a problem too and i haven't taken the mount apart but i can,2
9867,the main problem is that people can't hear you and then with a couple of attachments,2
9868,signal gets lost as soon as i removed it from charging it would be okay for a couple minutes,2
9869,maybe i should keep this case in a few minutes and switching either to the handset or to another bluetooth headset,2
9870,love the concept but unfortunately it stopped working after 2 weeks very frustrating,2
9871,if you need minimal protection anda very think case this may be the way it's advertised,2
9872,i also find that the lens cutout does not allow me to do that so it's a real shame,2
9873,i thought something was wrong with my phone at first it arrived early and everything,2
9874,it would have been a great case for your ipod touch 4 g,2
9875,i'll update this review once i get it to call the right number,2
9876,had to buy another case because the top and bottom with cut outs are a bit flimsy,2
9877,the iphone 5 fits the phone perfectly is easy to slip on in witch makes it very easy to write with,2
9878,i just wish it worked with my cell phone yields very limited utility,2
9879,this thing was not very useful and not worth the add on to this product,2
9880,on the back of the case or the switch connection itself,2
9881,i really wanted to love this product but i didn't want to get your phone out,2
9882,i do like the fm option the sound is good and i like the rubber grip so your phone does not charge,2
9883,i don't know why the charger wouldn't stay connected to charge it,2
9884,she did not want to have the phone in an otterbox with this protector on it,2
9885,this is the one with the dust speck in the middle of a shift is a disaster,2
9886,i almost bought this car mount because i have a pair of beats pro or several other high end headphones,2
9887,if you happen to get one of these units if you plan on using it ever,2
9888,please stay away and don't even think about getting it out,2
9889,but the length is great but the devil is in the details and this case is probably the thinnest battery case i found on here,2
9890,so the case does fit fine and and for the price it would be ok,2
9891,i remove the case after a month it would charge my s3 batteries in about 6 hours,2
9892,i've used many portable chargers over the years and has never cracked any of them she is a gentle child,2
9893,i have never been cut off and as far as that goes i say 3 out of 4 corners,2
9894,i love this cover and got lots of compliments but didn't last very long,2
9895,unfortunately it is just too much trouble to put on,2
9896,this product does protect the screen the edges of the phone,2
9897,it's a good deal when it comes to the functionality i say stay away,2
9898,the case is still pretty and a good price for a decent phone,2
9899,it works but once you close it it is hard to tighten it to the surface even more,2
9900,i plugged it in and the connection is pretty good so far the best of the four,2
9901,then a few days later i dropped the phone it'd survive intact,2
9902,after looking at it the plastic is very cheap and it doesn't clean easily,2
9903,it also caused the phone to activate the voice control button,2
9904,the sounds quality is meh and it doesn't even mention how to pair with a cell phone,2
9905,the case is very flimsy and essentially feels like you're going to tear up the screen protector,2
9906,every one of my protectors had hair or some sort of oxidizing because it was uniformly discolored over the exposed areas,2
9907,i was finally able to get the phone in and miss the bottom docking connection causing my phone to still crack when dropped,2
9908,pull it off w a little too much in my opinion but eh,2
9909,my 5-mile walk aka test route proved to be a a frightful effort of controlled force,2
9910,march 11th update yes if you have any case at all,2
9911,the tools are cheap came with the wrong size screw remover and there was no software resolution so the phone had to be returned,2
9912,but the fact that it came with a little hard piece of cardboard to smooth out bubbles during application,2
9913,it looks nice in the dark but i just do not need to be charged more than once a day even with heavy use,2
9914,the one thing that did not work and then received these,2
9915,so for me it's not worth the hassle i ended up buying another one,2
9916,the privacy film got a tiny little bubble that just won't go away no matter how hard i push the screen,2
9917,edit otterbox quality is not whats pictured,2
9918,i would go to turn on the screen or wait for the screen to respond to inputs,2
9919,i've been through a lot of bluetooth headsets on the market and after hours or research and positive review reading i bought it,2
9920,eventually the release buttons wouldn't depress at all and i never felt like they were properly seated in my ears,2
9921,it is attractive but i definitely would not recommend this product,2
9922,this case does not protect the top of the phone is the same position,2
9923,using your phone while in the car if the battery is truly an authentic samsung product,2
9924,however the little indicator light on one of the ends i can get the plug to take i can charge my pebble,2
9925,it seems i may have to get another pair in 6 or 8 months,2
9926,good item for the first week but since i put my phone in it once so it's not like the one pictured,2
9927,case has to be removed in order for the charger to plug it back in to reset it each time you pick the phone up,2
9928,if you re like me and this is your first charger pad it will convince you to never buy one again,2
9929,it covers all of the back of the hatchback and put it on y ipod,2
9930,after using this case for about 2 weeks then one of the ears went dead,2
9931,don't waste you money on this one if you have any case at all,2
9932,the protection wasn't as good as a oem cable which it is not,2
9933,if it were not so inexpensive i would return it try my luck with a different brand and those survived,2
9934,it lasted for less than a month then took it off and switched to a cup-holder model,2
9935,when connecting the headset to my phone over and over again until i get a better case than this,2
9936,this is made out of i had planned to give this case a 2-star rating,2
9937,i can not use it because i feel like it does not have a cut-out on the front panel,2
9938,they won't be producing it for the rezound so i tried this one after striking out on a solar powered speaker system,2
9939,i personally like a scrren protector slightly smaller than the 3 g 3gs which the sleeve was technically made for,2
9940,it's kinda fast to drain esp when u don't use it anymore so it is of little use for me,2
9941,it's a nice case but it did not help,2
9942,however for only the privacy screen portion i have to give these only two stars unfortunate it's so thin that i prefer it anyway,2
9943,and on walking mode all the time it takes to arrive,2
9944,i'm not sure why this one is so slick that it was difficult to set up the phone,2
9945,note if you like to switch up the look of your phone a lot be it charging it using your earphones etc,2
9946,it's grippy just a little but that will probably break it,2
9947,the other problem is that it did not perform the way i would expect a case to last a week or two,2
9948,unfortunately this case leaves a lot to be desired and a lot to be desired,2
9949,this looks nice and does a good job keeping two devices recharged overnight,2
9950,i received the second order which actually came in a completely different packaging and are completely different screen protectors,2
9951,less than three months later however two of the tabs that hold the outer part of my ear,2
9952,the only thing i liked about the case is that there is a noticeable gap between the edges of the phone are pretty lame,2
9953,the aux cable that came with the s4 oem,2
9954,i would order a few at a time since they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time,2
9955,compared to the finiti the audio quality is bad and its echoing during calls,2
9956,it is not for the iphone 5 as it is not very user friendly once you put your phone in it,2
9957,i've tweaked mine and added 3rd party programs but you can't tell it with this phone,2
9958,prior to the iphone i had an at t tilt and never been completely satisfied with their performance,2
9959,the mount would not stick on the leather dash board,2
9960,this is a very slight movement but you can feel it every time you do that the ear bud gets crammed in your ear,2
9961,instead it's see through and i don't believe she was 3 months old and already upgraded,2
9962,-removing the battery can cause panic for some because i've found that other android phones are very reliable,2
9963,they talk about a front and back but it's too early to tell,2
9964,so it wasn't a big fan of this thing,2
9965,my final complaint is that the damn thing is too thick to actually fit all the way in your ear,2
9966,yes the time stamp and everything else you could think of,2
9967,i am going to buy samsung products i will go to the bank and dispute the charges,2
9968,if they called it 34 water resistant 34 i would have given it a much higher rating,2
9969,bummereffects some it stopped working after about a week or two,2
9970,but there's not a heck of a lot easier to use than a pocket is,2
9971,if the mount had worked it would have been good investment because of the reviews and ordered it,2
9972,the functionality of the touch screen it was hard to grip and got annoying so i got rid of it,2
9973,i received it a couple days ago and i must say i really hate this phone,2
9974,worked good for a few months i have to lower this from a three star down to a two star rating,2
9975,the case is perfect for my samsung galaxy s4,2
9976,it has done random unauthorized updates that have caused me to drop the rating down to 2 stars for this reason,2
9977,it's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price so why bother with case with an extra one,2
9978,there are dozens of professionally excellent photography apps for the iphone and even while left plugged in all night to get a 50 % charge,2
9979,the case is chipping on all four corners and can hear clicking sound at one corner bottom right,2
9980,i should have kept it and asked for a new one right away as it should be,2
9981,i assume if you can get used to the center button,2
9982,i've installed many screen protectors and while i'm driving so i can't hear the bbbuuuzzzzz sound on the table or etc,2
9983,i ordered them and was happy with the level of protection that you are getting,2
9984,one day i'll learn that you get what you pay for 34 really rings true here,2
9985,annoying if you're using some other case you'll have to start rebooting it phone calling good,2
9986,i choose this rating because the printing on the device says they should be 1a ports,2
9987,feel and durability of product are great but it does not fit my white 4s properly,2
9988,the grid only charges the phone and the plastic is cheap,2
9989,ordered 2 since the longer cables would be nice to have it auto dim or auto bright,2
9990,now the unit is useless since there is no way to publish a one star,2
9991,it took them a while to get it to work again,2
9992,finally after a lot of effort to squeeze the phone into the corners that i was concerned about damaging the screen,2
9993,this case was cute but i ended up not using it,2
9994,not a fan of this screen protector but was disappointed,2
9995,its pretty soft rubber so it doesn't look too big on my wrist,2
9996,to bad as i like the color but not the right fit,2
9997,it doesn't conform tight enough to the bottom of the screen which i will provide,2
9998,i even see that users of the iphone 5 screen are now dulled by the guard,2
9999,for me i could do without vocalist which i don't i find it to be more comfortable than most,2
