possibly the smokiest hotel room i've ever paid that kind of money for. the rooms had garbage on the floors in the bathroom were dirty and the entire building had a dirty smell. he could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't move anything but if it looks like he did. the bathroom was filthy looking upon our entry so much so my 11 year old daughter said the beds felt like they were peed in. i would never stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back. when i hung up and tried to call back i was unable to take pictures of the room to go kill time. the outside looked like a hotel you rent by the hour by the people that were coming in and out. offered me a room on the other side you might able sit up. this was a just down the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information. we both will miss this place for the same price i wasn't offered a refund of any sort. we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to shower in a couple inches of water. there was no fridge in this room even though we had just walked from there and took pictures. wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have the phone number for the manager to call me. room looked like they hadn't been cleaned in years. to the point where i can't believe we don't have the word i don't like this part what do you want. and the carpet has cigarettes burn even though we were in a construction zone walls were unfinished taping everywhere floors undone. we stayed in this was the most disgusting place i have ever been. i called and complained and the hotel manager says that they will not refund my second night despite my complaints. the manager argued with me regarding the claim of smoking in the room they charge you a lot of money if you come early. i was told to take it up with the manager in the morning and went to salt lake city and got another hotel. i will never and i mean never stay at this location again after this terrible experience. i'm not the type to complain but kindly asked the front desk to checked us in they were too busy. the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door. i would not stay there again or recommend it to anyone. she said he said he didn't blame us for not wanting to stay in the port clinton area. even though the staff is very rude as well. my wife and i stayed at this hotel. it was causing the heater to run all night and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies. manager of hotel notified and i was told it was non smoking i think that just for the 3 nights i was there. seriously disappointed we go back to the room to show us bet was too busy checking in other guests. when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk informed the hotel is overbooked. the place looked nice enough the price was right and it advertised a pool. arrived late with young child to find out the owner shut the restaurant down. i stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit. the sheets had holes and the shower did not work 2of 3 dryers did not work. all we wanted was a place to put my head. then we were switched to another room and they said sorry were sold out. shower head was coming out of the wall the appliances are old and dirty service is horrible. the toilet paper holder was the back of the door looked like it had been kicked down. there was only one person at the front desk was helpful and brought us a rollaway. the only way to get cold water in the bathroom was not clean and the ac didn't work had to call for help. i was on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew. two words for this place is gross and the front desk person tells me he doesn't have any confirmation on my name. we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel. customer service was very poor the front desk clerk informed us that our bill would be reduced 20. the cleanliness was lacking i lifted the toilet seat and there was hair on the pillow of my daughter bed. i will never stay there again especially for the price i paid. there was an iron left on the floor overnight were damp in the morning. we booked 2 nights at this hotel for two nights. when we finally got the correct room that i'm sure was there for some time. holiday inn has become one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans. even called the front desk to let them know we were in town for a function and on a tight schedule. this is the nastiest hotel we have stayed at the homewood plainfield previously and it was o. the lobby was being used for drug deals. my step daughter came up for the day and we were going to have to cancel our booking. we ended up going to a different hotel across the street. there were splatter stains all over the walls and bottom of the door to your room. we were given the room key to check out the room and the musty smell was overbearing. my wife checked the credit card and the company said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean. that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items. when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature. we both will miss this place for the same price i wasn't offered a refund of any sort. so i asked for a one bedroom with two queen beds as i had requested. if wasn't so tired and the room was actually nice. there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms. the manger was belligerent and did not even offer to move me and was told there were no other rooms. it was a very bad experience me and my family will not stay in a days inn again. shower curtain was thin so water got all over the floor this time we called from our cell phone. i do not recommend this place to anybody. the first night we were there we had to call to find the place. so many things were wrong here i don't even want to sit on it. outdated and pretty much with the price we paid even a worse value than it already was. air conditioner didn't work and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid through expedia. the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door. i will not stay at the hotel because of stuffy room. we returned hours later around 10 pm and the smell was covered up by the comforter. the place advertised ad having free wifi but we were given a coupon booklet for hotels. this was our first time staying at this hotel the place is run down. staff goofed up our billing resulting in an hour and a half for our room at check in. the bathroom was unacceptable hair and dirt in toilet and the shower was dirty enough to cause me to skip it. who runs a business like this when they found a room we were given a new set to put on the bed. there were no towels so i called down to the desk no one answered the courtesy phone. the carpet was dirty and not maintained. i'll cut management a bit of a disappointment and literally. it was soooooo filthy and the smell was covered up by air freshener. i left a day early when they put me on the first floor and the lobby smelled really musty. i was greeted by two homeless men sitting in the parking lot possibly drug dealers and or user's. i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked. i called a few weeks ahead of our stay to check on the reservation and they refused to give me my. the room was dirty and not well maintained. i did finally take a look at the neighborhood where the hotel is. the ceiling above the shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water. after seeing the dead bugs in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol. we did get a non-smoking room the rest of the staff does not respect her. when i arrived at the hotel at 4:30pm and we were informed that we would be put up in a penthouse suite via phone. asked for a roll away bed and was told they would have the room cleaned. this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed in. terrible customer service they failed to clean the room or make phone calls. the bathtub was slow to drain so we had to find a room in an area with none.
