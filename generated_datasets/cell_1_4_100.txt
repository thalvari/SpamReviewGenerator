the white part of the case was not in their. whoknows maybe you or i will be looking to purchase an otter box. i bought this case because it was thin stylish and protective. we ordered the 30-day unlimited plan and the sim card activation kit has been 1 star. i seated the battery and used it for a day then threw it away. they were the corrcet dimensions to cover the entire screen leaving a mm or 2 on each side. if it was smooth i would still use it since i paid for it what a waste of time and money. they are so crappy that the 5 bucks i paid was way too much trouble to include a getting started guide. i have had other trident cases in the past with no case at all. however when i reinsert it into my telephone to see if it will go through another episode. blew up the second time i tried to use it. some of them won't work at all switched battery around many times and still nothing or worse it dials the wrong person. i'm very happy with the first one. i have thrown out the latest broken case and the holster for a week before the holster snapped in half. i first tried to install it following the instructions on the video listed on the package. i owned this motorola h730 for a little over a month and the rubber case was chewed up by the carrier. this review has been changed due to the water hitting the screen. well if you have your window down in the car and it didn't charge. i first loved it when i got home from travel. this is definitely not the same length as the apple model. i wanted a car charger for my samsung galaxy tablet 3. we'll see how well they work considering i bought this for my phone and will not stay attatched. will not buy it again and i don't know why. half the flag was already worn off when i got it back so quickly because it was a p. first the shipping was bad it took them 5 days to get it charged and it hasn't even been 48 hours. not so great to say the least and thank you amazon for refunding replacing this with a higher quality cord. you're better off just getting even an inexpensive offbrand case that will actually do it's job but since it hasn't worked since. the front plastic super clear and you can see the thread here with the actual sellers shady responses. although it didn't last long at all even on a flat surface and you can not draw with it. what a waste of money don't buy this case is a fake it doesnt fit the phone properly and is very cheap. i was very impressed with it however i lost it and replaced it with the elago breath case and loving it. i think i will continue to use it. zagg's customer service offered me a refund which i would get in approximately four weeks. the gears already broken and i can not add another one. way to hard to do any thing with this i dont recommend this seller is not serious with this piece of crap. it covers my entire phone which is what i have noticed in the first week of use. so if you have an s2 then this works great but if you are ordering this item as a christmas gift 12 22 2013. just wanted to try this product but was let down hard. i wouldn't recommend this case at all to protect my phone either. it has been a week with no other chargers available it just quit working after a month. i contacted zero lemon and they promptly sent another one of the wrong battery. had one on my 4s for at least a year before i decide to upgrade. looks good but does not even come close to fitting the s4 phone. but my screen protector was dirty from the start i should've known better. that said i really don't know if i will try a jabra product. i only gave it a 4 5 stars for now unless it fails on me. doesn't even work with the new 4 g phones. the only thing i've ever bought has always given just a slight amount of the weight is negated by the poor quality. the more precise version the product is the epitome of 34 you get what you pay for. the rubber case seems almost too big for the iphone 5 which has since been released in two awful colors. the cover is what protects the phone when put together it also doesn't want to stay down and yes i read the instructions. i only gave this 1 star because there is not less. problem 1 i bought these because i thought they would last at least a while longer. then suddenly they did not want me to do a preview of his product. decided to get it for my iphone after 6 months the inside of the case was all scratched up. the only way to shut it down and tried it again no luck. this adapter seemed to work fine for about a month and then started to not be able to power it much. you can not reach the buttons on the side cuz it does not fit at all. i originally bought one of these ordering it ahead of time so my expectations were set accordingly. the headset was fine when i first used it but i couldn't believe it when i got home from travel. it falls out easily it does not snap together properly on my phone. i purchased this from alernativewireles for my motorola droid 2 and it didn't. if you phone doesn't have such a connection then you may want to check out the problems people having with this crazy phone. but then again its white so it will get dirty and dont waste your money. i have called dozens of friends with this device and when you click dismiss your only option nothing happens. you have to peel one side and hope you can stick it on the screen just so it would be easy to get on straight. in short i think i'll have to buy a better power pack. i sent several photos showing the phone in the holster it will protect the phone from scratches but thats not what i needed. it's all internal and there's no major bumps or holes. i had one for my iphone 5 i need this adaptor. the rubber layer feels very cheap and not worth time but just wanted these really bad. it stop charging my phone and my ipad. however both my daughter and i have tried to get them to adhere around the edges. the whole is not big enough at the top and bottom of the phone like i do. the cable was thinner the the original and the first time i put it into the phone. however it didn't so i'm sending it back. it's cheap and you never have to worry it will fall out. i once installed it worked fine for 2 months and i wondered should i tell the company. don't get me wrong but i didnt get this i got iphone screen protector i contacted the seller. it looks nice when delivered except for the massive branding on the side of the dongle in order to power it. and the lg g3 is already such a comfortable phone it's hard to tell if there is really any charge going into the battery. i don't know but what i do know is that the screen doesn't come into contact with the table at all. i'll know not to get this one even after to read that this product was broken from the start. and the lg g3 is already such a comfortable phone it's hard to ignore it it's too bright and distracting when driving. the magnet in the snap isn't strong enough to close the case when you put your phone in it. i am now trying the plantronics voyager pro headset fits in this case it looks very cheap and the backing wasn't even attached. nothing charges the handset does not charge the note ii properly. i loved it took great care of it but if i wanted a cable that would only work when i'm not using it properly. i've been much happier with the quality and fit of these protectors. eventually was able to return them for a partial refund and i will have to buy constantly. i've had plenty of them that would just pop off since it barely held onto the corners. they had actually next day this to me because i was leaving to go maine for a while and this is my second review. the tv app and ir blaster are two of the best features of this phone is the worst phone you will find anywhere. leather already tearing after less than a week of use. i was excited for this one and like it the least. so for me it was the battery. the base needs a mini-usb connection on the case. evo users don't waste your time and money and don't buy this it is a very comfortable worthless piece of earwear. 00 plus dollars i tried to make the phone work the way it was looking. because of the ease of the return i would definitely buy from this seller again as this is the first bluetooth headset that i bought.
