591,the courtyard was a great place to stay and the breakfast each morning was delicious and available until 10 a,4

601,my only bad point was the pool area far too small for the amount of time that we spent in the room,4
602,right on the beach close to the action but far enough away to be very quite,4
603,otherwise it is a nice place and the staff is very helpful,4
604,there's so much to see and do both historic and gourmet,4
605,there was a noisy party going on in the hotel lobby and rooms are very clean,4

618,this place was right off the interstate rt,4
619,it was very clean and comfortable room a lot,4
620,other than that issue my stay was very nice except for noise,4

623,the hotel is fine and the room was in pretty good shape,4
624,they were very courteous picked us up stopped so we were able to manage through them which turned out to be excellent,4

637,2 they listed on their amenities that they have a dog policy that is not made very clear on hotels,4
638,the free breakfast offered the usual continental fare of cereal rolls juice yoghurt,4
639,the first two times i stayed at another chain hotel just across the street from the public landing far enough to not be problematic,4
640,the room was clean and well maintained but could use updating,4
641,i was greeted very warmly and since i had a late check-in at this hotel as i was attending a military function,4
642,when i visit a hotel i want a nice clean quiet place to stay and there is no refund if illness etc,4
643,all in all not to bad would like to see microwave or small fridge,4
644,another reason to stay at this price point near the airport,4
645,check in was quick the staff at the reception were courteous and helpful,4
646,i stayed for five nights at this hotel to service your comfort,4
647,the food isn't as good as other hie but enough to get you on the road again,4
648,great service not a bad hotel over all,4

714,we had a large corner room on the top floor with neighbors who didn't allow their doors to slam,4

717,large pool was very nice and clean,4
718,large hot included breakfast free wi-fi and plenty of room,4
719,i called to try for a last minute stop it was ok,4

744,we would definitely stay here again when we're in grand junction due to the location,4
745,we had a room on the 1st floor,4
746,this homewood suites is a very nice modern lodge literally right next to the bed so it got rather cold,4
747,nothing fancy but for the price you can't beat the location,4
748,like most places on the oregon coast it's a bit like a restaurant charging you extra to use cutlery,4
749,the hotel is very clean and well kept even if it was a little more roomy,4
750,the other room was very nice no complaint's the breakfast was very good and service was mostly great throughout,4
751,the only problem is their wifi is spotty if you're in the city but convenient for business great exercise facilities for working out,4
752,this hotel was in a great location the only reason why i couldn't give it 5 stars was the pool,4
753,for the price we paid and all the other great things that the french quarter has to offer,4
754,the owners were helpful and very friendly all the time,4
755,second the inside lower edge of the bathroom door otherwise the room was nice and fresh,4
756,the hotel was not so close to the boardwalk we saved money on parking,4

766,my ac was broken and it was titling to one side,4
767,as another reviewer noted there is an odor in the lobby and also in the pool area,4
768,we needed a place to sleep have a quick breakfast in the morning with no atlanta or chattanooga traffic,4
769,we only ate there once then went out for the rest of our trip or lost our cash,4
770,there were some cleaning details in the room that was the only minus,4
771,this was just an over night stay for us but we enjoyed it and would do it again,4
772,this is our second stay at the hotel an der philharmonie very much,4
773,but i would still recommend this hotel and i plan to stay here anytime we visit alamosa,4
774,this hotel was very convenient to the beach,4
775,me and hubby are getting older and to make several trips up and down the hallways late at night and early in the morning,4
776,the only problem we had was that the pillows were too,4
777,so this best western in sunnyvale was about 20 minutes away easy to find and walking distance to everything along the waterfront,4
778,the facility appears to be older but our room was fine so we could live with that,4
779,209 has a private deck and a view of the golden gate bridge from our room 313,4

787,this hotel was great the only thing missing was a measuring cup for cooking,4
788,the hotel was close to her and it was just fine the bathroom was small but room was good size clean and comfortable,4
789,there was a small hole in one wall the sheets on the bed comforter sandwiched between two sheets in the closet,4
790,there were a lot of dogs in the motel but if i had not called back to the hotel exhausted and filthy,4
791,it is not located downtown with the restaurants shops etc but is convenient to the interstate yet far enough away to be more affordable,4
792,very clean and the staff are friendly and room is clean,4
793,fourth visit good location for my purposes not to far from the airport but it's worth the money,4

795,they had a decent continental breakfast each morning which is more than sufficient,4
796,room was a suite and it was very clean and i would recommend this facility to others,4
797,unfortunately we only stayed one night to break up the trip in the future,4
798,if you need something after hours the front desk staff was not very friendly felt as if i was bothering her,4
799,bed was comfy and had plenty of room for our family of 4,4
800,we've stayed this hotel a couple of times in the last month and have usually found it to be of rag quality,4
801,so instead of having a view of the lake through the trees,4
802,good location a couple of blocks away from the main street due to noise and foot traffic,4
803,the rooms were clean and well-maintained the beds are comfortable and it is quiet,4
804,the hallway is a bit small but manageable,4
805,this hotel was clean quiet and friendly service,4

807,good location has a pool the size of the room and extra perks eg,4
808,just what you need to give the kids some swimming time,4
809,after a long debate the clerk gave me a non-smoking room but i am not sure i would have liked,4
810,easy access to sites in san antonio without being right in the centre of the island to the latter,4
811,i would definitely stay in this hotel the rooms are lovely the meeting spaces were great,4
812,and lastly our room was not ready until an hour and a half complete with hot food,4
813,the breakfast is nothing special but the people at the cinder winery garden city i d to be very friendly and helpful,4

817,we had a nice room with a beautiful deck overlooking zion,4
818,we really enjoyed our stay at bayside resort,4
819,upon checking into the hotel i was told that the room above us,4
820,the favorite part of my stay was that much more enjoyable,4
821,however it is an uphill direction if you are not from around there you could easily go to the wrong one,4
822,it was my first time to stay at hotel deca as it was close to family members we were in town for,4
823,we usually like americinns and this one was just as good as i remembered from two years ago,4
824,we especially loved the pillows on the bed and plenty of towels,4
825,this stay we had a room on the second floor,4

831,you have to ask for a room on the first floor,4
832,our room was right next to the convention center didn't have to book 2 nights due to the packer game,4
833,despite having people above and next door to me there was no noise level to speak of in our room,4
834,the only downside was that for the price it was overall very good,4
835,the pluses hotel is in a nice area,4
836,nos there is no parking in the hotel lot is difficult but there are two shuttles nearby that can take you straight there,4

840,and is always nice to have a completely smoke free environment,4

851,bedroom was small but the staff was very nice and clean,4
852,older hotel with not much in the way of restaurants and shops etc,4
853,seemed odd though that there wasn't a refrigerator in our room but solid in the sitting,4
854,when i entered my room on the third floor and he found us one,4
855,the staff was great the rooms were clean and quiet,4
856,have stayed here in the past but this time i had the 3rd floor and the pipes are loud,4
857,when we called to ask if they had a package deal like some of the other restaurants in the area both cheap,4
858,i loved that it was a great stay,4
859,only stayed one night and the room was never cleaned which was very disappointing as well,4
860,apartment has been renovated and looks new although the bathroom does not have a pool or a fitness center,4
861,wish the pool was heated though since it would have been much more convenient for me to stay in another location,4
862,take a harbor view if you want to go and do,4
863,easy walking distance to good restaurants and away from the street and road noise,4
864,the hotel rooms are a bit dated but the staff is excellent and the driver was a really nice hotel for the money,4
865,it's good experience the location of the hotel if you need to,4
866,the room we had was very clean the beds were firm and i had a very pleasant stay,4
867,there were teenagers also staying there and the front desk staff and housekeeping were great,4
868,turned out to be the perfect place for an extended stay,4
869,they allow pets without a fee or deposit which was a big plus for me was that the indoor pool stays open until 11 pm,4
870,great hotel with very spacious rooms a nice bar and nice rooms so you never have to leave the property,4
871,we pretty much took the lyft everywhere we needed to go which wasn't too pleasant when it rained on us,4
872,we arrived to find that although we had booked a room with a hot tub,4
873,the tv remote didn't work but i was too tired to care much at that point,4
874,will most likely stay at this hotel when i visit sarasota,4
875,clean comfy room for the price of it,4
876,mid week we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go to relax and sleep in,4
877,it was so not busy when we were there there was a king bed and a pull out couch,4
878,the shower was a little noisy but be were still able to get a very good night sleep,4
879,room heater was a little noisy in the morning but really no complaints,4
880,a nice walk up to or down to the free gondola to head into town or into the heart of mountain village,4
881,the rooms are clean and the beds were soft and comfortable but you need to get on your knees to access it,4
882,i recommend highly and will return next time i'm in the area,4

893,the decor of the room was great in every way,4
894,most of all i had a quiet night sleep unlike the last stay at this facility was about 10 years ago,4
895,so about 5 00 pm we asked the front desk staff does their best to meet your request,4
896,it was clean and comfortable and away from the street otherwise great place and breakfast was good,4
897,however there is only one elevator and it is not handicap accessible,4
898,what it consists of is early check-in to check-out,4
899,hotel looks iffy on the outside but it is nice to count on a microwave and refrigerator,4
900,also the room did not have blankets for sofa bed called the front desk and management we dealt we were very poor,4
901,very happy overall with the hotel clean comfy room close to the station and only 2 stops to boston downtown,4
902,i need a secure quiet place to sleep and it fits the bill perfectly,4
903,on the plus size even the basic rooms are quite nice the service is good as well as the restaurant attached,4
904,the only down side was that the pool was closed at a time it was advertised as open,4
905,location is good we were there for was not formal,4
906,this was my first time of using this hotel i would think that breakfast would be included,4
907,everything was nice and the staff were all very pleasant,4
908,we rented a cabin and was very impressed with the staff at this resort are all so friendly and helpful with any questions,4
909,not to happy to get a room with 2 beds which were full size and not queens,4
910,restaurant was ok but a bit overpriced for what we thought we were going to have queen beds but they were only double,4
911,we will stay there the next time we are in town,4
912,the beds were very comfortable our mini-fridge and some lights in the room that was very dirty,4
913,there was a great little disc golf course just a few blocks from the subway and not far from food farmers market and coffee,4
914,there's a sign on the main road and does not stand out,4
915,alls good for the price paid and quiet,4
916,not bad considering the proximity to the casino is excellent and there is a luggage lift to take bags up to the 2nd floor,4
917,great room keurig in the room with you,4
918,the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable and there was a spacious room for eating,4
919,first they put us in a room where it is cooler outside than in,4
920,hotel is 13 years old but looked like it was located in a convenient location for us,4
921,the only bad thing was the breakfast as i am a bit of a drive to the beach the gorge or downtown,4
922,happy with overall stay fast and friendly check in room was nice and clean and check-in out was efficient,4
923,the rooms were clean modern and they had several hotels that would give you a special medical rate,4
924,i was late in looking for a hotel just for the,4
925,i enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay again the next time we visit,4
926,only negatives are wifi needs improved and would be nice to be able to stay at a kimpton hotel on future trips,4
927,as opposed to the staff at the desk are very helpful and the staff were very accommodating and i very much appreciated the courtesy,4
928,left a shirt in the room and lobby were very nice,4
929,breakfast was ok but it was actually pretty nice and the guy at the front desk but got no answer,4
930,she made sure we had a quaint historic lodging that was comfortable and walking distance to a chinese restaurant burgerville and a liquor store,4
931,it's quite typical of the chain in its facilities and we found it is the best hotel and casino in,4
932,hotel is a little out of the way if you want to see in l,4
933,it was clean quiet well maintained and very comfortable and i felt very safe even walking at night,4
934,rooms are very large clean and the beds were soft and staff was pleasant,4
935,i liked the fact that there was free wifi and plenty of room,4
936,service was very good and the bed were not very comfortable,4
937,the facility was clean and the staff was nice and breakfast was great,4
938,coffee available at all times and the breakfast is better than no breakfast but still a bummer,4
939,to reach the beach you go down a steep staircase but there are a lot of car break-ins,4
940,i have dogs but could tell it was a newer hotel,4
941,for the price we got a good night's sleep,4
942,the receptionist was a charming lady and the rest of my stay was i forgot my prescription sunglasses in the room,4
943,the sights and activities were all within a short walk from back bay station and copley square,4
944,its an older hotel and there is a lot of traffic out the front of the hotel and the area,4
945,it is consistently clean and comfortable with a large clean room and helpful staff,4
946,it's a great value for the little cost of the room and they called within 20 minutes to let us know,4
947,excellent location basic but clean rooms free coffee in the lobby and off you go,4
948,no better place in town for the fireworks show at ung,4
949,it took the staff a long time to check in because the computer system was down butt that was not their fault,4
950,it was large and comfortable and came with four good pillows,4
951,the service in the hotel is awesome too,4
952,i can see how some people would find this cluttered but it's not close enough to walk into town,4
953,with all this though everything was clean and looked cared for,4
954,195 room rate plus tax was excessive didn't feel like paying the higher rates and parking fees associated with downtown,4
955,the room was clean and comfortable including the beds and pillows were comfortable and it quiet compared to other locations we have stayed at,4
956,it was great to get up in the morning we don't feel like we're paralyzed,4
957,the room was clean very nicely decorated spacious and all the facilities especially the pool and breakfast,4
958,i am a picky person especially when it comes to traveling these days especially for families,4
959,the location is also very good depending on what you want to visit on oahu i strongly recommend using the economical and,4
960,for the price it was more than i expected fir this type of hotel is good for an overnight or a short stay,4
961,not far from all of the staff were very helpful,4
962,i do recommend it and of course will stay again if we are in the process of being completed and hopefully will continue,4
963,the cleanliness in the room could have been a bit overpriced but these days everyone wants to take all your money,4
964,i made the initial reservation and called back and asked for a quieter room being an insomniac this would have driven,4
965,buffet breakfast is expensive was not included in the price and was wonderful,4
966,convenient location close to the car ferry to bellagio with easy access to both the mit and harvard campuses,4
967,the room itself was a bit sketchy but i will book again next time check suite out before unpacking,4
968,my husband and i stayed with my husband's cousin for a couple of days,4
969,i selected this hotel because of its location a 5 minute walk to the train station,4
970,not a bad place for an overnight stay and settled on,4
971,our stay was extended so i had to sleep on the weekend,4

973,perfect place we stayed for 3 days and even though we were on the 4th floor it was quiet,4
974,i was very surprised how nice big the room was when i arrived,4
975,i was in virginia beach for a business trip and i would have to wait on it often,4
976,my 12 year old slept on the pull out sofa mattress was not very nice could feel the springs move and you adjusted positions,4
977,very professional service from the front desk to the shuttle drivers,4

979,the fitness center is modest but ok and typical for a hotel but nice to have included,4
980,we didn't have any available so we had to do in the yarmouth area,4
981,our room was on the quiet side of the hotel the view was of the east side dwntwn and the back of some buildings,4
982,i wish i had been made aware before booking it would have been nice to have breakfast earlier,4

988,the room was comfortable and the staff is friendly and was helpful in giving us directions,4

990,the decor is straight out of the oven they were delicious,4
991,enjoyed our stay the staff were great and location is fantastic,4
992,there is a car park attached to the hotel is a 5 minute walk on to the university of hamburg campus,4

994,the kitchen was well supplied although some glasses were missing and there was no closet had to hang clothes on,4
995,great for one night budget stay when in the area again and need a room i d stay again,4
996,although it's huge it is in need of an update but location is good,4
997,we specifically picked this hotel because of its good price decent reviews and close proximity to the entrance of zion national park,4
998,i booked this room online from trip advisor when i pulled up i could hear what sounded like sea lions and i was right,4
999,our room door was very difficult to operate and broken deadbolt,4
1000,however the headboard to the bed was not done and the towels all over the floor no towels to clean with and no,4
1001,no smoke smell at all it was great because my husband is a truck driver and he thought it was a great value,4

1003,the hotel is very clean and the front desk staff was friendly and very accommodating,4
1004,wifi is not included in the price and was wonderful,4
1005,my only objection is that the hotel is advertised with a pool but clearly was not usable,4
1006,we had to walk across the street to a great beach at,4
1007,nothing fancy but a decent place to stay for a bargain price perfect for one or two people but not for three or four,4
1008,marina neighborhood is great for walking or running,4
1009,would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to eat was across the parking lot helped greatly also,4
1010,owner operators are great rooms are clean and large with microwave tv etc,4
1011,the atmosphere of the hotel was great but it was difficult to find a parking spot if returning to the hotel late at night,4
1012,being close the mall is probably the best in the keys,4
1013,when we got to our room and before we could get in safe area,4
1014,the location is awesome which is right next to the bed so it got rather cold,4
1015,they let us check in early and get parked right away,4
1016,i'm not a light sleeper so it didn't ever get fixed while we were there,4
1017,the only problem is their wifi is spotty if you're in a hurry and a grocery store is minutes away,4
1018,when i got in there was water all over the floor,4
1019,tv cable was limited tv's really need to be updated but for a few day stay it's manageable,4
1020,good motel and a great location was close to all the action places in hollywood since that was my purpose,4
1021,the hotel has been recently renovated and was very clean as was fridge mattress was firm not sagging worn out,4
1022,the shower door would not close all the way so the bright parking lot light was shining in,4
1023,we had to carry a lot of personals would have been nice to have a microwave and stove to a bar sink,4
1024,breakfast was not as good as the last one but everything else was awesome i'd stay there again very nice hotel,4
1025,my only complaint was that the bed was way too soft,4
1026,if you bring a pet your room will not be nearly as nice as the big name hotels in the area,4
1027,we stayed their one night on our way to the beach and we certainly got a lovely view,4
1028,the attendant put us in the middle of nowhere with hotels to match but this was a very nice size for 2 people,4
1029,i stayed here while in town for a comedy show at the arlington improv this hotel was a great hotel,4
1030,so when we travel it's alway a gamble to find a hotel like this in crystal lake,4
1031,the bathroom was a bit on the small size but we had a wonderful weekend away,4
1032,but overall it's a great value for the money and we've stayed in several of the hotels in the area,4
1033,this hotel is a short walk to the very center,4

1042,excellent location basic but clean rooms free coffee in the lobby and elevator area from the work going on,4
1043,we liked the area around the hotel to park in but luckily we did not have to drive into the city until morning,4
1044,finding the promised coffee maker was a bit of false advertising by expedia at the hotel monaco,4
1045,however i was in a first floor room as i requested,4
1046,overall i would not hesitate to stay here anytime we visit alamosa,4
1047,the parking is extremely tight so if you have a lake view with a balcony,4
1048,this hotel was in a good location close to everything and right on the boardwalk,4
1049,you are across the street from the hostel and just a couple of stops on the way,4
1050,sharing baked brie and the marinated olives at a table for two with chairs which could be used for eating,4

1059,good convince close to a lot of restaurants,4
1060,we didn't use the pool hot tub and sauna,4

1063,the location was perfect and the room was nice and clean,4
1064,each day i would come back here definitely,4
1065,i was very impressed with the overall appearance of the room and it barked the whole time they were out,4
1066,we were passing through so we only stayed one night so can't say much about life around the hotel,4
1067,the room was nice and clean across the street from another in this area,4
1068,better than other laqunita's that we have stayed at in the cape for this price that i would gladly return to,4
1069,we were glad to have a clean room close to the station and only 2 stops to boston downtown,4
1070,comfortable beds nice to have a microwave and stove to a bar sink,4

1234,also the fan in the bathroom had a large double sweater jacuzzi shower,4
1235,our room did not have a vehicle it is a bit surprising as there are so many good restaurants near by,4

1249,in fact after staying here i have stayed at but it was far better than most,4
1250,late night noise disruptions but i think a little is to be expected with a motel at the cape,4
1251,i didn't do the breakfast or anything so i can't compare to the competition though,4
1252,the staff was very friendly and accommodating i would not change a hotel because of the small town old fashioned atmosphere,4
1253,we didn't experience breakfast as we had to attend an event at riverside convention center,4
1254,we didn't have the kids with us and it was getting late,4
1255,both times we've enjoyed our stay finding the rooms to be clean and quiet except for highway traffic noise,4

1257,was close to highway but didn't really notice noise from the planes,4
1258,breakfast was good but a bit sparse however there is a denny's across the parking lot and you can bet the thieves know this,4

1260,house keeping forgot to make up the bed for my son,4
1261,with so many guests present they didn't have any issues while out at night,4

1266,the place looks great and the staff was very friendly and helpful,4

1590,offered to check with manager but we did not utilize it because we were only in town for two nights over a weekend,4
1591,my only issue would be the size of the bathrooms the staff the pool and the hotel very much,4
1592,the person checking us in was not happy with hotels,4
1593,this motel doesn't look like much from the outside but it is nice to count on a microwave and refrigerator,4
1594,this hotel is close enough to the freeway but not too noisy,4
1595,i believe the best part of the room,4
1596,i have stayed at this hotel previously and enjoy the location and comfort of the place it should be cheaper otherwise needs to have,4
1597,main ice machine in our end was not working and i was advised a contractor had been called,4
1598,the only negative was are room was by trash area but i think it may just be super well maintained,4
1599,this was a very nice stay for the money,4
1600,have been there several times over the years just for a quick couples getaway,4
1601,the front desk was really friendly when we checked in until we checked out and they charge you the bill which was 460,4
1602,the bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when i got to my room it was still occupied and dirty,4
1603,she said she must use the rate shown on her computer even though it was booked solid with the other athletes and their families,4
1604,spurs and just needed a place to spend the weekend,4
1605,room had a jacuzzi tub and came with a bottle of champagne and chocolates breakfast for two and late check-out,4
1606,i usually have a hard time sleeping thinking my truck was going to be like because the lady at the front desk was slow,4
1607,free parking across the street and that was not so nice,4
1608,otherwise the room was wonderful and the bed was very comfortable,4
1609,also has bags to p u poop and a place to hang out for the day while we waited to fly home again,4
1610,overall this was an an enjoyable stay and we would stay here,4
1611,our family stayed here for an overnight because we were unable to secure a suitable room in cave city,4
1612,we asked to be moved they had no hesitancy in changing our room when the heater was not working properly,4
1613,the location is within walking distance to the koka ampitheater which is where we were going so it was a very nice and quite location,4
1614,the street noise is a little much and the walls are thin bit with the tv on we slept well,4
1615,the rooms are big and clean with fridge and microwave and a corner table and chairs,4
1616,the room was large and even had a shuttle to and from the hotel and the business next door a service station,4
1617,i was a little leery of what the room would be a little bogger but it was smaller,4
1618,we've even purchased two weeks so that we could not hear the traffic,4
1619,but i didn't hear any air noise,4
1620,hot tub water the way it should have but other than that everything was wonderful,4
1621,our first room had an unmade bed it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the sea view motel,4
1622,but for the length of time we were there which was half the week,4
1623,i wish there was a coffee maker in the room and lobby were very nice,4
1624,we needed a place to stay the night because we were visiting from fresno,4
1625,the only reason i gave it a shot,4
1626,it's conveniently located near the highway and is close to caprock were we worked for couple weeks,4
1627,we stayed here for about a week and had a great view of the beach right out our door,4
1628,we arrived at 4 pm check-in is quick even though i had to wait a long time for the shuttle van,4
1629,no desk to write and only 1 chair in the room that was the only minus,4
1630,the room we clean but we have to go to the pool but it looked nice,4
1631,it was a quick 5 minute trip but it's not posted and pool was closed not good,4
1632,however we needed a double queen bed room and they were able to accommodate us and we were pleased with our two night stay,4
1633,i needed a room with a balcony overlooking the water where two swans hung-out,4
1634,one problem for those who can not climb stairs is that there is no elevator so you have to drive to get to restaurants,4
1635,the front desk attendant was very helpful in helping us with directions,4
1636,other than having excess light it was a great place to stay if you are passing through,4
1637,under construction otherwise a great place to stay,4
1638,wi-fi was easy to connect to and we had no trouble adding a couple days to our existing reservation,4
1639,found grand junction as a nice place to stop if your heading to florida,4
1640,room was clean and listening to the waves from the balcony was a lovely bonus with the sound of the river nearby,4
1641,for under 100 including taxes this is a great place to stay in the hotel with good food and great service,4
1642,the hotel is in the heart of town next to many restaurants and bars and overall we were very satisfied,4
1643,the thing to note is that this is a brand new hotel but more like an awesome old bed and breakfast,4
1644,i was there four days and i have to admit my husband and i were in town for a graduation memorial weekend,4
1645,there were a number of restaurants and a clean well appointed room,4

1647,25 the gym facilities were nice and the breakfast was mediocre but staff was excellent friendly and helpful,4
1648,the rooms were clean and spacious and pretty quiet even though we were next to a highway it was so quiet at night,4
1649,the hotel was fully booked and we couldn't shake the feeling for a while,4
1650,the hotel was good for the low price of the room was quite comfortable,4
1651,our kids were happy to swim in the pools even the heated one,4
1652,only downsides were the wifi wasn't great but i don't respond to sour body language however my stay is excellent,4
1653,we arrived late and the hotel staff were nice people helpful and speak english,4

1662,night we checked in we found ants in the room and there was only one working socket in the room,4
1663,the hotel is nothing fancy but gets the job done it's no frills but that's to be expected,4
1664,i stayed in the hotel to attend the pilgrimage tours,4
1665,this was a great value for the city,4
1666,this was our first time staying in a regular double room and we were given an inferiour room because it was booked through hotel,4
1667,they let us check in early and get parked right away,4
1668,elegant without being fussy very friendly and accommodating i would not change a thing,4
1669,i ran the boston marathon and stayed as a stopover spot coming back to georgia from louisianna,4
1670,my family and i enjoyed our stay at this aging but consumer friendly hotel,4
1671,staff went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible,4
1672,we even decided that we would probably stay again but would ask for a different room because of the housekeeping was running behind,4
1673,other than the chlorine problem the place was nice as they were here for my wedding,4
1674,free on-premise parking free wi-fi allowance but if you wanted more you had to pay for parking,4
1675,we decided to stay an extra night but the front desk provided us with extra ice buckets to help keep our drinks,4
1676,hotel was in a great location in this quaint town,4
1677,i was able to hear some noise from the road but the breakfast itself is fairly mediocre,4
1678,room was clean and spacious and quiet,4
1679,the room was fresh and clean i will be staying at the candlewood again,4
1680,the parking is extremely tight so if you have a flight subsequent days are charged at a very nominal fee,4
1681,the hotel looks 70's-ish on the outside but the inside could use some work,4
1682,the lobby at twelve is a great place to spend a week in paradise,4
1683,if possible ask for a room with a terrace over looking the water,4
1684,great location to investigate the french quarter but far enough away too especially since i stayed over a weekend,4
1685,i'd read reviews and decided to book with quality inn,4
1686,only a five-minute walk from the main railway station and maybe a minute's walk from the rhine,4
1687,with so many guests present they didn't have enough bathtowels we had to wait for them,4
1688,the reason i couldn't give this hotel a bad rating,4
1689,very comfortable rooms will stay again when i'm in town i will be trying to stay here,4
1690,otherwise the room and breakfast area great service,4
1691,overall i would recommend this hotel highly to anyone who is trying to just get away for a few days of business,4

1696,it's conveniently located near the highway and far from the beaches and downtown,4
1697,this is very affordable and the rooms are very roomy and are extremely clean,4

1701,multiple places deliver to the hotel if you rented a car,4
1702,everything at the hotel was excellent the staff were very friendly and the breakfast while simple was fresh and well maintained,4

1898,we booked a one night stay king room,4
1899,now besides the items i mentioned it really was a nice place for the price good free cont breakfast in the am and no surprises,4
1900,my room was ready at check in staff was very personable and accommodating,4
1901,plenty of eateries so you can't go wrong with the price,4
1902,i need a secure quiet place to sleep and it fits the bill perfectly,4
1903,it was very clean and the staff was nice and friendly the room was comfortable fridge was well chilled and the ac did what it,4
1904,there was a good restaurant right next door and the location is a quick drive or short ride walk into the center of town,4
1905,drinks and meals are very expensive compared to other rooms and rates i would do it again,4
1906,our room was nice and so were the furnishings but all in all it was a good stay,4
1907,com and the close proximity to the interstate but it wasn't good at all,4
1908,we even decided that we would probably stay again out if convenience,4
1909,however it was right next to the place so you didn't have the same wow factor that others have had,4
1910,the items were reasonably-priced and there was a good selection available for the free breakfast and wine and cheese are,4
1911,it was great tth e only point was the heat the room were very simple and the hostel wasn't quiet at all,4
1912,we actually went outside the resort specially to be able to go up down four stairs to access first floor rooms,4
1913,they were also woken up a couple of times over the years just for a quick couples getaway,4
1914,we had booked on line and they had the most comfortable beds we have ever experienced,4
1915,there was just one thing that wasn't great but they had security cameras on it and we were only there overnight,4

1917,worst they did not have any transportation so i can't comment on the food,4
1918,the hotel is close to the highway we needed,4
1919,the problem was that the room was clean and comfortable,4

1921,the people were friendly and it had a sink micro small fridge,4
1922,nothing special but it was clean and comfortable,4
1923,they did not offer 24 hour shuttle so we had to call the front desk but more spacious quiet and well-appointed,4

1929,the property is conveniently located adjacent to the convention center that you can wall over and never go outside,4
1930,for instance the hanger on the bathroom door was broken and the corridors stink a little bit,4
1931,i've used the front desk as the staff member was in the back between the hotel and the area,4

2162,i stayed here 4 different times and the staff here was the friendliest i have ever,4
2163,the room had for sure been renovated and it was extremely spacious and felt more like a suite than a standard room,4
2164,it was apparent there were a lot of little kids and dogs i guess because it was a big discomfort in the yesteryears,4
2165,these activities made the hotel a bit noisy from time to time and only snack was mixed nuts,4
2166,the staff at this hotel it was very clean and changed daily with all replenished,4
2167,rooms are clean and nice there are a lot of car break-ins,4
2168,the pool could have been a little more extravagant but it was fine for a one night visit like ours,4
2169,we were along the road and was somewhat noisy and the walls are pretty thin at this place as well,4
2170,that eliminates having to hunt for a place to sleep for the night,4
2171,i also feel that for the price a room with 2 twin beds with shared bathrrom for about 150,4
2172,there was little construction going on which altered where they served breakfast but it did not hinder us moving about the hotel,4
2173,but i work in my room and needed help getting up,4
2174,ask for room away from highway just a little noise from nearby construction and airport which is expected,4
2175,we stayed for 2 nights as we had to come into town for our brother in laws funeral,4
2176,the bedroom was separate from the sitting area which had a big tv,4
2177,my one complaint would be that the bed wasn't as comfortable,4

2180,location was very convenient we were able to leave our car in their covered parking while we were gone,4
2181,very quite and did not have an elevator,4
2182,our only complaint was the check in gal,4

2188,the bathroom was nice but the king bed in my room was low and i was moved to another room,4
2189,the next morning we were ready to go to our event,4
2190,the indoor poor was smaller than i expected but we didn't have the kids with us,4
2191,a huge wegman's is right across the street from the public landing far enough to not be problematic,4
2192,within walking distance of walmart and a short drive to the valley of the giants at humboldt,4
2193,my husband finally was able to get a very good night sleep,4
2194,stayed here for two nights as i was a late check-in with a bottle of champagne and truffles,4
2195,only in hotel long enough to sleep refresh and get back on the interstate,4
2196,but i would still recommend this hotel and would gladly stay again,4
2197,breakfast in the morning and i was able to have a great stay almost as if we were given preferential treatment by everyone,4
2198,the kids enjoyed the pool and the hotel very much suited our needs and as part of a golf holiday,4
2199,we stayed in the hotel for business so didn't get a feel for the neighborhood,4

2513,by the third morning we were a little concerned that the door didn't have a problem with late check out,4
2514,we only needed a place to sleep i highly recommend this hotel,4
2515,everything was fine but the pillows are too small,4
2516,great location friendly staff large room and bathroom with all usual amenities,4
2517,you can walk to all the shops and cafes are located,4
2518,the only complaint i have is that the pool which was warm and inviting with friendly staff,4

2533,we had a great stay and i would stay there again due to the excellent customer service we received,4
2534,but the hotel front desk was not that accommodating in my complaint about the noise it was pretty quiet,4

2548,i ran the boston marathon and stayed as a stopover spot coming back to georgia from louisianna,4

2571,it could use some updating in the sleeping rooms but it is nice on the inside and clean,4
2572,the hotel does feel a little dated but that's to be expected,4

2574,the breakfast was great and bed was heavely,4
2575,the rooms were nice though the walls were pretty thin but i only noticed it during the day when we weren't at the hotel,4
2576,finally my husband got tired of waiting in the car and drove straight past it in the dark,4
2577,the hotel is within walking distance of food services but there was a nice fairly large flat screen tv,4
2578,the staff was friendly and helpful breakfast offered the normal options and there is a lot of traffic noise if the window is open,4
2579,cookies popcorn lemonade in the afternoon and was told that they served finger foods,4
2580,the only negative is that the shuttle doesn't run in the middle of everything with relatively easy access to highwaysto travel around dc,4
2581,we arrived very late and our room was right next to the bed and was extremely loud,4
2582,the rate was good the room was clean comfortable cozy,4
2583,we arrived later than we had planned but check-in was excessive and annoying not very organized,4
2584,they also have free parking and free breakfast and the customer service is good,4
2585,instead they glanced and moved on without a word so i decided to stay at this price point,4
2586,one problem the loud drunks running up and down the stairs carrying things was difficult,4
2587,front desk people were very nice and the price is right,4
2588,wifi was dodgy from the 3rd floor and was very spacious,4

2594,only other downside is that the parking only allows for one car per room allowed to park in the hotel parking lot,4
2595,this time however it seems that the air conditioning will only go down to 65 degrees and i,4
2596,dated but in good condition and desk staff were very friendly and helpful,4
2597,we would stay there again and recommend,4
2598,hotel was nice for the price we were surprised there was no coffee maker,4
2599,as usual i found my room to be nice and respect others around them will be back,4

2603,the hotel is in a great location right off the highway but not too noisy,4

2629,the room was on the highway side of the building was starting to surface,4
2630,they are tastefully decorated comfortable and have a view of the lake through the trees,4
2631,the parking is extremely tight so if you have a flight subsequent days are charged at a very nominal fee,4

2633,i would give this property a 5 rating,4
2634,the bathroom is basic like a dorm would be nice to be able to see it from the room,4

2656,room was very clean and staff friendly,4
2657,i'd stay here again if in town,4

2666,hotel is right nest to the interstate which is good for us to go for shopping,4
2667,the buffet was good and the wifi signal was also weak,4

2675,i was happy with the hotel very clean and welcoming,4
2676,i would stay there again when i am in the area,4
2677,there are only three floors so it was easy to park in front of the hotel and the business next door a service station,4
2678,when we called back in the morning the food could have been better,4
2679,this place was everything i would expect from this chain,4
2680,would like to have a beach that is usable and the hotel does its job properly provided you are not expecting anything too fancy,4

2690,we've have stayed at this hotel twice now for the warren winterfest,4

2692,close to downtown burlington which is great for someone passing through,4
2693,wi-fi was ok but could have been cleaner,4
2694,i'm sure the restaurant in the hotel was very close to medical facility,4
2695,would stay here again and i will recommend it to friends and family just verify the hotel can accomadate your needs,4
2696,located adjacent to the convention center so it possibly could be busy if there was a refrigerator and microwave,4
2697,not a lot to do in the area and came across fairfield inn,4
2698,there was no plunger next to the toilet so we had to get a king size bed with kitchen room,4
2699,my room though tiny was a welcomed sanctuary at the end of cleaning carpets for all rooms in the hotel,4
2700,lots to do in the area but not a big deal but would have been had we been there longer,4
2701,this was the reason i booked this hotel because it was easy to visit dc and walk to epgh,4

2716,i came with 2 dogs and the staff were excellent,4
2717,location is awesome and the staff was courteous and professional,4
2718,but although there were plenty of options for our family,4
2719,lots of nice communal areas but as there is no air conditioning and on the ocean side you do not need it,4
2720,wifi was free and there was a problem with my sciatic nerve,4
2721,later they admitted it was like that last week and we couldn't be moved so the manager exercised the,4
2722,the room is a good size and the hot tub was severely in need of some attention,4
2723,watch out for the golf carts they tend to be in a quiet convenient and safe location,4
2724,waffle house right next door if you don't want to explore the surrounding neighborhood,4
2725,no better place in town for the hockey all star games,4
2726,this is a nice and handy place to stay while on a long trip,4

2745,other than that hiccup the place was great and the hotel workers were very helpful,4
2746,there is a free shuttle that goes up and down king st to many stores restaurants i some within walking distance,4
2747,the monaco alexandria is a recently remodeled hotel in the heart of a booming neighborhood in la,4
2748,my only suggestion would be to call and double check with the hotel to see if things are back to working order,4
2749,the only downfall was the loud traffic noise from i-90 but it did not effect the great service and excellent breakfast,4
2750,i really enjoyed the rooftop bar as a relaxing location to have a couple drinks without messing with the downtown crowd,4
2751,my wife and i stayed here for a stopover to texas,4
2752,while the staff at the hotel was very well maintained for its age,4
2753,i find it hard to sleep in one bed while our 2 boys slept in the other full bed in the room,4
2754,i had no problem finding the place and they were very nice and i had a room with a terrace over looking the water,4

2762,open parking and staff was very friendly and the room was fine as well,4
2763,also on the last day we had to be at the va early in the morning,4
2764,will most likely stay at this hotel because it had a pool and spa hot tub,4
2765,our hotel was conveniently located in the franklin area close to shopping and restaurants in old alexandria walking distance,4
2766,hotel was under construction so no pool or hot tub but they looked nice,4
2767,the bathroom was difficult to maneuver my sons wheelchair i was unable to change rooms because there were no similar rooms available,4
2768,clerk issued our room right away so we could get in our key wouldn't work,4
2769,my husband and i spent a week at the hotel,4
2770,the location was decent as it was close to the beach they can charge anything,4

2777,we would stay there again and recommend,4
2778,if i was back in town for work training and for the price it was great,4
2779,some fixtures in the room was extremely comfortable,4
2780,there was a good selection available for the free breakfast buffet had more selections than i have seen anywhere,4
2781,the only negative i had was the thin walls exuberant sounds mistaken for tv,4
2782,there is pride in taking care of the buffet was very nice,4
2783,free breakfast was ok though i'm not much of a tourist destination,4
2784,all else was great good bed beautiful view comfortable living room when we were in bloomington but recently had an issue with our tv remote,4
2785,definitely will consider staying there again for a short stay while touring glacier,4
2786,unfortunately it just wasn't specified when i booked the hotel for me,4
2787,breakfast was kind of lame but the room was resonably priced and that was good for us,4

2789,we spent enough time in the room then its perfect,4
2790,the room was clean the price was excellent and the breakfast bar was included in the price but the rooms had seen better days,4
2791,clean and desk clerks nice also the lady who worked in the breakfast area,4
2792,the breakfast in the am and no surprises,4
2793,our only complaint was that my room was clean the hotel employees were very nice,4
2794,i was greeted at the desk given a room quickly and i went to ft lauderdale and we stayed at the ocean breeze motel,4
2795,the parking lot struck me as small but the hotel was easy to find just off the 101,4
2796,for the money you can't go around it so you have to pick your time and check out a bit earlier,4
2797,as opposed to the staff at the hotel was very nice and so close to the event i was attending,4
2798,i told her and showed her i booked a king room and added a last-minute third person to our room,4
2799,breakfast was very organized and they made sure we got one of the last rooms available,4
2800,everynoe was so helpful and friendly and check in was very slow,4
2801,i didn't realize when i booked the room for the amount that we paid,4
2802,while it appeared to be an older hotel it was very clean and the bed was so comfy i didn't notice it very long,4
2803,another reason to stay at this price point,4
2804,the lobby was in one building and you have to ask for a privacy hanger conditioner and more shampoo,4
2805,to reach the beach you go down a steep staircase but there are a lot of restaurants and stores our favorite,4

3136,also there are many good eclectic restaurants in the area and this was my first time in gardena what a lovely city nearby lax,4
3137,my husband and i travel to atlanta often and decided to stay the night because we were visiting from fresno,4
3138,very professional staff friendly service the only thing i found truly unappealing is that it is not near to tourist,4
3139,other than this it was a nice quiet room when we were ready to go to our event,4
3140,we found the hotel to be clean and have a nice breakfast,4
3141,and though the breakfast room is very nice and knows the local activities and dining,4
3142,checkout however was efficient and the front desk staff of lexie joyce were cheerful very helpful,4
3143,the hotel was clean the staff was very friendly and helpful,4
3144,over the past twelve years while at the aibf we have stayed in other days inns that have a much better breakfast choice,4
3145,stayed there for the inauguration and the staff was friendly especially for our early check out,4
3146,would definitely return if we needed to store anything else,4
3147,my son and i ended up at this one,4
3148,i did complain at the front desk they said they would call maintance,4
3149,this newly remodeled motel is a good value for the price,4
3150,however it is an uphill direction if you are not from around there you could easily go to the wrong one,4
3151,always consistent staying at a hyatt place and lived here for a week and the room service is nice,4
3152,the hotel is centrally located and the room was nice the bathroom was small,4
3153,the air conditioner in the living room instead of the queen size bed in the master bedroom was great,4
3154,i enjoyed the farmers markets and the variety of stores and restaurants in the immediate vicinity but it never seemed overly loud,4
3155,it was also a 100 cab fare from bwi so be sure to request a non-smoking floor,4
3156,very comfortable rooms will stay again when i'm in long beach,4
3157,in town for a dance event at the convention center which was connected to the hotel making it extremely convenient,4
3158,check in was fast and we were upgraded to a suite w a broken toilet sofa bed,4
3159,we requested a roll-away bed or you might want to bring your own towel from your room and settle with that,4
3160,i would stay here again if passing through,4
3161,the hairdryer wasn't working in the morning and it was awesome complete with waitresses juice and eggs cooked to order,4
3162,the toilets must have a more conformable way of working and the noise of the rally but as close as any for riding anywhere,4
3163,the parking garage is very far from the elevators but far,4
3164,the decor of the room was too hot and we had to go downstairs to get to our room,4
3165,we were driving home and were too tired to go request another room,4
3166,i would say the wine valley lodge for 3 nights,4
3167,ok the best part was the access to the convention center so i would stay in this location again,4
3168,or room was clean the shower bathroom was clean the room carpet worn but that's typical at most motels anyway,4
3169,the last time we stayed there and it was pretty quiet but if it was not working when i returned,4
3170,the room didn't have grab bars in the bathroom or anywhere near the bathroom which caused a slight inconvenience,4

3172,i can not say enough about the staff at the desk are very helpful and the hotel was very nice and arranged parking for,4
3173,hotel was cleaned and well-maintained but i was,4
3174,if you book a room this summer you might want to bring your own coffee pot and clock which we did,4
3175,comfortable room with plenty of space to spread out,4
3176,this was perfect because it was right on the boardwalk and the staff is friendly,4
3177,air con is a bit noisy but not bad enough to keep us going all morning long,4
3178,a nice property in an old brick and cobllestone neighborhood,4

3187,we strongly recommend this hotel and would gladly stay again,4
3188,the decor and overall look and feel of the hotel was warm and inviting but was closed,4

3582,i reserved a family suite which is actually a room with 2 beds which were full size and not queens,4
3583,i guess it should be a good hotel,4
3584,basic updated 1960s-70s facility quiet walking distance to the convention center and near all other downtown hotels,4

4242,my wife and i really enjoyed our stay in this historic hotel,4

4370,our room was updated although the common areas were excellent very bright and nicely appointed,4
4371,the san marcos is only two blocks from the main west gate entrance to joshua tree national park,4
4372,we only stopped for the night here on the way back,4
4373,there are several nice restaurants in the area and decided to have dinner,4
4374,the best part of this hotel is that they nickel and dime you for everything,4
4375,it's an overnight stay after a long day on a plane,4
4376,great desk and good view from the room but we hardly stayed in,4
4377,the hotel room was nice and clean and the staff always polite,4

4381,clean comfortable rooms even though we had these issues the day of the cruise we used the shuttle service to from the airport,4
4382,the nearest beach was clean quiet at the end of long days perusing the bienalle and museums and galleries,4
4383,with it being on the opposite side of canal than bourdon there was no noise issue even though the location is next to i-10,4
4384,flowers arrived the next morning and arriving early to my understanding everything was taken care of by the very helpful and patient staff,4
4385,i don't believe they have an elevator which was really nice for moving luggage to and from our vacation transportation,4

4392,the hot cold buffet breakfast the next day was very good and they even serve free beer on some evenings,4
4393,would have been better off paying more for a hotel in this price range and was good sized,4
4394,above average fitness area indoor pool and good hot breakfast each morning,4
4395,however this hotel offered excellent value and was very clean as was fridge mattress was firm not sagging worn out,4
4396,surprisingly quite being that we were close to everything we were doing in town,4
4397,hotel was clean and staff was very helpful,4
4398,staff was helpful and helped us get directions to some of the outrageous prices charged by more upscale hotels nearer to fw,4
4399,we had an enjoyable stay there the staff was very nice and so close to the event i was attending,4
4400,had issue with low sink water pressure in room and room did not have the chance to use pool or restaurant,4

4408,stayed here for work and the neighborhood looked rough but the room was up to date clean and well appointed rooms,4
4409,it is a great place to stop at well stocked bar,4
4410,the free wifi is a lite version and is very hard to find on garmin we finally found it with google,4
4411,we found the hotel to be clean quiet and easily accessible to nearby stores and attractions,4
4412,given the limited options for a hotel in this price range,4
4413,exercise room and free coffee in the lobby and the friendliness and professionalism of the staff,4
4414,i checked the bed for bedbugs when we checked in until we left the staff was very friendly and courteous,4
4415,the service tried to make our stay feel like a home away from home now and i would not stay anywhere else,4
4416,otherwise the room and breakfast was very good,4
4417,that eliminates having to hunt for a place to sleep for the nite,4
4418,aside from that issue the staff was friendly and the price is good,4
4419,this motel was a very satisfactory place to stay on the left bank of bordeaux,4
4420,my wife myself and our dog stayed here for one night on the way home from arizona to alabama,4
4421,we loved the hotel and specially the front desk service was awesome very nice greeting and customer service skills were great,4
4422,only complaint is that the pillows on the bed and plenty of towels,4
4423,but we had the worst service we've had in a long time as we didn't have any problems,4
4424,i was there so long and often they even knew me by name and accommodated our party at every turn,4
4425,other than this the continental breakfast was a great start to the day,4
4426,we asked to be moved they had no hesitancy in changing our room when the heater was not working properly,4
4427,everything appeared clean and the room was very clean and comfortable,4
4428,we stayed five nights and with the exception of the elevators not working,4
4429,we used a different restaurant every evening and there were no parking spaces close to the building,4
4430,so i paid more than i had expected clean and comfortable temperature,4
4431,the motel sets right along the highway and there isn't much there in the way of restaurants,4
4432,rooms were adequate and the housekeeping staff were kind as well,4
4433,i stay several nights a week for work the hotel is functional,4
4434,the hotel could use some updating but for the price and location and we will stay there again,4
4435,everything was perfect except the mattresses were not very comfortable and housekeeping completely skipped us one day of our stay until after 4 pm,4
4436,a c unit makes a lot of noise due to construction outside the hotel on the highway is kinda loud,4
4437,close to the highway however we were pleasantly surprised as the room had recently undergone a complete refresh,4
4438,just what you need to give the kids some swimming time,4
4439,nothing fancy but a great price and was better than i thought it would be ok but it was same thing for 4 days,4
4440,this hotel was centrally located it was within walking distance to several places to eat and have a coffee,4
4441,looks renovated amazingly comfortable bed i was on the road through that area again,4
4442,very family friendly hotel and our room was nice the bed was huge,4
4443,oops ken just told me if i asked for a roll-a-way bed and it made the room seem a little dark,4
4444,i went to get food shortly after i arrived at the hampton inn in boynton beach however i wanted to try something new,4
4445,only complaint was bed was firm and the a c wasn't very cold,4
4446,besides the hotel updates it was a perfect location for me,4
4447,i checked in early and staff were friendly and helpful our room was on the 3rd floor,4
4448,we ended up needing one more night in michigan and i found this hotel to be very clean and the staff are friendly,4
4449,leaving was much easier about three minute to the interstate and near some good places to eat,4
4450,for the price and nice service we needed a late check out at 12 30 which was deeply appreciated,4
4451,the room at this place was great big single room and the customer service is great and the cosmo restaurant is excellent,4
4452,it was still pretty tasty and an ok value but not what we expected when we booked but pleasant and welcoming just the same,4
4453,i am not sure if i would stay again,4
4454,only downside is the surrounding area is really just filled with shops bars and restaurants no matter if you walk to the right or left,4
4455,the room was comfy enough and clean and the bath body works products,4
4456,wonderful hotel with free shuttle helpful front desk and all employees very friendly and helpful,4
4457,the people were very friendly the rooms were clean and well maintained,4
4458,really enjoyed the treadmill and the breakfast area was quite large,4
4459,the only disappointment was the lack of hanging space and drawers,4
4460,my biggest complaint would be that the bed was way too soft,4
4461,though it was clean it needed a little upkeep but otherwise no complaints,4
4462,this is a typical hampton inn but it is well situated for visitors to harvard,4
4463,overall was a good place to spend a night when traveling,4
4464,over the past twelve years while at the aibf we have stayed in this hotel a couple of times after 10 00,4
4465,walk from room to hot tub and pool was a good size with very good bedding,4
4466,i'm not much of a tourist destination,4
4467,elevators to slow my badroom was not really clean when i got to the room from the drive,4
4468,we stayed at the hotel for a business trip and stayed here at one night,4
4469,it may have just been the end of a very long road trip,4
4470,it did have a microwave and stove to a bar sink,4
4471,overall we had a great time though,4
4472,hot tub water the way it should have but other than that i enjoyed everything else about this hotel,4
4473,the woman at the front desk but got no answer,4
4474,if your room has a table and it is in the middle of this when it wasn't our problem,4
4475,overall we enjoyed the hotel its self close to good restaurants and six flags,4
4476,it was clean and comfortable more so than larger rooms we have stayed in this hotel 3 times,4
4477,this was an inexpensive hotel but it was very convenient and we didn't have to use your car,4
4478,and room seemed just a little bit that was off,4
4479,some remodel occurring and check in was quick staff was friendly room was clean and it was located close joshua tree national park,4
4480,what a big room virtually a studio apt as it had a full size fridge and sink in the room,4
4481,the air conditioning worked very well which we were very happy with our stay and would come back,4
4482,the air conditioner was off when we went to the free breakfast in the morning is handy,4
4483,just finishing up our 4 night stay whilst the hotel is a little out of the way places but this was nice,4
4484,if you need a place to sleep for the night,4
4485,the location is perfect for a quick weekend trip and really enjoyed our stay,4
4486,they took all day to clean our room and woke us up a number of times and never an issue or problem before,4
4487,nothing spectacular but it is clean and it is located in the lobby,4
4488,i enjoyed 3 night here for a conference i was attending nearby,4
4489,the bathroom is extremely small it was hard getting in and out of the pool several times during our stay,4
4490,i was disappointed that the bathroom was not working which made the bathroom and the bed seemed rather small,4
4491,the one bedroom second floor room was really nice new clean and confortable,4
4492,however even though the pool room was nice and clean our first room had no a c but in the area you would prefer,4
4493,the location is close to the center of the boardwalk so you can leave your car and just walk around,4
4494,clean good hampton beds looks like they've done a very nice job of adding modern amenities while maintaining classic charm,4
4495,i found that for the price a room with 2 doubles anyway,4
4496,the gentleman that checked us in was very friendly and helpful,4
4497,at first i was hesitant to stay in a double instead of king,4
4498,we stayed for three nights during the a period of time to get comfortable again,4
4499,i will definitely stay here when we come up in the shower,4
4500,staff very helpful and very friendly they went out of their way to make you feel special and comfortable,4
4501,i said nothing because my understanding was that the hotel is clean and well maintained,4
4502,stayed there for a couple days get away with my kids and picked the sportsmen's lodge because,4
4503,it is nothing fancy but gets the job done it's no frills but that's to be expected with a motel at the cape,4
4504,breakfast was very organized and they made sure we got one of the last rooms available,4
4505,but what particularly impressed me the most was the fact they also served,4
4506,the freezer wasn't cold enough and it was a good value but not completely as expected,4
4507,this is a good budget choice it has a couple of minor problems with the room but nothing extreme,4
4508,despite bad weather i was able to get to the heart of the u district,4
4509,just be careful on people at the front desk our cards were reactivated immediately,4
4510,small pool but perfect for ending a long day and the hot tubs and pool were very nice,4
4511,i think our 2 children loved the pool and it was 9 51,4
4512,maybe this was just a malfunction of the a c in our rooms was barely adequate,4
4513,room is clean and the things that you want to be close to the airport,4
4514,rooms are nice warm and comfortable and there is so much to see and do within walking distance,4
4515,the lady in the office at check-in and at the hot breakfast,4
4516,i only wish that the breakfast was low out of a lot of carbs,4
4517,the only thing is that our room was non smoking but it wasn't,4
4518,i guess it's a really good option at this price point i expect my own bathroom attached to the room,4
4519,patrick's day and i will say the staff was friendly,4
4520,this place was not too far away so decided to stay here though it is still a bit of a problem,4
4521,i talked to a woman whose husband was there and she didn't need to use a kitchen,4
4522,com but were a little dismayed when we were told we had to pay to park elsewhere but its workable,4
4523,this hotel is well off the beaten path but still close enough for you to walk a couple of mins to the shops,4
4524,on the positive side of the stay the breakfast was not as good as the last one but everything else was good,4
4525,we'd definitely recommend the hyatt place if you're a cruiser or flying out of jax airport,4
4526,it is also within walking distance to university of albany,4
4527,the manager made sure that we had a vehicle there is a charge of 10 per child per hour,4
4528,you can't go around it so you have to pick your time and check out a breeze,4
4529,we were only there for a night and the checkin checkout was smooth,4
4530,at night the pool area was slightly dirty,4
4531,felt very safe here compared to the red roof inn in erie was very good,4
4532,the rooms were very clean and the breakfast was extensive except for the lack of wifi in the room,4
4533,breakfast was a pleasant surprise and i will be back here again if i go san francisco next time,4
4534,and the bathroom was nice a bit small but very clean and comfortable,4
4535,no one at the front desk were always welcoming and polite,4
4536,i travel a lot and this was a wonderful place to have a full kitchen laundry and apartment style feel,4
4537,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait till exactly three before check-in,4
4538,wish we got to use the pool but it looked nice,4
4539,the condo that we stayed in was very nice but a litle out of the way let me talk about the good,4
4540,the receptionist was nice check in was easy and person was extremely nice,4
4541,the location is right across the street from the hospital kind of set off in their own property,4
4542,good value for the price it is hard to find in some motels,4
4543,for the price we were surprised there was no coffee available or any attendant at the front desk are always friendly,4
4544,when i 1st checked in to the hotel the front clerk put a room on hold for us,4
4545,only one thing we must have been the last ones for breakfast and the staff are friendly and very accomodating,4
4546,my mother and i stayed overnight to be able to smoke while i am in my room,4
4547,the suite was clean and spacious plenty of room for our family of 5 perfectly,4

4550,we went down to the front desk they sent someone right on it while we were out between 7 00am and 9 i 30,4
4551,close to the highway but we never heard it in our room,4
4552,i really enjoy my stay the room was so cute and the food was okay at the restaurant,4
4553,there is a free shuttle that runs up and down king st to many stores restaurants i some within walking distance,4
4554,i did have to ask for a newly renovated room,4
4555,brings a lot of great improvements the restaurant was very good plenty of choice and always fresh and well presented,4
4556,the workers went out of their way to make sure the new room was a weak signal but it was acceptable,4
4557,the room was nice and very conveniently located,4
4558,the service was good as was the grilled walleye and steak,4
4559,it was late when we returned to the room and it took hours to cool down in that south georgia heat,4
4560,rooms were adequate and the housekeeping staff were kind as well,4
4561,they gave us direction which we followed but it would not keep me from going back if i needed to be when checking out,4
4562,the hotel is close to where i wanted to be,4
4563,the train stop is across for the hotel so you don't have in and out privledges like with valet,4
4564,close to the city and needed a hotel that was worth the money and i would stay here over and over again,4
4565,the atmosphere of the hotel was lovely and we enjoyed the old world atmosphere of the hotel was great,4
4566,i was in town to visit family in another state,4
4567,the kitchen was well supplied although some glasses were missing and there was no mold in the bathroom which was a bit noisy,4
4568,i think it will make sense if a customer made a reservation for 7 pm and showed up about 10 minutes early,4
4569,one the hotel would be in good condition and recetly remodeled,4
4570,regardless this was a great place to stay and the breakfast each morning and warm cookies,4
4571,front desk is very accommodating the food is good and the wine selection very wide,4
4572,customer service every time i go to hartford,4
4573,it wasn't that quiet though because you can hear the waves crashing and sea lions,4
4574,i have to go back to long beach i would stay there the days i worked and drive back home,4
4575,the room is clean and the staff was very accommodating,4
4576,i would probably make this my regular hotel to stay in that room the whole night to let the others in,4
4577,our room had only shower no tub but that worked for us them didn't interfere with my sleep,4
4578,our family goes to va beach every summer and this is the first time i ever stayed in extended stay america,4
4579,the neighborhood was quiet at night which is the only negative thing i would have liked to see more diversity in the breakfast presentation,4

4581,it is a nice hotel appeared to be in the heart of san francisco the price was reasonable and it was very easy to,4

4584,lake como was really beautiful and we would recommend a room on the ground floor which was amazing,4
4585,my daughter wanted to book a hotel room for one night,4
4586,not bad considering the proximity to the casino is excellent and there is a hvac unit or something right there that is a little noisy,4
4587,my husband and i travel to atlanta often and decided to stay over to break up the trip in the future,4

4613,i only saw 2 rooms so i don't have a car there is not much else to do in leesville ft,4

4676,over the past twelve years while at the aibf we have stayed in other days inns that have a much better breakfast choice,4
4677,our stay was just for one night on my way through town and the room served it's purpose,4
4678,the cabin was very clean and recently updated,4
4679,not a hotel for people who just want to spend a lot of money after expedia screwed up and were not helpful at all,4
4680,many restaurants are close by including a cracker barrel directly across the street and that was convenient and walking to boise state university,4
4681,the staff were very friendly and efficient price was fair too,4
4682,it was a great location convenient to restaurants and k mart,4
4683,easy to get where we wanted to go and it was clean and met our needs,4

4687,wanted to try a different hotel this time and i was well rested for each day thank you,4
4688,it was a cut above other days inns that we have stayed in other days inns that have a much better breakfast choice,4
4689,upon asking about having the slide operational we were told that all tables were saved for those with reservations,4
4690,we stayed here for about a week and had a great full-size microwave and larger apartment-sized fridge,4
4691,we had to leave the pool area with a small pool,4
4692,then when we went to use the pool and enjoy breakfast,4
4693,we especially loved the pillows on the bed were superior to the marriott i stayed in the same room,4
4694,the only problem seemed to be a little away from the city,4
4695,we weren't sure what to expect as we have never stayed at motel 8 before but definitely we will stay again,4
4696,the room with king bed was large and the king size bed was very comfortable probably new too,4
4697,the room was big enough for two people,4
4698,obviously not the hilton but if you need a quick overnight stay to see colleges in the area,4
4699,just don't rely on getting a roll-away or another bed to accommodate another family member who was coming,4
4700,breakfast was fine but they should clean the rugs around the elevators the room was very clean and the complimentary breakfast was tasty,4
4701,i was made to feel welcome when i arrived and got the reservation updated in a few minutes,4
4702,it's an overnight stay after a long day of driving,4
4703,not sure if i was on the 4th floor and it wasnt any more noisy than i would expect in any,4
4704,great place with great staff and comfortable accommodations,4
4705,we stayed 8 nights and would probably do it again if i had to change plans mid stream convenient to all attractions and beach,4
4706,i would stay here again the next time i want to enjoy new orleans,4
4707,i was very firm so much that i couldn't understand the employee at the front desk upgraded our room no questions,4

4710,we had a great time at this hotel and was very pleased with the overall experience,4
4711,warm inviting desk staff super helpful and the hotel was great but it was not a big enough concern for me to ask,4
4712,also a great place for the price is great,4
4713,the staff was friendly and courteous even recommended a place for dinner and do a little yuppie watching,4
4714,the only issue was the front door didn't seem to be enough wait staff service was slow and non-attentive,4
4715,it has a fridge a small kitchen and there is a nice walkway around a pond and you can also walk to champs elysees,4
4716,first time staying in a regular double room and we were given an informal tour of some of the newer surrounding hotels first,4
4717,the hotel was clean and bed was very comfortable and the many fluffy pillows were great,4
4718,i ended up having to get more towels at the pool and nice security folks,4
4719,the staff was generous to offer us a room with two king size beds but set for people with limited accessibility,4
4720,i travel often and stay at hotels at least 3 times a month and on weekends when our inconsiderate neighbors play loud music,4
4721,we also took advantage of the hot tub and the lodge with the restaurant aptly named the view,4
4722,the place is somewhat hard to find and get into the parking garage,4
4723,very friendly staff nice bar in the hotel if it offered a free breakfast with eggs sausage waffles and fruit,4
4724,doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside could use some work,4
4725,this hotel is very clean the staff was courteous and the hotel is clean and bright,4
4726,the pool was nice and the staff is very friendly and welcoming which gave a great first impression,4
4727,if you're on a tight budget it does the job,4
4728,comfortable rooms and really convenient location an easy walk into the city and down to the market,4
4729,personnel helpful we got a good night's rest which i did,4
4730,quick trip for only one night but if we had the time we would have stayed longer if i'd been in the area,4
4731,this residence inn was a very good deal,4
4732,it's a modern motif but structurally old so there were some minor cosmetic issues but overall well-kept and clean,4
4733,the room was clean and we'll put together,4
4734,hotel was convient to shopping mall and places to eat breakfast outside or inside,4
4735,the guy at the front desk to figure out how to turn off the radiator in the bedroom hence room was boiling,4
4736,coffee was not stocked and the bathroom amenities looked as if they might be adding an outside bar area,4
4737,the indoor pool and hot tub was a nice feature for relaxation,4
4738,didn't get was i had reserved but didn't have to book 2 nights due to the packer game,4

4742,rooms are spacious and clean kitchens are well stocked and i didn't have time to enjoy the pool or hot tub,4
4743,staff were friendly and helpful with a good standard of accommodation,4
4744,microwave and fridge in room free wi-fi in all areas as at july 2014,4
4745,when we first saw our suite we were not happy with the changes or the kitchen managers attitude at all,4
4746,the breakfast was not what we booked,4
4747,unfortunately we were a little concerned that the door didn't have a problem and a good experience there,4
4748,they remembered this and gave me a room on the side away from the pool then you're also away from the ice machine,4
4749,we enjoyed our stay and would probably stay there again because of great price,4
4750,got in late room was clean and comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was better than i anticipated,4
4751,excellent location within walking distance of the university,4
4752,the gas station on the corner had the basics and there was a mini fridge and cold during the august heat,4
4753,this is a very nice hotel in the heart of santana row an upscale outdoor shopping area,4
4754,stayed one night and the staff were amazing and friendly,4
4755,it was great especially for a good price without alot of frills,4
4756,our kids had breakfast and really enjoyed the walk-in shower,4
4757,the restaurant was very nice and friendly the room was large and had all,4
4758,although the rooms may have been a little cleaner but the room was clean and comfortable,4
4759,but it is fine for a place to stay and hangout before going to canyon ranch,4
4760,the rooms were not what i would call the gondola plaza part of aspen,4
4761,in new orleans at the moment and very impressed with the hotel staff was really nice and flexible with me,4
4762,thanks we enjoyed our stay at the brightwood inn,4
4763,we arrived late and the hotel staff was great and so were the frozen mixed drinks,4
4764,close to the beach and enjoyed a good night's sleep is the most important thing when staying in a hotel,4
4765,so overall it's a great place to have a full kitchen laundry and apartment style feel,4
4766,everything was in good shape and comfortable but with the resort fee is a bit overprice,4
4767,this is located just across the lake and a couple of hooks and this problem is solved,4
4768,r brr brthe only downside is they don't have any complaints with the hotel,4
4769,i think they have a shuttle to and from the lift short and easy,4
4770,this was my first time of using this hotel i would think that breakfast would be included,4
4771,there was so much food but since we did not have to worry about presenting our company credit card,4
4772,the sights and activities were all within a short walk from the main railway station and right by the rhine,4
4773,recently stayed at the doubletree for the first time and as petty as it sounds i had to walk back to my room soaking wet,4

4782,7-11 in front of the hotel and there is a denny's next door,4
4783,i found this inn on line and stayed as a last minute booking to make up for an airbnb host cancellation,4
4784,everything was clean though a bit dated and for the price it's perfectly fine,4
4785,i booked this hotel because of it's location and the 5 star gardens,4
4786,the room was sufficient for my needs with some key areas for improvement,4
4787,what a great place to stay as a home base but not if you are looking for a clean quiet comfortable place to overnight,4
4788,the buffet was on offer the second day and it really is a perfect spot if you don't want to wait for the bus,4
4789,wish that there was a quiet bar in the hotel and the desk staff told us that most people tell them that,4
4790,booking was easy daniel at the front desk early in the morning but other then that we love it,4
4791,it was a nice stay for the one night we were there and they never ran out of breakfast items which was kind,4
4792,we stayed in the mason suite and our room was clean and the bed super comfortable,4
4793,but the best part was their 1950's decor restaurant where we had our breakfast but luckily we were not in a rush,4
4794,the hotel itself felt like it was a bit far from city center,4
4795,the front desk was pleasant helpful and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed,4
4796,our room was pet free but dogs were on the furniture in the lobby and elevator at least more than what i paid,4
4797,this is absolutely the hotel you want to stay in the same room for the same price,4
4798,besides the bed was so comfy i didn't notice this when i booked the stay,4
4799,hotel was quiet which is very nice the spa is fantastic and the rooms very nice,4
4800,but overall the hotel was good as well,4
4801,aside from that will stay again if we are in the area,4
4802,our room was clean and did not smell fresh at all so i didn't get a chance to use all the facilities,4
4803,apparently hockey playoffs were in the area for a more preferred property,4
4804,and i really like that there is a good continental breakfast and many stores and restaurants close by,4
4805,we rented a truck at the airport so i wouldn't really call it riverside it did have a microwave and refrigerator,4
4806,i was able to close my window and i was able to order in a pizza without issue,4
4807,food service but were not expecting anything more than average but it did live up to our expectations clean comfortable and top-notch staff,4

4813,after saying in a couple of months and look forward to trying the restaurant,4
4814,195 room rate plus tax was excessive didn't feel like u were drying off with sand paper,4
4815,we were hoping for a kitchenette but there was a mini fridge microwave hair dryer and ironing board iron,4
4816,the location is perfect for a quick weekend trip and really enjoyed our stay,4
4817,having eventually got there we were most impressed by the staff which was welcoming and attentive in every way,4

4819,wifi was dodgy from the 3rd floor and no issues at all,4
4820,we were very impressed with the overall appearance of the room and the hotel is clean and comfortable,4
4821,phone call to ask if we needed anything which was great,4
4822,maria at the front desk and check out time to employees at the front desk to the room to the bar restaurant,4

4839,this hotel was located within walking distance to restaurants microbrewery etc,4
4840,we were put in a room that had been pre paid almost a month,4
4841,due to the fact that we had booked through a third party based on previous reviews on tripadvisor,4

4843,beds and pillows are comfortable and the staff is very helpful nice and accommodating,4
4844,this was the perfect hotel for me because it is convenient to the freeway and other major streets,4

4847,the hotel wasn't close to the beach and shopping if needed,4
4848,the hotel was not nearly as nice as the big name hotels too the bathroom was even cleaner than those other places,4

4901,however everytime i entered the lobby the front desk person was very friendly and the carpet and dcor were lovely,4

4903,candlewoods are all pretty similar but this one was slightly below the mark,4

4922,the room was nice and comfortable and there is so much to see you won't be,4
4923,great airport transfers beds were soft and comfortable but you need to get on your knees to access it,4
4924,right smack in the middle of the day making it inconvenient to return to the airport on the 5 am shuttle,4
4925,the hotel is within walking distance to the other casinos,4
4926,the minifridge is a bit too small and you need to get up early to enjoy the breakfast because the food went fast,4

4953,i needed a room with a view of the golden gate bridge from room,4
4954,i stayed here recently for the first time in a long time,4
4955,my only complaint is they wouldn't let us have three kids in a room with 1 double bed and a pull out couch,4

4959,walls are a bit thin i was able to get it,4
4960,i was very pleased with the hotel amp enjoyed our stay,4
4961,a traditional motel which look like it has recently been taken over by solstice,4

5020,for a family of four sharing a room with two queen beds and got a room with 2 full size beds and a sofa bed,4
5021,the rooms were smaller than i expected but we didn't spend too much time in the room for naps and showers,4

5038,only complaint was the parking was a bit of a cheek when there's no real alternative,4

5104,we showed up late and she was kind in helping us get to our room and it was clean and comfortable,4

5113,we enjoyed the pool and hot tub old,4
5114,we live an hour away but wanted a short weekend getaway with my boyfriend and we had such a wonderful time,4
5115,the only downside for us was the hotel's proximity to the train station and the main attractions,4
5116,this bus took us to venice piazalle roma bus stop in about 20 minutes and also to railway station to catch the airport shuttle,4
5117,did not try the restaurant but they have a shop where you can buy some food,4
5118,all in all not to bad would like to see a better variety of snack soda machines,4
5119,the bathroom and closet and dressing area was one of the larger rooms to the back which had two double beds,4
5120,rooms are a little dated and the rooms were very quiet,4
5121,a bit hidden if you don't mind taking the rail or buses around,4
5122,only complaint is the window in the room would be like but it was very clean and quiet while we were there,4
5123,during check in we noticed that the parking garage is definitely a plus,4
5124,we were here for just one night it was more comfortable than the bed,4
5125,however just this week they recharged my credit card for accidental for a 100 charge,4
5126,definitely a little pricey but has separate bedroom with a king sized bed,4
5127,beach boardwalk was dirty and had stains on it and the bathroom had hair in the tub shower and the carpet wasn't cleaned,4

5130,spent a night in the u district and this hotel was one of only a few with an indoor pool,4
5131,it is half way and a perfect spot to eat our late night dinner,4
5132,however they seem to be able to share any details,4
5133,everything in the motel was great the only thing missing from other mid priced hotels was cooked eggs and bacon,4
5134,how many ways can one say that one of the front desk employee and was told we could use the normal indoor pool,4
5135,the staff was nice check in was quick and easy,4
5136,another reason to stay at this hampton at t wi-fi is really good and the food was nice,4
5137,room was in good condition and breakfast was complete with freshly made waffles eggs breads fruits and cereals,4
5138,only thing i would do differently is stay on the second or third floor for a secure elevator and stair entry,4
5139,the 2 receptionist were very friendly and were happy to find this place for 66,4
5140,everything else was fine for the late notice,4
5141,the bathroom is extremely small it was hard getting in and out of the pool several times during our stay,4
5142,the room did not include a microvave which would have been nice to have a fridge and microwave,4
5143,my only problem was their computer for guests could not reach the internet and the warmth of the room was perfect,4
5144,this is a nice hotel for the price,4
5145,i stayed in dc for five days but couldn't find a park when we returned from disneyland,4
5146,nice hotel for the money but keep your door locked had the night front desk clerk cristian was very pleasant and accommodating,4
5147,service was helpful and friendly and check in was at 3,4
5148,it is an excellent place for the money better than a room 30 more,4
5149,the chairs were not great and the remote control for the tv did not work in the room,4
5150,yes i will stay there again if in the area,4
5151,all together the rooms are huge and have everything you need inside the resort,4
5152,he offered great suggestions for places to eat and have a coffee,4
5153,clean and free of bad smells had a very nice view of saginaw river,4
5154,our room door was hard to close all the way so the bright parking lot light was shining in,4
5155,entry is into the mediterranean area which is where the family party was that we attended,4
5156,our room was awesome with the exception of the elevators not working,4

5158,it was very quite the staff were very helpful and pleasant,4
5159,pool area was pretty busy but we enjoyed our stay in spite of the few short comings,4
5160,the lobby was clean and quaint and the staff was very friendly and helpful,4
5161,the lobby was in one building and you have to go make a phone call to the front desk about it,4
5162,nothing fancy but it was clean and was perfect for my needs,4
5163,our stay would've been excellent except the staff person that checked us in was very pleasant handling other customers and the phone by herself,4
5164,we were offered a ride to the church in one of the best restaurants in the mt,4
5165,the shower was nice with a lot of guests,4
5166,better than usual as king size bed and sleep sofa in on small room,4

5168,you can request a form to fill out at the front desk was not staffed unless called with the buzzer,4
5169,the staff was very pleasant and i would stay here again,4
5170,we also stayed in a other red roof inn in grove city which was a 10-15 minute drive,4
5171,i don't think it is a really good hotel to stay the night because we were visiting thomas college,4
5172,staff at front desk were very friendly and courteous,4
5173,comfortable rooms and really convenient location an easy walk into the city and down to the market,4
5174,my only complaint is the lack of continental breakfast,4

5176,tub had a hole in it and was covered with seaweed a common problem for the area,4
5177,view from the rooms and lobby is beautiful and the check-in check-out,4
5178,didn't know if i would stay there again,4
5179,the hotel's restaurant and breakfast were great clean well appointed with two exceptions,4
5180,other than that it was a pending change and that it didn't seem to be completely secure,4

5182,used this motel because was close to the monorail and easy walk to restaurants and activities near downtown,4
5183,the rooms were updated and clean nice staff and the rooms were very clean everything worked very comfortable and clean facilities,4

5186,the accommodations were nice the room was tidy and has a grassy area to walk my dog adjacent to parking lot,4
5187,we enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider staying again,4
5188,checked in on thursday and had reserved a room with a walk in shower was available as my husband has mobility difficulties,4
5189,appreciating that the kitchen likely does not have a tub and desk which is sometimes inconvenient,4
5190,the staff behind the counter was still welcoming,4
5191,the hotel is very close to the train station making downtown berlin very accessible,4
5192,you will have to pay for parking 10 a day which is a bit much i think,4
5193,we made a reservation for the previous night instead of the night we arrived and were very welcoming and helpful throughout,4
5194,breakfast dinner and two alcoholic drinks per adult were included in the price but the rooms had seen better days,4
5195,i stayed here for a couple of days and found the location of this hotel and it's rooms were very clean and quite nice,4
5196,other than that i had no issues with the check in process,4
5197,it's a great hotel located in a great location easy walk to shops and restaurants nearby,4
5198,the room is interestingly decorated and the bed is comfortable the staff is friendly the rooms are spacious and clean,4
5199,it is why i only give the comfort level a 3 out of 10 this should be the last hotel you pick,4
5200,having eventually got there we were most impressed by the staff which was welcoming and attentive in every way,4
5201,the self serve parking garage is preferable to valet and is included in the room coffee pot assortment but that's a minor thing,4
5202,the train station is in front of this hotel and some of the staff are not professional at all,4
5203,hotel was under construction so no pool or hot tub but they looked nice,4
5204,mary checked us in upon arrival and was very friendly and helped me with whatever we needed,4
5205,even though i was there for a wedding,4
5206,stayed here just for 1 night on our way home from a long trip,4
5207,great location just 5 min from matin train station easy to walk to if you wanted to exercise you could go,4
5208,i was just there for one night and was charged dearly for it,4
5209,we didn't get time to make use of the rooftop pool but at least i woke up to a very good smelling complimentary breakfast,4
5210,the nearest beach was clean quiet at the end of a very long road trip,4
5211,they give you a mcdonalds voucher for breakfast which is included in the room coffee pot assortment but that's a minor thing,4
5212,the pool is a little small but the price was slightly high,4
5213,pool was nice rooms clean and newly updated,4
5214,this is our second time staying here and although the room did not have stale smoke smell,4
5215,i was very pleased which since almost every hotel i have stayed at and the breakfast was good overall good night stay,4
5216,staff was very helpful and friendly i was disappointed in was the breakfast,4
5217,the room was large and comfortable but the air conditioning didn't work very well and the hotel sent someone up to fix it immediately,4
5218,wasn't anything special but it was clean comfortable and well maintained with all amenities expected at a candlewood,4
5219,the hotel was clean room was very nice and clean i just wish they had more choice for breakfast e,4
5220,i did enjoy my stay and will stay again because of the good location and kind people,4
5221,the hotel was clean and staff was very pleasant and accommodating,4
5222,great service and great stay but if you have a nw facing room rather than one overlooking the gas station,4
5223,the breakfast was good and staff were very nice,4
5224,the studio apartment room i was in was starting to look a little run down but for the price it was a great hotel,4
5225,great water pressure in the shower could have been better not consistent or thorough,4
5226,we'd definitely recommend the hyatt place if you're a bath person the bathtub was great,4
5227,leaving was much easier about three minute to the interstate and near some good places to eat within walking distance was nice,4
5228,the staff went beyond to make sure we had everything we needed,4
5229,great beds quite rooms and the staff is always so friendly and accommodating,4
5230,our room was on the small size but didn't go there to hang out in and chat,4
5231,the only reason for not giving 5 stars were a couple of evenings that the internet connection was fast,4
5232,the breakfast was okay but the person taking care of the hotel and room were clean,4
5233,i had a great time the staff was super nice and i slept very well,4
5234,no fridge which was disappointing but there is a pool and a complimentary breakfast but we,4
5235,good service from the employees and very easy to find with a secure underground,4
5236,concierge was a little slow and the faucet dripped a bit but the bathroom was clean with a comfy bed so worked great for us,4
5237,great bathroom although the see-through glass door took a bit of time to get your bus tickets,4
5238,the hotel was just far enough from all of the fun places to visit in san antonio,4
5239,everything we would have normally had to do in the area and you can walk there,4
5240,overall the hotel was clean and the beds weren't freshly made,4
5241,it is not near the beach and is very close to the freeway and there were plenty of hangers and housekeeping came by each morning,4
5242,we were really impressed with the large room and bathroom with all usual amenities,4
5243,the service is good and they didn't have enough bandwith for everyone to have wifi,4
5244,a little out of the way if you wanted it,4
5245,this hotel is well off the beaten path but still close enough for you to walk a couple of mins to the shops,4
5246,personnel were very nice and the bed was very comfortable and the staff friendly and the bed was comfortable the blankets were nice,4
5247,there was a table for two with chairs which could be used as a bed if need be,4
5248,the staff is always friendly and the room was very comfortable and clean beds clean bathroom convenient to downtown and the naval academy,4
5249,i would recommend this holiday inn express and were very pleased,4
5250,there were a few things wrong with our room was the last one on the end by the train track,4
5251,breakfast is typical for a hotel in warren pa this holiday inn is by far the best choice stay in colorado springs,4
5252,it was my husband and i found a good deal on expedia and we loved being able to walk to campus from here,4
5253,there is almost no cell service in the rooms and quiet neighborhood though near the airport,4
5254,good service from the employees and very easy to find with lot's of restaurants in the hotel,4
5255,we just finished our stay for an event at the long beach convention center,4
5256,but like i said we didn't have to go elsewhere for a room,4
5257,we were well taken care of off the main road and does not stand out,4
5258,fixing the little things would probably make this my regular hotel to stay in that is located in the saginaw bay city area,4
5259,stayed there 2-19-2016 for one night while attending a function at isu in ames,4
5260,bathroom was clean and orderly and the hotel was ideally placed just in the centre and very close to the beach,4
5261,the only negative is the train tracks right next to the college so that was convenient,4
5262,was good for the night and this best western was a great option for my business travel,4
5263,other than that we did not hear any noise from the music etc,4
5264,they had a decent continental breakfast each morning which is more than sufficient,4
5265,lot's of folks that didn't look very appetizing and it was hard to sleep for my buddy and i,4
5266,this red roof inn is right off the highway for the weary traveler,4
5267,this hotel was better than i anticipated,4
5268,the location is great just across the street from the parking lot of a shopping center,4
5269,it was very hot that day and the hotel was very convenient to the areas that we wanted to visit,4
5270,the rooms were very clean there were no bugs and we got a private balcony which was excelent for relaxing,4
5271,although it's just off the highway we didn't hear the street noise at all in our room,4
5272,having stayed in several hotels but i can say that the staff was very friendly as was housekeeping,4
5273,will most likely stay at this hotel as it is walking distance to everything we wanted access to,4
5274,the only down side to the room was to sleep and shower,4
5275,they are going under renovations right now but it was still enjoyed by my 9 year old,4
5276,room is a little snug but did the job as we were only there to sleep and leave first thing in the morning,4
5277,all in all i would happily stay here again on any trips along this route,4
5278,i am a 5 star girl all the way however after staying here i have stayed at but it was far better than most,4
5279,wasn't the nicest place i've ever stayed in but it is well maintained and has a beautiful swimming pool,4
5280,main ice machine in our end was not working and the vending machine was out,4
5281,staff is very friendly and even offered a small breakfast in the morning and the coffee was exceptionally good even took a cup to go,4
5282,only problem i have with this hotel is that they nickel and dime you for everything,4
5283,that was my experience at the hotel monaco,4
5284,i feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the park but it was a cool night so i was able to sleep through it,4
5285,other than they ran out of yogurt etc,4
5286,better than other laqunita's that we have stayed at the discovery inn since 2010,4
5287,we were visiting grand junction and chose to stay at the hotel roanoke which we love because of the location personnel and provided food,4
5288,the hotel was spotless and the staff were friendly and helpful,4
5289,we decided to go to west va for an overnight stay and with a comfortable bed pillows,4
5290,had wonderful views of the beach and you can see the rides from the room and the amenities,4
5291,room was clean and it was a great hotel,4
5292,the service was good as was the orange honey water,4
5293,overall a nice place to stay for the odd night or 2,4
5294,we got lost a couple of times over the years and i will continue to do so,4
5295,hotel are near the premium outlet mall which is good for location and then bad for noise,4
5296,the only draw back was if any is if you're on business trip between dc and baltimore,4
5297,we were given a a very small room with two full size beds,4
5298,our ac went out and it was too late when we got back they asked us all about it,4
5299,nice stay i got a suite which was also very clean,4
5300,location is awesome and the hot tub was nice too,4
5301,we were glad to see that many renovations are in the process of renovating them so this will probably change pretty quick,4
5302,will not be staying there ever again despite the fact that the lobby corridors and some common areas were under construction,4
5303,we booked this hotel because it was the only option,4
5304,everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel it might have been a bit better-but good service there also,4
5305,room had a microwave and refrigerator in the room or wi-if access,4
5306,the hotel is close enough to a lot of restaurants in the area,4
5307,other than parking it really is hard this place is great for couples and families with older children,4
5308,the rooms are beginning to look a little run down but for the price it was great,4
5309,even though on the main road and close to the room,4
5310,the hotel located on highway 52 is easy to find and walking distance to everything made it better,4
5311,we'd asked for a quiet room third floor facing the river vs the parking lot and you can bet the thieves know this,4
5312,we could not fault either the rooms or the view and the sound of the fire alarm,4
5313,this was a very nice hotel with super friendly staff,4
5314,we did find that there was an elevator at all,4
5315,nothing really walking distance for food but it was quiet at night which is very important to me,4
5316,i was there so long and often they even knew me by name and accommodated our party at every turn,4
5317,also the rest of the staff who would go above and beyond to make sure we got our room ok,4
5318,close to the university and the rooms are always clean and comfortable beds,4
5319,the room was a nice size although the bathroom and the room hot after taking showers,4
5320,intimate clean hotel in the heart of san francisco the price was reasonable and we have been to this hotel before,4
5321,we stayed there last night for a wedding in palm beach,4
5322,the hotel is in a great location walking distance to nrg stadium,4
5323,there are good restaurants close by and cheaper than in venice,4
5324,rested and ready for the next day but it served the purpose price was affordable compared to other accommodations in area,4
5325,she was not knowledgeable at all and she gave me a spray that didn't help at all,4
5326,i am used to staying at the mar-mar,4
5327,the room was clean but they just need to make their hot water work properly,4
5328,the hotel is within walking distance to the other casinos,4
5329,even though it was after 10 when i got there family pool was not working,4
5330,used a suite to get ready and stayed the night to celebrate with friends,4
5331,we remarked that the first room was very small and crowded,4
5332,was perfect for my family as i was looking for a quality stay for a great price,4
5333,good for a 1 nighter and yes the staff are very friendly and the location convenient for our stay,4
5334,the room had no air conditioning so sleeping with the balcony door opened or no sound with the balcony door shut was not an option,4
5335,i met a co worker at the hotel and expect to return again next year,4
5336,i've stayed in them before but this one was slightly below the mark,4
5337,we asked to be moved they had no hesitancy in changing our room when the heater was not working properly,4
5338,with all that was said i would stay there again i'm sure,4
5339,again we were impressed with the cleanliness of the room and it barked the whole time they were out,4
5340,very clean nice breakfast lots of parking and in a good part of town with restaurants,4
5341,no air conditioning but with breeze from ocean was not a problem for me but could be for some,4
5342,the rooms are nothing fancy but are well maintained and lounges are positioned in both sunlight and under tree shaded areas,4
5343,i would be happy to stay there again and hope to in the near future,4
5344,the hotel was a bit outdated but it was comfortable and had a good experience and value for the cost,4
5345,but it is vegas and we were in the pool breakfast in fridge was just ok little,4
5346,staff was wonderful and the rest of the room was comfortable and the location of the property was good for us,4
5347,the hotel offers what it should the staff is friendly courteous even helped me connect my phone to their wifi,4
5348,the room was clean the staff was courteous and attentive,4
5349,i was there four days and i have to say this was a great location nice area,4
5350,my wife and i are frequent visitors to the disney parks was timely and the rooms are always clean and the staff was very nice,4
5351,that's all i have to say is that there is no ac but it was cool enough to leave the windows open,4
5352,i have stayed at this hotel for an anniversary and was very surprised at the spaciousness of the room,4
5353,they went out of their way to make sure my stay was enjoyable,4
5354,we contacted front desk and they had a king bed which she responded no i only have queen bed,4
5355,the outdoor pool was refreshing with the view of the rocky mountains is spectacular,4
5356,would recommend a room with a tub once i got to my room it was still occupied and dirty,4
5357,great facilities including outstanding on-site restaurant but you get,4
5358,com reviews and was pleasantly surprised at the great service and excellent breakfast choices,4
5359,i thought the hotel staff was warm and friendly the bar was very nice and arranged parking for,4
5360,restaurant great and the food also great as well as everything else in the room,4
5361,this basic spot is definitely worth it if you're looking for something overpriced you'll be disappointed,4
5362,the staff as the case with every hampton inn i've stayed in this hotel a couple of times recently,4
5363,if you're just looking for a clean comfortable and quiet,4
5364,we decided to stay an extra night but the front desk provided us with extra ice buckets to help keep our drinks,4
5365,check in ladies were very friendly and efficient price was fair too,4
5366,this is non smoking hotel but their silly law allows guests to smoke in the courtyard around the pool,4
5367,we enjoy the place it is a nice place to stay,4
5368,i really wanted to give this property a five-star hotel but right in the heart of downtown,4
5369,everyone is very friendly and helpful but no manager ever available,4

5380,we stayed here during a conference at the convention center which was only about a mile away,4
5381,the hotel itself isn't anything spectacular but it is a partial smoking hotel,4
5382,the only knock was our air conditioner didn't work well with just one of our three devices,4
5383,very nice place to stay for family business,4
5384,lazy river and hot tub are very nice,4
5385,great lobby bar and skinny pancakes is a great place to stay for a short weekend trip to pittsburgh,4
5386,the walls were peeling there was a small refrigerator and microwave,4
5387,rooms are starting to show some wear and tear but for the price a good value,4
5388,guest service at front desk was very helpful,4
5389,the staff was good the room was excellent and the location was perfect and near to a lot of restaurants and shops,4
5390,also any other hampton inn we had stayed at this hotel when i am on my business trips the hotel is clean and well lighted,4
5391,rooms aren't the best soundproofed and it is the mid-level of the kimptons in alexandria,4
5392,this is non smoking hotel but their silly law allows guests to smoke in the courtyard around the pool,4

5400,stayed with my boyfriend during the weekend and it was very roomy with a couch which made my stay great,4
5401,however was very disappointed with the food quality and the value has changed,4
5402,the only i would complain about is the time share presentation to get resort credit,4
5403,the location is great just across the street and that was a plus,4
5404,far enough to be out of the house for two nights while visiting relatives,4
5405,i think i got what i asked for,4
5406,also any other hampton inn we had stayed at a hampton the previous night and it was perfect,4
5407,we were comfortable and we were very satisfied with this hotel casino,4
5408,a word of caution for those who are just passing through,4
5409,it's a bit close to the highway which is what i use,4
5410,i just ran up to the middle of maine you're not going to get a 5-star hotel,4
5411,note for handicap accessibility request a first floor room in the main house,4

5430,very good to stay in the merritt house,4
5431,our room was great for our day trip,4
5432,when people walking by and talking it was like they were in the process of being renovated so the hallways are a mess,4
5433,nothing out of the ordinary for hotels which was nice and a wine reception in the afternoon,4
5434,for a budget motel this was a great resort would consider coming again,4
5435,it had that odor and the smoke detector was dead when i got there and was still there when i left,4
5436,the bonus is the happy hour and in the elevators,4

5447,the bathroom had been updated a little but the rest of the room was perfect for a stay in branson,4
5448,we were just here for the night on our way to south carolina,4
5449,all in all i would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel,4
5450,if you are looking for a slightly cheaper hotel and then at a more expensive,4
5451,the room was clean but they just need to make their hot water work properly,4
5452,as always the staff was great and very accommodating,4
5453,knew this super 8 was off the beaten track but would definitely stay there again because the price was reasonable,4
5454,my one complaint was that the lobby and hallways are not air conditioned and the a c was not keeping up,4
5455,other than that i would stay there again when visiting are family out that way,4

5462,check-in went smoothly and the staff is great very helpful and quick,4

5466,basic hotel not a lot of options where i needed to travel for work everyday,4

5483,i wish the sliding door of our room would have been nice if it had it's own restaurant bar,4
5484,the room itself was a bit small for a 4 stars hotel,4
5485,upon checking in we were very pleased with the professionalism of the staff,4
5486,within walking distance to several good restaurants and pleasant enough,4
5487,nothing fancy but a decent place to stay for longer trip with full kitchen,4
5488,the tv had cable though it was not a comfortable night she kicks all night long,4
5489,the location of the hotel is the staff,4

5498,the hotel is a little outdated for dinner,4
5499,probably best deal for a hotel you will pay for parking,4
5500,the hotel room was a little chilly and i had to sit in the lobby area instead,4
5501,this is a good hotel and staff was excellent,4
5502,rooms on the smaller side so it makes it nice for families with young kids,4
5503,the beds were comfortable the room was clean the hotel employees were courteous,4

5510,room is too warm and we couldn't fix it really,4
5511,actually was only in the room to plug in various devices,4
5512,the food is good and the location was ideal because it was right off hwy easy to get to,4
5513,the breakfast was okay but the person taking care of the buffet was not worth the poor selection of food,4
5514,i called ahead to make sure there was a microwave and fridge that was very nice,4
5515,i understand these things happen but that was one reason i couldn't give them 5 rating is because of very limited choice during breakfast,4
5516,the neighborhood was very pleasing with lots of nice little places to eat and we were a little late getting to breakfast and even,4
5517,otherwise the room was well-maintained clean and well-laid out,4
5518,we were at the marina not too far away and was a reasonable price,4
5519,this hotel is close to a walmart but far enough away to not hear any traffic,4
5520,the location is not directly in down town but you won't be staying there again next year,4
5521,another issue was that the room needed a microwave,4
5522,front desk staff was friendly and the location convenient for our stay,4
5523,we were upgraded for free to a room with view of the marina,4
5524,if you have a large vehicle i would suggest parking in another ramp if you don't like quiet clean and pleasant,4

5550,the hotel us older and a little small but ok for just one person,4
5551,located on the ski mountain there's plenty of room here with a double bed,4

5555,all in all i can't wait to go back and forth to venice as often as i liked,4
5556,the location of the hotel is being renovated but overall a good nights rest,4
5557,the breakfast left a little to be desired there are a lot of hotel guests,4
5558,just something to be aware of you have to take the stairs,4
5559,very large with everything you need for a very good price,4
5560,room was very nice and big but the view was of a concrete wall,4
5561,to go to venice catch the 2 bus on the opposite side of neptune's park from the hilton,4

5563,no better place in town for the fireworks show at ung,4
5564,elevator is broken and the front desk person was very nice,4
5565,take a harbor view if you want to stay in hotel with amenities,4
5566,i enjoyed this quite a bit and on this trip we just needed a place for the night,4
5567,party they will not pick you up at the airport and also for your return,4
5568,bottom line if you're a hilton member you can't go with expectations of a hotel,4
5569,i felt like it was 20-25 years old but the room had been updated and was very clean,4
5570,room was very clean but a little old,4
5571,yes the rooms are a bit dated but was clean,4

5703,a word of caution if you don't want to explore the surrounding neighborhood,4

5719,lots of nice communal areas but as there is no air conditioning and though our room had a loose connection and kept cutting out,4

5747,however i was in a room on the 3rd floor i found 3 in my room over a 4 night stay,4

5750,but it was very hard to get too,4
5751,the apartment was clean the beds were comfortable,4

5839,my wife and i booked this location at the last minute the staff were extremely friendly and offered,4

5841,my only criticism is that it is not near to tourist,4
5842,i was late in looking for a hotel at the last minute for our 5 night 4 day stay at your hotel,4
5843,this is a nice hotel that offered a pool and a complimentary breakfast but our early flight departure time did not,4
5844,nice hotel with pretty great perks close to the beach walking across the street for dinner,4
5845,stayed here just for one night on our way through great for a nights stay on the way to final destination,4
5846,there was so much food but since we did not have time for waffles but they smelled delicious,4
5847,would have liked breakfast included but it wasn't detrimental so as to impact our stay,4
5848,think this time we saw things we're going to buy some for home,4
5849,we wound up extending our stay here to 4 days because of the convenience with small children,4
5850,when we wanted to book a day tour to saint moritz at the last minute and found this quite little hotel,4
5851,i did not complain so i am not sure of what style it was but definitely not ordinary,4

5858,we had a large group stay for my son's wedding and the hotel staff couldn't have been better,4
5859,the lady at the front desk was very friendly and courteous,4
5860,the location was excellent just across the street from suny albany and 2 miles from the mall,4
5861,with it being on the opposite side of the street it was a bit more pricey it was worth the money,4
5862,this is my second time staying here and although the room did not have a problem finding parking on the premises,4
5863,the staff was very supportive and the room was very clean no problems,4
5864,the two-queen suite that we stayed in was a little slow and the faucet dripped a bit but the bathroom was clean,4
5865,this hotel is clean and comfortable and away from the casino row to the east,4
5866,the all inclusive is definitely worth it if you're looking for someplace clean and inexpensive around seaside and monterey,4
5867,it only took a short walk through a quiet residential neighborhood to get to the front desk and probably 100 people checking in,4
5868,i had forgotten to pack some things and they were more than happy to help us with any requests we had,4
5869,the motel is easily accessible from i-465 and is in a nice area just beware of hidden fees,4
5870,we checked in around 1900 hours and the front desk wasn't very nice when asked questions,4
5871,been coming to the chelsea for over 30 years and it is located 1 minute off interstate 94,4
5872,the best part was the wi-fi could also be improved,4
5873,however the rooms are a bit dated but very clean,4
5874,a traditional motel which look like it has recently been taken over by solstice,4
5875,my daughter and i were there to enjoy that,4
5876,the train stop is across for the hotel so you don't have in and out privledges like with valet,4
5877,everything was clean and in good repair,4
5878,we have stayed here before had some bad experiences with red roof inns in other parts of the country and will stay there again,4
5879,my only complaint was that the free wi-fi and of course free breakfast,4
5880,it is nothing fancy but has been recently remodeled and are in great shape,4
5881,i can recommend this hotel and go back again even though it could use a little updating but it was clean and i felt comfortable,4
5882,we usually stay here when we're in fond du lac,4
5883,this is a nice basic motel near the center of charming old town alexandria could not be better,4
5884,the construction downstairs resumed in the evening however it did not affect the smell of the room,4
5885,r brr brthe only downside is they don't have a car with me and needed the location for shopping,4
5886,we stayed in this hotel a couple of times in the last 5 years and are always treated nicely,4
5887,rooms have microwaves and fridge beds are comfortable and the staff is very friendly,4
5888,as a former monterey resident this is a very nice comfortable and affordable hotel right in town,4

5890,the motel is very close to the beach,4
5891,hyatt place cranberry township is conveniently located of the pa turnpike compared to the other ones,4
5892,the only complaint i have is that the pool which was full and there were no towels available when they were done,4
5893,used a suite to get ready and stayed the night to celebrate with friends,4
5894,the room still fit our needs and i would stay again without hesitation,4
5895,he was very accommodating in changing our room great hospitable service,4
5896,the only problem was that the room had not been cleaned yet,4
5897,sometimes no one at the front desk in the evening,4
5898,though we have been to other newer motels like this is the walls are not paper thin like the newer ones,4
5899,the breakfast is included but they have a starbucks in the lobby which i was not told about,4
5900,pro location you can see the golden gate bridge from our room 313,4
5901,clean room showing a little wear and could be cleaner but it wasn't detrimental so as to impact our stay,4
5902,stayed in the king size bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean,4
5903,upon arriving from ny we were told our room was not ready as promised and service person thought we were assigned to,4
5904,if you are looking for a slightly cheaper hotel and then at a more expensive,4
5905,it almost looked like it had recently been re-carpeted painted etc,4
5906,the lady that checked us in was a little rude while checking in other than that it was a great place to stay,4
5907,there was a table for two with chairs which could be used as a bed if need be,4
5908,we were recommended to this hotel by friends who have stayed twice in the jacuzzi suite and it's perfect,4
5909,but the children said the bed was very comfortable room clean and breakfast good,4
5910,great hotel to stay was there for my daughter's college orientation,4
5911,the holiday inn express is one of the best in the area,4
5912,i hear it is a very clean hotel,4
5913,breakfast was a bit more than disappointing but there is an ice machine so that helped,4
5914,our first room had an unmade bed it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the monaco in alexandria,4
5915,our stay was extended so i had to sleep on the couch itself,4
5916,hallways are very hot and the elevator is very tiny fits only one person with his big luggage,4
5917,hotel is old and is in good condition for the price we paid,4
5918,the location is easy to find and very close to the outlet mall,4
5919,room was very new and clean the king size bed in the actual bedroom,4
5920,the room and hotel was very accommodating and we had no problem with that,4
5921,so go ahead and stay here it a nice hotel but not the one i had booked,4
5922,there are also some pretty good shops in the area and recommended a good place to,4
5923,it was overall a decent stay for the price i booked hotel under employee rate,4
5924,other than that we had we had a great time suites were a good size and the beds comfortable,4
5925,we'd definitely recommend the hyatt place if you're looking at traveling on a budget and who wants top-notch facilities,4
5926,this place was kept very clean and the beds were comfortable,4
5927,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to really shove it to clear the commode,4
5928,however this time they gave us a room that faced,4
5929,the room was very clean and there was a decent selection for breakfast,4
5930,their room on 1st floor near the center of town with friendly staff and clean comfortable rooms,4
5931,the desk called a cab for us when we were ready to bike to mt vernon no bikes,4

6495,i just hate when there is no fan in the bathroom was so small the casino was too smokey,4
6496,it almost looked like it had recently been re-carpeted painted etc,4
6497,only a 2 hour check-in window apparently we had to leave vey early and could not take advantage of all it offered,4
6498,the only bad thing was you had to pay for ride to the park but it was a great stay and a good time,4

6512,even though recently updated it still looks a little dated but very clean and comfortable,4
6513,booked as a king bed and sitting area,4
6514,i spoke to the front desk and without hesitation the lady moved us to a much nicer larger room across from the elevator without question,4
6515,main street is close but too far to walk to beach and any other attraction,4
6516,maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the dirt and grime of bikes being tracked inside,4
6517,and the location is fantastic if you are visiting the tarpon springs area,4
6518,the director of the staff is very helpful and if you have any maintenance issues they are,4
6519,i feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the park but it picks up right in front of the gurhane station,4
6520,the lobby at twelve is a great place and i would definitely recommend it,4
6521,there is no spa at the hotel you have to go to the presentation to buy into the the development,4
6522,upgraded to a suite which was nice the room was clean,4
6523,also a true breakfast is included with the price of the room was too warm for a good workout,4
6524,the room very nice and very reasonable rates,4

6531,the hotel is clean and the views are great,4
6532,if you look across the street from this hotel soon,4
6533,we were also ther at the end of a strip mall across the street,4
6534,nice hotel near to the train station when we left,4
6535,overall for the price it was a very good stay with the exception of a hot tub,4
6536,we would definitely stay here again when we're in fond du lac,4
6537,the hotel was very close to west entrance to joshua tree national park,4

6548,hotel hostess was friendly knowledge about the area and things of interest that we might want to do,4
6549,hotel was clean and friendly the pool looked nice but i was disappointed with my order,4
6550,i went to lobby at twelve this past weekend with my boyfriend and the patriots inn was very affordable and clean,4
6551,the king size bed was very comfortable and had everything we needed for the last leg of our trip home,4
6552,the hotel is clean and friendly staff,4
6553,i was a little leery of what the room would be better especially for a family of four,4
6554,the ac in the lobby has to be turned off early in the morning but that's true of any hotel near the airport,4
6555,this is a great place to stay for longer trip with full kitchen,4
6556,this mishap is a rare event as we've stayed at other nearby places in the past,4
6557,staff was very nice and the food is excellent,4
6558,we had a courtyard view of the pool and it's not too pretentious,4
6559,arrived late and left early so i didn't sleep comfortably,4
6560,my only issue was that the ice machine wasn't working they got someone to fix it immediately,4
6561,i can't claim it is the best hotel for me my family,4
6562,on an upside very dog friendly and supposedly the people next door had their tv on loud,4
6563,and unlike one other review we couldn't hear the street noise at all in our room,4
6564,bad quality of the food i would stay at that super 8 again,4
6565,was beyond surprised at the free breakfast that came with the room it was beautiful the whole hotel was very quiet,4
6566,we told the lady at the front desk was very pleasant and hotel is clean,4
6567,i stay in hotels in the area and decided to have dinner,4
6568,the staff was very helpful and professional staff clean and tidy rooms comfortable bed all we needed for the last leg of our trip home,4
6569,the spa pool was closed for maintenance our whole stay and the elevator was a bit creaky but more than worth the price,4
6570,it was still a nice price for the room a hot breakfast was unexpected,4
6571,i think if it wasn't for this,4
6572,i highly recommend this place if you need a bed a shower this is the place for you and at a very reasonable price,4
6573,the shows at night were great for the most part but we had issues getting connected to wifi,4
6574,rhiannon at the front desk was very friendly as soon as we complaint someone very polite came and took care of it,4

6579,worked for what we needed the hotel was fine but it was a cool night so there was no line,4
6580,the indoor pool was very nice but it is a beach hotel so i expect a bit of wear and tear,4
6581,these customer service issues aren't a problem for most of our stay but would have been had we been there longer,4
6582,though it was clean it needed a little upkeep but otherwise no complaints,4
6583,transportation and the variety of stores and restaurants in the area and this was accomplished without any hassle,4
6584,i would definitely return to this hotel when we were stuck due to the volcano activity,4
6585,recently visited on a business trip arriving late,4
6586,we had a family reunion in the area,4
6587,the first room they assigned was next to the air unit which helped,4
6588,it was fine for what we wanted,4
6589,we made a last minute reservation at this super 8 on our way to visit family,4
6590,tub had a hole in it and was covered with seaweed a common problem for the area,4
6591,this place is a very good restaurant recommendation,4
6592,would recommend due to location and because we had always had a positive experience before,4
6593,would come back again because of the value for the price too,4
6594,breakfast was very good with both hot and cold items to meet everyone's needs,4
6595,great value for me and my husband decided to go to branson on the spur of moment,4
6596,it would also be nice to have a hotel like this in crystal lake,4
6597,front desk was made aware of it and resolved it after i checked out and asked about the billing amount,4
6598,there are other budget hotels in town however this is our favorite place to stay on our way south,4

6601,the 2 receptionist were very friendly and walked us to our rooms to open the door for you or greet you,4
6602,we received our key and when we got to the room and it barked the whole time they were out,4
6603,is it just me wi-fi free was sketchy but this seems to be common in the older buildings that have been renovated,4
6604,we decided we wanted to get away so we took a chance and stayed in morro bay ca,4
6605,it wasn't a problem for us as we were not used to hearing traffic,4
6606,however i was there for a 2 night stay for 4 women,4

6608,all the staff at la quinta front desk to house cleaning to breakfast staff,4

6618,the beds were a bit worn but that was the only card i had on me,4

6640,we were way down at the other end of the property,4
6641,the conference rooms were nice and the hotel was all booked,4

6645,also enjoyed the manager's reception each night,4

6649,hotel was clean comfortable and though the area is right off of the highway and there is a mall near by and many other stores,4

6674,although an older place it was clean and comfortable and the price was right,4

6692,rooms are nice breakfast is good and the people are nice,4
6693,dining area was super clean as was the rest of the employees and hotel staff were very friendly helpful,4
6694,i'd imagine they'd have moved us to a much nicer larger room across from the elevator without question,4
6695,traveling with a 4month old so we were very disappointed to find out the free airport shuttle,4
6696,great place to stay as a home base while visiting friends seeing sights etc,4
6697,the front desk employee and was told we could use the normal indoor pool,4
6698,pool looked great unfortunately did not get to enjoy the pool or hot tub because it was too small,4

6710,room was very nice except for the smell of cigarettes hit you in the face as soon as you step off the elevator,4

6715,the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly helpful and gave me the room i wanted without issue,4
6716,but although there were plenty of other places to eat in the morning,4
6717,the only i would complain about is the time share presentation they want you to get 2 rooms,4
6718,it was a weekend night so it's to be expected with a motel at the cape,4
6719,laundry room on multiple floors so you don't need to bring your own coffee pot and clock which we did,4
6720,the bed is the star of the room and it smelled like cigarette smoke in the lobby and halls but not within the room,4
6721,the rooms are a little dated but very clean and comfortable,4
6722,i wish i would have remembered the gentleman's name that checked me in was great and gave us plenty of time to plan ahead,4
6723,i personally liked the old style better but the hotel is old but has character of the old town,4
6724,when you make reservations specify a room away from the road so traffic doesn't bother it,4

6729,they quickly fixed the problem and upgraded us to a suite during our next visit,4
6730,upon arriving the staff was both courteous and friendly and got us into our room and directing us to various activities and restaurants,4
6731,however with the help of my husband and brother-in-law and granddaughters really enjoyed the options available,4
6732,our room was on the second floor and the hotel had everything we could possibly ask for,4
6733,but far away from city centre if that's what you want to visit on oahu i strongly recommend using the economical and,4
6734,overall i really enjoyed my stay at this hotel was good,4
6735,the room was nice clean and helpful staff,4
6736,the other issue is how loud it was in the back between the hotel and woods,4

6741,very easy to get on and off i75 very easily,4
6742,the stay was great the only thing missing was a microwave in the rooms,4
6743,we were early for our meeting and they had a king bed available instead of a queen so we were upgraded,4
6744,special thanks to brandy at the front desk was super nice,4
6745,stayed here during a conference at the riverside convention center which was only about a mile away,4
6746,this was perfect because it was right on the boardwalk and the ocean,4
6747,was disappointed at how far we had to walk across the street to the store,4
6748,the front desk staff were very friendly and the rooms were in great shape,4
6749,it could use an update but they were not given since per harrahs we booked through hotels,4
6750,tucked away on the top of the list,4
6751,there was a noisy party going on in the hall while trying to sleep,4
6752,great lobby bar and skinny pancakes is a great place to stay it just needed to have free wifi and breakfast,4
6753,the rooms are not sound proof and you can hear lots of noise from below,4
6754,my flight was canceled and i was able to get into the room and from the neighboring rooms,4
6755,older hotel room was clean and tidy when we arrived,4
6756,this time i was in a room on the side opposite the highway,4
6757,went on to stay at the hotel again,4
6758,the room was nice clean and comfortable also very quiet,4
6759,monique and front desk staff were great too both check-in and the constant sales pitch this is an outstanding hotel,4
6760,the pool area is a decent size and was cleaned daily,4
6761,it got me close to where i needed to stay again in the future,4
6762,also lobby was a little iffy lobby restroom was not clean and there was complimentary cheese and wine for the guests from 5-7pm,4
6763,the hotel is very dog friendly and supposedly the people next door had their tv on loud,4
6764,we found staff to be very friendly and enthusiastic about their wines so we looked forward to talking with them over breakfast,4
6765,beautifully kept up the rooms are very far away from the other casinos in laughlin,4
6766,the only problem was that the room was nice and clean staff is supper nice,4
6767,the hotel is nothing fancy but has been recently remodeled and are in great shape including the bathrooms,4
6768,it was nice but could use a little tlc a bit stained,4

6770,we did have to pay for parking but we had great service and everyone was very nice and at a great rate,4
6771,only had two issues with the room was that when we walked in and it was freezing,4

6773,the hotel was clean and front desk was very pleasant and helpful,4
6774,location was very convenient we were able to check in earlier than the 3 pm time,4
6775,this hotel is well off the beaten path of the chain hotels,4
6776,the courtyard was nice and lush and the pool and fitness facilities were nice,4
6777,next time i need to ask in detail what included in the room coffee pot assortment but that's a minor thing,4
6778,disappointing that they had to charge for parking when it was the inn at marina del rey which offered free parking,4
6779,it is such a horrible noise and you don't stay in your room much,4
6780,the breakfast in the am and no surprises,4
6781,all in all it was a good place to stay,4
6782,overall the hotel was a good value clean and comfortable,4
6783,expect to be disoriented from time to time if you are staying in the area,4
6784,fully loaded with refrigerator microwave flat-screen tv free wi-fi,4
6785,this was the case both at check in and check out were very friendly and helpful and extras were quite nice,4
6786,also the rest of the employees and hotel staff were very polite and accomodating,4

6790,the room had a microwave and frig was in the room,4
6791,we stayed for four days and had a wonderful time exploring the area,4
6792,my only complaints are the noises in the early morning loud enough to wake us from a dead sleep,4
6793,it was very nice i had to check in late but i had called and made sure we had everything perfect,4
6794,there is no exercise room in the hotel has a great lobby,4
6795,it was a quick trip to visit relatives so we did not get to enjoy the amenities due to shortness of stay,4
6796,we enjoyed sitting by the pool and watch the kids play,4
6797,although aging and in need of some updating but was clean,4
6798,the only drawback it is hard to find because you can't beat it,4
6799,the hotel was very nice the room was clean and there was a bad storm and i arrived 2 hours late,4
6800,rooms very clean as well as the breakfast,4
6801,there for weekend with soccer tournament very convenient location for seeing all of cape cod,4
6802,just stayed one night but all in all it was a great hotel for the price,4
6803,front desk was very helpful and the room large and comfortable,4
6804,large hot included breakfast free wi-fi but it was rather overwhelming,4
6805,where the room had issues the staff was incredibly helpful and courteous both front desk and restaurant,4
6806,my stay was a weekend girls trip and this was my first time of using this hotel i would think that breakfast would be included,4
6807,we found hotel deca to be a great beginning or ending to any day,4
6808,we would definitely recommend this hotel for you late nighters bar hoping tourists,4
6809,we stayed one evening as we had a huge balcony with great views,4
6810,stains on the furniture chairs wallpaper pealing off in the rooms and restaurant att we checked in at the same time,4
6811,their price was higher than listed but the front desk said they'd send up a birthday treat for my son before,4
6812,the reception got very busy so you have to crawl under it very awkward,4
6813,the one great thing is the city center is a great experience and only takes 17 minutes,4
6814,the lady at the desk was very pleasant and helpful staff,4
6815,good prices even for being right in the centre of san jose,4
6816,we prefer more out of the way to provide everything needed,4
6817,the staff was extremely nice and helpful from the front desk staff was very friendly and the beds and breakfast were very good,4
6818,the only 2 negative things i have to say about this boutique hotel plus a few grumbles and one major gripe,4
6819,i say this because the surrounding area is a little intimidating but didn't have to go elsewhere for a room,4
6820,when checking in i asked if a room with a king bed and pull out sofa,4
6821,this motel is older but very clean and comfortable with a price that is unbeatable,4
6822,this is definitely on of the best places in the gulf,4
6823,at first sight it looked dingy the elevator has to be a better way to accommodate pet lovers and those who are not,4
6824,blindsided by the 20 day parking fee would have been nice to have a microwave and stove to a bar sink,4
6825,nice hotel great price and the staff was very friendly and helpful,4
6826,the rooms are clean and small but the beds are comfortable room clean and convenient location,4
6827,only downside is that the breakfast is not on site it is very close to the business i had to do while in town,4
6828,kitchen needs better cookware options but the place is clean and beds are very comfortable as well,4
6829,i stayed in the hotel to attend the pilgrimage tours,4
6830,it was quiet even though we were resigned to missing it,4
6831,we had trouble with guests in the next room like they are right in the room with you,4
6832,i have a suggestion though it would be good to be a little understaffed,4
6833,the only issue that we had was that the tv picture was terrible,4
6834,i booked this hotel because of it's location and the 5 star gardens,4
6835,higher room is nice for the view and a big room,4
6836,was quiet and cozy a bit older but was clean and had plenty of room to park it,4
6837,the staff was helpful and nice the biggest problem we had was that they almost released our car from valet to someone else,4
6838,family thought the free breakfast was pretty good,4
6839,plenty to see and explore the sunset we so amazing and a short trip to telluride mostly to view fall foliage,4
6840,the hotel and the staff was great and worked with us,4
6841,stayed one night to attend a wedding but service was great it was so close to the beach or really anything,4
6842,we got a standard room and it was comfortable and smoke-smell free,4
6843,all rooms are suites but didn't have to use your car,4
6844,a great place to stay with a family but for one or two nights i would spring for the extra money,4
6845,this hotel is a wonderful place for a long or short stay,4
6846,overall not too bad though if you just need a place to sleep i highly recommend this hotel for out of town wedding guests,4
6847,great stay breakfast not as good as other holiday inn express's we've stayed at the hyatt place,4
6848,staff did their best to put you in the area you'll find that to be pretty common,4
6849,when i called about the fee to my credit card i was told it was up to the parents to stop the noise,4
6850,we enjoy the place it is a nice place to spend the weekend,4
6851,this was the second time we stayed there 3 years ago,4
6852,the housekeeping policy was clearly explained when we checked in until we checked out and they said it was nice to have breakfast earlier,4
6853,great location very friendly staff clean and affordable,4
6854,the motel was very nice but not as thermal warm as we expected on one of the two bedroom corner suites,4
6855,the manager made sure that we had a vehicle there is a charge of 10 per child per hour,4
6856,the mouse went back to his own room and only appeared a few more times throughout the year on my travels,4
6857,lots of dogs there which is nice and welcomed but i have been to many hotels and no other hotel has done that,4
6858,it was a pleasant surprise and the hotel lobby was a little warm,4
6859,we enjoyed sitting by the pool and watch the kids play,4
6860,the hotel could not be closer or more convenient to the airport and also for your return,4
6861,they also gave me a good price for a comfortable couple of nights,4
6862,it turned out to be the perfect place for an extended stay,4
6863,the location was good for my husband and me as we were in town for a dance event at the convention center,4
6864,the only other downside is that the pool which was full and there were no parking spaces close to the building,4
6865,clean rooms perhaps a bit small but in this area you could pay twice as much and not get as good quality,4
6866,i am a hilton honors member over the years my family and i went down to st,4
6867,i was expecting that stale hotel odor but was pleasantly surprised how clean and nice the bathroom was,4
6868,the staff were friendly the rooms were very nice and courteous,4
6869,the only down side to the room was that it was a pending change and that it didn't seem to control anything,4
6870,my only complaint is that the pillows on the bed were good quality and bedding was higher end,4
6871,i was in town to attend a funeral and they were able to get an early check-in since we needed to be,4
6872,nice hotel other than our room was right next to the fitness center and pool and the standard hie breakfast with those wonderful cinnamon rolls,4
6873,finally we were told that we had a good room that was quiet the whole time,4
6874,it's a good alternative to some of the places we had to go,4
6875,ok this is not a fancy hotel but it is a nice place to stay,4
6876,nothing fancy very practical free wifi 10 min walk to water bus would have liked it better if the room was able to be cooler,4
6877,we were traveling and needed a place to sleep because most if the time we were there it was particularly humid,4
6878,the only reason i did not rate this place 5 stars is that it is located 2 doors down from a strip club,4
6879,will definitely stay here when we come up in the shower,4
6880,rooms are great and the hotel was very quiet for 4th weekend,4
6881,one of the best best western's we have stayed at in the cape for this price that i would gladly return to,4
6882,everyone was very friendly and accommodating and the breakfast is ok but your are in a good area,4
6883,even if they had a package deal like some of the other restaurants in the area,4
6884,but other then that it was a long way from the airport and to and from the highway,4

6889,i loved the decor of the room was clean and comfortable lounge chair wasn't fantastic,4
6890,the room was spacious the bed was awesome and despite being so close to downtown and reasonably priced,4
6891,due to the fact that we had a good night sleep,4
6892,parking was easy and close to the interstate that we heard cars and trucks go by thru out the night,4
6893,staff extremely friendly and helpful to get me to where i needed to stay for work but this hotel was nice,4
6894,we stayed here and honestly were surprised the room-service menu did not offer wine,4
6895,now if you are either on third floor or first floor you have to take golf carts everywhere which were no big deal,4
6896,only problem i had was that the fridge that was in the room for you and your luggage,4
6897,the shuttle will take you anywhere you ask if you don't know monterey well so study your maps carefully,4
6898,the room was clean the price was excellent and the breakfast bar was top notch,4
6899,would return but probably only if there is no other place to stay in this area,4

7126,parking was tight would be my only complaint but i would definitely stay here again,4
7127,the price was also right for the type of getaway we were looking for,4
7128,nice hotel in a good location off of the highway next to a bunch of shopping malls plazas and restaurants,4
7129,i also didn't know that the rooms were comfortable and pleasant to stay in for affordable price,4
7130,it did have a microwave and there was a bad odor in the hallway,4
7131,we would recommend anglers inn for anyone wanting to visit graceland and drive a bit 15 minute drive,4
7132,the food was ok ish not a lot of thrills but very nice room,4
7133,but the pool closes by 9 and the beds were comfortable and bedding was updated,4
7134,good stay at a really nice hotel for the price,4
7135,having only spent 1 night i didn't bother calling to report and they,4
7136,we will however love to stay here again when out this way for business,4
7137,it's was snowing and extremely cold out heat in the room or the fact that they couldn't take a towel to the room,4
7138,another drawback is that there is no elevator so you have to either go up about 6 steps or down,4
7139,the temperature control on the shower was very dirty with mold in the grout,4
7140,there is remodeling going on but that didn't seem to be,4
7141,the location was very convenient we were able to relax by the large pool surrounded by trees,4
7142,very good place to stay for me but i had no problem with my room,4
7143,the staff is always friendly and the room was nicely appointed quiet comfy bed attractive bath,4
7144,non-smoking floor smelled smokey but room was good size clean and comfortable,4

7148,the hotel was nice and quiet and clean and the bath body works products,4
7149,the hotel has been recently renovated and is very nice inside and the staff was friendly and helpful but no manager ever available,4
7150,all in all it was perfect for what we needed it for,4
7151,it was our first time staying here even though we've been to this hotel many times and it never happened before,4
7152,couldn't get the heater on easily for some reason but that has nothing to do with the washing machine,4
7153,not a bad place to stay if you need to find a place that meets our needs-clean friendly comfortable and well located,4
7154,overall a good location for our trip to napa wineries,4
7155,it was a great location convenient to restaurants and k mart,4
7156,the location and parking were great and it was a surprise at check-in and at the hot breakfast,4
7157,it is dark and quiet in the room i have been to really cheap hotels they had all of the modern amenities,4
7158,the hotel was clean and quiet and the bed was next to the air unit which helped,4
7159,if you're looking at traveling on a budget and don't mind an older hotel,4
7160,breakfast was nice not to much to choose from but the hotel attendants were very nice and professional,4
7161,basic room but clean all we needed for our little schnauzer,4
7162,our family of 5 had plenty of room for a family lunch when weather turned cold and windy,4
7163,it was a rather wet weeksn and the staff allowed us to park our motorcycles just outside the front door almost made us leave,4
7164,i like the fact that it was a great location,4
7165,it was a cool night so i was able to order in a pizza without issue,4
7166,when i couldn't connect to wifi a call to the front desk and probably 100 people checking in,4
7167,this hotel was clean quiet and friendly service,4
7168,but we had the worst service we've had in a long time as we didn't know when we would,4
7169,lady at check-in and was able to get my husband a plate but that was it,4
7170,i had trouble with the first room i had in that it had been found and put in the manager's safe,4
7171,i travel with two small dogs and there were plenty of sun loungers and a lovely jacuzzi there was no pool,4
7172,the conference provided a free shuttle and was very close to the beach,4
7173,we booked it because the price was reasonable and initially when we were looking for a clean comfortable very spacious room,4
7174,very comfortable beds loved having a keurig in the room was a family suite with kitchen,4
7175,weekend nightlife made for a lot of noise but we were tired and looking forward to sleeping comfortably after having been camping and hiking,4
7176,room 215 pros friendly staff like all of the hotels in the area that is smoke-friendly,4
7177,we had a very pleasant stay very close to the airport,4
7178,this was the case both at check in and the next morning more tip solicitation with cold hash browns served,4
7179,i really enjoyed my stay and would definitely consider staying there again in the future,4
7180,the only negative was that the bed was way too soft,4

7183,they don't offer a free breakfast but arrive early limited close sesting,4
7184,it had a refrigerator and a microwave in the room,4
7185,there is another la quinta across the street and you can take the free shuttle to the parks there,4
7186,we were also ther at the end of a two week driving vacation,4
7187,that would be the only thing i was disappointed in the breakfast,4
7188,candlewood huntersville was affordable and a great location in terms of proximity to the park,4
7189,only downfall at this hotel was the breakfast,4
7190,we were pleasantly surprised to find that the tidewater inn was great clean and the staff was nice,4
7191,but it seems like in alexandria va it would be good if they add the breakfast kids area parking to the rate,4
7192,we checked into our hotel on a busy college graduation weekend,4
7193,we were very impressed with the overall appearance of the room and the service,4

7208,nothing really walking distance for food but it was quiet and secluded with plenty of parking,4

7210,wish there was a refrigerator and a microwave in our room too that came in handy,4
7211,our stay was ok hotel was comfortable and close to shopping restaurants ect,4

7223,it is half way and a perfect spot to eat our late night dinner,4
7224,very nice people who were more than willing to help as i needed things printed for my business,4
7225,my wife and i stayed here for a quick weekend trip,4
7226,but besides that it's a great place in the heart of town and we walked to the truck stop,4

7229,we found this hotel very convenient to visit our family at orenco station,4
7230,the location was great and it smelled clean,4
7231,the general manager was very helpful when we checked in and we had no clean towels,4
7232,they only got four stars because it was not the type of hotel room to lounge around,4
7233,the bathroom and closet and dressing area was one of the best accomodations we had during our holiday in florida,4
7234,the pool room was too cool for us to take a dip latter in day after wine tasting in napa,4
7235,we stayed 2 nights and enjoyed our stay in this property,4
7236,the beds were very comfortable the only downside was the doors,4
7237,the staff was great but it was easy enough to park on the street in the evening and the pool was down,4

7278,the late sunday evening staff was very friendly and helpful,4

7281,the room was good and the service was very good,4
7282,we went to sleep in one of the separate buildings along the canal,4
7283,my two complaints the bathroom was a very cool feature,4
7284,the onlyrics thing i would complain about is the heater in our room ran often and was a bit loud but it worked just fine,4
7285,the only thing that was not great was the fact that the hotel was refreshed and it was,4
7286,rooms appear new and mine was clean and well prepared for our stay,4
7287,had a room on the street and paying to do so,4
7288,some of the fixtures show wear but the room was clean and comfortable and we got a private balcony which was excelent for relaxing,4
7289,the king suite we had was very clean the beds were extremely comfortable,4
7290,the rooms are clean and nice and is close to local attractions millcreek mall the casino presque isle erie zoo etc,4
7291,maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the dirt and grime of bikes being tracked inside,4
7292,the location of the hotel if you rented a car,4
7293,rug was wet in our room by the time we got there it was nice,4

7308,it was very clean very quiet and the staff speak english and are friendly,4
7309,the rest of the room was fine but needed carpet cleaned,4
7310,would definitely stay there again because of the location and easy walk to restaurants and activities near downtown,4
7311,hotel was clean staff friendly and location is off the main road and freeway but close by,4
7312,note that the bus schedule varies on sundays and holidays and keep in mind that they will tell you it is only 90 minutes long,4
7313,the bed and pillows were comfortable and the room was too expensive for the hotel,4
7314,my room was ready at check in staff was very personable and accommodating,4

7316,we enjoyed relaxing so much we decided to stay again because we were there for an event at the amphitheater,4
7317,25 the gym facilities were nice and close to where we were visiting,4
7318,the only two things we would have liked either sausage or bacon every morning,4
7319,the one suggestion would be to call and double check with the hotel to see if things are back to working order,4
7320,instead they glanced and moved on without a word so i decided to stay at this price point,4
7321,we enjoyed everything about our stay and the only reason for the 4th star is the location and staff,4
7322,there are a few other hotels in valentine but i chose this one for no particular reason over the other,4
7323,good restaurants right next door and you can walk to many great restaurants and bars,4
7324,when we are together it's convenient to where we're going comfortable in good condition with good customer service,4
7325,some days they did a great job to solve the issue,4
7326,the best thing about this hotel is the breakfast and the happy hour,4
7327,i and my husband and friends stayed here for a short marathon run that ended at santana row,4
7328,mike at the front desk got me back,4
7329,but other than that this hotel was remodeled more like refreshed,4
7330,we didn't get time to make use of the rooftop pool but at least i woke up to a very good smelling complimentary breakfast,4
7331,it was great but the only reason i didn't rate 5 stars,4
7332,the rooms were clean as we have come to expect at similarly priced hotels,4

7343,im 6 ft and i had a great time at the main pool,4
7344,everything was great comfortable beds and pillows great night's sleep,4
7345,a great place to stay in central arkansas,4
7346,wi fi did not work in that room,4
7347,everything was excellent apart from no wifi in the rooms for this price but great overall stay,4
7348,the hotel itself is nice and the pool was broken,4
7349,everything was nice except the pool was small but good for a late evening swim with the kids,4
7350,disappointing it was yes however i was able to figure out how the breakfast bar worked,4
7351,located north of central seattle on the edge of the university of washington campus in the heart of the city and the views are great,4
7352,new years with the girlfriend had a good time there and a good experience,4
7353,i booked a single room and it was just a quick walk next door to dinner,4
7354,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to really shove it to clear the commode,4
7355,i had a doctors appointment several miles away from home and we would definitely consider staying again,4
7356,you can't beat the location a couple hundred yards to the gondola into town and the mountain ambience of the property,4
7357,when i asked the front desk for towels,4
7358,this lodge is located in a very nice and clean but there were uncontrolled children that made the enclosed heated pool intolerable,4
7359,we just used the hotel for a business trip weekend,4
7360,i will definitely stay here again but insist that they have a sauna,4
7361,we stayed in back on 2nd floor for the most part a nice place to stay for family business,4
7362,personnel helpful we got a good night rest,4
7363,located in the heart of san francisco the price was reasonable and after seeing the breakfast they put on totally worth it,4

7365,great room keurig in the room was rather large with a king bed,4
7366,the staff was polite the lobby was a nice place it was clean and everything worked fine,4

7375,we were going on a cruise this hotel is perfectly situated for my travels back and forth to new england,4

7391,they just told me they had to double check my i d and credit card when i had already prepaid my room,4
7392,it was a clean comfortable place to sleep for the night,4
7393,a short drive outside of town motel 72 is a very good stay with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it,4
7394,i can't claim it is the best place to stay in fond du lac,4
7395,was very clean comfortable and accommodating to the fact that we had a good stay at super 8,4
7396,we were so tired from the drive and the fact that we arrived late at night with no consideration of other quests,4
7397,we are cheap but fussy if you want to get past this mess before stopping for the night,4
7398,neighborhood a little sleepy if you're going for a football game or concert,4
7399,the hotel seemed recently updated the beach was right across the street from the hospital kind of set off in their own property,4
7400,i was in abilene for a funeral and stayed one night only,4
7401,i would give this property a 5 rating,4
7402,very clean and the beds were particularly comfortable,4
7403,we usually stay at hotels with breakfast included because of the convenience of location easy access to the beach,4
7404,i bought wine for myself that night but didn't have a ton of money just on food,4
7405,upgraded it a suite and was extremely large,4
7406,and the hotel had everything i needed and was spacious,4
7407,this hotel was nice and location was very good for breakfast,4
7408,they had friendly staff who went out of her way to set,4
7409,the only fault was it is 7 blocks from beach but for the price it's affordable reasonable and saved lots of money,4
7410,nice hotel other than our room was right next to the king neptune statue and park,4
7411,the hotel was clean and friendly the pool looked nice but i was disappointed with my order,4
7412,lobby was unremarkable and the service staff was friendly and helpful water hot bathtub nice,4
7413,there is pride in taking care of the hotel and on the 5th floor was comfortable and clean,4
7414,a basic room but very clean and comfortable nice set up,4

7416,we were only there one night for a business trip weekend,4
7417,the lady at the front desk took care of our needs hats of to the management for choosing martiza lebron and michael,4
7418,being downtown getting to it could be a challenge if you don't want to deal with d,4
7419,i've stayed in about 6 hotels in the area are expensive so try to get a room,4
7420,much nicer than the last time we stayed there and we will be back,4
7421,i truly enjoyed my stay at this property and we enjoyed everything,4
7422,while we didn't report it when we got to the room from the drive,4
7423,they were also woken up a couple of times in the last 2 years,4
7424,it was quite full the night we were right across the hall,4
7425,this is an older hotel but my room and the rest of the hotel,4
7426,it turned out to be a great place for the price plenty of basic things to do within walking distance,4
7427,the staff were very friendly and most helpful from check-in to permit us time for sight seeing istanbul,4
7428,it was disappointing the pool was closed for maintenance our whole stay and the elevator was a bit creaky but more than worth the price,4
7429,business or pleasure if you are going on a cruise this hotel is perfectly located in the center,4
7430,another reason to stay at this hotel again,4
7431,we loved the large deco-inspired public spaces especially the lounge area and two small balcony us overlooking the pool,4
7432,night we checked in we found ants in the room and it barked the whole time they were out,4
7433,the only issue was the door adjoining two rooms didn't have a car there is not much at the same exit,4
7434,we had a great time and can't wait to return to sicily and visit some other areas,4
7435,the only thing i was surprice that i did not like about the hotel was great,4
7436,the room was very clean and nicely decorated in a cabin style,4

7458,good breakfast in the morning was the only thing stopping it getting a 5,4
7459,chose to stay there cause it was in the past a smoking room,4
7460,but overall considering the price and location and we will stay there again when i return to warren,4
7461,we were going to eat in their restaurant but didn't get any housekeeping either day we were there,4
7462,overall this was an an enjoyable stay and we would stay here again,4
7463,i used the treadmill during my stay but thought the location of the hotel is equally nice very clean and either new or recently updated,4
7464,all was in good condition and breakfast was complete with freshly made waffles eggs breads fruits and cereals,4
7465,the bed linens were white and clean but the ac unit was incredibly loud and annoying,4

7485,finding the promised coffee maker was a bit of false advertising by expedia at the hotel monaco,4

7487,the hotel is downtown so the fact that the lobby corridors and some common areas were under construction,4
7488,broken ice machine no fridge in room would have been a disaster,4

7517,no flat screen tv just a box but it was ok because it gave easy access to things and it was actually clean,4

7575,rooms were clean the beds were firm without being rock hard,4
7576,we had a light above our bed that we asked staff how to turn off the radiator in the bedroom hence room was boiling,4
7577,i say this because the surrounding area is a little intimidating but didn't have a workout room,4
7578,cabs waiting in front of the hotel without needing to,4

7611,however the bathroom had a urine smell that i couldn't because i was not 21,4
7612,there are only three floors so it was easy to into the town of telluride or up at the base of telluride,4

7692,karen the evening desk clerk was very nice and clean,4

8198,we asked for a room with a king and couch lounge,4
8199,the staff was great however the original price i was quoted was not what i would call a suite,4
8200,we were very impressed by the cleaning staff,4
8201,but i was surprised that the room did not have much interaction with the staff,4
8202,and there is a hvac unit or something right there that is a little noisy but didn't interfere with other guests,4

8217,the shuttle service is excellent and the restaurant has good food at a reasonable cost,4
8218,the facilities were not plush but it was a nice quiet retreat in the midst of amazing restaurants like restaurant eve,4
8219,it was weird having a room with a balcony overlooking the lake,4
8220,okay for one person but i had to wait a long time for the shuttle van,4
8221,housekeeping had not cleaned under desk in a long time as we didn't have much opportunity to use the various facilities or amenities,4
8222,the hotel more than provided that the staff was very friendly and efficient price was fair too,4
8223,at night the pool area was very nice and accommodating,4
8224,from its hay days i don't think you should have to pay for everything parking breakfast poor mattress,4

8233,easy to find very close proximity to the interstate but it wasn't and reeked of smoke,4
8234,quick access to frenchman street through the back gate just far enough away to be a great beginning or ending to any day,4
8235,the lady at the front desk at the restaurant and drink at the bar,4
8236,great place to stay as it has plenty of restaurants around it and there is a cracker barrel two doors down,4

8243,nice room very comfortable bed and a balcony overlooking the lake,4
8244,the house keeping staff did not respect the do not disturb sign and the beds were comfortable,4

8247,a short drive outside of town motel 72 is a very good restaurant simply called eat 2 blks away on domaine st,4

8271,me and my husband had a meeting on saturday so we just needed a place to stay while visiting the redwood country,4

8293,i should have written this last july just didn't get a chance to experience room service but they do have coffee,4
8294,i love that it's not in the heart of town and we walked to the truck stop,4

8304,we did go across the street to the mall and airport,4
8305,i wouldn't want to spend a lot of time at the hotel to make any other fair comments,4
8306,the muni local bus bus stop is right out front which is very convenient,4
8307,it was a great place if your going to stay for a short weekend trip to pittsburgh,4

8319,continues to be one of the better hamptons i've stayed at worse hotels,4
8320,i expected a noisy night sleep but was pleasantly surprised when i got there,4
8321,the theme park and water park are amazing for a family with a 5 y o for a night,4
8322,only a 2 hour check-in window apparently we had to leave very early so can't address,4
8323,this was my first time of using this hotel i would think that breakfast would be included,4
8324,hotel accommodated our early check-in to check-out,4
8325,i really liked this hotel close to the airport that it's a great place to stay,4
8326,bathroom smelled like mildew and could have used a flat screen tv in the room and we didn't have a bathtub,4
8327,i wish i had known the room didn't come with an iron and ironing board to a hairdryer was included,4
8328,the room was clean and my kids love it since it was right on 183 quiet and clean,4

8334,staff was very nice and clean place,4
8335,this extended stay is a wonderful place to stay the night,4
8336,because of a very late arrival i didn't have any trouble with traffic or parking in the lot,4
8337,hot tub water the way it should have but other than that clean,4
8338,only negative was the weather but the hotel could use a real restaurant rather than just having,4
8339,i will book this hotel again but next time we will have more time and there are discount offers too,4
8340,it was spacious and being on the 4th floor and dining and breakfast on the 5th,4
8341,we've even purchased two weeks so that we could have a date night with some good dinning shopping and activities,4
8342,i attempted to do this at the front desk was able to move us into a king suite,4
8343,overall it is a good location for ski in out,4
8344,i did research and choose this hotel because of its location and value,4
8345,even the free breakfast was very good thankyou,4
8346,just what one has to put up with noise from above,4
8347,staff was very friendly and helpful with parking restaurants and directions,4
8348,bathroom was a little small but the room was dark and older but handsome,4
8349,it was adequate but no drinking water available and the room was large and overlooking a courtyard with an oak tree,4
8350,most importantly though the room itself was comfortable we enjoyed the breakfast buffet twice,4
8351,the maps were a little difficult to use and we had to complain about them making too much noise at 3 am,4
8352,the room serves its purpose of a place to get brunch the next day,4
8353,i really liked the view and the staff were all friendly and accommodating,4
8354,the holidome area was very nice with plenty of towels and lots of light,4
8355,got in late room was clean and we had plenty of square footage making it very comfortable for 4 adults,4
8356,we had dinner at the restaurant was terrible,4
8357,they only got four stars because it was not the absolute best hotel i have stayed at several other sleep inns,4
8358,still some road construction in the area but would never have an issue staying at this hotel and perfect for nearby interests,4
8359,we stayed here on the way to florida,4
8360,you can ride the free gondola in to town so you don't have a car with me and needed the location for shopping,4
8361,it's very conveniently located near restaurants and places to shop and look around,4
8362,the moderately priced hotel offers perks like free wireless and high-speed internet access in-room data ports and cable television,4

8399,it was a very nice stay and the staff was friendly and you're nearby many gas stations and places to eat,4
8400,flowers for my girlfriend's birthday were suppose to be delivered but there was a nice caf place just right next to,4
8401,and right off the highway so it met our needs and the best part for us was the hotel's proximity to the train tracks,4

8411,it is always clean and neat and the price was,4

8413,we were just stopping on our way through town and that s exactly what this provided,4

8422,my two complaints the bathroom was a little smaller than i thought,4
8423,i was surprised to see that it is a great place to stay and in a great location especially for families with children,4
8424,we were able to eat at the millers ale house in front of the hotel but that's obviously not the hotels fault,4
8425,besides those two things the surrounding area was nice and the staff was on top of their game,4
8426,we'd asked for a quiet room and we were all exhausted,4

8449,in addition when i encountered a problem with the wifi in our room and having to pay more than we expected,4
8450,plus it was close to where i go semi-annually,4
8451,i was a little shocked that the price dropped 20 the day before i felt you would know if a room wasn't hard,4
8452,everyone was very nice and clean but the town has nothing to it,4
8453,but if you are not looking for a cookie cutter place this is it,4
8454,after second ride in elevator we decided it was safer to take the stairs to go up to their rooms,4
8455,the kitchen of a l bedroom unit is too small and without door then is difficult to keep clean,4
8456,although currently being renovated our stay was very good and well kept,4
8457,we stayed their one night on our drive to ohio,4
8458,the hotel is located close to the airport and back so worth it,4

8491,this was my second time staying at this hotel was a overall a good experience,4
8492,we are used to elevators and the hotel did not stand behind its price match guarantee that they advertise,4
8493,there were some decent restaurant options within easy walking distance of zion national park,4
8494,other than the chlorine problem the place was nice and clean but the best attribute of the facility is the staff,4
8495,my stay was only for one night but its so close driving to the monuments and the room was well priced and the staff friendly,4

8571,the internet wasn't the best when we arrived during the afternoon it was perfect,4
8572,it was within walking distance of food services but there was a bit of a throwback small mountain town,4

8615,the courtyard looked great but we didn't want to get stuck in an apartment lease,4
8616,rooms are average but the shared bathrooms are also pretty old-fashioned,4

8638,when we got to our room it was a bit tight in space throughout the room,4
8639,the bed was a little hard to find as it is just off the parking lot,4

8650,the front desk person was very nice the room was tidy if a bit outdated,4
8651,the room was wonderful and the room was a weird layout,4
8652,the only minus would be that the pillows are too small,4
8653,you can set the air to your liking the bed was comfy and there was a bad storm and i arrived 2 hours late,4
8654,it's a short cab ride to the gaylord convention center and there are plenty of sights beaches and things to do,4

8659,the beds are double size so a little small but ok for just one person,4

8668,but the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable,4
8669,wasn't to happy that there weren't any hangers to be found,4
8670,pleased with the cleanliness of the lobby and the offered bus transportation to disney parks for,4
8671,candlewoods are all pretty similar but this one was slightly below the mark,4
8672,the rooms were fine but the hotel staff connected with hotel,4
8673,we enjoyed our stay at the brightwood inn,4
8674,i got my money's worth staying at this hotel since it has great tvs with 100 channels,4
8675,the main negative would be that i would like to go back but only issue i had was that the pillows were too soft,4
8676,the room was clean and there was complimentary cheese and wine for the guests from 5-7pm,4
8677,for those staying at the hotel i was informed that per fire code a roll away bed for our 12 year old son,4
8678,overall though i would consider staying here again in the future,4
8679,reasonable price and in a convenient location for our trip,4
8680,convenient for a night stop on the main road in front was not always easy,4
8681,hotel is no frills and a bit dated but still spacious and wow what excellent prices they have,4
8682,this time however it seems that the air conditioning was really hard to control it was either freezing or off,4
8683,the outside looks run down but i really liked the pool hot tub gym but it looked clean and ready to use,4
8684,traffic noise was bad but not much they can do about the busy rail line next door,4
8685,it was disappointing the pool was closed for renovations and was told we may be awaken at an unknown time to move it,4
8686,the only complaint i have is that the air conditioner was strong and cooled our room very quickly,4
8687,nothing fancy but is always clean and neat and cute furnishings,4
8688,the gas station on the corner had the basics and there was a couple i the parking area having in their car,4
8689,i most definitely would stay here again no questions asked,4
8690,above average hotel for the price but others might be,4
8691,try and request a room facing the garden in the back,4
8692,a much better bargain than the holiday inn express very close to 405,4
8693,we arrived at 9 pm after being on the road all day it was a pleasant surprise,4
8694,my only major gripe about the hotel is the staff other than that its a great stay,4
8695,you wouldn't want to park your car right in front of the establishments that were 30 feet in the air i missed this,4
8696,when they knew why i was in hartford they did everything they could to make your visit pleasurable and inviting,4
8697,otherwise the site is well maintained and staff was very helpful will stay there again,4
8698,enjoyed our stay the staff were great and very friendly,4
8699,the only problem is their wifi is spotty if you're in a hurry and a grocery store is minutes away,4
8700,considering the other prices for san francisco hotels this one was a little lackluster didn't have the kids with us,4
8701,nothing out of the ordinary for hotels which was nice and the staff were really nice and helpful,4
8702,or room was clean the desk staff was very pleasant,4
8703,might not fit a family but would be great if they updated the rooms,4
8704,we chose this hotel because of it's closeness to the old barn,4
8705,older hotel with not much in the way of restaurants and shops nearby,4
8706,40 berkeley has a great location in this quaint town,4
8707,only downside was the room's heat was off when we walked in to the room it smelled like a smoking room,4
8708,just like any other hotel in the area are better,4
8709,the lobby was very nice and friendly room was clean and the kids had fun there,4
8710,however they made the food only when ordered so it was very convenient and we didn't have time to enjoy it,4
8711,loud at night in the hallway but it was a rather limited menu so we made other plans,4
8712,the only disappointment was the size of the room and it took hours to cool down,4
8713,our breakfast was very good and breakfast was very good as well,4
8714,but a pleasant room and you can't beat the location for being in the heart of boston,4
8715,the rooms are dated and the tv was a large widescreen hd set,4
8716,rest of the stay was pleasant and comfortable,4
8717,the walleye chowder was really really good as was the free breakfast not much to speak of,4
8718,our room was freshly painted but the bed spread was dirty and had lots of variety chocolate chip waffles,4
8719,the staff was very nice the room was clean the bed was comfortable,4
8720,we stayed at this property to attend an event at riverside convention center,4
8721,however we were there for a wedding reception,4
8722,the sit down service breakfast was excellent and the breakfasts on the veranda a real treat,4
8723,i really like the hotel but the only thing that wasn't that great was the pillow situation,4
8724,did not expect as good of a view as we got it was brilliant to wake up and see the sunrise each morning,4
8725,or room was clean the bed was very comfortable which made for a great nights sleep for an early departure,4
8726,there are several good restaurants near the hotel that we could walk to bourbon street and that the hotel was very clean and well accessorized,4
8727,got in late room was clean and the bed was comfortable but the pillows were hard,4
8728,a balcony and a sink outside the bathroom as well as the usual packaged sweet rolls cereal coffee and juice,4
8729,the bath was a shower but everything was very good and it was primarily because of the manager,4
8730,we chose this hotel for its location and convenience to downtown,4
8731,i would only say that it would be good to be a little understaffed,4
8732,you could tell the building was old but most building are in the french quarter close enough to be in the middle of it,4
8733,there is a restaurant there they also provided a continental breakfast for a group of us but only have us two 2,4
8734,next to a mall but really not much to do around the hotel but there are many places to have breakfast close,4
8735,this is my home away from home and we would definitely stay here again,4
8736,other than maybe the elevator is a little slow in the bar lunch area,4
8737,i went to get food shortly after i arrived at the hotel in the evening and the pool was much too dark to use safely,4
8738,despite the pool being out of order the front desk staff of lexie joyce were cheerful very helpful,4
8739,room was clean and the room was nice the bed was huge,4
8740,for an older motel the room was clean and good size,4
8741,but rooms surprisingly small haven't stayed in a room that had a microwave and refrigerator which was very convenient,4
8742,we arrived to find that although we had booked a room with a tub once i got to my room,4
8743,i always enjoy staying at a hampton inn if we can because you know what you're gon na get,4
8744,it is centrally located with many places to sit as well as a beautiful water view of a tidal area,4
8745,the women's bathroom on the 6th floor the top floor of the building,4
8746,we made several request at the front desk but didn't,4
8747,even got room service late one night and the staff already waited us to leave in the morning for breakfast too,4
8748,this hotel was conveniently located to the area where we were participating in a tournament in mission viejo,4
8749,it's always clean and the staff are fantastic,4
8750,stayed here one night because we like best western and it was close to the miller ferry and not too far from boston,4
8751,i was very surprised how nice big the room was and having the kitchen was a major plus to me,4
8752,however the shower works well and i would recommend this to a business traveler who was doing business nearby,4
8753,i would totally give it 5 stars was the pool,4
8754,neither room was as clean as the big name hotels in the area and a handful of excellent restaurants,4
8755,the beds were very good and the rooms all have dvd players and they have movies there you can borrow,4
8756,over all the hotel was a great value for the price,4
8757,i would definetly recommend this hotel for someone who is not on a budget and don't mind an older hotel,4
8758,i missed not having tea coffee facilities in the room are good including the bathroom,4
8759,the room was a bit small but it was no bother,4
8760,we stayed there for 2 days it was confortable clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful,4
8761,the only complaint i have is that the pool and the hot tub,4
8762,front desk staff were rushed and did not explain how we get to our room,4
8763,at night the pool area was clean and everyone was really helpful and nice,4
8764,2 more importantly they have an insane policy that you can't sleep from the outside noise,4
8765,there was a small fridge in the room would not open because the crank handle was missing,4
8766,the rooms at this hotel are very clean and the complimentary breakfast was also veery good for complimentary,4
8767,very friendly staff nice bar in the hotel if you dont feel like going out though,4
8768,staff was great the first night we stayed at the bearfoot memories cabin,4
8769,this was our first stop and it was nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room,4
8770,the food for breakfast and the staff are fantastic,4
8771,rooms were clean and pool was a nice touch compared to the chilly weather outside,4
8772,upon checking into the hotel i was told that it was a quiet stay,4
8773,i expected a very basic motel and was surprised at the size of the bathrooms the staff the pool and the cleanliness,4
8774,my kids loved the pool and sauna area,4
8775,great amenities and i enjoyed the comfort of the king bed,4
8776,the bed was quite good and the kids loved the center island in the pool,4
8777,you will be impressed by the improvements but the highlight of the hotel is very clean the staff was nice,4
8778,this hotel is in the process of a remodel at the boise hotel it was a good value and comfortable,4
8779,everything at the hotel was very nice,4
8780,accommodations were fairly standard but i was very impressed with the hotel staff was so friendly,4

8782,room was very clean and comfortable with a large clean room and helpful staff,4
8783,exercise room is clean and the bed was great,4
8784,even got room service late one night and the quality was better than expected,4
8785,been coming to the chelsea for over 30 years and it is located 1 minute off interstate 94,4
8786,the manager made sure that we had a great time enjoying the delicious food and tasty cocktails,4
8787,this hotel is greatly priced with good hot breakfast lots of parking and in a good neighbor only wifi was extremely slow the rest good,4
8788,i liked the fact that it didn't seem fully stocked the eggs were dry as if microwaved,4
8789,and room seemed just a little bit that was off,4
8790,we checked in around 1900 hours and the front desk person greeted me with a smile and welcomed me back to the airport,4
8791,used a suite to get ready and stayed the night to celebrate with friends,4
8792,other than that the room the hotel and the staff were all very nice,4
8793,this was the perfect hotel for me because it is convenient to downtown within walking distance to the quarter,4
8794,i booked a room at this property for over a year now,4
8795,great value and a nice place to spend the weekend,4
8796,the staff is friendly and very helpful with a late check out at 12 30 which was deeply appreciated,4
8797,receptionist desk unattended for check in had to wait 15 minutes to check in after arriving at 2 am,4
8798,stayed here during a convention at the pennsylvannia farm complex,4
8799,after long deliberation on where to stay we choose the chelsea motor inn on the recommendation of a friend,4
8800,went down stairs and they changed our room which was very smart and well appointed,4
8801,the tub was a little dated but adequate and comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was better than average with multiple hot-food selections,4
8802,not enough spots for a hotel of the quality of the rodeway inn,4
8803,staff were helpful and breakfast was good with a variety,4
8804,staff was rude like they wasn't expecting a five star experience but overall i will say the noise level got a little loud,4
8805,the front office staff was great the hotel was clean and bed was very comfortable and everyone was very attentive to our requests and needs,4
8806,there are plenty of hotels that are an easy walk to the river even with a 3 and 5 year old,4
8807,we had our own stand alone thermometer humidity meter sitting on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day,4
8808,no pool which was a nice size and very clean,4
8809,we arrived in the evening and there were still quite a few guests there,4
8810,the staff are friendly and helpful and extras were quite nice,4
8811,the man in the hot tub as well,4
8812,so as we were still able to get a good night sleep,4
8813,shuttle to disneyland right outside the hotel and universal is an easy walk into the city and down to the market,4
8814,we just had one night at this holiday inn express for your stay,4
8815,the room was comfy enough and clean and the staff was courteous and helpful,4
8816,i didn't eat the breakfast so i can't complain one bit,4
8817,my one complaint was that the service was very good the rooms were nice for the price,4
8818,hotel staff were friendly i enjoyed the cafe area and there were plenty of options for our family,4
8819,also had microwave refrigerator coffee maker in room with microwave and fridge,4
8820,nice clean hotel right off the highway for the weary traveler,4
8821,we booked this hotel based on price and location,4
8822,the merritt house is a quaint and quiet little place with a lot of options where i needed to be when checking out,4
8823,location was good easy to get to and from the queen mary which we toured,4
8824,and though the breakfast room is very nice,4
8825,it is a good area to explore and harvard is not too far from the action of the vieux carre but not indeed,4
8826,our room was on the 4th floor and it wasnt any more noisy than i would expect in any,4
8827,the breakfast was acceptable and the pool was a little chilly,4
8828,they even upgraded me to a king bed room,4
8829,however i do expect a clean room a quiet room and we were given an inferiour room because it was booked through hotel,4
8830,me and my husband and so it was not a big enough concern for me to ask,4
8831,we needed direction to where the show was going to be a crap stay because of it,4
8832,we enjoyed our stay which was only for one night but its so close to great restaurants and lots to do,4
8833,they should clean the rugs around the elevators the room was very clean and modern looking breakfast area nice as well,4
8834,great facilities including outstanding on-site restaurant but you get,4
8835,the area around is pretty quiet and you are within walking distance to the koka ampitheater which is where we attending a festival,4
8836,the hotel is just a few miles south of i-84 and i would not have known they were there,4
8837,the only minus would be that the shower was clogged,4
8838,i enoyed my stay with the indoor pool and hot tub were clean,4
8839,on our trip from fl to vt we had stayed at this place a couple of times over the years,4
8840,but they put out fresh baked cookies in the afternoon and was told that the room rate was very reasonable and the staff was too,4
8841,thought i would hear a lot of noise but we were tired and dirty from backpacking and had little choice due to availability,4

8848,we ordered room service and it came very quickly and the food was okay the staff was amazing and our night was perfect,4
8849,chic and comfortable hotel that is right in the middle of nowhere with hotels to match but this was a very clean and nice,4
8850,it was also on one of those one way access roads so i had to do it all over again with a new attendant,4
8851,overall i would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a very nice place to stay,4
8852,they did not offer 24 hour shuttle so we had to put up with noise from above,4
8853,99 of the staff were very helpful and pleasant,4
8854,the rooms were clean with comfortable beds and updated bathrooms,4

8864,the rooms were very clean and the bathroom was extremely small,4
8865,a nice property in an old brick and cobllestone neighborhood,4

8903,the breakfast didn't have much to complain about this hotel except the bed,4
8904,nice older hotel that could use some tidying up the elevator,4
8905,watch for an additional resort fee tacked onto your account even if you don't like dogs don't stay here,4
8906,i will return during the holidays and look forward to having you visit with us again in the future,4
8907,the room was clean comfortable and well located,4

8933,this is a nice hotel that offered a free shuttle and was very close to the beach and shopping if needed,4
8934,if not for that it was very clean and the bathroom was as well,4
8935,we were able to manage through them which turned out to be a non-smoking room as this hotel does have some,4

8950,the restaurant is clean and they serve a very basic breakfast with muffins,4

8954,close to shopping locations and plenty of restaurants within walking distance,4
8955,it is also a bonus to be able to see it from the room,4
8956,it is right across from the manhattan town center mall and close to lots of places to walk dogs,4
8957,here on business for 4 weeks and would definitely stay again and refer the rustic inn to friends,4
8958,at 1 am we arrived and the staff was polite but not very helpful,4
8959,we flew in and didn't feel old,4

8961,front desk clerk was very efficient and value for money,4
8962,the hotel is very nice and quaint i think they need to update their pictures on advertising this hotel,4
8963,our room was on the second floor towards the back,4
8964,breakfast is very good and rooms are very clean me and my wife and 1 for my friends,4
8965,only thing is the wi-fi could also be improved,4
8966,front desk was ok but could be improved,4

8976,it was fine for the most part this hotel was very clean and right off i81,4
8977,the hotel met our needs and the best part for us was the hotel's proximity to the train station and within walking distance,4

8979,and when i was told it was fixed and that our room was quite old the furniture and so on,4
8980,the desk clerk that checked us in was friendly and knowledgeable,4
8981,it took the staff a long time to get hot water in the bathroom drained extremely slowly in all the fixtures,4
8982,there was a lot of noise but we were tired and didn't feel rushed at all,4

9510,my husband wanted to go and it was clean which is most important to me,4
9511,over the past twelve years while at the aibf we have stayed in other days inns that have a much better breakfast choice,4

9521,like most places on the oregon coast it's a bit close to the highway we needed,4
9522,we usually stay at the monaco because of its location a 5 minute walk from the train station traveling between florence and venice,4
9523,this was a nice place to stay and the breakfast each morning was great,4
9524,the staff was the best we have found,4
9525,it is an attractive hotel but the main reason we stay at la quintas,4
9526,other than that it was a good stay and i would stay there again if our travels bring us back to albany in the future,4
9527,also the hotel is near all trendy bars and restaurants within walking distance and yet still quiet and safe,4
9528,my family and i stayed at the hotel last night for a wedding,4
9529,stayed here for 4 days as we were in town to see a show,4
9530,this property is right in the heart of a booming neighborhood in la,4
9531,i would definitely stay here again and recommend to a friend,4
9532,the building is old but i love the water so if i could i would have been disappointed with another,4
9533,the staff was friendly and very helpful with a late check out so we had time to spend in the pool area,4
9534,however this time they gave us a river view very nice,4
9535,i requested a handicap accessible room and i don't think we will be back,4
9536,it was first time traveling with our puppy and overall it was a nice room and very quiet,4
9537,on reflection we should have asked to be moved but the said we will first talk with them,4
9538,i think it's above a 2 star a facilities were a bit dated but they were fine for a short stay close to all,4
9539,guests of pif will be staying here again in the future,4
9540,the rooms were all marked as nonsmoking but there was a very loud siren that woke us up in the middle of ole town alexandria,4
9541,much better than many places we've stayed in this hotel a couple of times there was a little bit lacking at times,4
9542,from the hotel we were told that the room above us,4
9543,called the front desk to figure out how to turn off we could not find the button to save our lives,4
9544,not a high end hotel by any means but quite comparable to best western and the like,4
9545,everything was good except it would have been a game changer,4
9546,the hotel more than provided that the staff was very friendly as was housekeeping,4
9547,my children gave me the gift over thanksgiving of staying at hotel monaco again in the very near future,4
9548,last year we had a riverside room on the ground floor in the past i chose to stay here for the views folks,4

9554,the bathroom is basic like a dorm would be nice to see more variety in choices over the weekend on the buffet,4
9555,the service of the staff was very helpful and nice,4
9556,i hope i am able to stay at a quiet inn that was well taken care of overall,4
9557,purchased the 2 double beds deluxe to have a microwave and stove to a bar sink,4
9558,be sure to request a non-smoking room did not and the single queen room could have used a better cleaning,4
9559,unit was not that great but it is very comfortable and the breakfast was fabulous,4
9560,great for visiting area shopping center gas etc all right across the street you can walk to the park and to downtown columbia falls,4

9582,staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the area so you can get to the,4

9590,this time we decided to stay the night which was clean tidy,4
9591,the hotel room was neat and clean and the staff was friendly and helpful,4
9592,my only issue this time was that we were not informed of my request and said they could do nothing about it,4
9593,new stuff in the continental breakfast area was a little odd to get to as it was on the same switch as the light,4
9594,only complaint was bed was firm and the a c compressor was loud,4

9880,upon arrival all was in order and we had no problems with this place at all,4
9881,despite being right next to highway the place is pretty easy to find as it is strangely placed but that is city planning,4
9882,this hotel seems to be a safe area,4
9883,very close to dothan for better restaurants but if you want a basic stay then this is the place for you,4

9891,although it is showing age the hotel is kept extremely clean and i didn't find any of the dinginess described by other reviewers,4
9892,what it consists of is early check-in to permit us time for sight seeing istanbul,4
9893,instead of walking the quarter we took a taxi most of the time so this is not so important,4
9894,other than that we did not hear any noise from the music etc,4
9895,i hope they fix up a few things to caution you of the continental breakfast is a nice touch,4
9896,when i booked the hotel for a business trip,4

9898,the staff were really friendly and kept everything clean and well stocked with clean towels and necessities,4
9899,we often stay at hampton inns when we travel that's the main reason we chose the hotel so that was quite disappointing,4
9900,loved the back yard with the pool and jacuzzi were also an added bonus,4
9901,rooms appeared clean showers weren't the best but it might have been a bit larger and brighter,4
9902,reminded me a bit of a moldy smell,4
9903,we used to live in the nashville area so it is close to all the restaurants and bars all of which were as expected,4
9904,but the kids hour and wine hour are great and the hotel was clean and the beds were just the right amount of firmness vs,4
