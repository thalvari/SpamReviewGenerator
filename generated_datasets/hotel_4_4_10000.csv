513,parking was a challenge the location is excellent easy access to the airport,4
514,gave me the choice of what floor i wanted which is always a treat in a non smoking room the smell is in everything,4
515,the keys were a little difficult to work with and the in-room mini fridge and coffee makers are great,4
516,the only disapointing thing was the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom,4
517,overall i was satisfied with the room and the door in the morning,4
518,the walls were a bit thin i was able to access their wi-fi without any issues,4
519,our first room looked out on a courtyard which made us feel special,4

542,the motel is easily accessible from i-465 and is in a nice area and nice pool,4
543,all staff was pleasant and helpful and the art decor character of the hotel is nice,4

546,i did not want to have to go far to eat,4
547,very accessible from the expressway with in walking distance and others within a short car ride,4

552,we chose to stay in huntersville on our trip to portland with a side tip out to alcatraz,4
553,also this hotel is right outside of downtown annapolis and was fairly easy to get to and room was nice clean and simple,4
554,housekeeping came and cleaned it up and gave us a rollaway bed,4
555,security and night staff on the other hand was a little disappointing,4
556,we enjoyed our stay at this hotel very pleasant and helpful,4
557,we decided to stay another day and they were very happy with this la quinta,4
558,the rooms furnishings are large makes you feel like you were in a very private and quiet place,4
559,i did park overnight for one night and the location was just perfect,4
560,i enjoyed this hotel's restaurant and breakfast were great,4
561,the rooms are comfortable and clean but needs better lighting,4
562,i personally liked the old style better but the hotel is up-front about all that so no real penalty,4
563,we got a suit and it was very convenient to butterfly world and markham recreational park two sightseeing goals,4
564,the rooms were clean and spacious and pretty quiet even though we weren't in the room much,4
565,pool was a bit cold but the hot tub was way too hot but it was adjusted and enjoyable after that,4
566,we've stayed here a couple of times but found it,4
567,this hotel is meant for business travel but it is a very pretty and central hotel,4
568,the staff is always very nice and accommodating the room was clean spacious and everything worked,4
569,the shower could use a little updating but it was clean and i felt that the complimentary breakfast is also well done each morning,4
570,a few pros and cons make a reservation or you'll be very disappointed with the hotel when it came to directions,4
571,the hotel itself felt like it was a bit noisy but ok,4
572,we really enjoyed the personable staff and the very clean rooms very impressed on how the big the room was when i arrived,4
573,the breakfast area is way too small but overall nice place,4
574,the staff was great and the staff is professional,4
575,they are renovating the room we stayed in was completed and it was clean and quiet and the desk clerks were extremely nice and,4
576,well what can i say it was a good quiet place to sleep in on my long drive to nc,4
577,the bed was ok but the pillows were horrible very very soft,4
578,i came to town on a saturday night and there was plenty of space around it,4
579,we stayed in room 40 on the 4th floor and it was tolerable but annoying,4
580,there is nothing special just a stop over to maine,4
581,everything was fine except the sofa bed was broken so i had to do my hair in the room by the bed,4
582,there were plenty of options for our family,4
583,not the newest laquinta i've ever stayed at but i knew that going in and the staff was courteous and professional,4
584,we enjoyed the hotel for its location and convenience to downtown,4
585,we only stayed one night since i was attending an event at the convention center hotels,4
586,it's fine if you just need to spend a night,4
587,had a great time also a short drive to either campus in ithaca,4
588,this was a fine hotel for that purpose very easy to get to clean comfortable pet friendly,4
589,the beach was just a block a away but we didn't go to stay in the hotel with good food and great service,4
590,great location and lots of restaurants nearby and right across the road which was nice,4
591,other than that we had a hot tub in the spa but wonderful outdoor heated pool,4
592,i was made to feel welcome when i arrived and got the reservation updated in a few minutes,4
593,breakfast is not provided which was fine for us because we did not have a vent so the aroma was a little overpowering at times,4
594,the hotel was putting up no vacancy signs when we got there and the desk man was very helpful,4
595,our hotel room was clean and comfortable and is also close to dining establishments,4
596,all in all i think i found a place to stay while attending a training in philadelphia,4
597,that eliminates having to hunt for a place to sleep for the night before continuing our trip,4
598,i realize this is an extended stay motel and we only stayed two nights and it was convenient to the conference and reasonably priced,4
599,otherwise i really enjoyed my stay there and would recommend the hotel designate smoking areas in the lobby area to get work done,4
600,have stayed there many times and without problem however this trip i seemed to be having trouble with the wifi and internet speed,4
601,this time it had the best rate available over the counter with discussion,4
602,it could use an update but for the price it would be a bad place,4
603,we did have problems with the tv and called to ask for early check in and he accommodated us,4
604,the staff was incredibly helpful recommended restaurants near the hotel including la brasiera and more expensively la caseta de la nonna,4
605,as stated the room was clean and the staff were excellent,4
606,the room was a good size and the hot tub was closed for repair,4
607,the staff was great and my family really was comfortable with the typical hotel rock hard bed of course,4
608,its close to the metro and restaurants and the hotel is one block south of chestnut st,4
609,staff was friendly room was clean and we slept well,4
610,was here for an interview arrived late and left early so i didn't sleep comfortably,4
611,good location for my purposes not to far from the airport but it's worth the money,4
612,the suite was wonderful and the room was very nice and staff was very helpful,4
613,there was a window that opened to the street in the evening and the pool was closed,4
614,now if you are either on third floor or first floor you have to take golf carts everywhere which were no big deal,4
615,stayed in both a king as well as a shower and a mini frig,4
616,but the bad part was there was no pool and it didn't take that long,4
617,is it better than the average budget hotel,4
618,my husband and i wanted to sit at the end of long days perusing the bienalle and museums and galleries,4
619,my room was on the second floor with a king size bed but were moved to a better room quickly,4
620,everyone is very friendly and accommodating staff,4
621,the room was nice and clean staff friendly,4
622,all in all though it was pretty decent and i would stay here again when visiting the worcester cambridge springfield boston areas,4
623,we typically stay with the holiday inns when we travel that's the main reason we like it is because of the staff,4
624,the carpets were clean though and the room was nice we had a double bed,4
625,the maid cleaned only half our room one of the days everything was perfect when we returned,4
626,maybe if they had the air turned on to begin with it would have been nice to have a cart to put our things on,4
627,maybe they're on one floor i don't know if i would stay there again,4
628,it was in a convenient location to downtown napa,4
629,we needed a place to stay after flying in late,4
630,actually was only in the room to turn on the lights,4
631,my kids loved the indoor pool and 24 hour gym,4
632,we liked the size of the room and the whole house are super homey with a lot of food options nearby,4
633,house keeping forgot to make up the pull-out so we had to hold the curtain out of the way to provide everything needed,4
634,hotel was good for the price you can't beat the price,4
635,this is compounded by the fact that there was free wifi and plenty of room,4
636,when i inquired i was told that the room above us walked around,4
637,the room was very nice and clean the accommodation is best according to price,4
638,the room looks like it had been renovated and the rooms are a little dated and there was no breakfeast,4
639,loved having a suite plenty of room for pups to be comfortable,4
640,the business class rooms are huge and have everything you could need plates pots paper towels full-sized refrigerator etc,4
641,did not expect as good of a view as we got it was brilliant to wake up and see the sunrise each morning,4
642,stayed here for work and the neighborhood looked rough but the room was well appointed and appreciated after a long 14-hour day at work,4
643,my only negative note is that there are no coffee makers in the room so you can hear everything your neighbor says at 1 am,4
644,the staff seemed to do a good job as room was fine clean comfortable adequate space,4
645,it has all the amenities required and the location is great central to everything,4

675,had just enough time to get to our room but when we opened the door it was more than 300,4
676,the eating area is a little intimidating but didn't have a workout room,4

688,the evening got noisy with the bars downstairs but we were on the way home from arizona to alabama,4
689,it didn't ever work for us to be assisted at the front desk he left a note stating his dissatisfaction with the facility,4
690,eventually management got them to quiet down but i think that they should have made those people move to a room with 2 doubles anyway,4
691,it was annoying however we were able to find the hotel fine,4
692,the hotel was great however the room was clean and bed was very comfortable and the breakfast has a good variety including lots of fruit,4
693,stayed for 4 days and enjoyed it the room was neat clean quiet and moderately priced,4
694,my only complaint is that ip is not walking distance to the perimeter mall and another shopping center with a grocery store restaurants etc,4
695,after arriving we went to our room however when we got there and left in the dark,4
696,you could tell the building was old but most building are in the french quarter with rooms compatible to the location,4

711,the hotel is well maintained and appears to be a newer property the finishes seem to be lower end,4

744,very nice area and location just a few minutes walk from the lake,4
745,another quick thing was they don't provide a free wifi,4
746,after my wife's request rena at the front desk waiting to check in for almost 10 mins,4
747,i did not bother to check if it was locked when we first got there but it was gone by the morning time,4

882,we stayed one night in this hotel while visiting boston,4
883,i would have rated it 5 stars but the walls are fairly thin in the room so you can hear everything,4
884,we will stay here again and recommend this hotel to friends and would stay again,4
885,what a big room virtually a studio apt as it had a hint of cigarette smoke and some burn marks in it,4
886,the parking lot struck me as small but the hotel was close to her and it was just right,4
887,the location is great in the center of all the action but far enough out to be peaceful a rare balance,4
888,continental breakfast spread is wholesome with a good variety of hot and cold foods,4
889,free parking for a week is included if you have a nw facing room rather than one overlooking the gas station,4

905,never woke up in time for breakfast so i can't comment on it,4
906,there was a soccer tournament going on so there was no room for us,4
907,i have been staying at this place every time we are in annapolis,4
908,the rooms are clean and rate is one of the hotels in griffin i feel this is one of the many great amenities for guests,4
909,the actual bedroom part was not that big and i wish there was a night light and a fan in the bathroom,4
910,i celebrated my 22nd birthday and the front desk person was very pleasant to deal with,4
911,it's an older motel but well kept,4
912,for the price it was very good and the room was very clean as was fridge mattress was firm not sagging worn out,4
913,the hotel currently in process of renovating but it wasn't detrimental so as to impact our stay,4
914,we decided to stay here though it is still a shuttle ride to most of the trails from there,4
915,i only needed somewhere to stay overnight and chose this hotel because kimpton's have a great reputation and they are pet friendly,4
916,i did not see that it had a microwave and fridge that was very nice,4
917,a big plus are the shuttle to and from the carnival terminal very good,4
918,very clean comfortable room and they had a king bed which she responded no i only have queen bed,4
919,i guess mcdonald's breakfast is better than average for a complimentary breakfast,4
920,the place is somewhat hard to find and the counter staff was cranky,4
921,all employees are friendly the breakfast is good and rooms are very nice clean and roomy,4
922,i was worried that we would be a bit too far from the highway close to olympia conference center,4
923,we thought it was a very good value,4
924,would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the fort lauderdale plantation area,4
925,the hotel from the train station this small hotel was perfect for our needs,4
926,there are rows of public benches right in front of the hotel very quiet with a forest view out the windows,4
927,but there is a denny's across the parking lot from the pool and it was very good,4
928,after speaking with the person at the front desk was incredibly helpful and courteous both front desk and restaurant,4
929,it seemed nice enough although a little dated it was comfortable and having the starbucks there added to my happiness lol,4
930,they provide a modest breakfast plenty of parking and minutes from where we needed to be nearby,4
931,the room itself was well-maintained clean and comfortable,4
932,the breakfast was great the pool and hot tub were very appreciated after a long drive we made a good choice by,4
933,no fridge which was disappointing but there is a denny's across the street though,4
934,a c was not the best but worth the price,4
935,your dollar rents a lot of room to put baggage,4
936,the hotel is an older hotel but it has been very well maintained and clean,4
937,timing was not the best i have ever stayed in anywhere,4
938,only thing bad about this hotel is they allow dogs,4
939,rooms appeared clean showers weren't the best but it might have been an off day,4
940,pictures show large counter-height refrigerator now it's very small village but a lot of fun with navajo culture,4
941,traveling cross country last stop was very surprised to see construction in the lobby and elevator at least more than what i paid,4
942,we had a frige and microwave-you need to bring your own towel from your room and settle with that,4
943,the location is excellent and its a short walk to state street where all the shops and restaurants,4
944,we got there early and there were no other options for using the lights in the bathroom,4
945,great location very central but on a quiet street but close to the train which will get you there,4
946,it is why i only give the comfort level a 3 out of 10 this should be the last hotel you pick,4
947,they were having the locks fixed while we were out between 7:00am and 9 i 30,4
948,the breakfast was reasonable but could have benefited from a microwave and a frig in the room,4
949,the staff was very friendly and the hotel room was a little bit dark,4
950,i was looking for a reasonably priced option that didn't have a ton of money just on food,4
951,the motel and my room was clean and spacious and quiet,4
952,there is an event center on the property and offers a good selection of hot and cold items,4
953,only negative was that the hotel was very cozy with a cottage feel,4
954,we did have issues with our keys each night and had to go to office to get toilet paper,4
955,this is a very nice area and view of the harbor,4
956,the room was quiet the bed was comfortable and room was too,4
957,it's slightly odd in its design but our room was fine so we could live with that,4
958,i made the initial reservation and called back and asked for a quiet room and we were all treated in a welcoming way,4
959,hotel is clean the customer service is great and the charm of the hotel,4
960,holiday inn has become one of the most beautiful spots that you can imagine,4
961,great except there was no parking directly in front of our door which was very nice,4
962,room seemed outdated and i couldn't find a room so i stayed in a twin room with a shared bathroom,4
963,there was no odor of smoke which is always a better setting than those with the air and,4
964,the hotel is small but clean and that is a plus for us,4
965,the room was clean smelled clean the breakfast was plentiful and had a large selection gluten free foods available,4
966,i love where the hotel is located in the center of downtown kona near the beach restaurants etc,4
967,we stayed 4 nights at the pelican shores,4
968,i absolutely loved everything about this hotel except the bed,4
969,the room stayed clean and the bed was very comfortable probably new too,4

1077,we enjoyed the hotel its self close to good restaurants and away from the street otherwise great place and breakfast was good,4
1078,a bell at the front desk took 45 minutes to check in due to the line up of people,4
1079,check in was a little slow and the faucet dripped a bit but the bathroom was a bit bigger,4
1080,would definitely go back for a quick getaway,4
1081,why provide a nice flat screen tv's in the room,4
1082,i found this inn on line and stayed as a last minute booking to make up for an airbnb host cancellation,4
1083,building is old but i love the water so if i could i would have been disappointed with another,4

1089,my experience was completely different than some of the other reviews as the maid service left a lot to be desired,4
1090,the location is also very good depending on what you want to visit on oahu i strongly recommend using the economical and,4

1092,an abc convenience store across the parking lot from the pool and it was very quiet all night,4
1093,the rooftop pool and bar was very nice and the beds very comfortable,4
1094,it is also a bonus to be able to tell him thank you in person,4
1095,the main negative would be that i would like to know the brand of pillows you have,4
1096,the only bad thing i can say is that the parking lot is well lit and plentiful,4
1097,the bedding was nothing out of the ordinary but they should specify,4
1098,a tech was quickly sent and took care of it and made sure all was done,4
1099,attention and patience with each person and if you don't mind taking the rail or buses around,4
1100,even though i know that it was the hottest part of the summer would probably be okay,4
1101,you can't beat the plentiful hot water in the bathroom drained extremely slowly in all the fixtures,4
1102,for a budget hotel this was a nice hotel but parking was limited,4
1103,it was a bit more pricey it was worth the money and i would stay there again,4
1104,overhaul we were happy with our stay and the only reason for the 4th star is the location and staff,4
1105,the kitchen left a lot to be desired but there's a denny's next door,4
1106,the riverview rooms have a great view of the back field and pond area,4
1107,all-in-all the staff at the front desk are always friendly,4
1108,and also just a heads up the continental breakfast was just 3 different cereals,4

1111,we were recommended to this hotel by friends who have stayed twice in the jacuzzi suite and it's perfect,4
1112,the only thing i would have to say is they still have tube tv's,4
1113,a traditional motel which look like it has recently been taken over by solstice,4
1114,the staff were all very friendly and helpful staff and very convenient access to stores restaurants and much more,4
1115,best wireless wifi in a hotel room it was a nice hotel about a 20 min drive from the pier in san francisco,4
1116,it was a cut above other days inns that we have stayed in this hotel before and the shuttle always picked me up,4
1117,would have liked breakfast included but it wasn't and reeked of smoke,4
1118,but overall the hotel was nice public areas were very welcoming and helpful throughout,4
1119,they are renovating the room we stayed in looks to have been recently renovated,4
1120,would stay here again if we are traveling through north platte,4

1126,if you're traveling on a budget and who wants top-notch facilities,4
1127,only concern we had was that the bathroom door did not want to have to go far to eat,4
1128,this hotel was recently upgraded although it is hard to get away from this fee,4
1129,this hotel is off the beaten path but still close enough for you to walk a couple of mins to the shops,4
1130,however the a c wasn't very good and the person at the desk was very professional with exceptional customer service,4

1136,this was the super nice place my wife and i stayed at the inn to attend a family reunion in town,4
1137,we were surprised that our king-bed room where everything was ship shape and in very good shape,4
1138,besides the hotel updates it was a perfect location for me,4
1139,the hotel was fine but it was a pleasant and comfortable stay,4
1140,but my stay there turned out to be a great beginning or ending to any day,4
1141,the people we're terrific from mgr to maintanance very helpful with directions restaurant info and giving us extra coffee supplies for the room,4
1142,the conference provided a free shuttle and was very close to too hot and was over-chlorinated,4
1143,we would definitely recommend this quaint place and will stay there again on our next trip north,4
1144,new and nice facility but the fire alarm went off was turned off shortly after going off,4
1145,later they admitted it was like that last week and we couldn't shake the feeling for a while,4
1146,other places we have had to take a taxi at night,4
1147,plus it was close to a walmart which is very convenient,4

1155,pro the staff at this hotel for two nights,4
1156,the room wasn't brand new but it was clean and the staff are friendly and very accomodating,4
1157,eventually management got them to quiet down but i think that they should have made those people move to a room with two queen beds,4
1158,another reason to stay at this hotel again,4
1159,good prices even for being right in the center of the boardwalk so you have many options to dine and shop,4
1160,this was an inexpensive hotel but it was quiet and secluded with plenty of parking,4
1161,when we went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing to help dry your boots overnight with,4
1162,when i was researching hotels the customer service rep suggested this hotel because of its proximity to interstate 85 and the ease of getting around,4
1163,upon arrival all was in order and we had no problem finding the hotel,4
1164,workers were nice room was nice and clean i just wish they had elevators,4
1165,booked here and were very pleased with the room,4
1166,they are renovating the room we stayed in was nicely decorated and very comfortable,4
1167,there were several restaurants nearby but we didn't want to pay any more than that though,4

1169,shops and beach are some distance away not easily walkable as there are no signs to indicate its a hotel,4
1170,the only things i didn't like was no room service but the front desk was very helpful,4
1171,the maid cleaned only half our room one of the days everything was perfect when we returned,4
1172,the best thing about this hotel is the awesome front desk day staff,4
1173,the only problem was that the room was nice and staff were nice,4
1174,it isn't a typical hampton inn but it is well maintained and has a beautiful swimming pool,4
1175,i had the impression that we were given an end room on first floor which was perfect,4
1176,the room had a sitting area with a fridge and microwave in the room is noisy and it interrupts my sleep,4
1177,the location is the best if you want everything footsteps from the hotel but the only thing that would have made it perfect,4
1178,my only complain was that the breakfast buffet area was set up in a pleasant manor with a king size bed and bath tub,4
1179,but the jacuzzi wasn't working and the new very nice flat screen tv if you aren't going to have hd cable,4
1180,the room was clean smelled clean the breakfast was great and overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel columbia,4

1189,nice grounds and the rooms were very quiet,4
1190,the staff was very nice and clean but the best attribute of the facility is the staff,4
1191,we used the pool on a day pass,4
1192,my mood improved greatly when i learned that i could get a smoking room through hotels but it turned out to be a gem,4
1193,however it was sort of white noise because we didn't hear any sound when i was sleeping,4
1194,i was also very impressed with this same manager of the hotel personally thanked me for the stay and was gracious,4
1195,the pool is a little small but it was exactly what we expected it to be,4
1196,the people are always friendly and make you feel at ease,4

1204,we were really impressed with the large rooms and comfortable beds,4

1206,but had a problem with children running back and forth and i was very impressed with the changes,4
1207,a friend and i decided to stay at this hotel again if the rate was competitive,4
1208,the hotel is clean rooms are spacious and clean and the breakfast had a variety of choices,4
1209,everyone was very nice but sure didn't get the room upgrade as a gold member probably because of availability,4
1210,we wound up extending our stay here to 4 days because of the convenience to my daughters home,4
1211,not far from the beach and waterfront and close to many restaurants grocery stores and department stores,4
1212,the rooms are a little dated and there was no noise level to speak of in our room,4
1213,everything was perfect except the mattresses were not very comfortable and housekeeping completely skipped us one day of our stay until after 4 pm,4
1214,the hotel was older and had some wear and tear in the furniture and carpet has a few small stains,4

1253,i only saw 2 rooms so i don't have a workout room,4

1255,and that's a good price for staying longer,4
1256,the lobby is fantastic and the food was good and fresh,4
1257,nice and roomy unit i would definitely stay here again for the price you would expect less,4
1258,my only major gripe about the hotel is the proximity to a train line,4
1259,for the price it was very good to have the suite,4
1260,rooms are clean and the views are the best part of this hotel is the staff,4

1277,non-smoking floor smelled smokey but room was good size clean and comfortable,4
1278,we chose this hotel for the most part,4

1536,the most outstanding quality of the hotel and value for the price,4
1537,you are across the street from the beach and airport,4
1538,but instead they took the time to find us a room,4
1539,we just had a quick overnight in a roadside hotel,4
1540,lots of parking and in a good part of town with restaurants,4
1541,the web booking suggested that there would be a actual bedroom for the second bed,4
1542,this section of the island is safe and in the parking garage as well,4

1551,also no minibar in the room that could have been better but there were still plenty of options,4
1552,there is also a perfectly fine english pub attached to the hotel but other than that i would stay again,4
1553,the only minor faults were that for some reason the a c in my room and the hallways were immaculate,4
1554,it's an older building that's recently been re-modelled and was in new condition,4
1555,weekend stay which was very enjoyable at a good price at the sea view,4
1556,burlington is an easy place to stay for the night while at a convention,4

1558,i'd recommend it if you're travelling on a budget,4
1559,the hotel is a bit dated and the room small but i think that's a good thing,4
1560,convenient location close to the potomac lots of restaurants and the del amo mall 15 minutes away,4
1561,therefore 130 is a bit too small and you need to get up early to enjoy the breakfast because the food went fast,4
1562,the room was small but fine for a single night's stay the la quinta proved worthy of my investment,4
1563,its two floors no elevator and its a bit incognito as there really isn't anything you can do about that though,4
1564,other than that issue my stay was very nice except the fridge did not work,4
1565,great desk and good view from the room but we hardly stayed in,4
1566,good breakfast and lovely hors d'oeuvres with wine in the late afternoon to spend sometime in the pool before we could check,4
1567,there's another la quinta inn across the street was smelly so we stayed here,4
1568,the hotel has a wonderful view of the beach and you can see the golden gate bridge from our room 313,4
1569,can't beat the location for being in the heart of san francisco the price was reasonable they have a great choice for location,4
1570,outside noise wasn't an issue despite being by the airport and a busy road below to keep us awake in the small hours,4
1571,the location was excellent due to it being a short drive to the cayuaga lake wine trail,4
1572,this was christmas away from home so that we could have a day to sightsee,4
1573,the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful with area eateries,4
1574,lovely hotel and the staff was very helpful and the restaurant crew is wonderful,4
1575,everything was great comfortable beds and pillows great night's sleep,4

1578,there's a good size flat screen tv in the room and we could hear every step,4
1579,mostly good an clean except for a used towel left on the back of the hotel and drops off right at the front gates,4
1580,helpful staff very nice rooms nice fitness center and pool and the standard hie breakfast with those wonderful cinnamon rolls,4
1581,if you're looking to stay somewhere to be in the heart of old town and a short walk to the very center,4
1582,the room is a little small for a hotel of this caliber and price point had this sort of issue,4
1583,overall we had a very comfortable bed,4
1584,pool area was great personal was friendly and helpful enumerating all amenities at check in,4
1585,the ac was quiet and the views were spectacular,4
1586,clerk issued our room right away so we could get in our key wouldn't work,4
1587,i booked this hostel after having a hard time getting the room pass key printer to work,4

1610,one the hotel would be in good condition and very clean,4
1611,the only thing that was not great was the fact that we had a brilliant holiday and would recommend the hotel,4

1623,r brr brthe only downside is they don't have to lug stuff to the 1st floor then back to your room vs,4
1624,overall though i would consider staying there again,4
1625,the refrigerator in the room or the fact that they had laundry available was key,4

1629,my wife and i stayed at this hotel for two nights,4
1630,it was very good but the hotel did accommodate us for this added bed,4
1631,room enough for 13 of us but could have used an additional easy chair for both balance esthetically and for comfort,4
1632,if you're looking at traveling on a budget and don't mind an older hotel,4
1633,the front desk staff was very pleasant and would definitely stay there again,4

1642,i wasn't aware that the hotel did not appear to have one available,4
1643,guest service at front desk was very nice and the beds were comfortable,4
1644,if you look across the street from the beach and 1 2 block from downtown coronado,4
1645,the front desk clerk that greeted us was not very friendly felt as if i was bugging them no hot tub as pictured on hotels,4
1646,everything was nice except the pool was small and no hot tub,4
1647,located on route 1 close to many stores restaurants bars and the water,4
1648,rooms are clean and very comfortable and worth the money we paid,4

1663,also we expected the other side of the hotel since it does create noise and fumes,4
1664,we've stayed at this hotel a couple of times when working in the area,4
1665,location made it easy to work with as a late arrival,4
1666,the only reason the room didn't come with an iron and ironing board to a hairdryer was included,4
1667,they arranged for a bike delivery and pickup and allowed us to walk to get to our old neighborhood good restaurants and the major highways,4

1669,this was our 2nd time we stayed here and honestly were surprised the room was so clean,4

1679,the hotel was pleasantly clean comfortable and ideally located for easy access to the mall and roberto was an amazing driver,4
1680,room was good clean and well maintained but could use updating,4
1681,after such a long drive it was kind of empty so that really didn't matter,4

1683,and thus affords a bit of a drive to the beach the gorge or downtown,4

1761,other than that the room the hotel and the staff could be rated as excellent,4
1762,the rooms were clean and pool was a good size and quiet,4

1890,the front desk staff were great at giving us directions to find a place for dinner and do a little yuppie watching,4
1891,really nice looking big indoor pool that i did not like about the room was that the outlet in the bathroom did not work,4
1892,the room was very nice clean comfortable only complaint is that the air conditioner was strong and cooled our room very quickly,4
1893,even though this hotel is not in a tourist area,4
1894,since it locates a little far from dc it is better if you have a nw facing room rather than one overlooking the gas station,4
1895,bathrooms are large and water pressure in the shower could have been better,4
1896,internet was spotty in our room but the beds could definitely use some updating but was clean,4
1897,the front desk clerk told us it was just a quick trip to sleep and move on for the next day,4
1898,note that the bus schedule varies on sundays and holidays and keep in mind that they will tell you it is only 90 minutes long,4
1899,this particular hotel still has smoking rooms and they are on the top floor with neighbors who didn't allow their doors to slam,4
1900,our ac went out and it was too hot to be in the park was a canyon suite,4
1901,if you don't mind a short walk into town and the mountain ambience of the property,4
1902,some of the things i did not like about the hotel was that there was no cancellation fee,4

1914,but i think this was one of the smallest i've stayed in them before but this one was very good,4
1915,it was very clean and appeared to be well maintained,4

1928,everything was very clean and there was a huge wait for everyone,4
1929,room was very clean the carpet could have stood to be replaced but was done so promptly,4
1930,just a place to crash on a road trip and stopped at the hampton inn,4
1931,they serve a great breakfast and the staff was very friendly and we were able to get more easily from the concierge,4
1932,the room was good for the low price of the room was clean,4
1933,in fact after staying here i have stayed at the discovery inn since 2010,4
1934,that makes the price of the hotel and you can see the fireworks from the balcony,4
1935,it's clean with towels but there is no air conditioning so the windows may need to be left open,4
1936,5 star hotel that is in a great location within walking distance of the motel,4

2718,my friend and i stayed here on june 2012,4

2732,eating area was very crowded but understandable since it was past midnight when we arrived,4
2733,the chandelier in the lobby is very good as was the grilled walleye and steak,4
2734,i'm a self confessed hotel snob and i would stay there again because of them,4
2735,it's a nice hotel and a good hotel but on expensive side,4
2736,we went back to the desk to check me out,4
2737,my only cons would be that the complimentary breakfast was better than most,4
2738,i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food in this calorie breakfast,4
2739,great for a short stay where you don't need a car when visiting if you want to watch video it would be sluggish,4
2740,we loved our stay at the best western kelly inn in april,4
2741,great place to stay for a quick overnight stop on the way down,4
2742,we went down to the front desk and the maids very friendly,4
2743,quickly resolved but still a hassle and the reason for the mediocre cleanliness rating was the carpet,4
2744,the wi-fi and a 24-hour business center complimentary continental breakfast fitness facilities and a whirlpool,4
2745,room was very clean well-maintained and has friendly staff,4
2746,that said the breakfast was good and staff was super friendly,4
2747,thus the beds were great but the room smelled of old smoke like it had been built with children in mind,4
2748,the room is a little small but tge room was updated and clean,4
2749,we had difficulty crossing the street to get to the big malls across the street is fabulous and the service is excellent,4

2753,breakfast was nothing fancy but very enjoyable,4
2754,the room was clean and we'll maintained,4
2755,rustic comfortable hotel situated in an area convenient to downtown and the local night life if your looking,4
2756,i wouldn't say that this hotel was great but the elevators were tempramental at times,4
2757,the only drawback it is hard to tell colors and,4
2758,exactly the standard one would expect for such a grand place,4
2759,this is a nice hotel with friendly staff,4
2760,even though it's right there across the street from a great place smokehouse hawaiian bbq itchy foot,4
2761,excellent choice for family travel especially if you are doing business in the cary area,4
2762,we go there to visit my son and we both really enjoyed the experience,4
2763,we came here because we had a pet-friendly hotel search,4
2764,i also had a quick breakfast in the cafe area and there were plenty of hangers and housekeeping came by each morning,4
2765,my only one complaint was that the nearby freeway exit ramp to the hotel was a little older,4
2766,wish we had the time we would have stayed longer if i'd been in the area,4
2767,the room had a microwave a small refrigerator and microwave in the room which is unsafe fall feature,4
2768,only downsides were the wifi wasn't great but i don't respond to sour body language however my stay is excellent,4
2769,the person checking us in was not happy with the condition of the bathroom the refrigerator stove or mircowave,4
2770,adjacent is a hot tub in the pool area which was also very clean,4
2771,however everytime i entered the lobby the front desk person was professional and friendly,4
2772,i would stay here again if i was on the third floor as we could hear people in the room,4
2773,it is a bit noisy but this seems to be common practice to change extremely high prices during a local festival,4
2774,great location we stayed in a room that had been pre paid almost a month,4
2775,other than parking it really is hard this place is great for kids or a quick dip,4
2776,overall i would come back to my room soaking wet,4
2777,we were fortunate enough to get a room with a king bed two dressers and a table and 2 chairs,4
2778,they offer a free shuttle to local areas,4
2779,we were only there for a quick overnight and off again,4
2780,we found the hotel to be clean quiet and easily located,4
2781,that would be the only thing i was disappointed in the breakfast,4
2782,i stay several nights a week for work the hotel is functional,4
2783,the hotel is fine and the room was nice and clean,4
2784,the third floor is the smoking floor and you can tell they are working to fix up the place,4

2786,people who work at the hotel are always very helpful,4
2787,the tile floors we very clean and nice place to stay,4
2788,seemed odd though that there wasn't a refrigerator in our room did not have a fridge but otherwise seemed ok,4
2789,otherwise the room was well priced and the staff is very nice and the breakfast was fabulous,4
2790,overall a great choice if you're needing to stay in the south tower adults only coffee pots and mini fridge,4
2791,doormen were very responsive and check-in out was efficient,4
2792,we traveled to bisbee with another couple and the front desk staff service eg,4
2793,but i didn't complain because we were out most of the time at the beach area and had a great selection,4
2794,bed ruffles could use a little updating but was clean and had everything we needed,4
2795,thank you for taking the time to write this awesome review,4

2797,i have stayed at this property on our way home from a long trip,4
2798,staff was very nice and the small mini breakfast was good as well as staff n cleanliness,4
2799,my only negative things i would say are that there was only one working socket in the room,4
2800,nothing out of the ordinary for hotels which was nice and a wine reception in the afternoon,4
2801,i will definitely be staying at hotel monaco which was lovely,4
2802,the person checking us in was very friendly and always asked if anything was needed in my room,4
2803,i find it to be priced high compared to other choice hotels in the area but an easy drive to sf,4
2804,only real problem i had during the stay is that the beds are like bricks but that seems to be true,4
2805,i have no complaint about the noise it was pretty quiet but if it was not for t the surroundings i would of returned,4
2806,the double room was too small to accommodate the roll away bed was even reasonably comfortable,4

2813,i think the hotel was pretty good breakfast was not,4
2814,my husband wasn't too impressed with the complimentary breakfast and the hot tub was a nice touch,4
2815,we had trouble with guests in the next room so maybe bring ear plugs,4
2816,it is up to date in good condition and breakfast was complete with fresh fruit and a breakfast sandwich in addition to pastries,4
2817,the only weird thing about the room which was fortunately not a long walk,4
2818,everything was very clean even the indoor pool and arcade was great on the rainy days,4
2819,i have been staying here for several years and have always found it to be rather nice with a breakfast included the following morning,4
2820,good room for sleeping wouldn't want to stay in hotel with amenities,4

3119,didn't go to any of them so i don't know but when u get up there there is nothing to do here,4

3128,they're beach-funky rather than glamorous and we've stayed at this location with 14 people using 8 rooms,4

3135,after we ordered what we wanted and went to the room and it took hours to cool down,4
3136,hotel is no frills and a bit dated but they were fine for a short stay,4

3160,there was a lot of noise but we were tired and looking forward to sleeping comfortably after having been camping and hiking,4
3161,a great deal and the fact that we had a brilliant holiday and would recommend the hotel designate smoking areas in the lobby area instead,4

3173,i honestly believe i this day and age all hotels should have free internet at least in the b tower,4
3174,if there was more than just the one bar in the hotel with parking in san francisco,4
3175,the place is pretty easy to find as it is strangely placed but that is city planning,4
3176,the first night our room faced the back parking lot and there are several other restaurants only a few minutes away,4

3201,we had fun in the pool and hot tub below average,4

3211,the bar closed at 8 pm this was a great hotel for the price,4
3212,we asked for a room with a view of the golden gate bridge,4

3241,this was a very nice experience and the staff was very friendly and helpful,4
3242,the other room was very nice and the room was large and very comfortable big bathrooms,4

3322,wes pleasantly surprised by the room and the size of the hotel and the staff,4
3323,the items were reasonably-priced and there was a charge for parking your car at the hotel and expect to return again next year,4
3324,the wifi is free but not very fast,4
3325,we told them they said they were in the process of being renovated so the hallways are a mess,4
3326,so someone had to stay in a place i hoped,4
3327,great room keurig in the room with you,4
3328,no longer is the best rate available so i chose it,4
3329,walk to the hotel from the outside looks a little outdated however once you enter the building unless we missed it,4
3330,the parking lot struck me as small but the hotel was not ideal for a family stop on the way to dallas,4
3331,after saying in a couple of months and look forward to trying the restaurant,4
3332,however when i first made the reservation i was told that i would get a 20,4
3333,it may have just been the end of a very long road trip,4
3334,given the limited options for a hotel in this price range and was good sized,4
3335,we arrived late in the evening and in the morning there is breakfast in a separate room until 9:30,4
3336,all in all a good value for what was offered,4

3344,i stayed one night in town for a lax tournament,4
3345,we liked that it was away from the airport exactly where i wanted to be for the annular eclipse of 2012,4
3346,the shuttle to diseny is very helpful and even gave us some suggestions for dinner,4
3347,this place was everything i would expect from this chain,4

3352,we would be happy to stay there again and may next year if we go back,4
3353,our guest room and bathroom were a bit noisy out in,4
3354,we always enjoy staying at a hampton inn if we can because you know what you want to explore,4
3355,the motel was in a convenient location off the highway,4
3356,your dollar rents a lot of room to put baggage,4
3357,i would been nice if we didn't get to the hotel until nearly midnight yet we still had a decent night,4
3358,the room was big enough for two people,4
3359,we only had a 1 night stop here but found it to be extremely clean and everything in the unit worked,4
3360,our room was lovely and very quiet considering the hotel was on great location in the downtown core,4
3361,not what we expected for the price and the getaway it was perfect for that,4
3362,only thing that was lacking in this hotel was the friendliest and most accommodating that i have ever slept it,4

3364,the breakfast is amazing and the staff is very pleasant,4
3365,my room was very clean well-maintained and very clean,4

3367,let me warn you that the hotel has a wonderful location with eateries close by,4
3368,the room was clean and that's what we got being light sleepers,4
3369,rooms were nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful,4
3370,the breakfast was a little sparse compared to other places in the area,4
3371,i selected this hotel because of price and walking distance to wharf and downtown area,4
3372,the people working there were very nice and the price is right the food is great but the restaurant leaves a bit to be desired,4
3373,it's always clean and the staff seemed friendly and helpful,4

3375,we had stayed here before the remodel and were pleased with our reasonable nightly rate clean pleasant surroundings and free breakfast offered,4
3376,stayed for three days at this hotel and perfect for nearby interests,4
3377,we liked that it was away from the airport exactly where i wanted to be for the annular eclipse of 2012,4
3378,the hotel sign was a little hard to find as it is in one of the meeting rooms,4
3379,love hampton but this one was very clean and comfortable room,4
3380,the walls are a little too thin making it very easy to get on and off the interstate lots of eating options nearby,4
3381,long beach had really good restaurants and there was a lot of restaurants and stores in the area,4
3382,this hotel is clean and comfortableand the service is ok it has plenty of amenities and is nicely located in mountain village,4
3383,it's slightly odd in its design but our room was fine so we could live with that,4
3384,our only complaint was that the nearby freeway exit ramp to the hotel was a bit outdated but spacious,4
3385,staff was wonderful and we still had a decent night,4
3386,breakfast was plentiful coffee great and they had the coffee and fresh scones in the morning,4
3387,if you want a mini refrigerator you have to pay 30 us dollars the all inclusive will not cover nice diners,4
3388,i left my phone charger in the room and a map and sent me on my way,4
3389,the hotel itself isn't anything spectacular but it is a very good value,4
3390,situation of hotel was fine room was clean and possessed a fresh smell,4
3391,and when we asked for late check out not entered in computer,4
3392,there was a problem with my sciatic nerve,4
3393,this place is right across from the cibeles mall and if you happen to be traveling between charlotte and houston,4
3394,the lady that checked us in was a little rude but i think that's a good thing,4
3395,i will look to stay at this price point i expect my own bathroom attached to the room unit,4
3396,each of the rooms have animal names which makes it nice for not a lot of choices for eating in immediate area,4
3397,also when we got there there was a mixup with booking,4
3398,they were very helpful and friendly i was disappointed in was my first evening i had ordered a pizza,4
3399,there are a lot of misleading information about the room conditions as well as the gym with beachside views as well,4
3400,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to really shove it to clear the commode,4
3401,if there is an event center on the property and offers a good selection of food and drinks,4
3402,i would recommend this hotel for the second time this year and had a great time,4
3403,the staff was very helpful the room was nice and clean,4
3404,a beautiful hotel in a beautiful setting,4
3405,on the way to atlanta this was a good value clean and comfortable,4

3407,room was clean and we'll put together,4
3408,i had trouble with the first room i had in that it had been found and put in the manager's safe,4
3409,i had passed this hotel many times over the years,4
3410,i hadn't been at this property for over a year now when i come to the area for work,4
3411,we arrived in the evening and in the morning for a shower,4
3412,upgraded it a suite and was extremely large,4
3413,instead you have to go down about 6 stairs or up to get to your room which wasn't too bad,4
3414,room was clean and very comfortable and worth the money,4
3415,when we were looking at getting a car there is not much else apart from the sea and some small shops,4
3416,the only bad thing was you had to pay for internet access so it was a little more roomy,4
3417,the room was a good size and kids have fun at the pool and just a bit more space at the beach,4
3418,a nice walk up to or down to the free gondola to head into town or into the heart of mountain village,4
3419,i booked the room but it should have been made clear at the time of our stay but it didn't work off a thermostat,4
3420,victor hugo is a beautiful part of paris and the hotel is one block south of chestnut st,4
3421,we will recommend this hotel to a friend,4
3422,some of the main through areas looked a little tired and in need of some reservations to bathrooms and general fittings,4
3423,we would certainly stay there again when visiting are family out that way,4
3424,it was in the back between the hotel and the staff could be rated as excellent,4
3425,it was a convenient walk to the french quarter and still get a good nights sleep,4
3426,i have stayed at this hotel many times before the renovation,4
3427,and there was no tv channel guide had to call the front desk but i still enjoyed my stay,4
3428,the hotel seemed recently updated the beach was right across the street and a few other stores too,4
3429,the rooms are small but adequate especially if you are travelling with you pet dog,4
3430,i have stayed at this very hotel quite a few times and will choose this again because i really like it,4
3431,it had that odor and the smoke detector was dead when i got there,4
3432,we spent one night with my daughter and granddaughters,4
3433,all staff were very nice and friendly,4
3434,however i was not expecting dogs at the hotel which was a problem for us,4
3435,the only negative was a musty smell in the room was loud when it kicked on though very effective,4
3436,breakfast was hot and fresh limited choices but clean and well maintained but could use updating,4
3437,decent room but if you want to get away,4
3438,walk to the hotel from the outside looks a little outdated however once you enter the building unless we missed it,4

3587,the motel is very close to the beach but clean and spacious room,4
3588,the office staff casey was super friendly and wanted to accommodate our needs,4
3589,the hot tub could have used a little cleaning caulking,4

3595,just a short 3 minute drive to downtown napa and easy access to all we needed to do,4
3596,the only concerns is there is not much at the same exit,4
3597,there was a small fridge in the room and it took hours to cool down in that south georgia heat,4

3618,wi-fi is one of the hotels in the area and came across fairfield inn,4
3619,we were passing through so we only stayed one night so can't say much about life around the hotel,4
3620,unfortunately we were a little disappointed at the lack of a mini-fridge and some lights in the room were a nice touch,4
3621,the hotel is in a great location right off the highway for the weary traveler,4
3622,it was great but your site has wrong check in and out perfect management wonderful and helpful,4
3623,stayed here a few times when visiting family in the bay city essexville area,4

3626,wonderful place to just relax not much to do other than theaters and a few restaurant,4
3627,almost no waiting we got straight in in september for access to the park and take the tram that loops through the park,4
3628,however i do expect a clean room a quiet room and that's what matters most,4
3629,friendly staff clean room overall decent hotel for the price and the location close to the cathedral and the river,4
3630,we were way down at the other end on the second floor and we loved the balcony and view of morro bay,4
3631,pool was really cold and but the hot tub was not even bathtub temperature,4
3632,i had booked a non smoking room but i am not sure it goes of every night or what it was for,4

3638,first time at a bw plus and we were pleasantly surprised to find the lovely town of dahlonega,4
3639,the three deep drawers available were helpful but there is plenty of choice just a short walk from back bay station and copley square,4
3640,only a small table to eat but it was just what i expected for a traveller type hostel,4
3641,when traveling i expect there to be some problems but this was just a malfunction of the a c was loud,4
3642,although the hotel was full of contradictions,4
3643,the wifi worked well as did the air conditioning unit could use a good cleaning,4
3644,it was charming although the hard surfaces made it a little difficult to climb to the second floor,4
3645,my only complaint would be the loudness of the air conditioner in the room is a bit small but in keeping with french hotels,4
3646,i have 2 kids going to school in columbia and this hotel has gotten a lot better each year with,4
3647,this hotel is located 3 blocks from the beach casa del mar is located,4
3648,i stayed here as a stop over on our destination-clean comfy room,4
3649,you have to look very closely to see that it was so far away from frankfurt,4
3650,though we have been to this hotel before,4
3651,we were glad to have a clean room close to the station and only 2 stops to boston downtown,4
3652,it was great for toddlers too staff were very good the room was clean and quiet,4
3653,pool view rooms nice but if you want a mini refrigerator you have to pay a little money for the breakfast but it smelled amazing,4
3654,the room was clean and nicely decorated and the staff was very friendly and helpful,4
3655,the breakfast contained a variety and there was no closet had to hang clothes on,4
3656,realitively easy to get back on the road,4
3657,the staff were very helpful and cheerful and we were very impressed with them,4
3658,they did work with us for late checkout even though we had 3 rooms on different credit cards,4
3659,the hotel was great but the room smelled of old smoke like it had been built with children in mind,4
3660,the internet speed was good as well as the grounds and hallways i will go back,4
3661,the one thing we did not like the room layout,4
3662,it's in a perfect location walking distance to everything in the french quarter with rooms compatible to the location,4
3663,best not to ask for a room on the other side of the street,4
3664,i would definitely visit again and would recommend but check to see if this hotel has the best deal and it usually does,4
3665,the only thing i was unhappy with at the hotel was extremely busy with team competitions in the area,4
3666,although it took a long time to get hot water in the shower and tv remote would not adjust volume or on off,4
3667,it wasn't as good as other la quinta inns,4
3668,this hotel hasn't enjoyed the best of reviews on trip advisor for all the cheap motels around here,4
3669,this was a nice stay and i would definitely recommend,4
3670,add to that a comfortable room a clean bathroom and most of all the pool which was warm and inviting with friendly staff,4
3671,rooms are very large clean and the bed was super comfy,4
3672,the hotel is clean and the views are great,4
3673,i chose this hotel because it was considered in the french quarter close enough to be in the area,4
3674,the bar food was good as well as the breakfast complimentary,4
3675,even though on the main road and freeway but close by,4
3676,a hot tub is well worth the short commute to disney,4
3677,i stayed here as a stop over to my next destination,4
3678,weekend nightlife made for a lot of noise but we were tired and looking forward to sleeping comfortably after having been camping and hiking,4
3679,the breakfast had plenty of choices and the pool and fitness facilities were nice,4
3680,there is nothing special just a stop over to maine,4
3681,it would also be nice to have breakfast before hitting the famous branson strip,4
3682,fridge microwave vanity outside the bath great when more than one person working the front desk once check in time starts,4
3683,we had a family reunion in the area,4
3684,i did park overnight for one night and it was perfect,4
3685,went with another couple and rented one of the two balconies and large screen dvd viewing room,4
3686,the check in desk was very friendly as soon as we complaint someone very polite came and took care of the situation,4
3687,the food was really good the location is good and easy to go to venice,4
3688,i will stay here again when we come to visit and this is my go-to hotel for future trips to the charlotte area,4
3689,conveniently right off the highway breakfast was decent rooms were small but clean and comfortable reasonable accomodations for the cost,4
3690,great entertainment the staff are very nice and can provide you with information,4
3691,when she finally started to check me in 3 hours early,4
3692,it's not fancy but real was a good place for a nights rest,4
3693,there's so much to see you won't be staying there again next year,4
3694,nice hotel with big clean rooms and a resonably good breakfast,4
3695,one of the best best western's we have stayed at this location with 14 people using 8 rooms,4
3696,there were several team staying the same night we were there but they were never disruptive,4
3697,they have a nice swimming pool and hot tub which both were a good time,4
3698,front desk staff was great making sure we were comfortable and we were very impressed by this laquinta,4
3699,i think if it wasn't for this,4
3700,the rooms were up to date 21st century,4
3701,would definitely stay again for a longer period of time since there wasn't much going on in the hall while trying to sleep,4
3702,i would recommend this hotel for someone who is not on a budget and don't mind an older hotel,4
3703,it is just 3 block from bourbon street and a couple blocks from louis armstrong park,4
3704,a certain charm and a great location was also very appreciated,4
3705,the check in staff were very nice room was clean breakfast was delicious,4
3706,other than that we had a brilliant holiday and would recommend the hotel even if we had no dog with us,4
3707,the website indicated that there was an elevator at all,4
3708,will stop again on our way home from a long trip,4
3709,but if you are not looking for luxury and just need a place to sleep but not much else,4
3710,there were five of us spending the night and we're glad we did,4
3711,but the room was clean comfortable and well cared for units with attentive staff good value,4
3712,it is hard to get away from some stuff,4
3713,the bathroom had less than 1 2 roll of toilet paper and they didn't have enough bandwith for everyone to have wifi,4
3714,this hotel is very clean and well-appointed than your average bb,4
3715,we would definitely stay here again in the near future,4
3716,the breakfast was okay met our need for the morning and the wait staff hustled but couldn't really keep up with the heat wave,4
3717,i used a groupon and stayed 2 nights with my wife funky hotel,4
3718,older hotel but my room was clean and the staff was friendly,4
3719,the corridors smelled of beer but it was okay for a one economically stay,4
3720,room was in good condition and very clean,4
3721,one day we came back to our hotel around 5 and our room had great views of bisbee and the surrounding mountains,4
3722,everyone was very nice and the hotel was ideally placed just in the centre and very close to the restaurant but quiet,4
3723,another reason to stay at this price point i expect my own bathroom attached to the room unit,4
3724,i had the box sitting on top of the kids clothes,4
3725,would recommend this hotel because overall it was nice but the king bed in my room was beautiful,4
3726,we were visiting grand junction and chose to stay at hotel deca as it was close to a wedding ceremony we were attending,4
3727,the room two queens was very large and had a huge walk-in closet and a coffee area with bar refrigerator,4
3728,you get a full gym but it's a clean convenient solid value,4
3729,would definitely return if we needed to store anything else,4
3730,all the staff was extremely friendly and helpful,4
3731,cleaner opened room door twice without any permision when we were in bloomington but recently had an issue with our tv remote,4
3732,the cleanliness in the room could have been a little overpriced,4
3733,one of the things i did not like about the hotel was very friendly,4
3734,there is a parking lot in the back but the pool was heated,4
3735,the train stop is across for the hotel so you don't need to use the bathrooms we were using,4
3736,nice hotel in a good location on the beach and the swimming for children and adults is wonderful,4
3737,also take public transportion or taxi's the valet is a little slow in the bar lunch area,4
3738,however the room was a nice size and the jaccuzzi was good and the bed were not very comfortable,4
3739,the only complaints i really had was the room temp was too hot,4
3740,i read a lot of reviews mention construction in the area but not a big deal for us,4
3741,trouble with the door but it was very clean and the staff were friendly,4
3742,hotel is clean and the staff were excellent as well as the rest of the accommodations where fine,4
3743,we used a different restaurant every evening and there were no elevators had to use the stairs to go up to the 5th floor,4
3744,we were not too happy with the fact that it was a pending change and that it didn't seem to deter us too much,4

4054,this was my first trip to seattle and i didn't like about it was there was nowhere to eat nearby,4
4055,we are cheap but fussy if you want to walk to the french quarter and still get a good nights sleep thank you,4
4056,after finding this out we went to the free breakfast also very good,4
4057,i have stayed here about 4 times over the last two years,4
4058,the hotel was clean and the hotel staff made arrangements with neighboring hotel so we could use it without the deafening noise,4
4059,hotel was easy to get to with breakfast,4
4060,i was told it was fixed and that our room was street side and very noisy,4
4061,close enough to the dcu center to be a good choice but far enough away too especially since i stayed over a weekend,4
4062,the hotel room was updated and very comfortable,4
4063,i've had wifi issues here in the past and it's always an enjoyable stay,4
4064,the room was clean and my kids love it since it was right on the boardwalk and the staff is pleasant friendly helpful,4
4065,my boyfriend and i decided to stay at this hampton at t wi-fi is one of the best for the area,4
4066,the hotel is convenient to hartford hospital where i needed to be great for my kids but we were let down,4
4067,we'd absolutely stay here again next time i'm in the area,4
4068,this is our first time staying with candlewood,4
4069,we also brought our dog who was with us during the day when the people next door had their tv on loud,4
4070,the hotel was fully booked and we couldn't shake the feeling for a while,4
4071,hotel is clean the customer service is great and the location is excellent easy access to the main highway leading to all the wineries,4
4072,the pool area is a decent size and was cleaned daily,4
4073,we ate dinner in the restaurant were excellent jerome in particular,4
4074,i needed a place to stop for a night,4
4075,pro the staff at this hotel it was okay,4
4076,they sell the disney tickets in the lobby and the friendliness and professionalism of the staff,4
4077,i think they have a shuttle to and from the highway,4
4078,the only weird thing about the room which was fortunately not a long walk,4
4079,i chose this hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub were good,4
4080,wish the bathroom was a little small but the room was super clean everyday,4
4081,the front desk bell staff was friendly and we checked in quickly,4
4082,the guy at the front desk was super friendly and wanted to accommodate our needs,4
4083,check in was easy staff friendly and location is off the expressway but far enough away too especially since i stayed over a weekend,4
4084,we will definitely stay here again on our next shopping trip,4
4085,i talked to the person at the front desk could never tell us the answers,4
4086,tucked away in the north eastern part of the french quarter and the staff was more than welcoming and always willing to help guests,4
4087,room was clean and the bed was comfortable the hot water was easily,4
4088,maybe if they had the air turned on to begin with it would have been nice to have a cart to put our things on,4
4089,long beach had really good restaurants and there was a twin peaks over the road,4
4090,i think that this hotel could use a little more cleaning and dusting,4
4091,overall the hotel is a little dated but has a neat old world charm that makes you feel sad not happy,4
4092,we stayed there for our soccer tournament weekend would have to go to a local health club as well,4
4093,but there is a refrigerator wet bar and pull out couch as well as a few of the housekeepers were very helpful,4
4094,the man who checked us in was very helpful and nice,4
4095,but for the length of time we were there which was half the week,4
4096,less than 10 minutes drive traffic aside from south murphy street with lots of restaurants movie theaters stores and pancake houses,4
4097,the room was nice and cold summer weather outside and i didn't have a terribly expansive feeling,4
4098,other than that the plaza hotel and our stay was a quick stay to be able to stay at a kimpton hotel on future trips,4
4099,exercise room and free coffee in the lobby and elevator at least more than what i expected,4
4100,i decided to stay in one of the two rooms above the garage,4
4101,it was difficult to get the luggage cart from the parking lot of the hotel which was convenient,4
4102,but housekeeping observed our do not disturb sign posted on the door,4
4103,front desk is very accommodating the food is good but you can definitely over do it,4
4104,only complaint was that you had to pay a higher rate than what i booked with hotels,4
4105,you have to valet park which is an added expense i didn't need them it was of no concern,4
4106,we liked the continental breakfast except they did not have any type of exclusion to,4
4107,purchased the 2 double beds deluxe to have a microwave and there was a free breakfast,4
4108,but overall we had a really good time but i don't think the hotel had a decent workout room and pool,4
4109,overall i think it's the best hotel to stay in that is located in the lobby which was very nice and service was fabulous,4
4110,the staff was very friendly and accommodating and the breakfast is better than average,4
4111,not just because it is in europe but it is an old hotel but it gave good value of your dollars,4
4112,the value comfort and friendly staff make it a comfortable place for me when i am dropping off something at a friend's house,4
4113,the room is a good size water slide,4
4114,the complimentary coffee in the am and no surprises,4
4115,breakfast was adequate however the front desk person was very nice the night i came in,4
4116,exactly the standard one would expect for such a grand place,4
4117,front desk was ok but could be improved,4
4118,with the help of trip advisor reviewers decided on staying at the high desert motel location is very convenient there are eating establishments close by,4
4119,i will recommend this hotel to a friend,4
4120,this hotel is located in one of the rooms there was construction going on and we needed to move rooms 3 times,4
4121,it is a very good restaurant recommendation,4
4122,very clean and the staff were really helpful and cheerful,4
4123,rooms have microwaves and fridge beds are comfortable and breakfast being avail started,4
4124,the only problem we had was that we were not letting our kids run wild,4
4125,loved the massive room and comfortable bed indoor pool and jacuzzi,4
4126,would reccomend this place to anyone who is looking for a very nice place to stay front desk gal was very friendly and professional,4
4127,where the room had issues the staff was incredibly helpful and courteous both front desk and restaurant,4
4128,we strive to excel in our service and it is always a good place to stay,4
4129,the staff were attentive and the free continental breakfast wasn't bad and it was close to the water but not directly on the lake,4
4130,one problem the loud drunks running up and down the halls all night was disturbing for getting sleep,4
4131,hotel was very good nice staff nice breakfast which gave a good selection of restaurants within a 5 minute radius,4
4132,we were able to have a restful sleep,4
4133,this is an older location in the heart of uofa but not too far out of town either,4
4134,i thought the hotel staff was friendly and the room was quiet,4
4135,we were tired and didn't feel rushed at all,4
4136,everything was great but the pullout couch wasn't as comfortable as we would have liked,4
4137,the wifi was not so great in our corner but we didn't spend much time there,4
4138,the hotel is convenient to the freeway and there is a cracker barrel restaurant next door,4
4139,despite having people above and next door to me there was no way he would make that mistake and called me a liar,4
4140,with that being said we won't stay here again if we were in the heart of town,4
4141,all in all the hotel was clean in and good condition,4
4142,nice hotel other than our room was right next to the shopping mall and well kept,4
4143,we had a great breakfast and the staff are outstanding,4
4144,our only complaint was that the service was very good,4
4145,there was no literature in the room that i stayed in for the night,4
4146,you couldn't ask for a better time the bar,4
4147,room had everything needed for a comfortable stay with many local places to have dinner at,4
4148,we arrived late in the evening and as long as you are a member of hilton honors,4
4149,we would be happy to stay there again when in the area,4
4150,the location is also very safe and quiet with a functional kitchenette stocked with dishes and some pots pans,4
4151,the hotel is nothing fancy but has been recently remodeled and are in great shape,4
4152,but i would still recommend this hotel and go back again even though it could use some cosmetic updates,4
4153,only a couple of issues that i was told i could get a free hotel shuttle ride from the airport even after midnight,4
4154,room was a bit on the small side with only 2 full size beds and a sofa bed,4
4155,the staff had fresh baked cookies at the desk especially when i get in late from work,4
4156,we are from houston and were surprised that a hotel of this size and in the shade a good portion of the afternoon,4
4157,this hotel is close enough to a lot of restaurants in the area,4
4158,springfield is easy access to the highway,4
4159,the only thing is you don't have kids it's not for the one across the street but three blocks down,4
4160,the people in the next room were disturbing,4
4161,i would recommend this hotel to friends and would stay again if in the area,4
4162,i would definitely stay here again for my next cruise,4
4163,other than that one thing it was a pleasant surprise as most places don't have that,4
4164,rooms were perfect for our family of five,4
4165,other than that we had a brilliant holiday and would recommend the hotel even if we had no dog with us,4
4166,air con is a bit noisy but this seems to be common practice to change extremely high prices during a local festival,4
4167,they had friendly staff who went out of her way to help me and be kind to me,4
4168,i have stayed at this hotel many times before the renovation,4
4169,other then that the rooms were great and we,4

4183,friday and saturday they have a small frige and a microwave,4
4184,it's reliable comfortable dog friendly and a great value for the little cost of the room for parking wi-fi and breakfast,4
4185,have been here on business for several years now and we will continue to stay here for 2 weeks in a smoking room,4
4186,breakfast was very organized and they made sure we got one of the rooms had some major plumbing problems on the first night,4
4187,walk to the disneyland parking and you can take that to the beach,4
4188,great stay breakfast not as good as the last one but everything else was awesome i'd stay there again when visiting family,4
4189,there's another la quinta inn across the street was smelly so we stayed here,4
4190,we made use of the indoor pool and gym,4
4191,i will say that the walls are a little too thin making it very easy to prep and get to the mall quickly,4
4192,a unique place to stay i have stayed here multiple times over many years i can say this place is consistant,4
4193,would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to spend a week in paradise,4
4194,room was clean bathroom was clean and functional and the beds were comfortable plenty of pillows and blankets,4
4195,parking right outside the door of our room would have been great if their kitchen and bar stayed open a little later,4

4197,the third floor is the smoking floor and you can tell they are working to fix up the place,4

4204,i had a quick overnight stay and it was delicious,4
4205,friday and saturday they have a small frige and a microwave,4
4206,the only thing regarding the service that i was expecting but i did find the ice,4

4209,this was a good hotel very clean and the staff helpful friendly,4
4210,i loved the service and plan to stay again if we ever go back,4

4224,the owners were very friendly and helpful staff,4
4225,there were a number of restaurants and stores in the area,4
4226,overall the stay was a just an overnight stay as i was stuck at the airport for the night,4
4227,the location was perfect and the room was nice clean and simple,4
4228,not a big deal but would have been had we been there longer we would have used the kitchen which was fully functional,4
4229,good value for the price and the simple breakfast was pleasant and the front desk staff was very nice,4
4230,we even decided that we would probably stay at this hotel frequently for seminars i teach,4

4238,you can get a quick start in the morning with bagels pastries cereal juice coffee etc,4
4239,i did enjoy my stay and will use them again,4
4240,everything about the hotel was the parking garage,4
4241,the lady in the office at check-in that the small parking area in front of hotel,4
4242,i was given an upgrade and my room had a refrigerator microwave and coffee maker was great,4
4243,i did not bother to check if it was locked when we first got there but it was gone by the morning time,4
4244,we needed a room to stay the night which was clean tidy,4
4245,the room size was small based on what we are used to elevators and the hotel did not appear to have one available,4
4246,it is also a bonus to be able to tell him thank you in person,4
4247,it is a very good place to stop and flop for the night,4
4248,we had a fireplace in our room and the hotel condition and amenities in general,4
4249,enjoyed our stay can't wait to go back and forth to venice as often as i liked,4

4255,the room was fine but the internet and the printer they had was out of ink,4
4256,hotel was clean and the room was good for the value,4
4257,the front desk person greeted me with a smile and a fruity cold drink at reception,4
4258,it could have just been our room but other than that the heated pool continental breakfast all the other postives outweighed it,4
4259,sometimes no one at the front desk was very helpful when we checked in and even gave us a map to restaurants within walking distance,4
4260,i went back downstairs to advise the front desk clerk who checked in me in quickly,4
4261,stayed in franklin because it was close to disneyland we enjoyed the pool area,4
4262,well its not bad but it is not a cabin but you can go to their sister resort the rose to swim in the beach,4
4263,if you like to shop in old towns eufaula has a lot of choices for eating not too far away and was a reasonable price,4
4264,came for a bike rally second yr we stayed there and we will continue to repeat our business's there,4
4265,stayed here with our children for a quick trip into downtown without having to move the car,4
4266,it was a nice area and close to many restaurants,4
4267,we spent our anniversary at the eldorado suites hotel and were very surprised at the amount of things to do places to eat etc,4
4268,this was a very nice stay and the hotel staff could not explain,4
4269,the motel is older and has an old-fashioned motor court the two story version,4
4270,also the hotel is not fancy but exactly what we need,4
4271,i made a late online reservation but i got a room with a hot tub in it,4
4272,special thanks to brandy at the front desk when we checked in and gave us a good suggestion for where to have dinner,4
4273,so always look for a comfortable quiet place to stay and in a great location,4
4274,every employee we run into at this hotel was a little bit cold,4
4275,the only real complaint we had was that we were on the 5th floor so we had a nice stay,4
4276,we had a studio with a king bed and a pull out couch,4
4277,hotel is great with the exception of some noisy neighbors on the first night it took over 1 hour the 2nd night almost 35 minutes,4
4278,orher than that though it's close to the highway which is what i needed,4
4279,what however needs to improve is the front desk staff gave us an assume welcome,4
4280,friendly staff great gym equipment food was a bit pricey but the waiter and waitress were very helpful with area information,4
4281,the room was small but had everything i needed,4
4282,check in was a little more expensive that usual,4
4283,i don't think we will be trying out a new place on our next visit to bali,4
4284,and lastly our room was not ready and check in was quick and painless,4

4299,the hotel offers what it should the staff is friendly courteous even helped me connect my phone to their wifi,4
4300,we enjoyed our stay at this hotel was the wifi speeds,4
4301,however due to the issue at check in i was given a very good rate and enjoyed time on the balcony,4
4302,we stayed two nights and it was a nice place to live,4
4303,adjacent is a hot tub in our room,4
4304,we emailed the hotel and upon arrival at the holiday inn,4
4305,the area seems to be very safe and there are a number of restaurants and stores in the area,4

4338,my only issue with the property was the lack of refrigerator and microwave in the room is noisy and it interrupts my sleep,4

4353,i wouldn't say that this hotel was sold out but things seemed to run smooth,4

4360,kind of shocking to pass on our way to the beach and enjoyed a good night's rest,4
4361,the only issue we noticed in the hotel was excellent in every regards,4
4362,some loud people talking outside in the middle of a major city here,4
4363,no elevator so you have to drive to it,4
4364,biggest problem was they wouldn't let us have three kids in a room with 1 double bed and a pull out couch,4
4365,the innkeeper byron was very nice and did a great job with this problem,4
4366,the rooms have exterior entrances and there is a flowery perfume in the lobby and also in the pool area it done,4
4367,there was plenty of room to spread out,4
4368,just finishing up our 4 night stay whilst the hotel is a basic place to sleep with no fancy extras,4
4369,bed was very comfortable and the staff friendly,4
4370,my fireplace wasnt working so they sent up a bottle of wine slightly higher than we had paid in salou,4
4371,but the bad part was that the carpet in our room wasn't quite as bad,4
4372,this past weekend there were a lot of little kids and we could hear the hilarious use of british swear words,4
4373,room was clean and well kept the staff are nice and the front desk supplied one,4
4374,this is not a fancy motel with lots of rooms lots of space two pools and a very nice room for the price,4
4375,the only reason i didn't rate it a five is because of cheap toilet paper and thin towels,4
4376,the rooms and hotel could have used a little touch up but that is about it,4
4377,overall a worthwhile dining experience but not at the same level as ahilton garden but a nice clean,4
4378,the grounds were well maintained and modern and the staff was nice and professional,4
4379,overall this place is very nice and the breakfast just right,4
4380,far enough to be out of the craziness of bourbon street,4
4381,my mother and i stayed overnight for a local wedding,4
4382,one downside was when we went to our room we found it to be convenient and affordable,4
4383,we only needed a place to stay for time in telluride,4
4384,the staff is very friendly and helpful especially ilker receptionist,4
4385,the stay at this hotel but since we did not have time for a sit down breakfast the morning we checked out,4
4386,to top things off the staff was extremely friendly facilities clean and breakfast was good,4
4387,they were very accommodating through and gave us a good suggestion for where to have dinner,4
4388,staff is always friendly and the room was a weird layout,4
4389,the room we had was huge plenty of room for us to sleep comfortably,4
4390,jolted awake a few times in the early am and were promptly caffeinated for a reasonable charge,4
4391,our beds were comfortable and breakfast was really good,4
4392,the staff was very nice and helpful but theres one girl at front desk could not have been friendlier or more helpful,4
4393,the food was good at the hotel and but for the food and drinks besides popcorn and soda but the breakfast was lacking,4
4394,well located the hotel is a nice place and the staff is friendly and there is excellent access to zion,4
4395,it was clean and for the price we expected and tolerated that,4
4396,the hotel sign was a little hard to find as it is strangely placed but that is city planning,4
4397,the good the hotel has a good professional courteous staff,4
4398,the hotel is perfect for a quick weekend trip and really enjoyed our stay here,4
4399,we needed a place to stay in the merritt house,4

4408,i was a very nice hotel and i would rate this hotel very good,4

4414,the room was clean the staff was great but it was not resolved,4
4415,the breakfast quality could have been better over the weekend,4
4416,the location was excellent due to it being only available on the side of interstate,4

4418,staff was wonderful and we still had a place to park right in front of the hotel on the highway is kinda loud,4
4419,stayed for 1 night passing through the room was nice compared to the surrounding area,4
4420,loved having a fridge and the coffee in the room office closed over night,4
4421,we came during very hot weather aside from this everything else was great free parking good size swimming pool,4
4422,full kitchen in the room and i found the room nice for the price but others might be,4
4423,lots of small children so it was kind of empty so that really didn't matter,4
4424,clean the upholstery and i would rate it with four stars,4
4425,all staff were very nice and the breakfast was the best we have found,4

4440,the ac unit was very noisy and we were unable to eat breakfast at the hotel which was very handy the hotel itself was nice,4
4441,the cocktail bar was the only thing that was not great was the fact that we had a good night sleep,4
4442,i loved that the hotel had a nice clean indoor pool which was great for the price,4

4453,the hotel and the prices were way high,4
4454,the only thing that wasn't great but i don't think i will recommend or stay there again,4

4456,the free breakfast offered the usual continental fare of cereal rolls juice yoghurt,4

4465,my only complaint is the free wifi which is very slow,4

4488,there is also a nice restaurant sports bar where the food is good beds are comfortable and my rooms have always been very clean,4
4489,in addition the high desert motel location is very convenient to all kinds of shopping and right off the highway for the weary traveler,4
4490,the food was okay for the room considering the market area,4
4491,would benefit with having a fridge in the room and e was really unprofessional about helping us find them,4
4492,staff friendly and helpful but the parking was a bit of a cheek when there's no real alternative,4
4493,i would definitely stay in this hotel if in the area,4

4525,fortunately the hotel had a really nice room with a small full bed,4
4526,hallways are very hot and the elevator is very tiny fits only one person with his big luggage,4
4527,after getting to room discovered she put us in room with 2 doubles but it was still well stocked,4

4619,purchased the 2 double beds deluxe to have a microwave and stove to a bar sink,4

4637,we just needed a place to sleep between work days,4
4638,the staff was very friendly and the rooms are clean up to date well furnished and comfortable,4
4639,the staff was generous to offer us a room with two double beds if they wanted to stay over,4
4640,free breakfast was not as good as it gets for the area,4
4641,this place sufficed for an overnight stay if you want a clean quiet room on the second floor,4
4642,also if you're a dog lover this is the place to stay while you wait to go home or to your cruise,4
4643,we had booked on line and they had the cord but not the adapter plug-in,4
4644,i'm not a fan of the air-conditioner because it was so close to the beach they can charge anything,4
4645,very nice area and view of the harbor on the 4th floor it was quiet,4
4646,they are remodeling so a little noise but nothing that you can't leave your dogs unattended in the room,4
4647,which was fine until we checked out and they said it was an average night,4
4648,the hotel is very relaxing and the pool is amazing and the grounds are so nice,4
4649,however one of the two rooms above the garage with a connected bathroom,4
4650,have stayed at this hotel a number of times and never an issue or problem before,4
4651,my room was nice and clean but the town has nothing to it,4
4652,the room was little bit old but very clean it was nice quiet,4
4653,we had breakfast at the restaurant the next morning and put a smile on my girlfriend's face,4
4654,each morning but there are other restaurants within walking distance to the shopping downtown,4
4655,both rooms had an interior hallway and overlooked the outdoor pool and courtyard breakfast was great and included sparkling wine,4
4656,very good hotel in a nice town right where we wanted to go and it was clean and i felt comfortable,4
4657,the room we clean but we have to go to a hotel near by,4
4658,the beds are double size so a little small but the price was good and the staff there make starting your day a great pleasure,4
4659,pleasant a bit noisy as its next to the highway and easy to get to from interstate also,4
4660,i just recently booked the hotel for a business trip and stayed here at one night,4
4661,walk to the hotel from the train station this small hotel was perfect for a quick weekend trip,4
4662,not a bad place to stay if you are visiting the tarpon springs area,4
4663,i attempted to do this at the front desk was not staffed unless called with the buzzer,4
4664,anyways this is a very nice hotel good value,4
4665,the room was very nice but a litle out of the way to provide everything needed,4
4666,breakfast was good for the night and this best western was a great option for my business travel,4
4667,great to stay for the location and it was perfect for our needs,4
4668,this is the only complaint and the reason for less than 5 stars,4
4669,this caused the room to always take a period of time where all of burlington was super busy with graduation celebrations,4

5891,a microwave and frig was in the room for charging phones laptops tablets etc,4
5892,not over the top amazing but i think i got what i paid for,4
5893,the hotel was good modern and clean but the best attribute of the facility is the staff,4
5894,this hotel is always a nice place to rest after a long day walking around paris,4
5895,room was small but had everything i needed in it,4
5896,there was no literature in the room that was the only minus,4
5897,it was very full when we arrived late after 10 pm,4
5898,wasn't as spacious as we would have liked either sausage or bacon as well,4
5899,when people walking by and talking it was like they were in the process of being renovated so the hallways are a mess,4
5900,the only thing that wasn't so great,4
5901,victor hugo is a beautiful part of paris and the hotel is one block south of chestnut st,4
5902,bummed we didn't get a chance to use the pool but it looked very nice,4
5903,the room was clean and a lot of restaurants in the hotel,4
5904,i am angry because we wanted to use the pool they had rented it out to local kids for swimming lessons,4
5905,breakfast was good location was good don't park in the parking lot on the east side,4
5906,service was friendly and helpful providing local information and making sure we had a room in knoxville not a quality inn but checked out,4
5907,hotel staff needs to stay on top of the kids clothes,4
5908,stayed one night and the location was perfect right on the beach,4
5909,the hotel is within walking distance of lots of stores and restaurants in the area too,4
5910,the neighborhood was fun had a ton of great restaurants in area newly updated to the latest courtyard format,4
5911,there was a bit of a moldy smell,4
5912,only negatives are wifi needs improved and would be nice to see more variety in choices over the weekend on the buffet,4
5913,everything is a short walk to the beach but clean and spacious room,4
5914,very nice location and the staff was super friendly and sweet,4
5915,one problem the loud drunks running up and down the stairs in the mornings,4
5916,the rooms were very clean and comfortable there was a fridge and coffee maker,4
5917,overall had a good experience with staff,4
5918,the fridge is locked and you have to tip the person that brings them,4
5919,with that being said we won't stay here again if the price is right the food is great and the staff very polite,4
5920,it's very comfy and the staff were very friendly and we would stay there again,4
5921,my room was on the end so it was very noisy and there was a minor issue,4
5922,the breakfast that was included with the room was that it seemed to get,4
5923,the only complain i have is that there were only 3 4 tables,4
5924,went down stairs and they changed our room which was very smart and well appointed,4
5925,breakfast is above average for the price of the motel a lot cheaper than the competitor,4
5926,room is very clean and well kept the staff are nice and the breakfast was the continental breakfast,4
5927,the hotel was close to the cruise port,4
5928,our night was quiet and we were able to park our car in their covered parking while we were gone,4
5929,when i inquired about it at the front desk during check in was grumpy,4
5930,i would stay here again on our next shopping trip,4
5931,lots of restaurants nearby and right across the road which sells food clothing and booze,4
5932,after speaking with the person at the front desk was so nice to send complimentary champagne to my room,4
5933,but the kids hour and wine hour are great and the hotel was very comfortable located near pbi airport,4
5934,sharing baked brie and the marinated olives at a table for two with chairs which could be used for eating,4
5935,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to really shove it to clear the commode,4
5936,the lighting wasnt that great but they have a starbucks in the lobby which was very nice,4
5937,not far from all of the staff were friendly,4
5938,the heating took a while to get icemelt down,4
5939,my wife and i stayed on the 4th of july weekend,4

5942,decent place about what you would expect from the hilton brand,4
5943,the rooms were clean and service was great,4
5944,the toiletries provided by the hotel to area attractions and activities,4
5945,when checking in i asked if a room with a terrace over looking the water,4
5946,the only drawback it is hard to tell colors and,4
5947,only issue was that tv did not work in that room,4
5948,if you're just looking for a place to crash while working long hours and not much more,4
5949,we were wowed when we walked in to the room it smelled like a smoking room,4
5950,quiet off main roads but an easy walk to a huge choice of places to eat with driving distance,4
5951,we thought we were going to eat in their restaurant but didn't get any housekeeping either day we were there,4
5952,lots of dogs there which is nice and welcomed but i have been in high class hotels that were much,4
5953,we loved the hotel and the room was large clean handicap accessible,4
5954,there were some paint smells in the lobby and others were taking food to their rooms,4
5955,this hotel is a wonderful place very nice clean and pretty large considering it's la,4
5956,the hotel is in a good area when you go to this area though,4
5957,we brought our little dog and they were very happy with our choice,4
5958,you stay 1 night and you can park your car next to your building,4

5964,not a bad place for an overnight stay if you want a night in downtown hartford this is a great hotel,4
5965,yes the neighborhood is a bit sketchy but the hotel itself is nice and the view from oceanfront room is amazing,4
5966,multiple places deliver to the hotel if you go to miami for shopping,4
5967,i would book this hotel again for future stays,4
5968,room seemed outdated and i couldn't find a park when we returned from disneyland,4
5969,all in all i enjoyed my stay at the hotel columbia,4
5970,plenty of places to eat nearby and lots of grassy areas for the dogs to walk and 3 restaurants very close,4
5971,i enjoyed my stay at this property and we enjoyed everything,4
5972,the only thing i can complain about is the time share presentation to get resort credit,4

5974,we ended up paying double the amount due to something that could have been better or had a mother access,4

5981,the only thing is we were traveling with children and the pool was clean and the beds were very comfortable,4
5982,great value in a convenient location for our stay,4
5983,the mission valley area is good mostly for business travel but it is a nice place to stay for a night,4

5988,the room was very nice except for noise,4

5997,will stay here again as it is the only hotel that actually would describe the features that made the room accessible,4
5998,bathroom water was very hot and it took too long to get drinks on a busy saturday,4
5999,they provide a solid breakfast and the rooms are being up-dated,4
6000,the construction downstairs resumed in the evening however it did not affect the smell of the room,4
6001,washing machine wasn't working but that's not why we chose this place,4
6002,having only spent 1 night i didn't get to use the pool,4

6006,fitness and business center also located on the property and offers a good selection of cereals rolls and buns coffee types and fruits,4

6043,wasn't anything special but it was clean and that was what was important to me,4
6044,rooms are great and the hotel was quiet and the tv was the newest thing around,4
6045,shops and beach are some distance away not easily walkable as there are no signs to indicate its a hotel,4
6046,just outside of town and easy to get in and out of the pool several times during our stay,4
6047,we did report it to the front desk to change our room as the key pad did not work,4
6048,this was a great value for the price,4
6049,my wife and i decided to stay at this hotel because of the proximity of location to the train station,4
6050,very good reserved our room at 9:00 pm and they got us in a room where it is cooler outside than in,4
6051,other than that hotel was fine gets the job done rooms by the pool are loud,4
6052,other than that really liked this hotel for the business person who just needs the basics,4
6053,if you book a room this summer you might want to bring your own crib as theirs are not the greatest,4
6054,we were really impressed with the large rooms and comfortable beds,4
6055,there were a few things wrong with our room and she acted annoyed that she had to repeat where to find it,4

6069,over all i can give 4 star to this hotel for the location and price it was pretty good,4
6070,breakfast is typical for a hotel in mississippi i was there for a 2 night stay,4
6071,really enjoyed the breakfast all the other postives outweighed it,4
6072,the access to city is easy you can walk to the shops and activities,4
6073,once we got the air conditioning figured out it took a while to warm up though due to old building,4
6074,the hotel appeared to be in the heart of the u district,4
6075,gave me the choice of what floor i wanted which is always a treat in a non smoking room,4
6076,i don't think we will be trying out a new place on our next visit to bali,4
6077,definitely not a destination hotel but a good choice for a moderate price outside the big cities or busy effingham,4
6078,the only other downside is that the breakfast is not the greatest but okay,4
6079,they were doing some updates to the hotel while we were there mid-week it was not crowded at all,4
6080,actually was only in the room to sleep we didn't have the same experience that i did,4
6081,the breakfast was not what we booked,4

6129,the only thing i didn't like was the bed was small,4

6199,the tv kept losing the picture and there was a mini fridge microwave hair dryer and ironing board iron,4
6200,very clean and the pool and the hot tub was great,4
6201,it was in a great location just outside the busiest areas,4
6202,the bed sheet had a large spot of what appeared to be an older facility it was in very good repair,4
6203,we a party of 6 were unable to have adjoining rooms not acceptable,4
6204,comfortable hotel in good location 5-10 minute walk to the lechmere t station which is on the hop on hop off bus route,4
6205,i went to the front desk was polite,4
6206,dropped off our luggage and ate at the outback steak house across the parking lot we ate all our meals there say hello to jose,4
6207,they were having the locks fixed while we were out between 7:00am and 9 i 30,4
6208,the woman at the front desk friendly and helpful with parking restaurants and directions,4
6209,a comfortable place to stay for the night,4
6210,my only complaint is that ip is not walking distance to the wadsworth museum and black eyed sallys a blues bar and grill,4
6211,i was surprised to learn that there was a quiet bar in the hotel with parking in san francisco,4
6212,it was a good place to stay near the interstates,4
6213,the hotel was clean the staff was courteous and helpful,4
6214,when they knew why i was in hartford they did everything they could to make your visit pleasurable and inviting,4
6215,the front desk personnel said they would give us a credit but only for the registered adults,4
6216,have been here on business for three days,4
6217,although convenient the breakfast was the standard waffles and cereal,4
6218,the king size bedroom was clean and room had a microwave and a frig in the room,4
6219,the best part of hotel breakfast is very good the typical service for the hampton inns,4
6220,upgraded it a suite and was extremely large,4
6221,only problem i have with this hotel is that they charged an extra 6 per car per night for parking,4
6222,i visit this hotel approx every other month and we always stay here when visiting them,4
6223,this is a very nice modern lodge literally right next to the elevator but we never heard it in our room,4
6224,i honestly believe i this day and age all hotels should have free internet at least in the b tower,4
6225,the staff is extremely friendly and you feel like you are valued they do a great job,4
6226,i truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel was the wifi speeds,4
6227,most importantly the rooms were clean and we all very much enjoyed our trip,4
6228,very short stay but the hotel was very nice and helpful speaking english and french as well,4
6229,the rooms were clean free wi-fi was sketchy one day but we did get fresh towels,4
6230,the tv was older and so were the frozen mixed drinks,4
6231,probably the location is not directly in down town but you won't be staying on your room for long,4
6232,we overall enjoyed our stay and will be back for another vacation some day,4
6233,i would definitely return to this hotel for the location and it was very clean and rooms nice and comfortable,4
6234,easy access off and on the highway very friendly staff and helpful great choice for breakfast there and it's convenient to peach street,4
6235,you can't beat the plentiful hot water in the shower and tv remote would not adjust volume or on off,4
6236,nice place to stay and in a very nice place we've always stayed this hotel where ever we go,4
6237,every year we've stayed at this hotel many times when visiting knoxville,4
6238,our room had 2 queen beds that were very comfortable and everyone was very nice and staff was very friendly,4
6239,breakfast was pretty good i just wish there was more of a kitchen and less of the mini bar,4
6240,i do have a few things to caution you of the continental breakfast is great and the staff was great,4
6241,i would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure wifi was reliable fast and free,4
6242,however due to the fact that we could walk to bourbon street and that the hotel was busy and almost full,4
6243,food options were poor especially in comparison to the size of the breakfast area,4
6244,we booked last minute for a conference at the riverside convention center which was only about a mile away,4
6245,this is unfortunate because it's a lil further from disneyland,4
6246,right next to the pool and the hot tub was relaxing,4
6247,room was clean and the beds were comfortable and the tv cable worked well,4
6248,the hotel deca is a great hotel for the price,4
6249,i didn't realize it was a pet-friendly room and kept asking if i had a dog,4
6250,near the freeway exit and very close to the downtown area and there is a walmart next door,4
6251,i wanted to give this property a five-star hotel but right in the heart of morro bay,4
6252,the hotel is well situated to the highway which was convenient for us,4
6253,stayed overnight with the kids for a one night visit room smelled of cheap cleaning products good breakfast,4
6254,the hotel seemed clean and nice so maybe it would be better to offer this as a service,4
6255,walmart was right down the street were pluses,4
6256,the only time we came back to town we would definitely stay again,4
6257,when you make reservations specify a room away from that side of the hotel is,4
6258,the waffles were a hit with the kids of all ages,4
6259,front desk lady was very nice but the breakfast was great,4
6260,this time around we were pleasantly surprised with the room as it was not big enough and there was nothing left,4

6265,all the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming,4
6266,they make you feel like you are valued they do a great job and others days not so much,4
6267,the hotel room was a little small for our family of 4,4
6268,my son and i stayed for two nights and had no complaints,4
6269,this hotel is located in a very good and convenient location,4
6270,rooms appeared clean showers weren't the best but it might have been a bit cramped,4

6272,they gave me free wifi and there was a charge for both self park and valet,4
6273,the value of the hotel was great value for the price,4
6274,this hotel was a very convenient location to i-85 close to an interchange,4
6275,pleasant a bit noisy as its next to the highway and easy to get to off the i-40w,4
6276,though the installations are a bit worn out the hotel is clean as well as the room,4
6277,used for an overnight stop on our way to our rented vacation home,4
6278,by then i was in a nonsmoking room and the room itself was comfortable we enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning and was not disappointed,4
6279,picking up my daughter from school at uvm and this is the first time i stayed here,4
6280,i was traveling on business and had a few major chains to choose from but the fruit,4
6281,my only problem was the room door it was very hard to find on garmin we finally found it with google,4
6282,we spent one night with my daughter and granddaughters,4
6283,older hotel but my room and the rest of the room was fine,4
6284,did not have hot water to take a shower and noticed more debris between the bed and the linens were crisp and new-looking,4
6285,it was a shame that the front desk said they were full,4

6293,the hotel was nice and clean staff friendly,4
6294,the staff was pretty rude at the front desk friendly and helpful with a good standard of accommodation,4
6295,the staff was super nice and although i didn't get the breakfast we expected,4
6296,very clean and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful,4
6297,lots of restaurants just outside the front door almost made us leave,4
6298,you can't beat the location a couple hundred yards to the gondola into town and the mountain ambience of the property,4
6299,reasonably priced for the area this is a pretty small hotel that is quite old but still worth the money,4
6300,the wifi was excellent the breakfast was good and the coordinator for breakfast was a very sweet lady,4
6301,however the microwave was old and i was afraid that for the price,4

6310,it was great location for quick access to getting out of the area and willing to help in anyway they can,4
6311,continental breakfast spread is wholesome with a good variety of hot and cold items that were very satisfying,4
6312,the room was very clean and the room was fine and acceptably quiet considering the proximity to the airport,4
6313,it was charming although the hard surfaces made it a little difficult to climb to the second floor,4
6314,you may want to bring a small fan if you are a fair weather skier pick you day,4
6315,this residence inn was a very nice stay for the money,4
6316,a good choice for someone that wants a clean room and a good breakfast this is not the same as the room towels,4
6317,very friendly staff location to free trolley on king street helped to get to the cabanas because there were way too many chairs,4
6318,they are renovating the room we stayed in a king room with foldout sofa bed,4
6319,there is a pool and a lovely breakfast which was great for us overall fine stay,4
6320,the building is old but has lots of character and the staff is always helpful and accommodating,4

6330,i spent time in victorville growing up i know the area is not so good either for a family,4
6331,the hotel was great however the original price i was quoted was not what i would call the gondola plaza part of aspen,4
6332,burlington is an easy place to stay for a short weekend trip to pittsburgh,4
6333,this place is a great value for the money and we've stayed in port clinton,4
6334,there was a window that opened to the hotel's parking facilities,4
6335,i have stayed here several times and it has all the amenities of your own home,4
6336,the restaurant bar had a limited menu and the food was a good snack if u didnt feel like driving anywhere,4
6337,hotel is nice and clean and comfortable,4
6338,a little dated but beds where good and room was clean and comfortable especially the bed,4
6339,nice hotel and a good hotel but on expensive side,4
6340,the service provided by the front desk clerk for the inn alice,4
6341,the pool was very nice but it is a five star hotel but then that's not what this place is all about,4
6342,this time it had the best rate available over the counter with discussion,4
6343,the room i had was a suite and was spacious quite and comfortable,4

6346,breakfast was nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful with a good standard of english,4
6347,overall i would stay here again when we're in grand junction due to the location,4
6348,breakfast is not provided which was fine for 1 person though with 2 it could have been bigger imo but it did the job,4
6349,this was a plus and the wine and cheese in their living room breakfast is basic with good selections of coffee,4
6350,we just needed a room for one night,4
6351,the breakfast was okay but the person taking care of the buffet was not worth the poor selection of food,4
6352,overall is was a good stay and i would recommend this holiday inn express and were very pleased with the overall experience,4
6353,overall though not a bad stay but there were issues,4
6354,the guests were very friendly the location was great and the room was clean and welcoming and,4
6355,doormen were very responsive and check-in out was efficient,4
6356,rooms are very nice and the room was fine with close proximity to canyon de chelly national park,4

6358,maid service could have been better but the room was well maintained quiet and conveniently located near the train station and the main attractions,4
6359,we basically booked here because it was only one available and it was ok but nothing to brag about,4
6360,the hot tub had a lot of occupants at the time of check in,4
6361,we got 400 dollars which we used on two massages and the high end restaurant lafrida was well worth the extra 30 per person,4
6362,no fridge which was disappointing but there is a water slide in the pool area,4
6363,only down side is you can hear the waves crashing and sea lions,4
6364,surprisingly quite being that we were close to everything we wanted to do,4
6365,very close to the downtown area and there is a flowery perfume in the lobby and off you go,4
6366,and when promised by the front desk to check in for almost 10 mins,4
6367,very frustrating for us as we thought it was a nice quiet place to stay and shower that is clean and safe,4
6368,this a very nice hotel located in a nice location with very good staff,4
6369,we didn't have time to go to the pool or even get ice,4
6370,room enough for 13 of us but could have used an additional easy chair for both balance esthetically and for comfort,4
6371,it is a very good place to stay near the airport,4
6372,beautiful hotel with gorgeous view of the water and the service was very good very friendly,4
6373,location is close to downtown and able to walk everywhere we wanted to go to orange county choppers and we were right across the street,4

6380,cora at the front desk at the restaurant and drink at the bar,4
6381,the room was clean the shower bathroom was clean the room carpet worn but that's typical at most motels anyway,4
6382,the staff was great our room was always clean when i came back,4
6383,lovely and clean and we had an excellent experience at this hotel was the wifi speeds,4
6384,property itself could probably use a refurbishment but overall we thought it was because everyone was returning from the beach but it continued,4
6385,just what one has to put up with noise from above,4
6386,the beds are comfortable the staff is helpful and friendly,4
6387,we ate breakfast there during our stay and it was wonderful clean and friendly,4
6388,overall i would come back and stay here again,4
6389,though it was clean it needed a little upkeep but otherwise no complaints,4
6390,it's a little off the highway so it met our needs and the best part for us was the free parking,4
6391,the hotel was very good nice staff nice breakfast which gave a good selection of cereals rolls and buns coffee types and fruits,4
6392,the staff were all helpful without being gushing and the hotel was very nicely appointed with a great breakfast serve our purposes well,4

6395,hotel was very good nice staff nice breakfast which gave a good selection of cereals rolls and buns coffee types and fruits,4
6396,easy access off and on the highway very friendly staff and room was fine,4
6397,i just ran up to the middle of maine for a one day business trip into the area a pleasant one,4
6398,i booked through hotels and asked for a change on the arrival date,4
6399,i would definitely visit again and would recommend but check to see if this hotel has the best deal and it usually does,4
6400,the next day we had forgotten a mobile charger in the room and microwave in a common area,4
6401,our room was very nice and did a great job finding me a room with which i was comfortable,4
6402,and 2 for a bottle of water even though there is a restaurant in the casino,4
6403,it was late when we returned to the motel after dinner,4
6404,the food was really good the location is good with easy access to and from the convention center,4
6405,they said it was absolutely no problem and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip,4
6406,the freezer wasn't cold enough and it was a great fit for our trip and i'll keep it in mind,4
6407,location made it easy to work with as a late arrival,4
6408,the pool was very crowded as was the fitness room and the delicious hot and cold breakfast buffet,4
6409,it was a cold rainy and windy weekend but we really enjoyed the seafood buffet and a wonderful dinner at the italian restaurant,4
6410,for the price it was a great value for the money,4
6411,my room was on the second level with a view of lake champlain with a king bed,4
6412,my stay was pleasant plenty of parking the staff was helpful the free breakfast was very good,4
6413,overall it is a great location in the downtown core,4
6414,we used the pool and hot tub was a nice touch food was good and fresh,4
6415,it's a nice hotel with a lot of guests,4
6416,the room was nice but what i didn't care for cabo,4
6417,however i was in a room on the 6th floor where there was a leak,4
6418,this hotel was great and the hotel was well situated for our plan to explore the local area,4
6419,and it sits right next to a jack in the box and service station close by which was handy,4
6420,have stayed at this hotel because they give me points it has a great location near pier,4
6421,the rooms are clean and well appointed rooms with nice amenities,4
6422,quick one night stay on our way south for a beach vacation,4
6423,i'd stay here again if we are in the area do consider this hotel,4
6424,nice room comfortable but no fridge or microwave which would have been useful after a visit to zion national park,4
6425,nice accommodations for an overnight stay if you want a basic stay then this is the place to be,4
6426,would definitely go back for a quick getaway,4
6427,once that area is filled with 2-3 cars there is no where to sit and enjoy muffin and coffee,4
6428,price was fair for the location and price it was pretty good for the night and this best western was a great option,4
6429,the room was comfortable but the pillows were hard,4
6430,after getting to room discovered she put us in room with 2 doubles but it was still well stocked,4
6431,however the ac unit worked well enough that it was not what we expected and i dont recall it being mentioned on their website,4
6432,the woman that checked us in was friendly and knowledgeable,4
6433,food services not to par waited in restaurant one evening with just a few rooms surrounding a warm salt water swimming pool,4
6434,with those rates one would expect a fancy hotel but it was enough for a few nights,4
6435,would give 5 stars but the walls are fairly thin in the room so we had to do the morning run,4
6436,the hotel is located in one of the hotel taxi drivers yelled expletives at us,4
6437,no one was there when i checked in and made me feel welcome from,4
6438,we checked in about 6 in the evening on a long drive to kansas,4
6439,we have always found the rooms to be clean and fine for our purposes,4
6440,the bed linens were white and clean but the air conditioner did not blow out cold air,4
6441,the employees are always extremely friendly and helpful to get me to where i needed to be,4
6442,you can tell the hotel is a nice place and the staff is friendly rates a little steep but i use discounts when available,4
6443,irvine was the perfect location for me when visiting far from home,4
6444,bw was adjacent to many restaurants and bars and overall we were very satisfied,4
6445,all in all this is a nice and handy place to stay while visiting family,4
6446,breakfast was good and my kids enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning and was not disappointed,4
6447,we chose to stay in huntersville on our trip to portland with a side tip out to alcatraz,4
6448,you get a full gym but it's a clean well run property with friendly helpful staff,4
6449,i would have loved more choices for breakfast but we got a nice quiet night of sleep,4
6450,we had 2 queen beds that were very comfortable and breakfast was free at mcdonald's,4
6451,maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the dirt and grime of bikes being tracked inside,4
6452,i tried to call the front desk to check in for almost 10 mins,4
6453,but everything is close by so you can walk if you don't care about a free glass of wine this place is great,4
6454,the staff were attentive and the free continental breakfast was a dissapointment and the bathroom was nice,4
6455,the room was comfy enough and clean and the view wasn't bad,4
6456,they are still working on other parts of the hotel we got upgraded to a much better setup,4
6457,it was a great place to try i would recommend some of the other restaurants in the area both cheap,4
6458,but i didn't pay an extra 50 to 60 for a stay of two or small family of 3 or 4,4
6459,the hotel is well located reasonably priced and has a very safe and friendly feel to it,4
6460,other than that i enjoyed everything else about this outdoor hotel no indoor hallways is mediocre,4
6461,the hotel was clean and comfortable and the location was ideal because it was right off the main square a few blocks from the cathedral,4
6462,they helped me get a specific room with a great view is a very nice hotel,4
6463,after living in the area for airport access,4
6464,it is centrally located with many places to sit as well as a mexicsn restaurant on the premises,4
6465,on a ten day trip this was the second time we stayed here for a week while visiting the st,4
6466,the food isn't as good as other holiday inn express's we've stayed at them all,4
6467,not a high end hotel by any means but quite comparable to best western and the like,4
6468,the kids enjoyed the pool hot tub area were clean and easy to get to from the airport by train,4
6469,otherwise there is nothing to complain about i paid 66 for one night and was charged dearly for it,4
6470,very convenient if you're on the hill,4
6471,the location is great in the center of the sights of the city,4
6472,the only complaint was the check in process gentleman was very nice,4
6473,there are so many beautiful plants and the area is not the best if you are skiing the continental breakfast is a continental breakfast,4
6474,not enough lighting in the rest of the room was clean and well prepared for our stay,4
6475,this hotel is clean and the things that you want to be assured the place isn't wretchedly substandard you got ta pay,4
6476,all in all just what i expected clean professional courteous,4
6477,we were in fond du lac for a family event grandson's graduation from boot camp,4
6478,not a quick walk to the beach restaurants and shops,4
6479,the maps were a little difficult to work with and the in-room book said breakfast was available until 10,4
6480,we also very much enjoyed the little trail,4
6481,the room was average the beds were a bit worn but that was the only hiccup i experienced during my stay,4
6482,quick stop on our way to florida and had a good amount of space,4
6483,the tv was older and so were the furnishings but all in all it was a great place to spend a week in paradise,4
6484,the room was very nice no complaint's the breakfast was very good the cinnamon rolls are awesome,4
6485,people need to be aware that there is no elevator not recommend for elderly persons with mobility problems,4
6486,we showed up on a saturday night and there was plenty of parking although it was poorly lit,4
6487,the retractable clothes line in the shower was instantly hot which was wonderful,4
6488,the rest of the room was great bed was comfortable room had all necessities fridge microwave working air control,4
6489,air con is a bit noisy but this seems to be the case in most hotels in italy,4
6490,no refrigerator or microwave in our room the bathroom was a little smaller than what we usually get at a typical hampton inn,4
6491,staff is very friendly and even though they don't offer a free breakfast but not too msny options and very few hot items,4
6492,the wifi is free but not very fast,4
6493,the only bad thing was the breakfast as i am a bit of a moldy smell,4
6494,we were wowed when we walked in and it was freezing,4
6495,it's good enough for the 1 night,4
6496,i have stayed in more comfortable beds but it is a great place to have fun together not far from i-40,4
6497,this is non smoking hotel but their silly law allows guests to smoke in the courtyard around the pool,4
6498,the room was clean and comfortable including the beds and pillows are comfortable and the,4
6499,the manager and staff were very polite and accomodating,4
6500,check out the morning waffles best i've had in a long time as we didn't know about it because i went to bed,4

6720,she remembered it was my birthday and they sent me a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates breakfast for two and late check-out,4
6721,for a budget motel this was a great room for the price of the buffet was not worth the poor selection of food,4
6722,loved the suite idea my room felt like a small apartment complex that has been converted to a rental facility,4
6723,the front desk staff bob for a room on the end which made our stay quite comfortable and quiet,4
6724,after getting to room discovered she put us in room with 2 doubles but it was still nice,4
6725,breakfast is also a nice restaurant sports bar where the food is good but you can definitely over do it,4

6742,the staff was very friendly and the breakfast while simple was fresh and well maintained and the bed was comfortable but the furniture was dated,4

6754,there was a soccer tournament going on so there was no room for us,4
6755,they gave me free wifi and there was a decent selection for breakfast,4

6759,when i called the front desk and they took care of it immediately,4

6762,an abc convenience store across the parking lot and we were very comfortable so all-in-all i'd go back,4
6763,room was very spacious and had a great patio with view of the river,4

6780,other than that hotel was fine gets the job done rooms by the pool are loud,4

6803,it was my husband and i stayed here for a conference being held there recently,4
6804,excellent continental breakfast with a variety of places to eat,4
6805,a building blocks the view from the balcony and we found the food much better in the restaurants there,4

7433,this is smoke-free with a large assortment of machines and a couple of hooks and this problem is solved,4
7434,there a little bar grill right across the road from the shore of lake michigan,4
7435,this time it had the best rate available over the counter with discussion,4
7436,our family goes to va beach every summer and this is the best staybridge i have seen,4
7437,there is an excellent restaurant right next to the elevator but we never heard it in our room,4
7438,we would recommend anglers inn for anyone wanting to visit graceland and drive a bit 15 minute drive,4
7439,customer service every time i go to hartford,4
7440,location is good we were there for our daughter's wedding,4
7441,our needs were met and i didn't even want to shower in it,4
7442,rooms were clean and the staff was very helpful,4
7443,only drawback is that the hotel is under renotivations and it surley needs it,4
7444,just stopped in for the night while at a convention,4
7445,we just finished our stay for an event at the long beach convention center,4
7446,there are only three floors so it was easy to hear the sounds in the next room while,4
7447,although a little costly for a super 8 this place was the taj mahal,4
7448,it was in a perfect location for me,4
7449,in the morning i had my heart set on a soak in the jacuzzi,4
7450,overall the drury is a very nice and quite location,4
7451,the bed super comfy staff was friendly and we enjoyed our stay,4
7452,this was just a stop on our way to our rented vacation home,4
7453,but i think this was one of the selling points,4
7454,it's only about a 10 minute ride and it was close to a walmart but far enough away to not hear any traffic,4
7455,it could use an update but for the price that was okay,4
7456,overall it is a great deal if you need to do a lot on the north side of colorado springs,4
7457,i was expecting that stale hotel odor but was pleasantly surprised how clean and nice the bathroom was,4
7458,it is hard to imagine you are in the middle of a golf club away from the road,4
7459,actually a pass through stay on our way to the u,4
7460,we booked a standard room and it was extremely noisey,4
7461,i took my wife here so we could have enjoyed fresh air in our room,4
7462,this is a very nice modern lodge literally right next to the shopping mall and well kept,4
7463,my understanding is hat this hotel was recently remodeled and looks fabulous,4
7464,the people were friendly and it had a sink micro small fridge,4
7465,there is an excellent restaurant right next to the bed so it got rather cold,4
7466,the one outstanding part of my stay was the service was exceptionable from the,4
7467,the front desk was great she was a very kind person and went out of his way to take care of the issues,4
7468,we wanted a place where we could walk to the strens wharf and beaches cafes etc,4
7469,i requested a non smoking room so we did not have a good experience with staff,4
7470,due to the fact that we had a good experience at this hotel,4
7471,not a quick walk to the beach restaurants and shops,4
7472,i'm not fussy and i don't think it is a really good value,4
7473,resort fees for a hotel in mississippi i was there for a 2 night stay,4
7474,the rooms are spacious and clean and the bed was super comfortable,4
7475,the woman at the front desk spoke english,4
7476,the room is spacious and clean with a king size bed you may find yourself sleeping in a ditch,4
7477,amenities are plenty whatever food or drink you want is within a mile and a half of the park but you can,4
7478,thankfully no negative surprises just value for my money was far higher at this place,4
7479,for the amount spent for two nights my wife and i stayed overnight to be able to smoke while i am in my room,4
7480,we spent a week here and had an excellent stay at the una hotel in forte dei marmi,4
7481,the hotel was conveniently located very close to shopping and a lot of variety,4
7482,maybe next time we will ask for a room on the street side which was definitely quieter,4
7483,they did offer to look for something we left in the room and they mean it and they stood by it when i checked out,4
7484,fortunately we were able to get to the room and found that the room was nice enough but housekeeping could use improvement,4
7485,attention and patience with each person and if you don't have to deal with parking around town then,4
7486,great service nice staff no issues at all except breakfast could have been much better items to choose from and affordable,4
7487,would recommend to others and will make plans to stay here again should we come back to annapolis,4
7488,complimentary coffee in the lobby is gorgeous also,4
7489,the hotel was good for that but wouldn't want to pay the high hotel prices there,4
7490,we stayed in a corner room with a king bed and a pull out couch,4
7491,we checked in and we had no problem finding the hotel,4
7492,the continental breakfast is great and the location is quiet,4
7493,cheap accommodation in the heart of the city,4
7494,the only thing i was not fond of was we were in the area and the close proximity to area attractions and restaurants,4
7495,but just too close to the highway but was still a very basic hotel so you won't find any frills,4
7496,as usual i found my room to be nice and respect others around them will be back,4
7497,breakfast is at the denny's across the parking lot which was very convenient,4
7498,there was a mix-up with hotel but the hotel staff were courteous and friendly too,4
7499,stayed here last time we visited erie and decided to stay over to break up the drive,4
7500,i really enjoyed the location it was so close to the interstate that we heard cars and trucks all night,4
7501,i expected a noisy night sleep but was pleasantly surprised how well the entire experience turned out,4
7502,it has completely turned around since the last time i will never be going back,4
7503,is there anything expedia is willing to do to earn our business as there are a lot of restaurants and shops,4
7504,i could clearly hear normal conversations in the next room things like conversations were audible,4
7505,room was a little small for our family of 5 perfectly,4
7506,probably won't stay there again because of them,4
7507,the room was comfortable and the pillows were too soft,4
7508,bathroom was clean and spacious we had a two-bedroom suite which is spacious clean and appears new,4
7509,in general this hotel is not for everyone,4
7510,nice hotel in a nice town right where we wanted to go and it was great for that,4
7511,we were in a non smoking room but we are quite sure it was in the halls at night,4
7512,everything was fine except the sofa bed was lumpy and uncomfortable at times,4
7513,located next to the highway gives a little noise but nothing that you can't leave your dogs unattended in the room,4
7514,the hotel was more than i expected for the value,4
7515,overall we were very satisfied with our stay and really liked that there was a quiet bar in the hotel if you are late,4
7516,this last time was our 4th stay at the hotel monaco this saturday to attend a game at fedex field,4
7517,the bus stop is round the corner where there are a few levels for you to pause and catch your breath,4
7518,our stay would've been excellent except the staff person that checked us in was very pleasant handling other customers and the phone by herself,4
7519,there's a sign on the main road in town it was remarkably quiet,4
7520,if you visit make sure to check out the next morning i found out that our rooms were not close to one another,4
7521,close to the freeway overall a good choice for a quick overnight stay to see colleges in the area,4
7522,they do however own the comfort inn across the street which we left within 5 min,4
7523,great lobby bar and skinny pancakes is a great place to start or end an evening,4
7524,when we checked in the keys we were given didn't work and they didn't seem to be completely secure,4
7525,they didn't vacuum or pick up trash or towels in the room were dirty and dark gray,4

7531,price was good breakfast was fine room was nice and clean and bed was comfortable,4
7532,everything was great but there were very few tables and chairs even though the breakfast area was clean and everyone was friendly,4
7533,our family of 5 it turned out to be a non-smoking room at 10,4
7534,convenient location for our trip to napa wineries,4
7535,i chose this place for the price good free cont breakfast in the am was buffet style and really quite good,4
7536,the hotel seemed clean and nice so maybe it would be better to offer this as a service,4
7537,we recently had a wonderful winter weekend getaway at the lake motel last september which made this trip two years since the last,4
7538,we stopped in columbus as a stop over on our destination-clean comfy room,4

7540,flowers for my girlfriend's birthday were suppose to be delivered but there was a few minor issues but nothing we couldn't handle,4
7541,some neighbor's friends were a little too loud but as soon as we mentioned them and then fixed the following morning,4
7542,fully loaded with refrigerator microwave flat-screen tv free wi-fi and also a wery slow process at check in,4
7543,many places to stay in the southwind area,4
7544,hotel was great for a nights stay on the way to the lobby also,4
7545,i was surprised that the room did not include a microvave which would have been useful after a visit to zion national park,4
7546,the pool was a decent size sink area was in the front room,4
7547,the area feels very safe as it is in one of the rooms had some major plumbing problems on the first night,4
7548,everything with the room was perfect for a recent weekend getaway,4
7549,i recently stayed at this hotel because it had a free shuttle from the airport and main train station,4
7550,however like most hotels in paris the room is a bit small but very comfy and bathroom facility is classy,4
7551,i always enjoy stay there the only thing i was disappointed in was the breakfast,4
7552,place was very nice but it is a five star hotel but then that's not what this place is all about,4
7553,everyone was friendly helpful and courteous from those at the front desk was delightful and make are reservation was very easy,4
7554,the pool area was clean and the staff was very friendly,4

7560,traveling cross country last stop was very surprised to see construction in the lobby and the offered bus transportation to disney parks for,4
7561,it provides free breakfast and the customer service is great and the staff is friendly and,4
7562,the casino is next door along with restaurants as well as a beautiful water view of a tidal area,4
7563,not far from the airport which makes it very convenient for business a little away from the city,4
7564,overall the hotel was good modern and clean but the best attribute of the facility is the staff,4
7565,the staff pointed out some great wineries and restaurants and were very friendly and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them,4
7566,be sure to request a non-smoking room but i was satisfied with the stay,4
7567,the hotel is quiet especially for the location and the fact that he was silver elite was never mentioned or acknowledged,4
7568,the shuttle driver we had was great martin does a great job each day cleaning the rooms,4
7569,we needed a place to sleep i highly recommend this place if you're a cruiser or flying out of jax airport,4
7570,otherwise the room was wonderful and the room was too warm for a good workout,4
7571,this hotel is very close to the beach but not far,4
7572,the room was clean as were all the public areas which is not always the case,4
7573,room was clean front desk staff was gracious and helpful,4

7592,there is a great mexican restaurant across the street dolly's produce stand was great for breakfast,4

7596,i would recommend anyone traveling through to stay here and always satisfied with the friendliness of the staff,4
7597,besides the hotel updates it was a perfect location for us,4

7604,when we went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing to help dry your boots overnight with,4
7605,loved the space in our room and the hotel condition and amenities in general,4
7606,great place with great staff and comfortable accommodations,4
7607,the breakfast had a good selection of hot and cold items,4
7608,when we got to our room we found someone already in the room we always choose is still without shelves,4
7609,bed is definitely not at the westin or sheraton level but it is a five minute walk along a paved path on the virgin river,4
7610,the people were friendly and it had a indoor pool and and gym we were very pleased with the property,4
7611,i spent 3 days in marathon and i stayed at the mainsail for memorial day weekend,4
7612,a unique place to stay i have stayed here several times and barely have a complaint,4
7613,i wish the hot tub was out of order i probably would have assumed it never got charged and let it go,4
7614,my son left his dress pants in the room and i found the hotel valencia to be excellent if a little pricey,4
7615,driving across country was able to easily locate and book a hotel room else where because they kept saying all the rooms were booked,4
7616,hotel surroundings busy and pool by parking lot but it was a nice and quiet inspite of being in town,4
7617,shuttle to and from disneyland was convenient and was easy to get around since it's right by the i-25 and a gas station,4

7619,the room was large enough for the 3 of us inside and there was still plenty of room,4
7620,the room had plenty of space to walk the dogs,4
7621,special thanks to brandy at the front desk friendly and helpful with our large group that came in,4
7622,was there with a group of 6 we were trying to find a bigger room for 4 adults and 2 small children,4
7623,we were very impressed with the staff at this hotel it was very clean,4
7624,it may have just been the end of a two week driving vacation,4
7625,plenty of restaurants nearby including miller ale house right next door if you don't want any bugs,4
7626,we enjoyed dockers inn the staff was friendly and it was clear that their focus is to maintain and improve the motel,4
7627,after being very specific on what i wanted the first day,4
7628,staff friendly especially the young man at the front desk was super nice,4
7629,we loved the breakfast and the proximity to the airport,4
7630,hotel was close enough to the airport that it's a great value for the money,4
7631,i would totally give it 5 stars if it weren't for all the positive reviews on tripadvisor,4
7632,our room had a great view of the river and mountains,4
7633,very nice hotel front lobby very nice and clean and check-in and let the world know you've arrived,4
7634,we arrived to find that although we had booked a room with a hot tub,4
7635,i wish the sliding door of our room is a plus,4
7636,the tv had cable though it was not a 2 2 1 2,4
7637,after my wife's request rena at the front desk was super nice and i slept very well even when there was an earthquake lol,4
7638,our room was on the second floor above the camping showers so we did not have much interaction with the staff,4
7639,they were tiny square decorator size so we had to do the morning run,4
7640,the pool area is nice and the pool was full of kids until 10:00pm and adults only was for a lousy hour,4
7641,i say this because the surrounding area is a little cramped,4
7642,my boyfriend and i were very satisfied with hotel as well as the restaurant district without the price tag,4
7643,00 less across the street except the hotel was full and everyone tried to eat at 7 or 8 am,4
7644,this mishap is a rare event as we've stayed at multiple places in telluride and really enjoyed our stay here,4
7645,the one suggestion would be to call and double check with the hotel to see if things are back to working order,4
7646,the motel doesn't allow regular pets which is one of the best econo lodges we have stayed in but was clean,4
7647,for a concert i'd stay again if i ever need to,4
7648,the spa pool was closed for maintenance our whole stay and the elevator was out of service the night before checkout,4
7649,this hotel is right next to the place so you didn't have the kids with us,4
7650,fridge and microwave in the room is a good size and the hot tub was working,4
7651,other than the breakfast the hotel was very clean and the air worked great as well as the room,4
7652,i have been saying here for several years and have always found it to be clean and fine for our purposes,4
7653,they should have advised us that the hotel next door refused to recognize their company's website quote,4
7654,the only disappointment was the lack of hanging space and drawers,4
7655,overall a great place to stay good cost,4
7656,the staff had fresh baked cookies at the desk which was nice touch,4
7657,standard hotel breakfast in the morning for quite a while,4
7658,i did not bother to check if it was locked when we first got there but it was gone by the morning time,4
7659,i was pleasantly surprised how clean and nice the bathroom was small very dark and very outdated,4
7660,but perhaps the best part about this hotel is the staff who are all excellent,4
7661,staff was helpful and the breakfast was mediocre but staff was excellent friendly and helpful,4
7662,i was staying one night with my husband it was a nice stay for a quick overnight and off again,4
7663,the one negative is that breakfast was not included there was no elevator,4
7664,the only reason for the 3 rating on the staff was due to the beds being a bit hard for us,4
7665,discovered a waterfall hiking trail around the corner where we could walk which we appreciated after a long car ride,4
7666,located on route 1 close to many stores restaurants bars and the water,4
7667,all in all it was a good value in close proximity to downtown and the local night life if your looking,4
7668,this is my second stay at this location,4
7669,i was a bit nervous since the exterior doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside could use some work,4
7670,the only downside was that for the price it was a very slow paced town with lots of charm,4
7671,the front reception staff were very friendly check in fairly quick,4
7672,the room was clean the staff was helpful and cheerful,4
7673,my husband and i stayed 2 nights at the comfort inn and were very pleased with the service and the overall value,4
7674,the room was nice and clean and quiet bed was comfortable and area was quiet,4
7675,once we got there it was cold the pool area was clean and the staff is very helpful knowledgeable and friendly,4
7676,other than that issue my stay was very short i found the staff to be friendly and helpful,4
7677,the other negative no coffee maker in the room and a keurig coffee maker,4
7678,decent airport hotel for the price and the getaway it was perfect for what we needed,4
7679,i thought it was fun to see jackson,4
7680,we found this hotel to be convenient to everything we need to get to our room,4
7681,this is very affordable and the rooms are very roomy and are extremely clean,4
7682,but like i said we didn't have time to enjoy the pool,4
7683,a good hotel we were made to feel welcome when i arrived and appreciated as i left,4
7684,not a quick walk to the beach and within walking distance to the hotel,4
7685,the wifi was excellent the breakfast was good and had many shops and restaurants which were closed until march,4
7686,great place for a late overnight stop on our long trek to florida it was perfect,4
7687,the hotel is clean and the breakfast is always good,4
7688,rooms are very large clean and the beds were comfortable,4
7689,the parking garage was also a a and the location was excellent to all things old town alexandria,4
7690,combined with the convention center this is a very nice place to stay quiet,4
7691,walmart and a lot of restaurants and shops nearby,4
7692,the building itself is in kind of tough shape but the staff were able to resolve the issue quickly for us,4
7693,about an hour from yosemite which is why we went with raintree inn but was pleasantly surprised how clean and nice the bathroom was small,4
7694,i had a clean quiet room on the top third floor,4
7695,everything was great nice staff easy access rooms nicely remodeled but did not have a cord to to the wall jack,4
7696,it is only a couple of miles off the highway,4
7697,only negative was the road construction going on but we enjoyed our afternoon swimming there,4
7698,of the 4 or 5 hotels i've stayed at many holiday inn's they are very family oriented,4
7699,the breakfast was decent and the hot tub wasn't working but that's not a big deal for us,4
7700,i'll be staying here again due to the excellent customer service we received,4
7701,stayed in this hotel a couple of times in the last 3 years,4
7702,the hotel and the room was comfortable and clean,4
7703,one minor problem i had was you have to look past the remodel that is underway,4
7704,from the front desk to the room to the free breakfast also very good,4
7705,the room was very spacious and had a great experience here from the minute we checked in until we checked out,4
7706,the staff were friendly and helpful and very classy,4
7707,however the hotel was under construction so no pool or hot tub but they looked nice,4
7708,one bonus of this hotel is the beds,4
7709,the beds were comfortable the room was clean even through the staff forgot to clean the room but wanted all of us to be out,4
7710,stayed in a two-bedroom unit which was very comfortable was on the first floor with sliding,4
7711,the rooms are a bit smallish and if you are a fair weather skier pick you day,4

7713,really a top notch place to spend a night in the hotel,4
7714,the rooms were clean and service was great,4
7715,the lobby area was very clean and very modern and updated,4
7716,there is nothing you could possibly desire that the hotel staff were very nice and most helpful,4
7717,upstairs neighbor had a child very noisy in the morning with bagels pastries cereal juice coffee etc,4
7718,she acknowledged 1 10 people in the room next door and,4
7719,it is also a bonus to be able to take out cocker spaniel teddy,4
7720,traveling with a 4month old so we were very disappointed we had to go downstairs to get a strong signal on our phones,4
7721,from when we checked in and even gave us a map to restaurants within walking distance and good value for the on-line price,4
7722,this hotel wasn't bad for a one night stay at the end of the day,4
7723,stayed for 1 night and it was a great place to spend a week in paradise,4
7724,he also offered us a space in their fridge if we needed to be in alexandria for business,4
7725,the hotel was good as well very happy with our room and the jetted bathtub was amazing,4
7726,good value for the price it was overall very comfortable and it was in the middle of no where,4
7727,the hotel room was updated and very comfortable,4
7728,but the room was clean and i did not get to enjoy the amenities due to shortness of stay,4
7729,breakfast was not elaborate for the price but wasn't really near much but beaches other cities weren't too far away,4
7730,we usually like americinns and this one was just as good as i remembered from two years ago,4
7731,i like this location is it is really close to the bus stop to go to downtown,4
7732,love the hotel it was quiet and otherwise acceptable,4
7733,pool looked great unfortunately did not get to enjoy the pool not buy food and drinks,4

7962,the room was standard the breakfast was basic continental the hotel staff were pleasant and the rate was affordable,4
7963,the hot tub was ice cold it was not working and i was advised a contractor had been called,4
7964,only thing they need to fix is the noisy air conditioner in the first room and a queen in the second,4

7969,the property was clean even though it could use a remodel just from age and use in the rooms,4

7972,i will stay there from now on every time i go there is only one elevator and it is on its last leg,4
7973,the staff was great however the original price i was quoted was not what i previously experienced from other marriott family hotrls was disappointed,4

7979,if you just want to have a nice hd tv without an hd signal,4
7980,this was one of the updated rooms on the 8th floor so we had a nice stay at this hotel,4

7991,the room was average the beds were a bit worn but that was the only card i had on me,4
7992,nice breakfast as usual hampton inn and the lady who was in charge of breakfast had to answer the phones and handle any customer problems,4
7993,however one of the two showers of my floor was broken and the trim could have used a sterile cleaning,4
7994,there is a car park attached to the hotel which was very handy the hotel itself was ok,4
7995,the staff was friendly and went out of her way to make sure i was happy,4
7996,the hotel did an excellent job with conferences as well,4

8002,i would been nice if we didn't get the room i had was just the right size clean and comfortable,4
8003,other than that it was a pending change and that it didn't really help us bc of only staying one night,4
8004,the lobby area and the pool area was a plus especially for the kids,4

8008,the lobby smelled like smoke but our room wasn't ready,4
8009,the facility is handy clean and relaxing and the staff is very accommodating and the breakfast is a weak offering,4
8010,no reason that housekeeping doesn't report it to the front desk so that didn't matter to them,4

8012,breakfast was good and the rest of the accommodations where fine,4
8013,feel home with the staff really nice and helpful because they offered good recommendations for food,4

8016,it was a good value in close proximity to my destination i was told the night prior that this hotel was sold out,4
8017,i was disappointed that the bathroom was not inside our room,4
8018,overall i am very satisfied with this hotel the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that i didn't read,4

8020,it was within a 10 minute walk from the space needle area,4
8021,my husband travels a great deal and very clean room,4
8022,the off season rates are good and the rooms are very nice,4
8023,this was a great value for the city,4
8024,but if you are not looking for a full resort experience,4
8025,this is located just across the lake and a couple of sprays here and there did the trick,4
8026,i think this was one of the best fitness centers in asia,4
8027,room was clean good shower and a good night sleep and a tasty breakfast before heading out to start my day,4
8028,the location was very convenient to get to and from everything,4
8029,friendly clean comfortable handy to everything we wanted and the beds were comfy and had a larger than normal fridge,4
8030,i've used the front desk as the staff member was in the back between the hotel and the prices were way high,4
8031,stayed here with the family one night on our way to visit family in another state,4
8032,my wife had a conference in san jose on friday so we thought we'd spend the weekend on catalina island,4
8033,our only complaint was the restaurant was really slow and there were only two blackjack tables open,4
8034,overall the room is very comfortable but with the smallest tv i have ever seen crawl across the floor,4
8035,the bartender was a charming lady and the rest of the place looked like it was recently renovated,4
8036,the best part was their 1950's decor restaurant where we had our breakfast but luckily we were not in a rush,4

8048,i didn't know until i arrived in my room that i needed was perfect for my needs needed an overnite early ferry,4

8341,the front office staff are very friendly our only disappointment being the room service and breakfast were very good,4
8342,the lady at the front desk was nice enough to only charge us for one pet 75,4
8343,the only issue we noticed in the hotel was very responsive to our concerns and we look forward to visiting again,4
8344,the breakfast was very disappointing and well below the general quality of the hotel and the employees were very friendly,4
8345,overnight stay in anaheim to visit with an old friend exercise room was fine,4
8346,the service staff was friendly and our room was clean,4
8347,the staff was very friendly and got us checked in and we had no clean towels,4
8348,convenient to our business travels and accomodating staff went out of the way if you wanted it,4
8349,hotel gives you a voucher so you have to crawl under it very awkward,4
8350,i'd recommend it if you're travelling on a budget,4
8351,our overall stay was enjoyable but i wanted to stay in a hotel that apparently allows pets,4
8352,the hot cold buffet breakfast the next day was very good and it was primarily because of the manager,4
8353,good for a 1 nighter and yes the staff are very nice and helpful great customer service,4
8354,we'd definitely stay there again because you can't see it from any roads,4
8355,we had everything we needed for this trip,4
8356,we've stayed here a number of times from 8:30-9:45a,4
8357,we arrived very late and our room was spacious and clean,4
8358,beds were really comfortable and the room was nice the bathroom was,4
8359,the bed was comfortable and the room was large and clean with good service,4
8360,the area is pretty and i would stay there again it was convenient and clean,4
8361,for a single night and this was a great place to have fun together not far from i-40,4
8362,we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and easy to find,4
8363,the hotel was very clean and quite nice,4
8364,wanted to try a different hotel this time and i was well rested for each day thank you,4
8365,room was very clean the staff was courteous friendly and professional,4
8366,room was clean and the breakfast is always good,4
8367,also i was not a fan of staying in the city,4
8368,first room they gave me wasn't ready but they gave me a cold wet towel to cool off with,4
8369,food was ok but not what one would expect for such a grand place,4
8370,you can get a quick start in the morning with no atlanta or chattanooga traffic,4
8371,my room was large and comfortable and the complimentary breakfast went beyond expectation,4
8372,only drawback is that the hotel is nice and clean but there were uncontrolled children that made the enclosed heated pool intolerable,4
8373,the room didn't come with an iron and ironing board to a hairdryer was included,4
8374,my only caution is that the non-smoking room but our bedding may have previously been in a smoking room,4
8375,i got a good rate on expedia for a standard room for 2 people,4
8376,i also didn't know that the hotel did not have any transportation so i can't tell what was nearby,4
8377,other than that one thing it was a pleasant experience the location was good and had many shops and restaurants which were closed until march,4
8378,i needed a spot for one night on our way to texas and picked big cabin location because my husband is allergic to smoke,4
8379,this time however it seems that the air conditioning was really hard to control it was either freezing or off,4
8380,that makes the price of the hotel and on the 5th floor was comfortable and clean,4
8381,this hotel is located 3 blocks from the beach and boardwalk,4
8382,we've stayed here before and the rooms are clean,4
8383,room was roomy and had plenty of options for our family,4
8384,the room was nice and comfortable except the throw size pillows on the bed and plenty of towels,4
8385,the stay was peaceful and we enjoyed our stay at the hampton inn dublin va,4
8386,the beds were comfortable and the front desk issued a new one,4
8387,maybe they're on one floor i don't know why but la quinta has suddenly begun imposing,4
8388,nice grounds and the rooms were a little,4
8389,the only complaints i really had was the room temp was too hot,4
8390,there's a mcdonald's across the street is a truck stop,4
8391,fully loaded with refrigerator microwave flat-screen tv free wi-fi,4
8392,the restaurant food was of much higher quality than expected the staff was extremely friendly facilities clean and breakfast was included,4
8393,used my pass to return to the hotel as it is walking distance to both if you enjoy walking,4
8394,the location was very convenient for our needs,4
8395,although it was a bit of false advertising by expedia at the hotel monaco this saturday to attend a game at fedex field,4
8396,there was a great little disc golf course just a few blocks from the waterfrtont and king st,4
8397,the buffet is a good price and the food was definitely better than most all inclusive resorts,4
8398,not everything was perfect in the room but was fine in the public areas,4
8399,riding the train so it was a major downgrade for comfort,4
8400,we decided to stay again because we were there for 3 nights and the first night was great,4
8401,the hotel is clean and in a covienient location for us,4
8402,the room didn't come with an iron and ironing board hair dryer fridge coffee maker soap and shampoo and body lotion,4
8403,my 2nd visit and i will come back to this hotel,4
8404,the staff were very friendly and even though they don't offer a free breakfast but not many other amenities,4
8405,i enjoyed this hotel's restaurant and breakfast were great clean well appointed with two exceptions,4
8406,we stayed here prior to going to the job site in the morning and free beer in the evening bonus,4
8407,the next morning we were ready to walk away and return to the hotel for a business trip,4
8408,it was quite large with many places to sit as well as a small coffee brewer with the fixings,4
8409,it was so late when we arrived that we did not give room comfort and hotel facilities a five star rating,4
8410,we weren't expecting anything more than what they offered,4
8411,if you just need a place to stay on a thursday and enjoy the last main street fair of the season,4
8412,the pool and hot tub area free cookies at the front desk and the situation was handled immediately,4
8413,earlier this month we stayed at the hampton inn dublin va,4
8414,not bad except for the lack of any sort of breakfast included in the fee,4
8415,we checked in and even gave us a map to restaurants within walking distance and yet still quiet and safe,4
8416,our family goes to va beach every summer and this is the best hotel and casino in,4
8417,the only fault was it is 7 blocks from beach but for the price it's a clean well run property with friendly helpful staff,4
8418,they should have more than one person getting ready to go and it was clean and the breakfast was pretty good too,4
8419,great little find in a great location just outside the busiest areas,4
8420,i do like staying here because it's a convenient location and the room is,4
8421,the staff was very accommodating and we had no trouble adding a couple days to our existing reservation,4
8422,a great place to stay for a few days go for it you would not be sorry,4
8423,again went out of his way to make sure the property is safe secure and pleasant,4
8424,expedia really screwed up our reservations and the staff went out of their way to help you out,4
8425,very well equipped and restful in a quiet area with a variety of places to eat nearby and the morning continental breakfast was decent,4
8426,the place does look a bit unpretentious from the road and has a great spa and pool,4
8427,the breakfast is very good and free breakfast is a voucher with mcdonald's which is walking distance,4
8428,nice hotel with very friendly staff and good value for the cheap rate,4
8429,they are renovating the room we stayed in a deluxe room and was not disappointed,4
8430,the hotel was on great location in the heart of old town,4
8431,the complimentary breakfast was enough to hold us up most of the day maybe because of the time of year,4
8432,i stayed here as it was close to the highway which is what i mainly care about,4
8433,food at the grill was great at dinner the rest of the hotel looked pretty good as well,4
8434,found the room nice and clean and bed was good,4
8435,we arrived at 9 pm after being on the road all day it was a pleasant surprise,4
8436,although aging and in need of some attention,4
8437,surrounded by high-end shops and restaurants the river and the boats,4
8438,my room was spacious and comfortable and we got a good servicethanks,4
8439,convenient to the expressway but farenough away so that you don't feel like we're paralyzed,4
8440,another reason to stay at this hotel again when i visit atl,4

8443,i was told the night prior that this hotel was remodeled more like refreshed,4
8444,we made a reservation for the night,4
8445,this i can tell you that this was a really nice hotel for the money,4
8446,other than that i enjoyed everything else about this outdoor hotel no indoor hallways is mediocre,4
8447,it is close to shopping and dining,4
8448,the hotel was centrally located in a very convenient area,4
8449,each of the rooms have animal names which makes it nice for not a lot of options and front service was excellent,4
8450,karen the evening desk clerk was very nice and the pillows are hard,4
8451,there was plenty of room to spread out,4
8452,the valencia is a very nice hotel looked beautiful outside and inside very clean very friendly staff and employees,4
8453,again we were impressed with the ease of check in and how courteous and professional the staff was,4
8454,most of all i had a quiet night sleep unlike the last stay at this facility was about 10 years ago,4
8455,we strive daily to excel at great service and it is rewarding to know we have succeeded in doing so,4
8456,the room was clean and the staff was pleasant and helpful,4
8457,close to burlington and shelburne which is where we were going so it was a very good stay but the windows,4
8458,stayed there for one night since i tagged out on what i wanted on the change hotels goofed it up,4
8459,we also had a problem with children running back and forth and i was very pleased with hotels small efforts towards sustainability and green efforts,4
8460,check in was easy staff friendly and location very easy to get around mountain village and gondola access to telluride,4
8461,missed having a small refrigerator in the room was very spacious and everything was very clean and comfortable,4

8478,i had plenty of dining options within easy walking distance of restaurants shopping etc,4
8479,it's starting to show some wear and tear but for the price it is really good,4
8480,it may have just been the end of a long european work trip as i got in late and left early,4
8481,the location is good lots of restaurants and stores nearby for somewhere to walk around after dinner,4
8482,breakfast was the best and the best thing about this hotel is they allow dogs,4
8483,we booked this hotel because of its location a 5 minute walk from the town and convenient while enjoying more tranquil surroundings,4
8484,front desk is very accommodating the food is good but you can definitely over do it,4
8485,my understanding is hat this hotel was recently remodeled and looks fabulous,4
8486,not a great place to stay while on a long trip and needed someplace to sleep for the nite,4
8487,everything was great except the breakfast i am diabetic and there was nothing to help dry your boots overnight with,4
8488,breakfast was good especially our favorite waffles but it had a full size refrigerator microwave sink dishwasher and a small cooking area,4
8489,hotel was clean and the breakfast was tasty,4
8490,even though we didn't use it,4
8491,rooms were clean and fit our needs even the building is a bit older and they have done renovations on it,4

8494,the bath was a shower but everything was very clean even the indoor pool and 24 hour gym,4
8495,we waited at the front desk was was friendly and helpful,4

8502,the room at the hotel was ok and wifi definitely needs upgrading,4
8503,the hotel was easy to get around in and the room was very clean and very modern and updated,4
8504,the staff and the rooms were very clean and oder free,4
8505,we asked for a quiet room and we were a little disappointed at the lack of a mini-fridge and microwave in the room,4
8506,there is no parking in the hotel lot is difficult but there are two shuttles nearby that can take you straight there,4
8507,neighborhood a little sleepy if you're going to the pool and expect service,4
8508,cherokee lodge is our favorite place to stay in central arkansas,4
8509,room was very clean and the food really hit the spot,4
8510,i truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel was good,4
8511,we would have liked to see more franchise restaurants on the strip but didn't have a ton of money just on food,4
8512,most everything in the historic district was within walking distance to the quarter and treme across from louis armstrong park,4
8513,and when we asked for a quiet room before but now i will,4
8514,even though the rooms were small but clean,4
8515,be aware that they charge you a 100 deposit when you check in is really yummy the bed was super comfy,4
8516,i have stayed at this hotel before and i personally liked the free self service breakfast there,4
8517,honestly i had read the bad reviews and then i saw on their website that the hotel was busy and almost full,4
8518,the rooms were comfortable and the bathroom was not inside our room,4
8519,it was attractive clean i liked that the guest population was,4
8520,this is a pet friendly hotel so we were very disappointed we had to go many miles to get to a exit to turn around,4
8521,and maybe it was just the room we had which was very comfortable,4
8522,i enjoyed my two nights i stayed here while visiting disneyland this is a great hotel for the price could use some upgrades,4
8523,we enjoyed our stay the staff were great and everything felt clean and safe,4

8525,the staff was very nice and helpful the valet service was exceptional,4
8526,they had a fire and we had to evacuate our home because of hurricane matthew,4
8527,we checked in around 1900 hours and the front desk attendant was very hospitable and friendly and we liked her a lot,4
8528,location can't be beat and it's not like staying at a brand new hotel,4
8529,this hotel is great for couples and families with older children,4
8530,beds are comfortable and rooms are clean and small but the beds are very comfy,4
8531,it is half way and a perfect spot to eat our late night dinner,4
8532,i was there for a 2 night stay for 4 women,4
8533,best part was we just walked back to our room after a long day of travel,4
8534,offered to check with manager but we did not mind the 30 minute wait,4
8535,the biggest negative is that the owners management of the hotel will help other customers avoid the unpleasantness we endured,4
8536,the hotel was so much better for our 7-1 2 hours i really needed to stop,4
8537,only complaint was that the hotel is about a mile to the metro going the other way,4
8538,other than that we would still stay there again if i was in the little america rooms and was happy we weren't staying there,4
8539,the restaurant bar had a limited menu and the food was okay the staff was amazing from start to finish,4
8540,this was the perfect location for the competition we were in town to see a show,4
8541,i was disappointed that the bathroom was not as clean as i would have hoped,4
8542,it had a good size room and large bathroom,4
8543,the staff were helpful and the location was just perfect,4
8544,parking in the hotel lot is difficult but there are two shuttles nearby that can take you straight there,4
8545,then it was another 20 minutes or so from two nice beaches,4
8546,this is a good hotel and we would definitely stay here again,4
8547,they consulted with their managers and we were told that all tables were saved for those with reservations,4
8548,when we got to our room to our room and there were no parking spots and had to park out on the sketchy street,4
8549,this hotel is decorated very nicely and our room hadn't been cleaned yet,4
8550,we stayed one night and were very happy with the accomodations,4
8551,the a c unit rattled off and on all day on the history channel,4
8552,but they are very expensive compared to very good restaurants nearby but it is a nice hotel and a good hotel,4
8553,it's a decent hotel for the money but be warned the beds are very comfortable,4
8554,staff is very nice and the rooms were clean and even had a shuttle to and from pier,4
8555,went on to stay at the sea view,4
8556,i have been staying at this place every time we are in the area do consider this hotel,4
8557,other hotels we have stayed at this hotel the next time because we were able to get more easily from the concierge,4
8558,it is also within walking distance to the main street that runs through old town alexandria,4
8559,the lobby was tiny but the service was great the room was comfortable functional and very clean,4
8560,the buffet is a good price and the food was great and the location was ideal because it was right off the lobby,4
8561,i had a great experience here from the minute we checked in until we checked out and they let me right in,4
8562,our room was small but had everything i needed,4
8563,overall a nice stay with the exception of an balcony smoker the hotel clean quiet and comfortable with a large clean room and helpful staff,4
8564,a word of caution for those who are just passing through,4
8565,you can request a form to fill out at the front desk at the restaurant and the van driver were excellent,4
8566,great cheap deal on hotels dot com and a lot nicer than other mid-way places where i have stayed,4
8567,the hotel was quiet which is very nice the spa is fantastic and the food was good,4
8568,they were very acomadating and let us check in early and that was a plus,4
8569,the rooms have a full size kitchen and living room area separate bath,4
8570,the candlewood suites was clean and the breakfast had a variety of choices,4
8571,overall i loved the old charm of the hotel and that it was close to a wedding ceremony we were attending,4
8572,upon arriving at the reception we had to say goodbye we felt so welcomed,4
8573,the room was clean it did have a fantastic view from the balcony it was spectacular,4
8574,it costs 25 dollars and change a day to park at the hotel there's no reason to drive anymore on your visit,4
8575,also the rest of the trip because everything is in walking distance from where i had to be,4
8576,also the fan in the bathroom had a urine smell that i couldn't get comfortable,4
8577,the maid service was terrific and the best part for us was the hotel's proximity to the train tracks,4
8578,if you are a dog lover this is a great spot in santa barbara,4
8579,their price was higher than listed but the front desk did not give us any information such as where the pool is located,4
8580,there was one thing that could use some additional improvements to bathroom,4
8581,the fan setting on the air unit did not work very well there either,4
8582,the room was very comfortable and the rooms are very,4
8583,we stayed for two days and went to nearby restaurant for several dinners,4
8584,best part about the room we were given the shower did not work,4
8585,the panera is very close however about a 2-3 hour period one of the families checked out,4
8586,the sweet woman at the front desk was very helpful,4
8587,no hot food at all but they did have milk that was warm from being left out,4
8588,there were a few dining options within walking distance including lounge bar at holiday inn which was fine,4
8589,the room was nice and very conveniently located,4
8590,she went out of her way to help me find a taxi to where i was going,4
8591,that was the only complaint i would have would be that the breakfast was low out of a lot of small businesses,4
8592,we stayed in a king room that was nicely decorated and at an at home feel to it,4
8593,if you're headed downtown i guess it's a really good option at this price point near the airport,4
8594,although by the airport you really didn't hear any traffic being on the first floor,4
8595,the staff was excellent and the room was clean and hotel was quiet,4
8596,wish we got to use the pool and enjoy breakfast,4
8597,the gentleman that registered me asked if i would like a handicap room though,4
8598,overnight stay in anaheim to visit with an old friend exercise room was fine,4
8599,breakfast service was pleasing with good selection of hot and cold items to meet everyone's needs,4
8600,we had a very pleasant stay convenient to everything in that area,4
8601,this hotel was not luxurious at all but the staff went above and beyond for us with our disneyland trip,4
8602,my dad and i were on our way to south carolina,4
8603,it was difficult to get the luggage cart from the parking lot could see into our room,4
8604,a nice clean hotel with friendly staff and an easy place to stay and this la quinta fit the bill,4
8605,the one recommendation i have for the hotel is to disneyland the higher the price and the simple breakfast was pleasant and the room is,4
8606,that would be a second choice but i still wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in the room then its perfect,4
8607,they can accommodate a family of 5 and need ample space and a comfortable bed,4
8608,overall a good room for a good value look no further,4
8609,easy walk to lots of shopping and dining options,4
8610,i don't usually stay at hiltons but the room was nice large and very clean,4
8611,great value and a nice place to stay while you wait to go home or to your cruise,4
8612,the cabin was very clean and nicely appointed,4
8613,hotel price was just right and there is a ramp up to the second floor which is convenient,4
8614,we emailed the hotel and upon arrival at the holiday inn,4
8615,we stayed in this hotel a couple of times when working in the area,4
8616,it is clean and comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was a bit light on,4
8617,nice hotel and a easy drive to the beach the gorge or downtown,4
8618,when i first posted a review the hotel was going through some remodeling by the stacks of sofa beds outside,4
8619,it's was snowing and extremely cold out heat in the room or wi-if access,4
8620,the area is beautiful and the restaurants were close and many to choose from,4
8621,nothing fancy but for the price it was very good maybe the best hotel i had in weeks,4
8622,cliffrose is not really impressive looking from the road the bldg looked closed,4
8623,room was clean and bigger than most hotel rooms bathroom was clean and had plenty of room for pups to be comfortable,4
8624,at first sight was a little taken aback as it looked like it was located in a convenient area for old town area of alexandria,4
8625,not a big deal but i wish they had signs near the food telling you the options,4
8626,this hotel was nice and close to the campus as well as the cruise and catalina boat terminals,4
8627,the train stop is across for the hotel so you don't have all the network channels presumably b c it was directtv,4
8628,good place to stay clean and good value the only downside was the toilet would not flush correctly not enough water pressure,4
8629,so go ahead and stay here it a nice hotel but not the one i had booked,4
8630,the lobby was in the process of upgrading to king beds,4
8631,it is not fancy like the big hotels but for the price a room with 2 beds which were full size and not queens,4
8632,the rooms are not very big the furniture is old but the room had a microwave and frig,4
8633,the lodge has a great location and all of the staff was very nice and comfortable with a large clean room and helpful staff,4
8634,drive past the entrance of the hotel at all times,4
8635,we are cheap but fussy if you want to view the harbor the coronado bridge and the pt,4
8636,the basketball court on the grounds was a hit with the kids of all ages,4
8637,the hotel is downtown so the fact that the a c controlled by the hotel,4
8638,when we are together it's convenient to where we're going comfortable in good condition with good amenities,4
8639,the freezer wasn't cold enough and it was a great place to stay,4
8640,it is an excellent place for the money better than a room 30 more,4
8641,the rooms were clean and the location was very convenient,4
8642,a little dust of the ceiling in cooling unit but other than that there is nothing country about it,4
8643,i was very surprised how nice big the room was when i arrived,4
8644,rooms aren't the best soundproofed and it is the mid-level of the kimptons in alexandria,4
8645,and money wise on the other hand had a problem with any of our reservations,4

9020,customer service every time i go to hartford,4
9021,it was close to the miller ferry and not too far from the major highways and there are plenty of places to walk them,4
9022,also i was not a fan of staying in the city,4
9023,one the hotel would be in good condition and recetly remodeled,4

9042,front desk was ok but could be improved,4
9043,all in all i enjoyed my stay and thought i got a great deal on groupon,4
9044,secure parking while you are at sea and a shuttle to and from the airport and the air force base,4
9045,a large undercover car park was handy for us to park our bikes under the overhand to help keep them somewhat dry,4
9046,this is the perfect hotel for me because it is convenient to other transportation if we had wanted to see the atlantic,4

9432,last time i was on the third floor and he found us one,4
9433,plenty of towels in the pool area which includes a,4
9434,the only complain i have is that the pool which was warm and inviting offering clean rooms and ample areas to mingle or rest,4
9435,i stayed on a tuesday night and there was plenty of staff around to guide you through,4
9436,the front desk employees had been informed and was able to have a great stay almost as if we were given preferential treatment by everyone,4
9437,but chlorine was very strong could only handle a few minutes in a taxi to the main promenade,4
9438,they had a fire and we had to use the stairs,4

9448,after we ordered what we wanted and went to the room and it took hours to cool down,4
9449,the room was clean with the exception of using the hotel's pool,4
9450,the morning staff however took minutes to get to the heart of the french quarter this hotel offers lots of charm and friendly staff,4
9451,the neighborhood is quiet there are no residential neighborhoods right next to the gondola and in the heart of boston,4
9452,it is within walking distance of plenty of boutique shops bars and restaurants no matter if you walk to the right or left,4
9453,they only open up half of the restaurant and you had to really shove it to clear the commode,4
9454,this is a hopping hotel but it was enough for a few nights,4
9455,i purchased bathroom spray with bleach and a couple of hooks and this problem is solved,4
9456,it was in a perfect location walking distance to so much,4
9457,we encountered two staff personal and both were fabulous going above and beyond his normal routine was very appreciated,4

9461,there is a large theater complex very close by and plenty of food choices in the hotel or nearby,4
9462,as a disabled person i frequently take sponge baths at the bathroom sink but everything was clean and comfortable lounge chair wasn't fantastic,4
9463,my only complaint is that the air conditioner in the rooms,4

9465,worked out ok when visiting our son family in north chicago,4
9466,it was a great room for the value,4
9467,if you have to stay here i would recommend to eat at the millers ale house in front of the hotel,4
9468,overall it wasn't a huge deal,4
9469,the room was clean and there was a good variety plus fresh fruit,4
9470,directly across the road from the reilroad museum,4
9471,it is quiet very clean staff is friendly and breakfast is beyond adequate with a good variety of hot and cold choices,4
9472,the only reason for the 3 rating on the staff was due to the construction but it was not ada complaint,4
9473,the breakfast was okay met our need for the morning and the coffee was exceptionally good even took a cup to go,4
9474,it felt like my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights in town for a funeral,4

9482,always an easy check in and convenient location,4
9483,nice hotel and very good staff at the front desk always friendly and happy to help,4
9484,you can't go around it so you have to pay a little extra for the breakfast deal,4
9485,we travel quite a bit and this hotel was one of many to choose from,4
9486,would definitely stay there again if i was on the 4th floor large and clean,4
9487,we received complimentary breakfast coupons and the breakfast was good although it would have been a nice addendum to the menu,4
9488,if you want a mini refrigerator you have to pay 30 us dollars the all inclusive will not cover nice diners,4
9489,but it seems like in alexandria va it would be good to have another blanket if possible,4
9490,room was clean pool area was nice and service was fabulous,4
9491,great king bed and fully functional air conditioner just as nice as the picture on the website made it look,4
9492,i am a big person and bathrooms are usually uncomfortable and this one was just as good as any other,4

9504,and though the breakfast room is very nice and seems to have been recently painted,4
9505,we stayed because we were visiting from fresno,4
9506,i really like the location of this hotel and some of the nearby restaurants,4
9507,it's nothing fancy but if you're looking for a clean inexpensive stay on our way to savannah,4
9508,we enjoyed our stay as we didn't have surprise extra charges,4
9509,we were on the 3rd floor on fillmore to get a view of the lake through the trees,4
9510,the rooms are big and clean with fridge and microwave and a corner table and chairs,4
9511,a c was not cooling the way it should be i do hot tubs not pools,4

9513,which was fine until we checked out had a very nice window seat,4
9514,we had dinner at the restaurant was excellent,4
9515,our room was on the second floor above the camping showers so we did not use its restaurant,4
9516,just out of the chaos of memorial day holiday but on beach and close to the beach and we certainly got a lovely view,4
9517,and though the breakfast room is very nice,4
9518,i don't have a car there is free parking so quite,4
9519,my first impression of the hotel was not nearly as nice as the picture on the site did not match the room we received,4
9520,i would have loved more choices for breakfast but we got a nice quiet night of sleep,4
9521,would definitely go back for a quick getaway,4
9522,fantastic views from the balcony rooms are very well laid out,4
9523,only complaint was the pull out sofa and said it,4
9524,the gentleman that registered me asked if i would like a better thermostat or better direction,4
9525,stayed at hotel deca for two nights while exterminators tented the residence,4
9526,due to our flight have a long lay over we had to stay in a place i hoped,4
9527,one minor problem i had was that i couldn't because i was not 21,4
9528,plenty of eateries to choose from and very cheap and delicious,4
9529,technically it was but it was so hard to find the entrance and the elevators were confusing but otherwise a great place,4
9530,maybe they're on one floor i don't know but when u get up there there is nothing to complain about,4

9539,it was a nice quiet room when we were in the back of the bathroom door otherwise the room was good sized clean and quiet,4
9540,this hotel was all that was expected for an inexpensive place to stay while on a long trip,4
9541,for a one-night stay in st,4
9542,the hotel is easy to find and very close to the beach walking across the street to eat was very nice,4
9543,we loved our room the breakfast the ambiance of the courtyard and a bit of wallpaper in the bathroom was a little small,4
9544,however for the price and the location for a short stay close to all,4
9545,high desert motel is an older property but it is very clean and comfortable,4
9546,this hotel is a good value in the napa area,4

9573,great location just 5 min from matin train station easy to walk to the french quarter and the staff was very friendly and helpful,4
9574,room is too warm and we couldn't shake the feeling for a while,4
9575,breakfast was excellent and the room was quiet,4
9576,i didn't do the breakfast or anything so i can't compare to the competition though,4

9578,have stayed before and will stay again because of the service he performed and the easy transportation to and from,4
9579,i stayed one night in this hotel while visiting relatives recently,4
9580,a little dated but adequate and comfortable and the price was very reasonable,4
9581,as usual i found my room to be nice and respect others around them will be back,4
9582,and there is a lot around this hotel the staff is rude and rooms are dirty,4
9583,we were late getting there the first morning and was told they don't do late check out,4
9584,we loved our stay at the hotel over memorial day weekend,4

9594,the restaurant next door was good and staff were very friendly and accommodating i would not change a thing,4
9595,it did include a microwave and mini frig which was a nice touch compared to the chilly weather outside,4
9596,i have been staying here on business for 4 weeks and would definitely stay there again,4
9597,i loved the kitchenette and the pool was lovely as was the hot tub was out of order,4
9598,it was packed when we checked in it was kind of annoying,4
9599,hallways smell a bit rooms are nice and very clean including the jacuzzi tub,4
9600,it was nice but the king bed in my room was low and i was moved to another room,4
9601,the hotel was fine but it was a weekend get away,4
9602,we went back to the desk to tell her that it was not what we expected since most resorts are high price low quality,4
9603,my flight was canceled and i was able to hear a little bit of an older building,4
9604,the service was really good we found the food much better in the restaurants there,4
9605,hotel is next to a busy road with limited parking on the other side of marina view towards the marine centre,4
9606,i paid 113 a night for a hotel you can get in the area,4
9607,actually was only in the room to plug in various devices,4

9610,they offered fresh baked cookies upon arrival and the hotel had everything i needed including a clean and comfortable room,4
9611,very friendly and accommodating and the breakfast was exceptional for being,4
9612,pillows are half the size of regular pillows but they give you a pass for a gold's gym several blocks away,4
9613,the good the hotel has a great friendly staff clean rooms and facilities near the freway but still quiet,4
9614,visiting for the first time in a long time as we didn't know when we would,4
9615,that eliminates having to hunt for a place to sleep but not much else,4
9616,the next morning we had breakfast which was better than most and even though the hotel is located very close to shopping and restaurants,4
9617,everything appeared clean and the room was clean and very basic,4
9618,yes we had a garden tub in the room would be like but it was very convenient,4
9619,everything is lovely except no one came to clean the room but wanted all of us to be out,4
9620,this is not the best place but cheap,4
9621,we only stayed for one night but was wowed by the hotel itself,4

9625,next to a mall but really not much to do around the hotel i,4
9626,i had an excellent experience at this hotel was a good value for what you need it for,4
9627,the owner and her staff were very friendly and even offered a small breakfast in the morning,4
9628,the only thing we were not a fan of staying in the city,4
9629,the area is mostly offices so it was quiet and not far from downtown,4
9630,newly remodeled rooms are in great shape including the bathrooms,4
9631,there were teenagers also staying there and the front desk was very pleasant and helpful,4
9632,a large undercover car park was handy for us to park our bikes under the overhand to help keep them somewhat dry,4
9633,we'd certainly have asked for this to be replaced if we had not called the motel our room would have been a good stay,4
9634,anyways this is a very nice hotel in a fine area,4
9635,a few cons the housekeeping folks were a bit noisy and the staff good have watched the breakfast area a little better,4
9636,all in all we will return when we have more time so we can check out the pool and spa facilities,4
9637,we stopped for one night on our way to our rented vacation home,4
9638,me my husband and 5 yr old stayed 2 nights for business travel rooms are nice bed was very comfortable and quiet,4
9639,we enjoyed the hotel and it was just a quick walk next door to dinner,4
9640,the other half of the room was clean but was not what i previously experienced from other marriott family hotrls was disappointed,4
9641,even though i was there for business and didn't need to stop by the resort,4
9642,my biggest complaint is that the walls are a little too thin making it very easy to prep and get to the slopes,4
9643,cleaner opened room door twice without any permision when we were in the parking lot of the hotel which was very convenient,4
9644,the rooms were smaller than i expected but it was nice,4
9645,i was surprised that the room did not suit his needs,4
9646,overall a good room for the money clean and a good 4 star all around,4
9647,i didn't use the pool but it looked very nice,4
9648,we accidentally left a laptop charger in the room but the bed was comfortable,4
9649,new carpet in hallways so it looks like they saved costs by skimping out on new bathtubs,4
9650,other than they ran out of yogurt etc,4
9651,the breakfast was not that great either but just dealt with it cause the hotel was booked with families with children,4
9652,the staff as the case with every hampton inn i've stayed in about 6 hotels in the area and walk around,4
9653,if there was more than just the one bar in the hotel if you rented a car,4
9654,on this stay i booked two rooms through a third party based on previous reviews and my loyalty to the hilton hampton brand,4
9655,neither room was as clean as the big name hotels in the area and came across fairfield inn,4
9656,room was clean and nicely decorated and the staff was friendly and generally the room was clean and we had a restful night,4
9657,typical motel breakfast in the mornings was good,4
9658,our stay was great and the location is excellent,4
9659,i booked this hotel because of its location a 5 minute walk from pikes place,4
9660,however due to the fact that we needed to have a roll away bed for our 12 year old son,4
9661,i felt like it was a nice stay the facilities were clean functional and tidy,4
9662,breakfast was served from 6:30am 9:30am and had a very attractive updated decor and was pet-friendly,4
9663,this hotel is close to everything and price is right,4
9664,i went straight to reception and asked for a change on the arrival date,4
9665,should have gotten the room we reserved was given away but the staff made sure we had a room with balcony and an ocean view,4
9666,check-in was very fast and was also delicious,4
9667,i booked a room with a hot tub,4
9668,staff went out of their way to make everything as comfortable as possible and the breakfast was good as usual,4

9670,it would also be nice to have a luggage cart,4
9671,staff is very nice and the room was a good size and the hot tub was relaxing,4
9672,when i arrived megan and lexie at the front desk was beyond helpful and accommodating,4
9673,only a couple of issues with our room or stay,4
9674,multiple apologies and they came as soon as we mentioned them and then fixed the following morning,4
9675,it is a great place to stay in south beach,4
9676,the courtyard was nice and lush and the pool and the recreational area are all in one big room,4
9677,it was exactly what we needed for our little schnauzer,4
9678,for a single night and this was a quality room for the price,4
9679,very short stay but the hotel was great for a swim after dinner,4
9680,this hotel is very close to shopping and the wine train,4
9681,first time at a comfort inn will stay again in the area i would stay here again and recommend this hotel,4
9682,yes there is construction off the freeway exit but i had no problems with 1st ir second floors at earlier stays,4
9683,i'm sure it's nice if you're looking for someplace clean and inexpensive around seaside and monterey,4
9684,i read somewhere that there is a good breakfast and fresh coffee,4
9685,it's an old-fashioned feel the rooms open onto the parking lot and we were very happy with them,4
9686,the staff and the room were fine but the hotel staff were unable to provide and do so with a friendly smile and greeting,4
9687,go there if you want to get away,4
9688,we stayed here on the way to pennsylvannia,4
9689,nice place to stay and in a very affluent area,4
9690,also i did not have a dog smell,4

9693,overall a good bb experience and i would definitely stay here again just to sleep,4
9694,the rooms are clean and a good location but the rooms are clean with comfortable beds,4
9695,each room is a little dated looking from the architecture but the rooms were very clean and food and bar service very good,4
9696,that said i would stay there again due to the early checkout,4
9697,the view from our balcony was superb and we enjoyed the breakfasts and the bar so our holiday was not totally spoilt,4
9698,also the room did not have a phone,4
9699,groundskeeping was nice and while it was a bit tight in space throughout the room,4
9700,it has been years since i've stayed in much more luxurious accommodations for half the price and twice the choice,4
9701,with the help of my husband and brother-in-law in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite,4
9702,we loved that it was a long way from the airport and to and from the cruise,4
9703,you can request a form to fill out at the front desk was very helpful in getting me another room on short notice,4
9704,the concierge we spoke to sent us to a restaurant that was easy to walk to even with my luggage,4

9708,after a long fast disney we were pleased to find a spacious comfortable and,4
9709,gas station convenience store just across the street and that was a plus,4
9710,with that being said we won't stay here again if in the area,4
9711,overall it was worth it however they really do allow dogs and there were plenty of options for groceries restaurants and attractions in the area,4
9712,the bottom of the tub in the bathroom was leaking we were moved to a better room quickly,4

9717,a typical hotel with lovely stone details in the rooms and in the hallways until after 4 am,4
9718,we visited in summer the access to the metro using the alexandria trolley,4
9719,empty brandy bottle under one of the beds had small and worn out holes,4
9720,the hotel is a nice place to stay for me but i had no problems and did not feel uneasy there,4
9721,within a couple of blocks away from the main street due to noise and foot traffic,4
9722,the lobby smelled like smoke but our room was four doors down from the swimming pool entrance,4

9730,we didn't stay at the hotel again,4
9731,the staff was very courteous from the front desk to the room to the bar restaurant,4
9732,a train went through several times during the nights i was there,4
9733,i am not sure that we would stay here again on any trips along this route,4
9734,aside from the ants the room was comfortable clean and quiet,4

9741,the staff is always very friendly and helpful with parking restaurants and directions,4
9742,gave me the choice of what floor i wanted which is always a better setting than those with the air and,4
9743,she was not knowledgeable at all and she gave me a spray that didn't help at all,4
9744,this was the case both at check in and the next morning more tip solicitation with cold hash browns served,4
9745,stayed for 4 days with our 2 dogs border collie lab mix,4
9746,2 days later we left the room i was greeted by a young lady named jessica the front desk which was great,4
9747,and with the size of the bathrooms the staff the pool and the included breakfast had many options,4

9757,this was a very nice stay for the one night,4
9758,the restaurant is clean and they serve a tasty breakfast buffet,4
9759,i would come back again because of the location and easy walk to downtown and the wharf,4
9760,everyday my wife and i booked this location at the last minute for our 5 night 4 day stay at your hotel,4
9761,hotel is being renovated but overall a good stay and i would go back,4
9762,you could not pay me to stay here again when my back is healthy,4
9763,hotel was clean staff friendly and location is off the main road and close to places to eat,4
9764,there was a large group of students but it didn't seem like other people were smoking so that's good,4
9765,as another reviewer noted there is an odor in the lobby and others were taking food to their rooms,4
9766,the minifridge is a bit too small and you need to get up early to enjoy the breakfast because the food went fast,4
9767,for one nights stay this hotel was nice and the location was just perfect,4
9768,they did give us another room and all was well,4
9769,the hotel itself is very modern and clean,4
9770,the hotel is very nice and quaint i think they need to update their pictures on advertising this hotel,4
9771,they comped me on my stay and gave me a headache that was something i needed to be,4
9772,room was clean pool area was nice and the kids really enjoyed the pool area,4
9773,really the only thing that was a bummer is that they charged me 164 when i left,4
9774,it is clean and it is located in the saginaw bay city area,4
9775,i am sure it was an easy check in and the entire front desk crew were incredible,4
9776,the only disapointing thing was the lack of fruit on the breakfast menu sausage eggs and you can make a waffle,4
9777,we got there early and there were no towels in the room,4
9778,only minor drawback was the mediocre food in the restaurant was unable to keep the orders straight at our table,4
9779,the room was extremely small and there was a charge for parking your car at the hotel and the staff could be rated as excellent,4
9780,there are only three floors so it was easy and comfortable for our family,4
9781,there is enough space in the room to plug in various devices,4
9782,jayakarta hotel is a great value clean good wifi coffee pastry in the am and complimentary wine in the pm,4
9783,i asked for advice on the best pizza delivery in the area and the close proximity to the airport,4

9785,i would give this property a 5 rating,4

9787,this condo is very close to the airport with a free shuttle provided,4
9788,one the hotel would be in good condition and desk staff were very friendly,4
9789,one of our biggest disappointments was the size of the room n how it separates the bedroom,4
9790,i would certainly stay here again because they were not able to accommodate us which was great,4
9791,customer service was also good the front desk people were very friendly and accommodating i would not change a hotel because of the indoor pool,4
9792,the third floor is the smoking floor and you can tell they work to keep it clean,4
9793,my only issue was i put the key card in the wrong room door and the window and let it air out,4
9794,my son looked at me walking to our room the floors were wet and slippery,4
9795,we found that the service was very good the rooms were nice bedding was a little worn but okay,4
9796,the first night our room faced the back parking lot which is built like a sun deck,4
9797,the 1 bedroom suite was great with a wide variery of hot and cold food fruit cerials etc,4
9798,great blue color on the outside of the building looks a little dingy,4
9799,except my room wasn't ready at 5:30 when i got there family pool was not working,4
9800,there is easy access to whatever you want to prepare to eat,4
9801,thanks we enjoyed our stay and was very impressed with how clean and quiet my room was,4
9802,stayed for 8 nights in a suite with a separate bedroom,4
9803,i went to the front desk and throughout the hotel,4
9804,i picked a room with a balcony overlooking the water where two swans hung-out,4
9805,the wi-fi worked fine for us but i know it's hard work and not appreciated by many,4
9806,but the staff care was great the rooms have been remodeled and look great,4
9807,staff were very friendly helpful and efficient,4
9808,despite this it was very quiet the bed was nice,4
9809,or room was clean the shower bathroom was clean the room carpet worn but that's typical at most motels anyway,4
9810,it was walking distance to several places to eat and things to see she was always cheerful upbeat made stay,4
9811,we were traveling and this was just an over night stay for us as we discovered cool places to have brunch,4
9812,the rooms are a bit dated but the staff is very knowledgeable the breakfast is fresh and better than most hampton inns,4
9813,breakfast was good and the desk was very professional and personal,4
9814,clean room friendly staff and a great location in downtown,4
9815,there was a small hole in one wall the sheets on the bed comforter sandwiched between two sheets in the closet,4
9816,i have a review of the trip i took in 2014 and i don't think i would stay here again if in the area,4
9817,it almost looked like it had recently been re-carpeted painted etc,4
9818,the bed is getting close to the end of serving time the was little hot food still available,4
9819,the breakfast was not fancy but was a great value for the price and convenience quite nice,4
9820,breakfast staff made sure we had 2 beds,4
9821,this was in the middle of no where,4
9822,i don't know why there is no kettle all our party did not care for the coffee we thought it bitter,4
9823,continental breakfast had lots of food options around,4
9824,and the pool was a hit with some of the other restaurants in the area,4
9825,also the wifi wasn't working for one day and that there was no hot tub just a pool,4
9826,this condo is very close to the end of serving time the was little hot food still available,4
9827,hotel was just as expected for the price nothing fancy but clean roomy comfortable and in a convenient location for us so we chose it,4
9828,very helpful and i think he actually cared that we had a vehicle there is a charge of 10 per child per hour,4
9829,there is a very impressive pool area with giant slide but i did not use the pool although it did look inviting,4
9830,only bad things are it's a little further off i95 than preferred,4
9831,our only complaint was that the service was very good and much appreciated each morning,4
9832,this was a very comfortable stay room was good size clean and comfortable,4
9833,the food was very beautiful and most of the night,4
9834,problem with first room was taken care of i even called,4
9835,i was also very impressed with this same manager of the hotel personally thanked me for the stay and was gracious,4
9836,the hotel had a lot of occupants at the time of our stay but it did not keep us from sleeping,4
9837,it's was snowing and extremely cold out heat in the room or the fact that they don't have a workout room,4
9838,we usually like americinns and this one was just as good as most of the other local places nearby,4
9839,double bed in my room was beautiful,4
9840,in addition the high desert motel location is very convenient a block from chestnut street which is the main reason,4
9841,not the newest laquinta i've ever stayed in but it was clean comfortable and well maintained,4
9842,stayed for 2 days great customer service and very accommodating comfortable rooms,4
9843,this is a nice hotel and a easy drive to the beach the gorge or downtown,4
9844,problem with first room was taken care of i even called,4
9845,from what i can tell it's about as good as it could have been bigger imo but it did the job,4
9846,we visited hershey chocolate world and this place is not a luxury hotel nor do i think they claimed to be,4
9847,the hotel did offer to move us and gave us coupons for free breakfast at the mc donald's next door,4
9848,the beds were comfy and we liked the fact that it included breakfast it was excellent value,4
9849,convenient to the expressway but farenough away so that you don't have to include that but it's just,4
9850,we were on the 3rd floor and no issues at all except breakfast could have been better,4
9851,the room needed more attention stains on the wall near the tub but the bathroom was clean with a frig microwave,4
9852,on an upside very dog friendly and supposedly the people next door had their pool open,4
9853,the hotel was clean and staff were very friendly and accommodating,4
9854,we stayed at this hotel when we play there again,4
9855,the main positive feature of this hotel is that they nickel and dime you for everything,4
9856,we liked this place because it fit our budget and the location is close to restaurants and grocery store,4
9857,room was small but clean and well-appointed than your average bb,4
9858,was here for a convention and never had to leave the pool area with a special area just for them,4
9859,first time at a bw plus and we were pleasantly surprised to find the lovely town of dahlonega,4
9860,was easy to find and walking distance to everything we wanted to do and inexpensive,4
9861,i really liked the room we had was quiet and was able to get into our room key cards wouldn't work the accommodations were,4
9862,i didn't know until i arrived in my room that i needed was perfect for my weekend needs,4
9863,great hotel with very spacious rooms a nice bar and nice rooms so you never have to leave the resort,4
9864,all of the staff were friendly and helpful and extras were quite nice,4
9865,room was not ready until an hour and a half complete with hot food,4
9866,king size bed was very comfortable with a great price location,4
9867,coffee was not stocked and the bathroom amenities looked as if they might be adding an outside bar area,4
9868,everything was nice and the bathroom was as well,4
9869,the muni local bus bus stop is right out the entrance,4
9870,if you are a single lady it's a bit like a conference venue but we would certainly stay again,4
9871,good location for my purposes not to far from the airport which makes it very convenient for business a little away from the city,4
9872,it's easy to reach the hotel and to get back to cable-a bit annoying,4
9873,an excellent value in a choice location very convenient to some great restaurants right on the harbor,4
