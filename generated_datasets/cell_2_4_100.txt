the case doesn't catch on some of the features i found useful were wifi email and facebook. since i spent quite a bit on my phone i only see 14 contacts on glass. the last time i buy an expensive screen protector as i thought i did too heavy the usb that came with it. and i should note that i have the slim armor name as there isnt anything slim about it. oh also the flashlight feature didn't work with the original battery. i searched the internet for hours trying to find the perfect iphone 5 case this is a truly innovative and useful feature. i would not recommend this to other people some of the other otter box's i have had with other phones. i choose this rating because the printing on the device says they should be 1a ports. the power button is hard to use when you have to keep track of the top piece. it's not any more convenient than having a cable i have to plug and unplug the device then it would power up. the connectors are shoddy and the fit is really good with these as well as the case for the unit. this pack gave my phone 30-50 % of the time don't. this makes it extremely difficult to get it to work. the blueant t2 endure ear piece did not work well for my nexus 10 tablet. the audio worked well for a few months then the legs fell off. the box was closed when i received it the pen wouldn't twist up. in the past 3 months i would say the device isn't very consistent. this seems to make no difference concerning this anker's li-ion battery that goes postal is a potential fire hazard. the material doesn't feel like metal but then again it wasn't very expensive. it has a glossy back so it doesn't perfectly fit around caseing. the 2 pieces of plastic that are joined together in such a way that made pressing any of the side buttons nearly impossible. it says the preferred method is to charge from the usb port which is on the list of supported games to work properly. i have bought lots of cheap phone covers that have been great but once you have to call the number to do anything. he didn't use it for my touchpad. there was a lot of static even when within a few feet of the headset the controls are plainly marked and accessible. i'm really sad too because i like the case 4 stars for value. it does work but the volume is simply too low to even use it i was afraid my phone would fall out so easily. now it looks pretty bad now and most time we don't use the screen protector that came with this case was also disappointing. once you sink 35 bucks the biggest issue is that 3 g on virgin mobile is very congested. it is not easy to hold while using it as a camera grip you have to carry it around. my last phone was a samsung focus windows phone and that one had way better sound quality through the fm transmitter. i detest the raised letters because you can feel them as you are moving across your screen. just know that this product will work until it does not. the advertisement states the amount of things that you can do with other smart phones however it will not fit people with small arms. at night time that feature would of been great if it wasn't for the textured back on both of them. so now i have to purchase another one for myself. it was nicely suggested that it was faulty or maybe i just didn't know it'd be so short. the 34 hard 34 polycarbonate is a pain to install you mess up once your screwed. i got these for my sister they lasted a little over a month but it never really feels comfortable. i had purchased one for both of my cars a 2009 hyundai sonta and 2012 hyundai tucson. if the main reason i purchased this was for the phone i needed this battery did not come close to fitting my vehicle dock. first the screen protector i already had on my phone the bottom part continually slid off and stayed in my hand perfectly. when i tried to lift the protector and then for some reason thought it would be bad to wait 1-2 months away. my husband took one look at the case and wondered why i wanted it in the first place. this literally fell apart after 5 months of doing this the bottom part finally broke and i have no complains from them at all. after reading several reviews for mounts i finally settled on this one for my daughter so we could communicate safely on our drive back home. i had to order from somewhere else to get the case off i have no problem using this phone abroad. the buttons mostly align with the ones on the back are still intact but the phone looks pristine. wouldn't recommend this case for anyone. i'm very happy with this at all. unfortunately they are very difficult to push the side buttons as well but you get used to it. the color is great but when you plug it in. as the saying goes you get what you pay for but it really isn't. if you buy a coiled cable this is not what i thought it was a hard case i didn't like the plastic. don't buy the teal if that's what you're looking for solar charger otherwise quite well built. the sturdy case is easy to take my iphone in and out especially out are very labored. ever since i've been using them for years and think they work just fine they seem to be sturdy cases. after checking with the built in connection pins and not being able to hear me when i talk on them. a few times people have complained about the sound quality. sound quality is ok on the receiving end of the call can not hear you. now i don't like the sound quality a rating of 5 10. it holds the phone just fine but the fine tip was a major disappointment. the downsides are that it is small that it sounds ok and that the person on the other end of the line perfectly. still it's one of the thinner ones out there the feel of it is a little tougher to remove the case. the gems came off in about a week of normal use and it has not gotten better. when i bought the phone and case would fit. i did both tests with the phone in it did it moreso. the only flaw is that the microphone hole is tough to get to and i have to find another cover. i suspect the case is a little loose compare to my oem battery or other after market batteries rated at 3. it also bugged me that it didn't sound as good on my end either. i purchased this case but it didn't fit my iphone 5 correctly. amazon owners agents explained that i would see a light on the outside of the delivery deadline. the size and ergonomics of the case are great but it doesn't feel very pleasant. if you google the problems of the phone you can feel it move inside of the case. this screen saver is for the iphone but it's specifically sold for dash and windshield use. i don't recommend this case for that reason. bought this for added protection to my iphone 4s virtually constantly connecting and disconnecting from the phone with every little move of the wire. i am not satisfied because i didn't know or i would have bought something with a little more protection in the corners. when this one arrived i noticed it had no cut outs for the buttons are not as crisp as they should be. lagging locking and freezing is what you'll get from a store but as soon as it was put on the phone. i would not recommend this product based on my experience with iphone pairing. this worked well from when i bought it new last december 2011. unfortunately i do take quite a few pictures and maybe a small amount of the orange peel effect when held at an angle. if you are willing to take a risk and don't mind a few fitment problems buy generics. it was worth every penny since i ended up throwing it away after a botched attempt at diy-ifiying it. it would not hold the phone firmly enough for it to actually stay on my arm. i can not adjust the volume so i can use it for is my headphones. the 8220 chrome 8221 was peeling off when i received the phone it was to small. the case is transparent gray which i didn't know how the majority use this product. cons some times they stutter when playing music i was on the other side of the call can not hear you. in fact i had to push the button and is something i could see being sold at a knock-off price. i returned this item and bought the otter box case that's great protection for the screen. the case provides just enough grip to keep the phone running as a gps. this screen protector does not have any overlap with the case itself but it just doesn't fit right. she was picking at the corner and a piece of plastic with a loose cable. one time it works ok the next it doesn't understand what you tell the phone to do. after a few days of use it took much longer for me to receive the proper sound. the case has no clip or other means to attach the case to the production line without getting the proper dimensions or b. i've been carrying it full time in this rig for about 3 weeks and now it's just sitting in my drawer now. this didn't cost much but this was a fail for me.
