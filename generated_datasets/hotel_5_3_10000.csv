6702,also there was a basket of fresh cookies and milk,5
6703,stayed one night but it wasn't shut down for four hours between 10-2 or 2-6,5
6704,well it was far enough though that it was very convenient and one to our parked car,5

6714,being a traveling nurse i stay in a swanky modern style hotel as opposed to a chain,5

7515,this was my second time in this area,5
