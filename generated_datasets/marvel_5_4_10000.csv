39,here he was quite different from the other marvel cinematic universe films in my opinion,5
40,iron man was the perfect choice to play tony stark in this movie was tony starks,5
41,since this movie is connected to the other marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5

57,iron man got it right when it comes to movies the avengers is down as the greatest of all time in my opinion,5
58,this movie had to be 10 times as good as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
59,as the first part james gunn was in charged of the movie because of how much i didn't care about him,5

132,great and movie with great special effects and some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
133,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i hate is that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
134,this was a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
135,and it doesn't feels like a superhero movie but a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
136,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
137,they were as important as the rest of the crew have put into this film and that is shown in the trailer,5
138,do not judge me but in my opinion avengers age of ultron is action-packed entertaining and very surprising,5
139,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
140,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
141,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and they hit it out of the infinity war alive,5

159,the action through scarce is very well done and it completes the movie,5
160,the film is colorful and bombastic with its signature irreverent humor but it is also one of marvel's best films they have ever made,5

244,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
245,overall this movie is absolutely amazing and speaking for all of the complaints and it doesn't disappoint,5
246,if it was not for this film the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
247,the best marvel movie of all the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
248,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
249,to be more specific i think this is a perfect hulk film,5
250,with ice breaking out of the way we now have plenty of time to get the word out,5
251,the acting is very good and the visual effects are amazing and the direction is great,5
252,there's a special moment towards the end of the day it's ranked up there with the best of them,5
253,at the end of the avengers three years ago couldn't be topped in the avengers second outing at the end of the credits,5
254,yeah they change a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
255,i've got to give spider-man homecoming is a must-watch comic book movie i have seen,5

290,i saw it once and i will see in a lifetime,5
291,even if you are not maybe you won't be able to enjoy it as much as i disliked that many people died,5

384,i believe that this movie was one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
385,the only complaint i can think to give this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
386,this movie soooo much fun to watch when i went to watch this movie,5
387,following four years worth of movies building up for this film which makes it even more enjoyable,5
388,not as good as the first one but this film is the lack of an excellent super villain or a better final showdown,5
389,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
390,so good i went to see this movie over and over i'm so exited to watch the next one,5
391,i highly recommend amp look forward to the next one for sure,5

399,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
400,the avengers infinity war is an essential watch,5
401,the first film in the marvel franchise loki,5
402,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5
403,if you like superhero movies this is up there with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie of all time,5

405,with likable characters and an excellent story i believe infinity war is the best superheroes movie ever made,5
406,the villain loki in my opinion is one of the best movies i've ever gotten to see along with guardians of the galaxy vol,5
407,i enjoyed the banter between the avengers and loki's army being one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5

409,i think it is just a great movie,5
410,yondu now has one of the most fun films ever,5
411,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5

418,it's so much fun to watch when i went to see it on a whim,5
419,it's a little bit better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
420,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the credits could the second outing top the previous outing,5
421,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action scenes make this a must see,5
422,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the best movie i have ever seen this movie succeeds in every possible way,5
423,own it on blu-ray as well,5
424,the cast gave stupendous performances especially chris pratt zoe saldana bradley cooper vin diesel and dave bautista,5

621,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and that is shown in the cgi,5
622,highly recommend if you love marvel and spider-man final word karen best girl,5
623,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
624,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
625,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers,5
626,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
627,iron man started off the mcu to a perfect start with loads of action and great effects,5
628,everyone makes decent appearance and 2:20 movie duration is great and it made me feel the emotions that i was expecting from the movie,5
629,in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
630,the character development is great and the acting was stunning,5
631,definitely watch this if you're a fan of marvel and a fan of ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
632,fantastic movie with some of the teen slang and a willow smith song it may not be the best mcu movie ever,5
633,one of the best villains we've seen in any of the phase one solo marvel films,5
634,i was nervous going in to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
635,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
636,all these superhero films lead up to this and it was well deserved it did not disappoint,5
637,killmonger is the best villain we've seen yet from the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
638,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie is really great and i like it a lot,5
639,from the actors to the music this is by far the best marvel movie,5
640,this movie was so much better than the first one,5
641,the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe but in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the day,5
642,and the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
643,probably the movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy was a huge risk for marvel,5
644,also let's be honest this is the first and best film of marvel cinematic universe,5
645,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
646,now this was a fun superhero movie should be like,5
647,i just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
648,i know its not as good as the first if not better and can not wait for the next one,5
649,but unlike avengers assemble guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of great visual effect,5
650,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the avengers was for you,5
651,off the box its so much better then the first with a better villian and better visual effects,5
652,i thought this was better than the first one by 1 %,5
653,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
654,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
655,most people say that guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy,5
656,when i saw it for the first time in an mcu movie,5
657,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy was the best film of summer 2014,5
658,only bad things about the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
659,4 1 17after my fourth viewing of guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
660,iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man movie of all time you will not believe the ending,5
661,i loved it and it is quite possibly the best spiderman movie at of all of them and tom plays the best spiderman,5
662,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
663,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
664,superior to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
665,this has to be one of marvel's best films,5
666,i thought that this was one of the most entertaining movies ever made,5
667,the best thing about this movie it has been doing since 2016,5

672,jordan delivers some of the best cgi i have seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
673,great and movie with great special effects and robert downey jr,5
674,the new enemy of the guardians in this film is a step in the right direction through the response of fans and critics,5
675,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
676,made one of the greatest movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
677,this proves itself to be one of the best superhero movies ever,5
678,all in all this film is one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
679,the perfect spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5
680,it's the movie that started it all,5
681,i honestly love this movie more than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
682,also visually this is one of the best marvel films to date,5
683,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
684,all i need to say disney is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5
685,it's the kind of stuff that you would normally see spider-man in movies seems untouchable but is he really,5
686,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
687,director joss whedon said that there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
688,arguably the best marvel movie in the history of forever,5
689,ant-man is definitely one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
690,this is an amazing movie one of my all time faves,5
691,paul rudd who plays the main role of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
692,this is definitely one of my favorite marvel movies can not wait for part 2,5
693,ant-man does a good job in exceeding the expectations of the film fans,5
694,although only february black panther is my favorite superhero by far,5
695,i don't care what you say this is the greatest movie within the mcu,5
696,oh my god i can't wait for part 2,5
697,the motivations of the vulture are so clear and understanding as i get to see how the story progresses in a couple years,5
698,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene,5
699,really love this movie the characters are awesome the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
700,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee should be able to fly at all,5
701,much like john wick 2 i think this is the only good iron man movie at this point,5
702,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
703,then later in the third act of the movie is michael b,5
704,marvel studios has done it again the avengers age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
705,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
706,the movie was very good and more entertaining than i thought it was funny engaging interesting bad guys with real motivations,5
707,not only the one of the best avengers movie yet,5
708,it's one of the best marvel movies,5
709,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and the story is told perfectly,5
710,the mcu has officially proved itself as the best superhero movie i've seen to this day,5
711,i honestly don't want to miss it,5
712,it could even possibly be my favorite superhero movie and it is such a fun ride,5
713,it was so cool can't wait for ant man 2,5
714,yes the cgi work is very good and the visual effects are stunning,5
715,iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play an alien,5
716,i wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out to be funny well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
717,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
718,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel cinematic universe series of films in spectacular fashion,5
719,guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way and provides a realistic and challenging villain,5
720,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
721,this is far one of the best spider-man to date,5
722,i would say it is my favourite marvel movie what an experience this was in the cinema brilliant,5
723,so evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but love the talent in this movie,5
724,also the iron man situation with him quitting by the end of the day it's ranked up there with the best of them,5
725,the 2012 avengers is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
726,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5
727,maybe it's the fanboy in me but i love this film tied for my favorite with winter soldier and age of ultron,5

778,don't know how they pulled it off this was a really good way to set up the entire universe,5
779,the fact that it keeps you on the edge of my seat the entire time,5
780,barry i just got this huge tulip order and i can't wait for the 3rd film,5
781,while ant-man is hilarious action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
782,this film has done an excellent job in playing peter parker spider-man and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
783,everyone worked well but the main reason i liked this movie better than the first one by 1 %,5
784,there is also a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
785,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of the new character ghost,5
786,it definitely has a lot of smart moments,5
787,this really is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
788,that's when they try and work as a team and being able to save the world from mass destruction,5
789,an outstanding film and probably one of my favorite film franchises of all time,5
790,i love marvel but they did a good job with their performances in this film,5
791,if not the best tied for the best with spider-man 2 still the best spider-man,5
792,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man suit and this was a match made in heaven,5
793,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best marvel movie so far,5
794,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of the incredible hulk spawned the entire mcu,5
795,amazing better then the first by far can't wait for ant-man does a good job with this movie,5
796,i didn't see anything that i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
797,could not have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
798,it's a fresh new take and a little bit of bad language in this film,5
799,and the main reason why i think this is the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
800,even if your not a fan of the avengers this is a must see for iron man fans,5
801,outstanding story telling great action and did i mention the movie is hilarious,5
802,the best spider-man movie that is by far the best spiderman movie at of all of them and tom plays the best spiderman,5
803,it is a toss up for me which was the best movie ever i would watch it again and again and again,5
804,the casino scene reminded me a little bit of bad language in this film is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5
805,the special effects in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
806,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron ups the action and comedy is great and the acting was stunning,5
807,his boyish good looks have a bit of bad weather in new york,5
808,the action scenes reminded me a lot of iron-man and that's not a spoiler so shield can't redact that,5
809,in my opinion this is one of my favorite films of the year,5
810,iron man is definitely one of my favorites the fifth element,5
811,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is by far the best marvel comic book movie adaptation ever,5
812,in my opinion the best superhero movie ever with the possible exception of rdj as stark,5
813,do i even need to mention that the movie is another belter from marvel,5
814,as a marvel fan it was great but if you aren't a comic book fan so i might be biased,5
815,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
816,still one of the best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
817,it is a little bit of a love story comedy and a lot of great character interaction,5
818,to be more specific i think this is my favorite of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
819,ant-man does a good job at juggling each role,5
820,much like the first ant-man but this movie changed that,5
821,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
822,i was feeling a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
823,and let's talk about michael peã±a as luis makes for the best character in the mcu and this one is the best one ever,5
824,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is by far the best of the two,5
825,what sets this apart most importantly from the previous films and improves on all points from them,5
826,best movie ever want to see it the second time,5
827,great humor acting and storyline make this one of marvel's best films they have ever made,5
828,in most cases spider-man 3 x-men the last stand and the amazing spider-man 2 was released,5
829,i dare say it was the best mcu movie to date,5
830,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
831,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first time,5
832,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the overall experience at all,5
833,the perfect spider-man film to date,5
834,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
835,the avengers couldn't have been brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight,5
836,it's very fun to watch even though it was different story track,5
837,he is so charming and i can't wait to see more of,5
838,guardians is a triumph and a fresh take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5

844,it has a lot of humor and a bit of both,5
845,there's a special moment towards the end of the movie,5
846,i feel this one is so much better than the predictable war of infinity,5
847,love it can't wait for part 2,5
848,i think this is the best marvel and the best superhero movie i've seen in years,5
849,marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film,5
850,also he is belittled by tony constantly a fact that as a spider-man film that sticks to the comics,5
851,the spirit of the ant-man character was done great,5
852,one of my favorite movies of all time and is one of my favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a deeper message than expected,5
853,shuri delivered some funny lines but if you are a superhero movie fan or not because anyway is a very good marvel movie,5
854,named peter jason quill taken from said planet in 1988 after his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of all on his birthday,5
855,i don't know what some people's problem is with this movie it was awesome i'll get this on disc when i can,5
856,in a world of superheros villans and explosions comes guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
857,marvel's the avengers is the best thing ever except the mad titan thanos,5
858,the start of the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't seen it yet,5
859,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
860,this not only has everything you want and much much more,5
861,the special effects in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
862,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't want to put you out,5
863,was not a fan of the avengers this is a must see for everyone simply because it is an almost flawless movie,5
864,i just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
865,funny action-packed full of suspense one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man 2,5
866,the avengers is by far the best movie marvel ever released,5
867,josh brolin did amazing as the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5

871,i love that this movie is a good movie,5
872,if you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is a great comic book movie i have seen,5
873,i personally liked it better than the first ant man movie,5
874,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the superheroes even my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
875,i saw this movie because it was set in the space,5
876,however this was one of the best movies i've ever seen next to the dark knight's joker,5
877,black panther is actually one of my favorite movies of all time,5
878,yondu's character arc is one of the best mcu films yet,5
879,the cast was perfect for each of their parts and you will be at the edge of my seat,5
880,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
881,as i stated earlier in my opinion this is one of the best produced for any film and a must own by itself,5
882,everything was great about this the action was one of the best if not the best,5
883,and it's one connected to the rest of the crew have put into this cinematic universe,5
884,it was one of the best heist movies i have seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
885,the best thing about this movie it has been doing since 2016,5
886,the motivations of the vulture are so clear and understanding as i get to see how he excels at being a leading man,5
887,the characters are likeable the effects are outstanding the action is so mind-blowing some of the best thespians in the business,5
888,another great addition to the marvel movie family,5
889,stark's journey to put the suit together still stands as one of the best villains the mcu has ever seen,5
890,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
891,its a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
892,he is the perfect choice to play tony stark in this movie was tony starks,5
893,they were as important as the rest of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
894,the author resolves to family and how each of the characters to make this a perfectly enjoyable movie,5
895,this is by far the best superhero movie i've seen in a really long time,5
896,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is in less than two weeks,5
897,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
898,among one of the best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
899,the music fits the tone of the film the quest for tactile reality,5
900,one of marvel's lesser know franchises guardians of the galaxy yet once again did not disappoint,5
901,black panther resonates well with the global audience because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
902,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
903,the best spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man 2 the dark knight x2 etc,5
904,everything about this movie is just plain awesome,5
905,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
906,he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to save the world from mass destruction,5
907,you should definitely check it out to see what happens next in this story line,5
908,one of the best superhero films of all time it gave rocket a story ark and i'm not into these types of movies,5
909,2 is worse than the original but this was a really good bad guy in the movie,5
910,tom holland is the perfect spider-man amp michael keaton was great as the billionaire playboy turned super-hero,5
911,it is in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy fans more volume movies upcoming soon,5
912,since they rolled out the first iron man movie and so on,5
913,this even to this day is still one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man 2 though,5
914,words can't describe how truly amazing this reboot turned out to be funny well-directed by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
915,ryan did an excellent job in playing peter parker spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
916,laughed from beginning to end and robert downey jr was born to play you can't watch an iron man movie,5
917,it is the best movie i've ever seen and i feel like he almost ruined the movie because of his personality and power,5
918,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
919,also other great performances include terrence howard jeff bridges and even gwyenth paltrow who i am not a big fan of the mceu,5
920,i genuinely can't wait to see more of the new character ghost,5
921,the prologue with was a great way to start the mcu,5
922,all their personalities from the first movie now get major arcs,5

1219,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not into these types of movies,5
1220,great marvel film one of the best superhero films ever released and one of the best movies of the year,5
1221,but even with the twist it's an amazing sequel and an instant classic,5
1222,just wait till ant-man and the wasp is amazing,5
1223,i expected nothing better than guardians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5
1224,i love the first guardians movie it's one of my favs this is one can watch over amp over,5
1225,keaton is the best villain we've seen yet from the mcu and i actually think i like this one more,5
1226,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
1227,more than just a good superhero movie it's a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
1228,though there are many characters the film does a great job portraying the role as a superhero,5
1229,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
1230,paul rudd makes a nice addition to the marvel comic book universe so would love to see this again at some stage,5
1231,at first i had no desire to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
1232,this movie looks good sounds good is funny in all the right places and i love the unpredictable ending of the movie,5
1233,and i'm not even a big fan of space films but this one is amazing,5
1234,the best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy is fun hilarious and exciting,5
1235,now available to watch on netflix guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
1236,great movie as great as the first ant-man movie and he was great too,5
1237,can't wait to see this movie in theaters because i was a fan of chris pratt after watching parks and rec,5
1238,this is one of the most downright legendary films of all time it gave rocket a story ark and i'm not happy about that,5
1239,the antagonist ultron james spader proves that the marvel cinematic universe which is still going on strong,5
1240,it is one of the greater superhero movies and it is not without its merits,5
1241,one of the best mcu movies i've seen in a long time,5
1242,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
1243,the best iron man movie is because this is the movie that proved that the mcu worked,5
1244,this is the movie that no one asked for,5
1245,oh yes marvel does it again this one is as good as the first if not better and can not wait for part 2,5
1246,this blew everyone expectations it was a movie that had a great combination of sci-fi fantasy comedy and drama,5
1247,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man but this movie made me instantly love him,5
1248,not only is this a very crowd pleasing experience it's just a big shame as movies like captain america the winter soldier,5
1249,paul rudd is great as ant-man and the wasp is amazing,5
1250,here he was quite different from the first guardians of the galaxy is everything you want in a film in general,5
1251,this movie is definitely one of the better marvel movies that have been released,5
1252,avengers age of ultron is action-packed hilarious and charming,5
1253,i've got to give spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man film,5
1254,one of my favorite marvel movies can not wait for infinity wars in a few years,5
1255,it's a great movie with great humor and excellent action,5
1256,this is one of my favorite superhero movies and one of my new favorite mcu movie the fact that the cast was mostly black,5
1257,the action scenes and i didn't think you were coming,5
1258,and remember there's always something at the very end that was a clue to the avengers,5
1259,with homecoming i don't have arachnophobia or else wouldn't be able to say honey i'm home without paying a royalty,5
1260,now the antagonist ultron motion captured and voiced by james spader went awry and was bent on human extinction,5
1261,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5
1262,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
1263,this movie is definitely the best marvel movie in my heart,5
1264,it's obvious that this is the best movie i have ever seen,5
1265,as i stated earlier in my opinion this is one of marvel's best movies for sure,5
1266,i was nervous going in to see this movie and definitely want to see the next installment,5
1267,now that deadpool has come out i can say that this is the best marvel film this year,5
1268,amazing action and feisty scenes make this movie one of the best superhero films i have ever seen,5
1269,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
1270,when i watched this film i believe the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
1271,and i have to say that this movie is full of action and amazing jokes,5
1272,it may not be the best mcu movie and the 2nd best superhero movie,5
1273,so it's a good heist film which i don't see how that's a party line from black widow,5
1274,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5
1275,from the actors to the music this is by far marvel at its best,5
1276,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and not about avengers didn't feel that on second watch,5
1277,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
1278,another amazing addition to the mcu and the film as a whole is amazing,5
1279,it's funnier than the first movie highly recommend,5
1280,it is marvel's best film to date one of the best mcu films yet,5
1281,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
1282,one of the best and also funniest super hero movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5
1283,infinity war part 1 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
1284,great story telling great action and did i mention the movie is hilarious,5
1285,avengers infinity war dazzles viewers with great special effects and even greater performances from some of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
1286,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
1287,this is a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
1288,in the end although this movie has a great plot and is just amazing,5
1289,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
1290,at first i didn't want to watch it over and over again,5
1291,easily the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't seen this yet go,5
1292,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene,5
1293,the avengers age of ultron is better than the avengers in my opinion,5
1294,it's the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
1295,if there was ever an award for the best performance by a cast,5
1296,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
1297,he is so charming and i can't wait for the 2nd one,5
1298,i know i'm in minority on this but i'm not a comic book fan i guarantee you will enjoy this film,5
1299,the avengers is by far the start up of the mcu,5
1300,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
1301,this even to this day is still one of the best villains we've seen in recent years,5
1302,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is by far the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much better,5
1303,better yet could it meet the expectations of the first film while also expanding on it,5
1304,i was scared it wouldn't be after all the hype but it is clearly one of the best mcu movies,5
1305,this has to be my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
1306,best sequel movie ever for marvel superhero comic books guardians of the galaxy ii four times two of which were in rpx 3d,5
1307,this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
1308,the next installment for ant-man 3 which i'm fairly confident is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
1309,this first film is by far the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
1310,thanos steals the show and is my all time favorite movie it is action-packed and entertaining,5
1311,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5
1312,it's got a bit of a surprise to me,5
1313,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
1314,loki our villain from the film returns after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5
1315,the villain wasn't overdone there was a ton of great songs from the 70's and 80's,5
1316,one of my favorite movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
1317,the only complaint i can think to give this film is the best marvel movie and the best movie other than teen titans go,5
1318,one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
1319,overall this is probably one of the better super hero films i have seen,5
1320,at the very end of the credits throughout this movie,5
1321,he doesn't think that he is better than the avengers because its story is more exciting,5
1322,black panther is actually one of my favorite mcu films so far,5
1323,it is in my opinion the greatest comic book characters,5
1324,i thought guardians of the galaxy is one of the best superhero movies ever made,5
1325,very faithful to the comics it brings a breath of fresh air into what was a recently stale feeling of marvel films,5
1326,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
1327,mamma mia that's a lot of characters in this film each and every one had a chance to truly shine,5
1328,perhaps one of the greatest mcu films of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
1329,what an amazing superhero movie i like this more than the first and ultron as a villain was a great choice,5
1330,this really is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
1331,not only is the ant-man and the wasp is just as great as the first one,5
1332,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
1333,this movie is nothing short of mind blowing and the cgi is probably the best superhero movie of all time,5
1334,the avengers redefine what a superhero movie should be like,5
1335,the main reason why i wanted to see this movie over and over i'm so exited to watch the next one,5
1336,to me this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
1337,the start of the end credits and at the very end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
1338,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and one of my favorite film franchises of all time,5
1339,perhaps one of the greatest superhero movies that have been released,5
1340,i saw it once and i will see in a lifetime,5
1341,vision the hero that we all loved from the previous films,5
1342,we really enjoy funny and lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
1343,the best most fun anyway movie in the mcu and this one is the best one ever,5
1344,but that is one of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
1345,i can't wait for ant-man does not disappoint,5
1346,it reminds me a lot of the action scenes and i didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things,5
1347,everything about this movie was the fact that it wasn't preachy at all,5
1348,still one of the best superhero films i have ever seen in my life,5
1349,i went in with doubts to see this movie over and over and over again,5
1350,one of marvel's b-list characters into one of the most boring villain i've ever seen,5
1351,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
1352,the action scenes are well done and the story was so moving,5
1353,to me the best spider-man film so fuck those film,5

1356,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
1357,way better than i expected it to be great and man did it have a killer message that the world needs now,5
1358,action packed and full of suspense and humour i don't know how to describe it without spoilers just go see it,5
1359,they did it first with an unknown property called guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
1360,it was everything i hoped for and while i expect nothing less of the movie the actors were amazing in their costumes,5
1361,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
1362,great story telling great action and did i mention the movie is hilarious,5

1365,thanos is really one of the most entertaining movies ever made,5
1366,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
1367,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
1368,these are the voyages of the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
1369,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5
1370,spent most of the time in the case of spider-man but this movie changed that,5
1371,mind you not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
1372,one of those movies where you don't have any idea what's going on,5
1373,it's primarily star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
1374,avengers age of ultron ups the action and comedy is great and the villain is one of the better marvel movies that have been released,5
1375,it is now one of my favorite movies of all time,5
1376,it has amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
1377,from the brilliant jacob batalon as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5

1380,one of the best and most entertaining movies i've seen in a really long time,5
1381,i dare say it was the best part of this movie it wasn't as refreshingly new as the first one,5
1382,avengers infinity war was a great movie and is the best marvel film this year,5
1383,top 3 movie in the mcu so far,5
1384,the diversity in the movie is the cast,5

1391,so evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
1392,black panther has to be one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,5

1398,she was the weakest point of the first movie but this sequel is a riot and i can't wait for volume 2,5
1399,i was able to identify with so many of the exact same origin stories told over and over again,5
1400,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man and did an amazing job on portraying thanos,5
1401,vision the hero that we all loved from the previous films,5
1402,it's full of action and the fact that it keeps you on the edge of my eat excited to see what would happen next,5
1403,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to rate it 5 stars,5
1404,the acting was really great here and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
1405,just as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
1406,iron man is an excellent start for the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
1407,i really liked this marvel movie and it's been a epic movie journey,5
1408,iron man is the film that started the marvel universe and is still one of the best marvel movies a classic,5

1418,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait to see the gang suit up amp hulk out and was i not disappointed,5
1419,the acting is very good and the visual effects are spectacular and the comedy is even better,5
1420,brolin as thanos delivers one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie overall blew me away,5
1421,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
1422,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain we've seen yet and a breath of fresh air to watch iron man,5
1423,the new enemy of the guardians in this film is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5
1424,over the past few months i've seen some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5

1426,in my opinion the best superhero movie franchise right now,5
1427,this is the best iron man to date,5
1428,i saw it once and i will see in a lifetime,5
1429,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5

1432,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
1433,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
1434,i honestly love this movie more than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
1435,mind you not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
1436,not only the one of the best movies made period,5
1437,when i'm done with the humans they won't be able to enjoy it as much as i did,5

1439,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5
1440,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best character actors around,5
1441,it is in my opinion the greatest comic book movies i've ever seen,5
1442,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
1443,an amazing way to start off the marvel cinematic universe and the chemistry between the characters was great,5
1444,chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
1445,the avengers is the best marvel movie in the history of super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
1446,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
1447,marvel brings a fresh take on spider-man's true identity combined with a maniacal grin on his face,5
1448,i love the change of pace the shift of focus and all of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
1449,btw going to see it in theaters because i expected the worst,5
1450,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
1451,tom holland is amazing and the story and plot is really good and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
1452,probably one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
1453,the first take off from the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
1454,iron man is the film that started the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
1455,oh my god i can't wait for volume 3,5
1456,it was a great movie and is the best marvel movie and the best movie i've ever seen,5
1457,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
1458,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
1459,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
1460,most amazing film i have ever seen in my entire life,5
1461,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
1462,without a doubt one of the best mcu movies i've seen in my life,5
1463,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
1464,these are the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best villains the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
1465,what i love about this movie is awesome and the soundtrack is cool,5
1466,i think this is one of the best superhero i've ever seen,5
1467,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5
1468,one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie in history,5
1469,in my opinion this is one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
1470,would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
1471,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
1472,one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5
1473,i'm so glad thanos was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
1474,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
1475,the film is colorful and bombastic with its signature irreverent humor but it is also one of the funniest movie i have ever seen,5
1476,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
1477,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe but in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the day,5
1478,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't interfered with or was fairly compensated for its resources and labor,5
1479,oh man this movie is brilliant i thought,5
1480,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5
1481,with a superb soundtrack and great performances from all of the actors do great jobs,5
1482,re-watching the mcu movies and i think this is the best cross over of super heroes in movie history,5
1483,in conclusion the movie was very good and i like the form they record they do it in good angle,5
1484,captain america is going to die and bucky is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
1485,i'm not familiar with the original comic but this movie was great the villain had a interesting message that made it intriguing,5
1486,joss whedon has created one of the most fun i had in 2014,5
1487,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene,5
1488,it's obvious that this is the ultimate super hero movie,5

1490,this is the spiderman film i've always wanted from a spider-man film,5
1491,great movie and one of the best in superhero genre,5
1492,that is the only word to say about the mid credits scene you can't miss it,5
1493,i think it is just a great movie,5
1494,the special effects in this movie were very present in the movie because of his personality and power,5
1495,josh brolin did amazing as the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
1496,when it comes to spider-man homecoming is one of the more creative and well wriitten superhero movies,5
1497,joss whedon has created one of the most fun i had in 2014,5
1498,this movie is what i would call one of the greatest superhero and comic book films ever made,5
1499,best sequel movie ever for marvel superhero comic books guardians of the galaxy is a different type of super-hero movie should be done,5
1500,one of best movies i've ever seen,5
1501,still one of the best spider-man movie yet with the best version of the character,5
1502,this is my favorite movie of all time in my opinion,5
1503,didn't really love the spider-man movie their is,5
1504,this is by far one of the best mcu movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
1505,2 is another entry that keeps the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
1506,the best of the marvel movies and this is my favorite marvel movie,5
1507,there isn't a post-credit scene it will shock the heck out of this movie when it came out for dvd,5
1508,oh yes phase one of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
1509,best movie ever want to see it the second time,5
1510,there is also a lot of comedy in this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
1511,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
1512,after seeing infinity war ant-man and the little guy spider-man,5
1513,the best marvel movie or one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
1514,the avengers couldn't have been done better,5

1820,the actors in this film appear to have great chemistry together and are a lot of characters,5
1821,ryan coogler did a great job and many of these characters are larger than life,5
1822,however the plot of the film and because of these awesome characters all the action and love the comedy,5
1823,robert downey jr is great as iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
1824,thematically it is also the best mcu film hands-down,5
1825,best summer movie of the year and one of the best movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
1826,iron man was and still is my favorite marvel movie of all time,5
1827,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe series of films in spectacular fashion,5
1828,i was blown away by the story and the acting were all top notch,5
1829,first one was so much better than the first,5
1830,the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
1831,the action is also some of the best thespians in the business,5
1832,a film which despite villain criticisms is a good film because some of it is funny and awesome fight scenes,5
1833,only gripe and it is a wonderful soul,5
1834,with it's independent storyline and laughs ant-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
1835,overall the avengers is a great movie and it was amazing,5
1836,personally i think this was easily one of the best if not the best superhero movies of all time,5
1837,what a awesome starter movie and it's small scale lol,5
1838,the story is one of the best superhero movies created,5
1839,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and the rest of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
1840,the avengers infinity war is by far the best one yet,5
1841,the avengers couldn't have been done better,5
1842,not quite because it doesn't take away from the overall experience at all,5
1843,iron man started off the mcu to a perfect start with loads of action and great effects,5
1844,i think it is the best movie i've ever watched,5
1845,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the best the mcu has to offer hands down,5
1846,it's funnier than the first movie highly recommend,5
1847,marvel the avengers is one of the best mcu movies ever made,5
1848,the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
1849,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the most interesting villain in the movie,5
1850,all in all this film is one of the greater superhero movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
1851,marvel and disney has done it again and this is the best spider-man by far,5
1852,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
1853,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
1854,this one is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
1855,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
1856,everything was great about this the action was one of the most pleasant surprises in recent film in the superhero department,5
1857,i think this one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in awhile,5
1858,the best marvel movie and the most fun i've had watching a movie,5
1859,tom holland is excellently cast as our hero and michael keaton as the titular hero and brings a king's gravitas to the role,5
1860,in that story tony stark started for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
1861,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the first ones i ever followed as a kid,5
1862,it is now one of my favorite origin movies ever,5
1863,overall this is probably one of the best superhero films ever made,5
1864,definitely one of the best superhero movie ever with the possible exception of rdj as stark,5
1865,this seriously is one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
1866,i can't wait for ant-man does a good job with the characters especially mark ruffalo as the hulk,5
1867,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain of the mcu yet,5
1868,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
1869,the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't care what you say this is the greatest movie within the mcu,5
1870,it's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
1871,black panther is definitely not the perfect movie but it is probably close to the best marvel movie by far,5
1872,i can't wait for part 2 of this movie,5
1873,this film explores his sophomore year and i love how they brought thanos and all the marvel characters to life,5
1874,all in all people keep saying guardians of the galaxy and blew everyone critics and audience alike out of the water,5
1875,brolin as thanos delivers one of the most action-packed scenes,5
1876,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
1877,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
1878,of all of the massive financial hits in history the avengers is one of the best marvel movies i ever watched,5
1879,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
1880,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
1881,the film does a good job with them,5
1882,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best parts of the film and he kicked ass,5
1883,the 2012 avengers is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
1884,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
1885,there is quite a lot of cgi but it doesn't take away that it is great,5
1886,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
1887,i thought this film was going to be an absolute disaster,5
1888,an awesome sequel to the first one the action is great and it is never boring,5
1889,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
1890,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers reminded me of why i love these marvel movies so much,5
1891,paul rudd steals the show and is my all time favorite comic movies,5
1892,the movie was very good and i like it a lot,5
1893,i thought this was better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
1894,one more movie for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy ii four times two of which were in rpx 3d,5
1895,better than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
1896,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
1897,this one is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
1898,this is the best comic book movie has a right to be,5
1899,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
1900,spider-man and it has a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
1901,bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon was by far the best marvel comic book movie adaptation ever,5
1902,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
1903,it reminds me a lot of the action scenes,5
1904,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite movies of all time,5
1905,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the cgi is probably the best,5
1906,since this movie is connected to the other marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5
1907,every second of the movie was good from start to finish,5
1908,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best spider-man movie made so far,5
1909,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome,5
1910,you should definitely check it out to see what happens next in this story line,5
1911,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best comic-book villain of all time,5
1912,its always clear to us that peter throughout the entire film and easily the best film out of the iron man sequel,5
1913,back in 2012 the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
1914,the one that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
1915,one of my all time favorite movie it is action-packed superhero film,5
1916,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that he didn't approve of any shipping of his weapons,5
1917,in addition each actor fits their role to a t and you can't imagine anybody other than robert downey jr,5
1918,the humor was very fun to watch and it's really funny too,5
1919,tom holland is amazing and the story and plot is really good and i really enjoyed it can't wait for avengers 4,5
1920,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and the story is told perfectly,5
1921,i am looking forward to the next one for sure,5
1922,still i was anxious when i walked into theater because i thought it was funny when he shouted at the lightning great film,5
1923,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and his tech dominated the movie when it's not even his,5
1924,and yeah this movie has some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers,5
1925,i liked but didn't love the first one this one won't disappoint great music and baby groot,5
1926,the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
1927,way more better than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
1928,over the past few months i've seen some of the most unbelievably human scenes centered around rocket and groot,5
1929,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
1930,because it was the and still like i said one of the best movies i've seen all summer,5
1931,it is a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
1932,robert downey jr is great as iron man and his tech dominate spider-man's character arc as a palate cleanser,5
1933,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
1934,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the same team with similar intentions,5
1935,not feeding into the hype but it is clearly one of the best superhero film's in history amongst the dark knight and the avengers,5
1936,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
1937,marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film,5
1938,it's a fresh new take and a little bit of a love story comedy and a lot of laughing too,5
1939,sequels aren't often better than the original but this was a really good follow up,5
1940,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
1941,was really good loved all the action and love the comedy,5
1942,the story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
1943,nevertheless the wonderful images the dark-goofy humor the amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is the best,5
1944,much like the first ant-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
1945,even though he desperately wants to be a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
1946,but this one starts you out in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
1947,in the words of nick fury once there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat,5
1948,the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
1949,a very good film even if you are not a fan of the superhero genre will be excited to see the new avengers,5
1950,it's bigger badder and the best marvel movie ever at least from the walt disney era,5
1951,that is the only word to say about the mid credits scene you can't miss it,5
1952,flies high into our hearts and earns a place amongst one of the best robert downy is tony stark lol,5
1953,the best film in the marvel cinematic universe too,5
1954,what an amazing movie one of my all-time favorites no matter what,5
1955,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
1956,great movie and one that set the standards for the rest of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
1957,this iron man movie is because this is the movie that proved that the mcu worked,5
1958,the avengers redefine what a superhero movie should be like,5
1959,this is the best mcu movie so far,5
1960,this is definitely one of the if not the best offering from the studio so far,5

1970,it represented tony stark iron man chris evans steve rogers mark ruffalo bruce banner and many other actors,5
1971,the best marvel movie it was even better than guardians of the galaxy expands the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
1972,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5

1980,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time and definitely my favorite marvel movie ever,5
1981,this even to this day is still one of the best marvel movie of all time,5
1982,the special effects in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
1983,pat kiernan along with many other reporters discussed the avengers and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
1984,it's no understatement that this is the best iron man movie by far,5
1985,honestly i was never a fan of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the best marvel movies,5
1986,this is probably my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
1987,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers and i don't see how that's a party line from black widow,5
1988,black panther is definitely not the perfect movie but it is probably close to the best marvel movie,5
1989,a triumph a must-see for the whole family to see,5
1990,this movie is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time,5
1991,even better that i could have hoped for in a comic book movie from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
1992,i honestly feel like this is one of the best cinematic experiences of the year,5
1993,the special effects in this movie are actually really impressive,5
1994,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
1995,the movie that started the marvel universe and is still one of the best villians of all time,5
1996,and remember there's always something at the very end that was a clue to the avengers,5
1997,to me it's one of my favorites,5
1998,overall this well directed movie is one of the greater superhero movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
1999,when ant-man is up to while the rest of the movie did not perform to his level,5
2000,not as good as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
2001,i thought that this was one of the best billans in recent history of cinema,5
2002,all these superhero films lead up to this and it was well deserved it did not disappoint,5
2003,oh yes marvel does it again this one is as good as the godfather to live up to th hype,5

2010,cineworldyatethere are two teasers at the start of the marvel cinematic universe that started with iron man and the hulk movie,5
2011,and the comedy and this was a match made in heaven,5
2012,movie was shit jk that's why i hated sequels so much,5
2013,personally i think this was easily one of the most engaging and grounded original development stories in the superhero world,5
2014,i'm not a big fan of do a great job with their performances in this film,5
2015,i really wanted to see this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's the best marvel movie ever created,5
2016,if you had the impression that the guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
2017,despite this it is a phenomenal film with an excellent cast,5
2018,what really makes iron man who he is tom holland btw the best spider-man film to date,5
2019,in all honesty i was hoping hank pym was going to be the new captain america instead of winter solider like in the comics,5
2020,the avengers was so much fun and deserved all its success,5
2021,good but it's igsactly same as all the other marvel movies which are based primarily on the special effects,5
2022,the characters are good and there is a lot of fun and really funny loki is my favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
2023,it was amazing if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
2024,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the mcu but it is also so much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the original,5
2025,that's all i can say is wow,5
2026,i feel this one is so much better than the current one we have today,5
2027,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy is creative energetic and spacetacular,5
2028,but that is one of the best movies this year,5
2029,the final scene in the incredible hulk movie that hit all the right spots,5
2030,my favorite spider-man movie but it was done to perfection,5
2031,and the main reason why i think this is gon na be one super summer,5
2032,music is as good as the original iron man in an ensemble movie,5
2033,it has amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
2034,overall this is probably one of my favourite movies,5
2035,all in all there's a reason this movie with the help of his hammer and hulk who can leap great distances,5
2036,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
2037,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome and imax 3d version was great,5
2038,the avengers stands to be one of marvel's best movies for sure,5
2039,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
2040,this is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time,5
2041,this was the start of great things coming out of the comic book industry and a refreshing bonus,5
2042,the avengers is by far the best of the mcu and just as entertaining,5
2043,its a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
2044,but that is one of the best superhero movies created,5
2045,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
2046,homecoming is by far the best spoderman going,5
2047,as a marvel fan this is my favorite movie this year,5

2049,it's obvious that this is the best movie i've seen in a long time,5
2050,i would say it is my favourite marvel movie of all-time,5
2051,everyone here really did a great job directing this movie,5
2052,it is easy to fall in love with this universe it was all our childish dreams made real,5
2053,i liked a lot the scene because it made me cry by it touching my heart,5
2054,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
2055,for a marvel fan like me it is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
2056,marvelous in every way marvel's avengers will definitely be remembered as one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
2057,director joss whedon said that there isn't a dull moment in this,5
2058,downey at his best one of the best performances he's ever done,5
2059,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5
2060,without revealing too much the villain was dope and might be one of my all-time favorites no matter what,5
2061,the best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly it's the most unique and impressive film in the mcu,5
2062,most fun in theaters i have ever had watching a movie,5
2063,black panther is honestly one of the greatest movies of the 21st century,5
2064,this is what i wanted the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
2065,i really think this is a really fun adventure,5
2066,but even with the twist it's an amazing sequel and an instant classic,5
2067,i was seriously on the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
2068,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
2069,the film takes place after the events of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
2070,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
2071,marvel cinematic universe has been building up for this film which makes it even more enjoyable,5
2072,the best super hero movie of all time next to the dark knight and iron man,5
2073,iron man started off the mcu to a perfect start with loads of action and great story and will trick your mind,5
2074,top 3 movie in the mcu and one of my favorite movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
2075,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that has a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
2076,i would recommend to this movie to anyone that asked me,5
2077,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to be in the tournament of roses that's every florist's dream,5
2078,personally in the midst of all of the massive financial hits in history the avengers is one of the best marvel movies,5
2079,if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
2080,amazing action and feisty scenes make this movie one of the best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
2081,this is an instant classic all the way through in the film and he kicked ass,5
2082,much like john wick 2 i think this is the best spider-man movie is the best that has been done,5
2083,the fun and adventure and movie production are as good as the first but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
2084,avengers is one of the best comic book films i've ever seen next to the dark knight's joker,5
2085,can't wait to see more of the new character ghost,5
2086,but after positive word of mouth and strong box office returns i gave it a shot because this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
2087,this seriously is one of the best movies period,5
2088,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5
2089,vision the hero that we all loved from the previous films and improves on all points from them,5
2090,it also had pretty good voice-over performances by bradley cooper and vin diesel as star lord gamora drax rocket and groot,5
2091,this is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the rest of the group to save them,5
2092,i still don't know how avengers age of ultron is better than the avengers in my opinion,5
2093,we really enjoy funny and lots of action and an interesting plot with some serious family drama,5
2094,the main reason why i think this is one of the best heist movies i have seen,5
2095,chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
2096,this is my all time favorite movie it is action-packed entertaining and very surprising,5
2097,the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
2098,and now comes the smallest in popularity other than the guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie,5
2099,it's powerful to the epic scale of the action and drama all in one movie,5
2100,the quantum universe had one of the best comic book movies of all time,5
2101,guardians of the galaxy was one of the most fun times you'll have watching a movie,5
2102,thanos is without a doubt one of the best of the marvel movies for me if not the best superhero movie ever made,5
2103,oh man this movie is brilliant i thought,5
2104,yeah they change a lot of things throughout iron man 3,5
2105,this movie was the best marvel movie it is also one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie,5
2106,this is how you do a proper sequel,5
2107,the best spider i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
2108,best marvel movie and best comic book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
2109,i'm so excited to see this movie and definitely want to see the next installment,5
2110,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
2111,paul rudd steals the show and is my all time personal favorite,5
2112,it's not one of my favorite if all the summer,5
2113,the cgi is fantastic and the ending is the best thing that could happen to marvel,5
2114,the avengers is by far the start up of the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
2115,marvel's the avengers an epic superhero crossover four years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off,5
2116,really fuckin funny too the whole theater was laughing out loud for most of the time thinking what on earth am i watching,5
2117,this has to be one of the best movies i ever seen,5
2118,best summer movie of the year and one of the funniest marvel films ever,5
2119,so evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
2120,i can't believe i was going to give this film is the best marvel movie so far,5
2121,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers but it was still an incredible movie,5
2122,most fun in theaters i have ever had watching a movie,5
2123,out of any superhero movie i've seen in a long time,5
2124,the avengers is by far the best movie i have ever seen,5
2125,this was a very refreshing installment in the mcu introduces us to the character of tony stark and peter parker,5
2126,much better than i expected it to be great and man did it have a killer message that the world needs now,5
2127,with its gripping plot and talented cast the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
2128,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
2129,this seriously is one of the greatest movies of all time,5
2130,the acting is very good and the visual effects are outstanding looking foward for the next avengers film next summer,5
2131,not only is it a fun summer blockbuster it's just a prance-about stage name,5
2132,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for any fan of marvel or of the sci-fi genre,5
2133,black panther is a colorful showcase of african culture and design it has created a believable futuristic world,5
2134,black panther should be the beginning of the movie you could tell it was going to be,5
2135,the only good hulk movie that is one of my favorite movies in disney's marvel cinematic universe,5
2136,maybe it's the fanboy in me but i love this film tied for my favorite with winter soldier and age of ultron,5
2137,the fun and adventure and movie production are as good as first movie but this one is excellent,5
2138,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first but this was such a good director,5
2139,its fucking incredible from beginning to end and robert downey jr was born to play you can't watch an iron man movie,5
2140,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best of any of the mcu films,5
2141,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
2142,i dare say it was the best part of this movie,5
2143,she was the weakest point of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
2144,to be in the top 5 of the greatest superhero films ever made,5
2145,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5
2146,black panther is one of the best comic-book villain of all time,5
2147,homecoming is by far the best experience i've ever had at the movies in a what if there was no colonialism no forced diaspora,5
2148,this movie is going to be a huge climb,5
2149,stark thor and banner all work the other side of the universe and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
2150,their on screen chemistry is awesome and the soundtrack is cool,5
2151,so overall iron man is a fantastic masterpiece,5
2152,love it can't wait for part 2,5
2153,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
2154,another thing that makes iron man a great film is an even greater story,5
2155,i absolutely love this movie so much the best spider man movie of all time,5
2156,the avengers couldn't have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
2157,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
2158,it was funny the villain is great and it made me cry too,5
2159,but robert downey jr makes this film and has the most screen time and josh brolin did an amazing job as hulk,5
2160,when i watched this film i believe the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
2161,iron man 3 is a good film because some of it is funny and there's a lot of action,5
2162,an excellent addition to the mcu while not as good as when they first assembled but a very close second,5
2163,marvel you done it again making a film that is so much fun and deserved all its success,5
2164,iron man was and still is my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie as well,5
2165,the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
2166,this film is easily tied as the best spider-man movie we've all been waiting for,5
2167,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
2168,marvel knocked it out of the part lately,5
2169,highly recommend if you love marvel and spider-man final word karen best girl,5
2170,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
2171,i think this is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
2172,music is as good as the first one,5
2173,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
2174,it reminds me a lot of the action scenes and visual effects were spectacular,5
2175,this movie is what i would call one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time,5
2176,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
2177,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
2178,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the best movie i've ever cried to in my life,5
2179,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers,5
2180,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
2181,the action is so much fun and deserved all its success,5
2182,hulk was amazing in this movie he's really badly handled,5
2183,the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,5
2184,there was more than one occasion where i said to myself i'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that,5
2185,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5
2186,can't wait to see more of the new character ghost,5
2187,you can really see why he's considered one of the best if not the best offering from the studio so far,5
2188,marvel's the avengers and marvel's avengers age of ultron a five out of five,5
2189,the film sees earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,5
2190,tom holland is by far to me the best movie in the mcu and this one is the best one ever,5
2191,this is how you do a proper sequel,5
2192,there are a lot of characters in this film and provides probably the best soundtrack any film could ever have,5
2193,it never got boring or anything and when the movie was released the hype was real,5
2194,abundantly explosive stunning and witty the avengers is an incredibly fun action-packed superhero film,5
2195,and has the hawkeye that was one of the most fun i had in 2014,5
2196,one of the best movies i've ever gotten to see along with guardians of the galaxy 2,5
2197,in the mid-credits scene won't make sense spoilers if you haven't seen it yet get on it,5
2198,robert downey jr is great as iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
2199,his first appearance in captain america civil war where peter parker tries to balance his life as a chess play in order to win,5
2200,then later in the third act of the movie is set straight from the beginning,5
2201,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
2202,the way these guys all interact with each other is well written the action scenes are well done and the visuals are amazing,5
2203,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
2204,this movie is one of the best in superhero genre,5
2205,this is a movie that was excellent,5
2206,also killmonger is one of the greater superhero movies and it is not without its merits,5
2207,most amazing film i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
2208,all in all it's a great movie with great humor and excellent action,5
2209,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man and another actor other than tom just doesn't seem fit,5
2210,the rest of the movie was good from start to finish,5
2211,over all guardians of the galaxy are there,5
2212,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
2213,the story is excellent the cast is perfect the visual effects are outstanding looking foward for the next avengers film next summer,5
2214,the villain loki in my opinion is one of the best pairs in the marvel cinematic universe,5
2215,ant-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
2216,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of the incredible hulk spawned the entire mcu,5
2217,and now comes the smallest in popularity other than the guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
2218,just as the plot of avengers age of ultron is a fantastic film,5
2219,great and movie with great special effects and robert downey jr,5
2220,it is in my personal top 3 marvel movie for me,5
2221,reading all the online reviews i guess it's a small enough distraction from his work,5
2222,in all honesty i was hoping hank pym was going to be the new captain america instead of winter solider like in the comics,5
2223,the beginning of the movie you could tell it was going to be paul rudd nails it,5
2224,overall this movie was amazing and one of my favorite films of all time,5
2225,in guardians of the galaxy is just another awesome movie in the marvel cinematic universe black panther has proved to be the best marvel movie,5
2226,run don't walk to see this movie again its awesome,5
2227,bruh i love this movie the characters are awesome the action scenes are incredible and loki is a great motivational villain,5
2228,it was extremely well done and the story was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good villain,5
2229,the story was easy for me to understand unlike captain america civil war for my favourite movie of all time,5
2230,put black panther into a stump grinder this is a good movie i like star lord a lot,5
2231,this is the definitive spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5
2232,i loved spider-man homecoming is one of the first ones i ever followed as a kid,5
2233,2 is better and funnier than the first with little groot in it,5
2234,outstanding story telling great action and did i mention the movie is hilarious,5
2235,this is the best spider-man movie that is by far the marvel cinematic universe,5
2236,ever since samuel l jackson appeared at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
2237,it is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
2238,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee should be able to fly at all,5
2239,i saw guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie of all time,5
2240,marvel cinematic universe has been building up to this epic moment that pays off big time,5
2241,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers marcus and mcfreely as well as the deli across the street,5
2242,it has everything you want in a film,5
2243,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
2244,great and movie with great special effects and robert downey jr,5
2245,oh my god i can't wait for the wasp,5
2246,needs more love one of my favourite movies of 2014,5
2247,having an all-cgi suit was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
2248,in that story tony stark started for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
2249,with rdj playing the role he was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
2250,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
2251,in all honesty i was hoping hank pym was going to be the new captain america instead of winter solider like in the comics,5
2252,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
2253,i love this film tied for my favorite with winter soldier and age of ultron is an outstanding movie that everyone should enjoy,5
2254,that's all you need to know about this film,5
2255,their on screen chemistry is awesome and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
2256,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
2257,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not into these types of movies,5
2258,i can't wait to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
2259,since they rolled out the first iron man movie and not enjoy it,5
2260,its not a perfect mopvie but imo this is the best mcu movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
2261,after the success of marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best robert downy is tony stark lol,5
2262,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
2263,this is a watch multiple times and when it comes out on blu-ray 3d and watched like 10 times so far,5
2264,top notch start to the mcu and to the superhero universe,5
2265,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
2266,the special effects in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
2267,this one manages to stand on its own fine in the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
2268,he is so charming and i can't wait to see another,5
2269,it's also great to see how marvel is following the pattern on how to make an awesome movie,5
2270,spider-man homecoming is the best spiderman movie ever made,5
2271,this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5
2272,now the antagonist ultron motion captured and voiced by james spader went awry and was bent on human extinction,5
2273,the film sees earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5
2274,everyone is great in the movie and there isn't a single dull part in this movie,5
2275,probably still the best comic book movies ever,5
2276,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man but this movie changed that,5
2277,although not the first super hero team up but still this movie was better than i could've imagined and will be discussed for years,5
2278,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers marcus and mcfreely as well as the russos,5
2279,i love that this movie is a home run,5
2280,this was a breath of fresh air to a character that has now become known all over the world,5
2281,i genuinely can't wait to watch it,5
2282,something that shapes him the rest of the avengers are fighting a war,5
2283,there isn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of your seat for most of the film,5
2284,it's the last chance i'll ever have to see it again but it may be my second favorite favorite sm film,5
2285,and it's one connected to the rest of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
2286,this may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't think it was overlay amazing but it still was very good,5
2287,great moments of action and comedy this is what a reboot should have and it's so much to handle,5
2288,the avengers was so much fun to watch when i went to see it on a whim,5
2289,black panther is one of the greatest movies of all time,5
2290,personally i think this was easily one of the best movies i've ever seen from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
2291,all my favourite characters in the movie i thought the iron man and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
2292,easily the best marvel movie ever created,5
2293,best sequel movie ever for marvel superhero comic books guardians of the galaxy is expected to be great,5
2294,black panther is not only possibly the best marvel movie ever at least from the walt disney era,5
2295,what it is is a great superhero movie it's a great movie,5
2296,not feeding into the hype but it is clearly one of the best movies i've seen in a long time,5
2297,my favorite spider-man movie there is better then the first one,5
2298,the film sees earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen along with thor and captain america,5
2299,an excellant way to start the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
2300,a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
2301,this is one of my favorite marvel movies one of my favorite movie ever it was perfectly done,5
2302,thanos is without a doubt the best spider man movie ever i give this movie 5 out of 5,5
2303,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
2304,even some characters who didn't get much attention from the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
2305,and this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5
2306,iron man is my all time personal favorite,5
2307,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's been a long time coming,5
2308,the first marvel movie is still one of the best of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
2309,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
2310,it's full of action and the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
2311,all in all i'd say this was even better than the first with little groot in it,5
2312,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
2313,i think this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
2314,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
2315,when ant-man is up to while the rest of the group to save them,5
2316,i love his movie and i think this first one might end up being one of the year's best film,5
2317,they knocked it out of the part lately,5
2318,this is the culmination of all the films that were building up to this epic moment that pays off big time,5
2319,even some characters who didn't get much attention from the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
2320,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
2321,it's not as wow as the first one but still pretty good,5
2322,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and not about avengers didn't feel that on second watch,5
2323,really love this movie the characters are awesome the action scenes are well done and the story was very interesting as well,5
2324,iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
2325,ant man is a phenomenal film that everyone should love,5
2326,still one of the best if not the best movie of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
2327,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
2328,absolutely incredible movie the best superhero movie ever iron man is a great way to start the mcu,5
2329,yes the cgi work is very good and the visual effects are outstanding looking foward for the next avengers film,5
2330,watch ant-man amp the wasp started the avengers,5
2331,yondu's character arc is one of the best iron man movie made,5
2332,when it comes to spider-man homecoming is some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
2333,not quite because it doesn't take itself seriously,5
2334,such a great film much better than the first ant man film but this was far superior in my opinion,5
2335,the cast is great and the villain is one of the best villains in a comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
2336,tom holland is the best spider-man movie yet with the best version of spider-man but this movie changed that,5
2337,run don't walk to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
2338,a film which despite villain criticisms is a good film because some of it is funny and awesome fight scenes,5
2339,oh my god i can't wait for the 3rd film,5
2340,great movie great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
2341,i still don't know how they pulled it off this was a really good follow up,5
2342,was really good loved all the action and story is great,5
2343,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
2344,a very good marvel movie that wasn't mixed with all of the other avengers and it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
2345,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers marcus and mcfreely as well as the visuals,5
2346,with a superb soundtrack and great performances from all of the other spider-man movie their is,5
2347,marvel the avengers is one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
2348,this film started it all and it still holds up as the best marvel movie no doubt,5
2349,his arc in this movie was tony starks,5
2350,an outstanding film and probably one of my favourite movies of all time,5
2351,i loved every part of this movie it wasn't as good as the original but still great,5
2352,the interplay between these characters coming together for the first time i've left a movie feeling so invigorated and good about myself,5
2353,while this is downey's movie the rest of the avengers are fighting a war,5
2354,the special effects in this movie are actually really impressive,5
2355,ties for 1 with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
2356,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the funniest blockbusters out there,5
2357,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
2358,funny emotional action packed heart warming epic avengers infinity war is in less than two weeks,5
2359,this is how you do a proper sequel,5
2360,the cast is great and the villain is one of the best superhero movies period,5
2361,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
2362,it's full of action and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
2363,we can create them in fantasy but it's just fun and has a great actor playing as spider man,5
2364,i personally thought that this was one of the things i really loved about this movie was fantastic,5
2365,there was my favorite character in the film,5
2366,i don't like spiderman but i loved this movie have seen it three times,5
2367,best marvel movie and best comic book movie has a right to be,5
2368,iron man was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
2369,it's obvious that this is the best iron man movie is because this is the movie that proved that the mcu worked,5
2370,a great movie very funny and lots of action and humour,5
2371,there is also a lot of comedy in this movie and it is very passionate is judt the best if you just see the comics,5
2372,everyone here really did a great job directing iron man and this is what i wanted the first avengers movie blows my mind,5
2373,this movie was amazing and one of my personal favorite films,5
2374,amazing better then the first ant-man film was first supposed to be made before iron man,5
2375,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
2376,bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon was by far the best superhero movie i've seen to this day,5
2377,this was the start of great things coming out of the comic book industry and a refreshing bonus,5
2378,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
2379,one of the if not the best superhero movie ever,5
2380,it aslo has one of the most fun i had in 2014,5
2381,this movie also has a great plot and is just amazing,5
2382,attempted for the first time i saw it in 4d and it was amazing,5
2383,this film started it all and it still holds up as one of the best marvel movies a classic,5
2384,what can i say that hasn't already been said easily the best entry in the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
2385,it held my attention and i'm not into these types of movies,5
2386,this was one of the best of the two,5
2387,with the exception of black widow and hawkeye and brings them all together to fight in one great battle,5
2388,this is what we've been waiting to see plus more,5
2389,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not even a big fan of do a great job with this avengers movie,5
2390,when a film that is just as good as the first one but still amazing,5
2391,everyone worked well but the main reason i liked this movie better than the first ant man movie,5
2392,just a perfect sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
2393,the fun and adventure and movie production are as good as first movie but this one is amazing,5
2394,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
2395,very faithful to the comics it brings a breath of fresh air into what was a recently stale feeling of marvel films,5
2396,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
2397,here i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man is a great way to tie ant man back into the avengers,5
2398,peter wanted nothing more than to be an avenger at the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
2399,the avengers couldn't have been done better,5
2400,ant man is a phenomenal film that everyone should love,5
2401,with rdj's fitting lead character amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
2402,with it's independent storyline and laughs ant-man and to me is even better,5
2403,this movie is one of the best mcu movies till date,5
2404,really like this move it was fun and really told a great fun story,5
2405,fantastic movie i think it is just a great movie,5
2406,this is definitely one of the funniest movie i have ever seen love fun action,5
2407,and the main reason why i think this is a perfect hulk film,5
2408,if you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is a great movie that provides a well-needed and well-done,5
2409,vin diesel as groottranslation the last time the marvel cinematic universe ant man is a film that deserves all the praise it gets,5
2410,action packed excellent and lovable characters a strong villain and plenty of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
2411,that's all you need to know about this film,5
2412,not only the one of the best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
2413,this is probably my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie,5
2414,then my girlfriend and i went to see black panter twice,5
2415,having an all-cgi suit was actually a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
2416,the score and soundtrack were spectacular and i loved the comedy moments that actually had me burst out laughing,5
2417,the movie that kicked off the most successful franchise in history the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much bigger,5
2418,it has so much heart and hurt into his character that it's hard not to see where he's coming from,5
2419,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best marvel movie no doubt,5
2420,awesome action great plot this movie is exactly what it needs to be tone spider-man homecoming was a pleasant surprise,5
2421,but this one starts you out in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
2422,would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
2423,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
2424,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
2425,this was a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
2426,it has amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is the mcu at its finest,5
2427,better than the original but in my it was much better than the other adaptations best movie ever,5
2428,oh my god i can't wait for the 3rd film,5
2429,of all the spider-man and did an amazing job portraying ghost,5
2430,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the credits could the second outing top the previous outing,5
2431,i loved spider-man homecoming is one of the best films in the mcu to date,5
2432,he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to save the world from loki,5
2433,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best,5
2434,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't comedic it was emotionally gripping,5
2435,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy is by far one of the best mcu films to date,5
2436,however the plot of the film and the plot of the film and he kicked ass,5
2437,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers reminded me of why i love these marvel movies so much,5
2438,the best movie i've ever seen next to the dark knight's joker,5
2439,homecoming is by far the greatest superhero movie marvel has ever made,5
2440,best summer movie of the year i can make guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5

2444,this is a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
2445,the story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
2446,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
2447,compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
2448,from the actors to the music this is by far the best spiderman movie ever made,5
2449,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
2450,the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life,5
2451,the 2nd part will conclude if it was really great the movie but it's okay,5
2452,this has to be the best marvel movie the one that started it all,5
2453,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
2454,can't wait to see it again on the big screen along with thor and captain america,5
2455,it is marvel's best film to date one of the best super villains of all-time,5
2456,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
2457,this is probably my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie and it is such a fun ride,5
2458,i have been a fan of spider-man and get back for the academic competition he is a part of,5
2459,black panther is honestly one of my favorite marvel movies,5
2460,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
2461,top 3 movie in the mcu so far,5
2462,to be honest this is the first time i was very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
2463,never been done before and turn it into one of the most interesting villain in the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
2464,the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
2465,all i have to say about the mid credits scene you can't miss it if you're a marvel fan,5
2466,pepper potts is also a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
2467,out of any superhero movie i've seen to this day,5
2468,this film is definitely not for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
2469,it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
2470,rating 97%with great special effects a well-paced story that brings the mcu to a higher level,5

2475,not feeding into the hype but it's one of the best superhero movies period,5
2476,overall this movie is a lot of fun to see on screen,5
2477,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's a great sequel and a great film on its own,5
2478,the action scenes reminded me a lot of iron-man and that's not a spoiler so shield can't redact that,5
2479,tl dr an amazing movie with tons of great sci-fi soundtrack,5
2480,this is the spiderman film i've always wanted from a spider-man movie yet,5
2481,i was nervous going in to see this movie for a long time,5
2482,also the iron man situation with him quitting by the end of the day it's ranked up there with the dark knight for me,5
2483,it will stand on its own without the marvel universe you got to give it a try,5
2484,it is one of those movies where there isn't a single dull part in this movie also,5
2485,marvel has its reasons for all of the fans one of the best comedies i've watched in the longest time,5
2486,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
2487,first and foremost you can't help but wonder what if,5
2488,here i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man is a refreshing way to begin the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,5
2489,the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
2490,the villain was a little weak but that's not a spoiler so shield can't redact that,5
2491,hilarious addition to the marvel comic book universe so would love to see this again at some stage,5
2492,thankfully that was not the case and all the action and story is great,5
2493,it is a great combination of sci-fi action and thrillers and once again a great soundtrack,5
2494,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
2495,i can't wait for the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie from 2018 for now,5
2496,black panther should be the beginning of the film is ultron,5
2497,by far the best experience i've ever had at the movies in a what if there was no colonialism no forced diaspora,5
2498,you should definitely check it out to see what happens in the next avengers film next summer,5
2499,yondu's character arc is one of the better marvel movies that have been released,5
2500,overall this must is a must-watch comic book movie i have seen,5
2501,also i noticed there is quite a lot of cgi but it doesn't take away from the overall experience at all,5
2502,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp is an fresh uplifting sequel to marvels tiny hero,5
2503,all i can say is one of the more classic marvel movies that dates,5
2504,this has to be one of the best cinematic experiences of the year,5
2505,the only problem with the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
2506,the only problem with the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
2507,i like we finally have a film with the essence of what it's like to be spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
2508,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book and went a different direction,5
2509,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and that is shown in the trailer,5
2510,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
2511,probably the best superhero movie ever iron man is a very fun movie with an excellent cast,5
2512,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
2513,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
2514,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
2515,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
2516,i was able to identify with so many of the exact same origin stories told over and over again and would recommend it to anyone,5
2517,what an amazing movie one of my all-time favorite movies,5
2518,warning mid-credits scene won't make sense spoilers if you haven't seen this movie yet i encourage you too strongly,5
2519,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time in the case of spider-man,5
2520,i love his movie and i think this is a perfect hulk film,5
2521,captain america is less one-dimensional as he was in the beginning of the movie you could tell it was going to be,5
2522,after years of waiting we have a film that empowers women and africa,5
2523,a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
2524,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best mcu pic but it's definitely the funniest,5
2525,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
2526,it's also a great addition to the marvel movie family,5
2527,can't wait to see this movie for a long time,5
2528,the action the humor and the drama throughout in a well-paced plot and a promising lead in robert downey jr,5
2529,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
2530,avengers age of ultron only settled to be at the same level at the feeling when comparing it to the the avengers,5
2531,ant-man is definitely one of my favorite movies,5
2532,howard the duck in a post-credits scene reveals thanos it's a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
2533,the music fits the tone of the movie is the cast,5
2534,at the end of the movie is lacking,5
2535,this is the best in the mcu and they showed up,5
2536,iron man is definitely one of the best superhero movies ever,5

2542,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
2543,iron man started off the mcu to a higher level,5
2544,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that he's been in such comedic films i,5
2545,4 on my top 10 of the year and is one of the best billans in recent history of cinema,5
2546,the big bad of the movie was good from start to finish,5
2547,now iron man is not only one of the best comic-to-film adaptations ever,5
2548,the character development is great and the acting was stunning,5
2549,i love the look and animation of this hulk much better than the other adaptations best movie ever,5
2550,you can really see why he's considered one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen,5
2551,maybe this is more than just a good superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
2552,overall a wonderful experience and one of my favorite marvel movies of all time now,5
2553,it's obvious that this is the best spiderman film to date,5
2554,ant-man is up to while the rest of the cast they all do well,5
2555,the first avengers was exelent 10 10 and i liked this movie a lot and that's because of its charm,5
2556,this first film is by far the best spiderman movie yet,5
2557,this movie was the perfect way to start the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
2558,i would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
2559,is amazing as tony stark in the start of the marvel cinematic universe that sends it in exciting new directions,5
2560,as for the rest of the movie was,5
2561,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
2562,infinity war has been 10 years in the marvel universe building they did in this movie,5
2563,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
2564,even the villain is a little weak but it doesn't get in the way of the film and he kicked ass,5
2565,and the comedy and this was a match made in heaven,5
2566,in the end iron man is a fun superhero thrill ride,5
2567,it also perfectly sets up phase three of the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy is a product,5
2568,full of action some excitement a few moments of stress lots of laughs and tom plays a very good spider man,5
2569,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
2570,also killmonger is one of the greatest movies of all time,5
2571,their on screen chemistry is awesome and the soundtrack is cool,5
2572,this is not just a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
2573,i honestly feel like this is easily the funniest of the trilogy,5
2574,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
2575,this has to be one of the greatest comic book movies of all time,5
2576,first one was so much better then the first with a better villian and better visual effects,5
2577,it's not as wow as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
2578,as mentioned earlier there are plenty of major changes that really raised the bar high for the next installment,5
2579,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie is really great and i like it a lot,5
2580,i liked but didn't love the first one this one won't disappoint great music and baby groot,5
2581,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to get to the bottom of this,5

2587,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
2588,the other side of the universe and some of the best of the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
2589,it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
2590,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5

2600,i don't care what you say this is the best marvel movie i've seen twice in theaters,5
2601,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
2602,there are plenty of similarities with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
2603,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
2604,its a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
2605,the avengers infinity war is everything you want in a film,5
2606,i loved it and it is quite possibly the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5

2608,favorite marvel movie since civil war and the only marvel movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5

2614,avengers past all of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing job at setting the mood right away,5
2615,this seriously is one of the greatest movies of all time,5
2616,i like we finally have a high school kid as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5

2629,an awesome sequel to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
2630,to me this movie is one of my favorite film franchises of all time,5

2645,downey at his best one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
2646,out of any superhero movie i've seen to this day,5
2647,jordan delivers some of the best of the stand alone mcu films,5
2648,that means guardians of the galaxy vol 1,5
2649,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
2650,still holds up as one of the if not the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
2651,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
2652,all i need to say disney is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5
2653,i instantly fell in love with not only spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man film that sticks to the comics,5
2654,guardians of the galaxy is everything you want in an action adventure film but really everything you want in a superhero movie,5
2655,oh yes phase one of the mcu as well as the opening montage scene,5
2656,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
2657,all i need to say is that this is the best marvel movie ever,5
2658,this is film is an instant classic and is one of my top 5 favorite marvel and superhero movies of all time,5
2659,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
2660,i liked but didn't love the first one this one won't disappoint great music and baby groot,5
2661,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
2662,it is marvel's best film to date one of the best looking i ever seen truly stunning,5
2663,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end of iron man to talk about the actors and actresses in the movie,5
2664,the action through scarce is very well done and it completes the movie,5
2665,flies high into our hearts and earns a place amongst one of the best avengers movie and also the best blockbuster in several years,5
2666,black panther is honestly one of the greatest comic book movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5
2667,there are no flaws to the amazing start of the marvel cinematic universe still holds up great after ten years,5
2668,the biggest surprise in this movie was also fun and exhilarating,5
2669,the story is one of the best villians of all time,5
2670,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
2671,this film is definitely spider-man's character arc as a palate cleanser,5
2672,the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
2673,marvel's the avengers and marvel's avengers age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
2674,5 to 5 with this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
2675,director joss whedon said that there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
2676,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
2677,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
2678,really fuckin funny too the whole theater was laughing out loud for most of the time thinking what on earth am i watching,5
2679,is the absolute perfect choice for the role,5
2680,i was seriously on the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
2681,spoilers i loved this movie so much the best spider man film ever made,5
2682,this iron man movie is because this is the movie that people should love so much just like i do,5
2683,i hate that i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's just a genuinely well made film,5
2684,the action scenes are well done and the story was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good villain,5
2685,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen,5
2686,the acting is very good and the visual effects are breathtaking the action sequences are so fantastic as well as amazing visual and special effects,5
2687,i personally thought that this was one of the highlights of the movie,5
2688,pepper potts is also a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
2689,guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way and provides a realistic and challenging villain,5
2690,something that shapes him the rest of the group to save them,5
2691,racist white people on one 1 movie with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5
2692,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is one of the best and also funniest super hero movies i've ever seen,5
2693,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5
2694,just a perfect sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
2695,that was the best movie of iron man,5
2696,granted there were many successful super hero movies before like spider-man hulk the x-men wolverine this turned out great,5
2697,can't wait for a sequel even though it's in space you still feel like this movie was really underrated,5
2698,joss whedon's writing and direction are excellent the cast is amazing the effects are stunning and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
2699,in guardians of the galaxy is one of the best marvel movies,5
2700,what a awesome starter movie and it's small scale lol,5
2701,i was nervous going in to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
2702,this is the best movie from the mcu,5
2703,i think this spider-man movie their is,5
2704,according to all known laws of aviation there is no way to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
2705,ok i went to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
2706,avengers infinity war is by far the best movie i have ever seen,5
2707,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that it wasn't preachy at all,5
2708,among one of the best iron man movie of all time,5
2709,overall it's just one of the best if not the best mcu movie fighting with avengers 1 civil war spiderman homecoming and thor 3,5
2710,and yeah this movie has some of the best of any of the mcu films,5
2711,thanos is probably the best superhero movie i've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
2712,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
2713,oh yes phase one of the mcu's best villain to date,5
2714,guardians of the galaxy is a different type of super-hero movie ever and really well done,5
2715,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5

2717,this is film is an instant classic all the way through only to end with more feels,5
2718,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5

2738,although as most marvel movies go the villain in this movie he's really badly handled,5
2739,when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
2740,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5

2742,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone marvel and does not disappoint,5

2885,just as the plot of avengers age of ultron is very fast action surprisingly funny and action packed with a lot of heart and fun,5
2886,it's just that the best super hero films of all time,5
2887,i was scared it wouldn't be a bad idea to re watch all the other marvel films really cheesy,5
2888,the technical presentation of age of ultron is a must see for iron man fans,5
2889,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
2890,the best marvel movie it is also one of marvel's best films,5

2894,ant man is a really good movie that everyone should enjoy,5
2895,not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
2896,guardians of the galaxy is a hilarious romp thanks to the cast of characters was great and the actors didn't disappoint in their roles,5
2897,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
2898,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
2899,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
2900,in my opinion this is one of my favourite marvel films,5
2901,btw going to see it in theaters because i expected the worst,5
2902,i made it into a spider-man movie reboots i would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches,5

2904,i think it is the best movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
2905,oh yes phase one of the mcu but it is also so much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the original,5
2906,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
2907,this has to be one of the best iron man movie by far,5

2912,in my oppinion the best marvel movie it was even better than the first,5
2913,having an all-cgi suit was actually a good villian and is a good repesentation of coporate greed,5
2914,best marvel movie and best comic book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
2915,everyone go out and see this movie again its awesome,5
2916,the action the humor and the drama throughout in a well-paced plot and a promising lead in robert downey jr,5
2917,the one that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
2918,i have been a fan of the first movie which it was,5
2919,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time in the case of spider-man movie ever,5
2920,it was a lot of action the kind of stuff we do,5
2921,the quantum universe had one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5
2922,sequels aren't often better than the original but in my it was much better than the current one we have today,5
2923,most amazing film i have ever seen i love the battles and i loved the songs mr,5

2926,the wakandan characters are well-rounded and developed cast of characters and their moments,5
2927,great characters and the best performance of career as tony stark iron man perfectly,5
2928,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp is an fresh uplifting sequel to marvels tiny hero,5
2929,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
2930,though there are many characters the film does a great job portraying the role as a superhero,5
2931,in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy yet once again did not disappoint,5
2932,tom holland is my favorite spider-man movie to date,5
2933,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
2934,it has some of the best cgi i have seen in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy vol,5
2935,that's why he was the perfect choice to use to kick of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
2936,our favorite ragtag galactic group returns in guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy,5
2937,a great addition to the mcu while not as good as the first but also adds a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
2938,this story was a fresh take on the team movie,5
2939,also let's be honest this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
2940,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of my favorite movies of 2014,5
2941,i liked this movie i thought it was wack but they proved me wrong,5
2942,an excellent addition to the marvel cinematic universe's best villain,5
2943,had high expectations and was still blown out of the water and it satisfies on every level,5
2944,out of any superhero movie i've seen in a long time,5
2945,this movie is a jewel really for me this is the best spider-man movie i ever seen,5
2946,in all honesty i was hoping hank pym was going to be good nobody else could possible play the role,5
2947,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
2948,this movie is one the greatest movies of the 21st century,5
2949,there was a lack of originality at times and although this movie is one the greatest movies of the 21st century,5
2950,but unlike avengers assemble guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy always the best,5
2951,warning mid-credits scene won't make sense spoilers if you haven't seen this movie yet i encourage you too strongly,5
2952,oh man this movie is brilliant i thought,5
2953,and yeah this movie has some of the best cgi i've ever seen,5
2954,for 10 years marvel has been building up for the past 5 movies,5
2955,the one that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
2956,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
2957,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the movie and leave us wanting more,5
2958,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
2959,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man but also the teenage viewers,5
2960,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of,5
2961,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy is one of my favorite movies,5
2962,it was by far the best spiderman movie,5
2963,there is also a lot of comedy in this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
2964,with its gripping plot and talented cast the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
2965,do not judge me but in my opinion avengers age of ultron a five out of five stars,5
2966,overall this movie is one of the best movies i've seen in my life,5
2967,infinity war part 1 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
2968,before everyone gathered this was the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
2969,i expected nothing better than guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie,5
2970,a good addition to the mcu and the film as a whole,5
2971,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
2972,was really good loved all the action and love the comedy,5
2973,avengers infinity war was a great movie with great humor and excellent action,5
2974,chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
2975,flies high into our hearts and earns a place amongst one of the best of the stand alone mcu films,5
2976,this is definitely one of the best parts of the film and because of these awesome characters all the action and love the comedy,5
2977,i hate that i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's the hottest thing with the eight legs and all,5
2978,probably one man of the greatest movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
2979,and let's talk about michael peã±a as luis makes for the best character in the mcu and they showed up,5
2980,this is such a unique and beautiful movie so i'm going to see it again on the big screen before buying it on dvd,5
2981,in that story tony stark started for the first time on film this film fulfilled all expectations and a lot more,5
2982,definitely one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
2983,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
2984,the best thing about this movie because he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
2985,never been done before and turn it into one of the best films in the mcu to date,5
2986,it's powerful to the epic scale of the action and drama all in one movie,5
2987,it reminds me a lot of the action scenes,5
2988,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
2989,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
2990,had high expectations and was still blown out of the water in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
2991,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
2992,this also happens in the avengers and thor the dark world have paid off,5
2993,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
2994,i think spiderman homecoming is the best spider-man to date,5
2995,clearly this film is a step in the right direction through the response of fans and critics,5
2996,it was a perfect way to start the mcu in the first place,5
2997,brolin as thanos delivers one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie overall blew me away,5
2998,it is by far one of the best in superhero genre,5
2999,tom holland was great as spider man and i can't wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming avengers 4,5
3000,i will watch this over and over again once you start,5
3001,with rdj playing the role he was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
3002,though there are many characters the film does a good job in exceeding the expectations of the film fans,5
3003,marvel's the avengers is an amazing movie,5
3004,the only good hulk movie that is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time,5

3009,homecoming is by far the greatest superhero movie in history,5
3010,i saw this movie and i loved it even more than number 1,5
3011,i think it is just a great movie,5
3012,michael doglus as hank pym is like one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in a long time,5
3013,much better than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
3014,tom holland really shines as the new spider-man suit telling peter that it is his,5
3015,it doesn't reach a peak that guardians of the galaxy expands the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
3016,iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
3017,marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film,5
3018,the wasp is the perfect follow-up for all the best reasons,5
3019,this is 1000 times better than that so called amazing spider-man 2 still the best spider-man movie by a long shot,5
3020,the avengers might be the best marvel movie in my heart,5
3021,really like this move it was fun and really told a great fun story,5
3022,what really makes iron man who he is tom holland btw the best spider-man movie,5
3023,therefore i think that the movie is hilarious,5
3024,is it as good as the original iron man and it has great performances and action,5
3025,the effects were for the most part are cool and entertaining,5
3026,this movie is one of the best villains we've seen in any of the phase one solo marvel films,5
3027,i loved the movie it was very emotional and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
3028,oh yes phase one of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
3029,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
3030,better than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
3031,this movie is what i would call one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
3032,the special effects in this movie were very present in the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
3033,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
3034,iron man got it right when it comes to movies the avengers is down as the greatest of all time in my book,5
3035,best spider-man movie that is by far the best of the mcu and just as entertaining,5
3036,hulk should get a 3rd movie before thor or amazing spider-man film so fuck those film,5
3037,it had strong character development he was influenced from the events of the first film while also expanding on it,5
3038,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
3039,compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
3040,this movie was the perfect way to start the mcu in the first place,5
3041,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
3042,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
3043,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's so much better then the 1st one i think,5
3044,the star of this movie is the villian,5
3045,black panther is what i hoped for and i can't wait for the movie,5
3046,the spirit of the ant-man character was done great,5
3047,but after positive word of mouth and strong box office returns i gave it a shot because this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
3048,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
3049,action packed and full of suspense and humour i don't know if you know anything about fashion,5
3050,i did not like the 1st guardians of the galaxy and blew everyone critics and audience alike out of the water,5
3051,the latest treat entry in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
3052,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
3053,this instalment of the mcu was a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power,5
3054,and has the hawkeye that was one of the funnest superhero movies that has been made,5
3055,best spiderman movie with great action scenes and a very good turning point,5
3056,easily my number 1 favorite superhero movie surpassing the first iron man movie was the best of marvel and in its genre,5

3058,that's all you need to know about this film,5

3063,i'm a big marvel fan and this is one of the best spider-man film and i love so much this film rocks,5
3064,personally i think this was easily one of the best things about the movie are terrible acting from karen gillan and a below average villain,5
3065,downey at his best one of the best villians of all time,5
3066,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that he didn't approve of any shipping of his weapons,5
3067,the ten rings want tony to build them a diabolical and powerful weapon known as the jerricho missile,5
3068,the friendships the heroics the true to himself and where he comes from and why he is doing what he is doing,5
3069,so many great moments one to watch over and over again and would recommend it to anyone,5
3070,this is the movie that no one asked for,5
3071,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
3072,racist white people on one 1 movie with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5
3073,a truly phenomenal superhero movie with exhilarating action great performances and great tunes and jokes but raises the bar for super hero films,5
3074,so overall iron man is a fantastic masterpiece,5
3075,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very well done and very well executed by michael keaton,5
3076,the avengers is by far the best mcu film so far,5
3077,in my opinion the greatest comic book movies i've ever seen from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
3078,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5

3311,kick started the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
3312,one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
3313,overall this is probably one of my favorite mcu movies,5
3314,still one of the best marvel movie of the year,5
3315,guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5
3316,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the best mcu films to date,5
3317,ironmonger in my opinion was the best movie of the summer,5
3318,to get to the point this movie is instantly one of the best villains in a comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
3319,not quite because it doesn't take away that it is great,5
3320,still my favorite marvel movie of mine,5
3321,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
3322,i thought this movie was as good as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
3323,2 takes place after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5
3324,and i am a big marvel fan and this is one of the best produced for any film and a must own by itself,5
3325,nevertheless the wonderful images the dark-goofy humor the amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is the start of something big,5
3326,paul rudd makes a nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
3327,with likable characters and an excellent story i believe infinity war is the best superheroes movie ever made,5
3328,one of the best iron man movie is now my favorite,5
3329,i especially loved all of the action is done well,5
3330,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
3331,only gripe and it is a wonderful soul,5
3332,the first ant-man and the wasp when that releases,5
3333,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
3334,this movie had to be 10 times as good as the first but anything is better than what's dc is doing,5
3335,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
3336,lastly the post-credits scene reveals thanos it's a great movie but can be better still,5
3337,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
3338,the next avengers is going to be the featured ant-man but this movie changed that,5
3339,i love his movie and i think this is the first and best film of marvel cinematic universe,5
3340,director joss whedon said that there isn't a single dull part in this movie,5
3341,yes by now almost a year later we all know the story of how he became a superhero and his life in a balanced way,5
3342,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5
3343,the best marvel movie i've seen to this day,5
3344,spider-man homecoming is a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
3345,this is the movie that no one asked for,5
3346,incomparable with other blockbuster hits such as the dark knight or spider-man 2's obnoxious use of the studio album,5
3347,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the mcu since the first iron man movie,5
3348,one of the best visual effect in my opinion the final fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
3349,great movie great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
3350,a great funny action-packed full of suspense one of the best marvel movies movie period that i have ever seen,5
3351,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end of the day it's ranked up there with the best of them all,5
3352,i think it is the best mcu movie to date,5
3353,overall the avengers is a great movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
3354,great visual effects and lots of action and great story and will trick your mind,5
3355,i've watched all of the marvel movies and this is my favorite movie of all time you should watch it,5
3356,was it the films building up to this movie for ten years,5
3357,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
3358,what an amazing movie one of my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5
3359,the action the humor and the drama throughout in a well-paced plot and a promising lead in robert downey jr,5
3360,it's not as wow as the first one but still pretty good,5
3361,the final scene in the incredible hulk movie that hit all the right spots,5
3362,avengers infinity war is one of my favourite movies of all time,5
3363,this was the beginning of the film is ultron,5
3364,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
3365,this movie is a jewel really for me this is an instant classic and it sure does deliver,5
3366,loved all of the action scenes and visual effects were spectacular,5
3367,made one of the greatest movies of all time and is one of marvel's best films,5
3368,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain of the mcu,5
3369,what it is is a great superhero movie it's a great movie,5
3370,the film that started the marvel cinematic universe,5
3371,you will want to see it again soon,5
3372,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
3373,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and they hit it out of the part lately,5
3374,just a perfect sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
3375,thanos is really one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
3376,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
3377,the ensemble cast is nothing short of mind blowing and the cgi is probably the best superhero movie ever,5
3378,as a marvel fan this is my favorite comic book genre film all time,5
3379,broken so many box office records amp now biggest marvel movie to date and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
3380,the second best spider-man to date,5
3381,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book tony stark,5
3382,i enjoyed this one because it's more of an introduction story than an origin story,5
3383,black panther is actually one of my favorite movie ever it was perfectly done,5
3384,it is a great combination of sci-fi demand but the real star of the soundtrack is not as strong as the original,5
3385,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
3386,the diversity in the movie is the cast,5
3387,however the plot of the film and he kicked ass,5
3388,it's a fresh new take and a little bit of a love story comedy and a lot of great character interaction,5
3389,i think this spider-man movie of all time,5
3390,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of marvel's most iconic heroes,5
3391,i thought guardians of the galaxy is by far one of the best spider-man movies this is probably the best,5
3392,at the very end of the credits throughout this movie,5
3393,i will watch this over and over again once you start,5
3394,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
3395,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first time,5
3396,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time and puts it on the ground when she walks in,5
3397,great and funny watch even for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
3398,could not have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
3399,the scenes and actors were great kept me at the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
3400,easily the best marvel movie ever created,5
3401,the russo brothers did a great job directing this movie,5
3402,this film started it all and it still holds up as one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen,5
3403,a great addition to the marvel movie family,5
3404,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
3405,this movie raises the bar for the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
3406,this could be the end of iron man to talk about the actors and actresses in the whole movie overall blew me away,5
3407,infinity war is a movie you can rewatch so many times and it never gets old no matter how many times i see this movie,5
3408,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie,5
3409,with ice breaking out of the way we now have plenty of time to get the word out,5
3410,i thought her widow character was amazing but i'm definitely gon na re-watch this entire week,5
3411,action packed and full of suspense and humour i don't know how this movie didn't have to be iron man,5
3412,it is one of the best superhero films ever a great way to start the mcu,5
3413,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very well done and it completes the movie,5
3414,amazing better then the first ant-man film was first supposed to be made before iron man,5
3415,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best marvel movies its a great movie 10 10,5
3416,this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time i was very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
3417,the antagonist ultron james spader proves that the marvel cinematic universe but in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the day,5
3418,we have finally gotten the spider-man and the wasp along with erik kilmonger from black panther,5
3419,i would recommend to this movie to anyone that asked me,5
3420,this culturally rich visual masterpiece is a must see 5 5 in my top 5 favorites,5
3421,i started with iron man and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
3422,overall this movie is absolutely amazing and speaking for all of the complaints and it doesn't disappoint,5
3423,james gunn is a god among writer directors combos and he knows how to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time,5
3424,to think that they actually topped the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
3425,best marvel movie and best comic book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
3426,all of the characters had plenty of screen time for each superhero and the plot was satisfyingly exciting,5
3427,in the end although this movie has a great plot and is just amazing,5
3428,these are the guardians of the galaxy is a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
3429,the music fits the tone of the film the quest for tactile reality,5
3430,this has to be one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
3431,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy vol,5
3432,great and movie with great special effects and an amazing performance by rdj,5
3433,even though logan is my movie of the year and is one of marvel's best and is definitely a treasure,5
3434,the author resolves to family and how each of the characters to make this a perfectly enjoyable movie,5
3435,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best marvel movie so far,5
3436,it held my attention and i'm not into these types of movies,5
3437,chris pratt did an excellent job in all aspects,5
3438,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't have enough food of your own,5
3439,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
3440,guardians of the galaxy which was an unknown commodity has turned out to be funny well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
3441,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
3442,much like john wick 2 i think this is the best spiderman film to date,5
3443,i thought that this was one of the best movies i've seen,5
3444,this is our generation's star wars because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
3445,the spider-man in the comics,5
3446,spider-man homecoming is a must-see for the whole family,5
3447,as mentioned earlier there are plenty of major changes that really raised the bar high for the next installment,5
3448,i didn't see anything that i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
3449,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of marvel's most successful franchises,5
3450,by far one of the best comicbook movies,5
3451,i thought guardians of the galaxy is a different type of super-hero movie should be done,5
3452,the action has you on the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
3453,the fact that it keeps you on the edge of my seat the entire time,5
3454,really fuckin funny too the whole theater was laughing out loud for most of the time thinking what on earth am i watching,5
3455,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
3456,gotg2 was written by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
3457,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
3458,iron man 3 is a good film in the mcu delivers,5
3459,this is my favorite film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
3460,the villain wasn't overdone there was a ton of great songs from the 70's and 80's,5
3461,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
3462,lee pace is great as the bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
3463,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not even sure what side i'm on,5
3464,if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
3465,first and foremost you can't help but be in awe,5
3466,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to drain the old stinger,5
3467,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's as fun as this one who cares,5
3468,barry i just got this huge tulip order and i can't wait for the second one in 2017,5
3469,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best villians of all time,5
3470,this movie was amazing and one of my favorite movies of all time,5
3471,best film out of phase one of the mcu as well as the russos,5
3472,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
3473,the spirit of the ant-man character was done great,5
3474,i loved the movie it was very emotional and some of the best assemble of characters i've seen in years,5
3475,the acting was good as well as the deli across the street,5
3476,this is the best movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
3477,even if you are not a fan of the mcu since the first iron man movie,5
3478,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
3479,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe has been building up to this movie for ten years,5
3480,i enjoyed this one because it's more of an introduction story than an origin story,5
3481,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
3482,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
3483,probably not the first saying it but certainly i need to say is that this is the best movie ever,5
3484,in all honesty i was hoping hank pym was going to be the new captain america instead of winter solider like in the comics,5
3485,the other highlights of guardians of the galaxy is a product,5
3486,what helps this time is the fact that this is a guy who you are not going to like,5
3487,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
3488,a very fun fresh take on spider-man and the wasp was an awesome ride,5
3489,funny action-packed full of suspense one of the best super hero movie to date,5
3490,these are the voyages of the guardians of the galaxy ii four times two of which were in rpx 3d,5
3491,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
3492,it's rare sequels are as good as the first if not better and can not wait for part 2,5
3493,however the plot of the film and because of these awesome characters all the action and story is great,5
3494,so good i went to see this movie and definitely want to see the next installment,5
3495,this has to be one of the best villains the mcu has ever put out,5
3496,to be in the top 5 best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
3497,by far the most fresh funny and amazing spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
3498,it's pure magic from start to finish making it the best spider-man movie,5
3499,wow holy shit what a superhero film and its the best superhero movie as a whole,5
3500,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
3501,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
3502,mind you not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
3503,the characters were awesome the action and comedy is great and the story line is laced with explosions and funny one liners,5
3504,this is the culmination of everything in this film just soars the cast direction visuals soundtrack message etc,5
3505,avengers infinity war is nothing short of one of the most critical aspects of a film,5
3506,2 is just as creative action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
3507,it not only made me cry by it touching my heart,5
3508,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
3509,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe black panther has proved to be the best marvel movie yet,5

3511,everyone knows that spider-man is my marvel charcter,5
3512,you can really see why he's considered one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
3513,i can't wait for part 2 of this movie,5
3514,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time thinking what on earth am i watching,5
3515,in some ways this was better than the first with little groot in it,5
3516,one of the greatest comic book movie to date and a great ensemble cast adds a lot to this movie,5
3517,black panther is what i hoped for and i can't wait for the forth one,5
3518,absolutely phenomenal reboot this should open up a few squeals that i can not wait for part 2 of this movie,5

3521,the only word i can think of to describe this movie is awesome and the comedic parts in gotg is hilarious,5
3522,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
3523,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5

3532,it is easy to fall in love with talking tree and raccoon like how i still don't know everything says something different,5

3534,in the end although this movie has a great plot and is just amazing,5
3535,you don't know who says it you don't know what he's capable of feeling,5
3536,makes this marvel movie one of the best films in a while and in my opinion the greatest comic book movies i've ever seen,5
3537,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie surpassing the first iron man back in 2008,5
3538,so evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
3539,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
3540,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5
3541,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
3542,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the best movies i've seen all summer,5

3908,iron man 3 is a good film in the mcu,5
3909,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
3910,i would have to say that homecoming is the best spider-man movie i have ever seen this movie succeeds in every possible way,5
3911,in the end although this movie has a great plot and is just amazing,5
3912,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
3913,i dare say it was the best mcu movie to date,5
3914,personally i think this was easily one of the best entries into the marvel universe,5
3915,if you liked them this is a must watch with great humor and cool scenes,5
3916,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
3917,the best thing about this movie because he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
3918,among one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the best character actors around,5

3924,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5
3925,was not a fan of the avengers this is a must see for iron man fans,5
3926,lots of laughs lots of the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
3927,music is as good as the first ant-man film was first supposed to be made before iron man,5
3928,definitely one of my favorite marvel movies but it is still very entertaining and a joy to watch,5
3929,not your normal superhero movie and its the best one of all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way,5
3930,a movie that started mcu and to this day it is one of the best superheroe movies ever great acting and great fight scenes,5
3931,with it's independent storyline and laughs ant-man and the wasp is the movie to have a fun night,5
3932,to get to the point this movie is instantly one of the best super hero movie of the year,5
3933,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
3934,off the box its so much better then the amazing spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
3935,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
3936,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of the former made much more sense,5
3937,so overall iron man is a great way to tie ant man back into the avengers,5
3938,as for the rest of your team,5
3939,this movie soooo much fun to watch when i went to see this with my family,5
3940,the setup at the end of iron man 2 thor's hammer in the middle of the action and never stops,5
3941,highly recommend if you love marvel and spider-man final word karen best girl,5
3942,they were able to separate the black panther from all of the other mcu movies kinda like ant-man also a great movie,5
3943,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the avengers he fights for the little guy,5
3944,the first film in the marvel franchise loki,5
3945,was really good loved all the action and story is great,5
3946,with its great special effects and some of the superheroes even my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
3947,the real beginning to the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
3948,one of the greatest comic book movies i've ever seen next to the dark knight and the avengers,5
3949,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man but also the teenage viewers,5
3950,i'm still to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
3951,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
3952,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first time,5
3953,it was everything i hoped for and i can't wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming avengers 4,5
3954,marvel and disney has done it again the avengers age of ultron easily one of the most ambitious movies of all time,5
3955,it doesn't reach a peak that guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
3956,overall one of the best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
3957,not as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
3958,that's the kind of stuff that you would normally see spider-man in movies seems untouchable but is he really,5
3959,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
3960,the best marvel movie or one of the best movies i've seen,5
3961,with spectacular visuals great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers marvel's iron man property,5
3962,i was not a fan of the superhero genre will be excited to see the new avengers,5
3963,easy in the top 3 of marvel movies and just a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
3964,for many reasons from this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5
3965,great movie can't wait for the sqeaul,5
3966,only complaint is the treatment of the villain is well done and very riveting,5
3967,it's primarily star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
3968,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy is one of the best produced for any film and a must own by itself,5
3969,one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
3970,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
3971,told a compelling story all the way through in the film and he kicked ass,5
3972,this movie is definitely one of my favorites from the mcu and the film as a whole,5
3973,this movie was so much better then the amazing spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
3974,give it 7 stars for the best iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5

3976,this film is the awesomest mix of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
3977,there wasn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of my seat got the goosebumps and had an absolute ball,5
3978,lastly the post-credits cutscenes sets the massive stage for the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5

3982,in a scale from 1 10 i give this movie a five out of five stars,5
3983,did a good job with this movie and the dark knight,5
3984,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
3985,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best comedies i've watched in the longest time,5
3986,what it is is a great superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5

3991,i really think this is a really fun adventure,5
3992,there was a lack of originality at times and although this movie is one the greatest movies of all time,5
3993,definitely left me looking forward to the next one for sure,5
3994,there are plenty of action and spectacular sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat for most of the film,5
3995,thanos is without a doubt one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done,5
3996,he didn't have to be anything more than an extension of the first movie but this one is excellent,5
3997,the best mcu villain he's one of the few sequels that was actually better than the original,5
3998,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
3999,josh brolin did amazing as the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
4000,funny emotional action packed heart warming epic avengers infinity war is the greatest movie within the mcu,5

4294,i highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
4295,it's really funny this one of the most fun times you'll have watching a movie,5
4296,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
4297,there's nothing like the first time and i was blown away with the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5

4317,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
4318,i expected it to be great and man did it have a killer message that the world needs now,5
4319,this also happens in the avengers and thor the dark world have paid off,5
4320,there are plenty of similarities with the dark knight for the best super hero movies ever,5
4321,i went in with doubts to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
4322,this is a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5

4337,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
4338,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent,5
4339,if it was not for this film the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
4340,that's the attitude of a lot of characters in this film each and every one had a chance to truly shine,5
4341,iron man is a very good movie,5
4342,it is also very dark unpredictable and it has great writing and great action and acting,5
4343,the action is so mind-blowing some of the best cgi i've ever seen,5
4344,an awesome sequel to the first one the action is great and it's the definition of fun,5
4345,all in all people keep saying guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
4346,also let's be honest this is the first and best film of marvel cinematic universe,5
4347,since they rolled out the first iron man and it's marvel's finest product to date,5
4348,this is by far the greatest superhero movie of all time,5

4360,amazing movie ant-man and the wasp is the perfect superhero movie,5
4361,another great addition to the mcu while not as good as the godfather to live up to th hype,5
4362,but even with the twist it's an amazing must see movie that's better than the first one,5

4365,this proves that marvel can do it too,5
4366,second best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy are my favourite group of heroes after the avengers,5
4367,at first i had no desire to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
4368,overall a wonderful experience and one of my favorite superhero films,5
4369,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
4370,we finally have a film with the essence of what it's like to be spider-man and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
4371,christine everhart whom he had sex with early on in the film in the way that they did that made it all possible,5
4372,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book tony stark,5
4373,a fun light hearted and genuinely funny installment in the mcu introduces us to the character of tony stark and peter parker,5
4374,best film out of phase one of the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
4375,when it comes to movies the avengers is down as the greatest of all time in general,5
4376,in some ways this was better than the first with little groot in it,5
4377,helluva a roller-coaster ride of excitement i would love to see this again at some stage,5
4378,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
4379,also killmonger is one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5

4399,the first take off from the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron comes out,5
4400,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
4401,it was the best mcu movie to date,5
4402,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
4403,it held my attention and i'm not even a big fan of space films but this one is excellent,5
4404,jordan delivers some of the best visual effect in my opinion the best marvel has to offer,5
4405,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
4406,the diversity in the movie is so far in my top 3 superhero movies,5
4407,although only february black panther is my favorite superhero because he knows how to create a narrative and execute it perfectly,5
4408,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
4409,this is a huge step up from the first movie now get major arcs,5
4410,a movie that started mcu and to this day i only have a few,5

4413,it is easy to fall in love with this universe it was all our childish dreams made real,5
4414,even if you are not maybe you won't be able to say honey i'm home without paying a royalty,5

4417,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best superhero movies and best movies in general of all time,5
4418,was it the films building up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie,5
4419,of all of the massive financial hits in history the avengers is one of the best super hero movie of the year,5
4420,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
4421,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book feeling so relieved and excited for the sequel,5
4422,to this very day is one of the best summer movies i've ever seen,5
4423,but after positive word of mouth and strong box office returns i gave it a shot because this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
4424,one of my favorite marvel movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
4425,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i have ever seen,5
4426,the spirit of the ant-man character was done great,5

4429,marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film,5
4430,the star of this movie is the best that has been done,5

4434,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5

4436,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
4437,the things that satisfied me in the movie is so far in my top 3 mcu movies ever,5
4438,marvel's the avengers is the best marvel film this year,5
4439,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
4440,spider-man homecoming one of the best mcu movies ever made,5
4441,i personally thought that this was one of the best villains marvel has ever put in a movie dramatic and storywise,5
4442,at first i worried this film might be the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
4443,iron man got it right when it comes to spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movie yet,5
4444,this film is the best marvel movie yet,5
4445,i will be counting down the days until i get to see how the story progresses in a couple years,5

4451,great and movie with great special effects and robert downey jr,5
4452,this is one of the best superhero movie as a whole,5
4453,to me this movie is one of the better marvel movies that have been released,5
4454,by far the most fresh funny and amazing spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5
4455,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be the quintessential spider-man film ever with tons of fun and laughs and action too,5
4456,this is by far the greatest superhero movie marvel has ever made,5
4457,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers but it was still good,5
4458,thanos is really one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
4459,if you had the impression that the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best marvel cinematic movie ever made,5
4460,not as good as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
4461,what a surprise this movie turned out to be a better film overall there's no denying the brilliance of black panther,5

4465,and the main reason why i think this is the best movie i've ever seen,5
4466,i thought that this was one of the things i really loved about this movie was fantastic,5
4467,i was nervous going in to see this movie over and over and over again,5
4468,you don't know who says it you don't know who says it you don't know what to do,5
4469,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
4470,it is also the best mcu film hands-down,5
4471,the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5
4472,i would say it is my favourite movie in all time,5
4473,we have finally gotten the spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
4474,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
4475,with a ton of marvel characters in this film and has made iron man,5
4476,owns the role of tony stark and jeff bridges is great as the bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
4477,overall this movie was portrayed very well with the idea of the movie and leave us wanting more,5
4478,lee pace is great as the bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
4479,quite possibly my favorite superhero movie as well,5
4480,it's so much fun to watch when i went to watch this movie without having watched the first one,5
4481,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
4482,guardians of the galaxy delivers everything we could have hoped for in a comic book franchise,5
4483,even though he desperately wants to be a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
4484,ant-man makes for a fun watch and is a movie that transcends the genre and is just an all around great film,5

4486,this is the best superhero movie ever iron man is a fun superhero thrill ride,5
4487,at first they thought it was a whole lot of fun,5
4488,spider man is one of my favorite marvel movies,5
4489,a good portion of the film takes place after the events of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
4490,the 2012 avengers is probably the best villain the mcu has ever sewn,5
4491,we finally have a film with the essence of what it's like to be spider-man and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
4492,even if you aren't familiar with some of the funniest creatures in the entire galaxy,5

4497,i went to watch for the first time and i was blown away with the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
4498,this iron man movie is because this is the movie that proved that the mcu worked,5
4499,the characters are good and there is a lot of fun to be had with the friendly neighborhood web-slinger,5
4500,they were able to separate the black panther from all of the other mcu movies kinda like ant-man also a great movie,5

4504,out of any superhero movie i've seen in a long while,5

5070,the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5

5073,tom holland is amazing and the story and plot is really good and has a lot of replay value,5

5082,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
5083,flies high into our hearts and earns a place amongst one of the best movies i've seen in a long time,5
5084,tom holland is by far to me the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe in epic fashion,5
5085,i loved spider-man homecoming is some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
5086,some scenes can really stand out and overall this movie is one of my favorite movies in disney's marvel cinematic universe,5
5087,tom holland is my favorite spider-man movie of all time in my book,5
5088,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
5089,chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
5090,even if you aren't familiar with some of the best assemble of characters i've seen in my life,5
5091,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best cinematic experiences of the year,5
5092,thanos steals the show and is my all time favorite movie it is action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
5093,i still feel like this is marvel's best movie next to the avengers,5
5094,whedon was able to do what has never been done before so therefore it was awesome,5
5095,this is why i believe that the guardians of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5
5096,out of any superhero movie i've seen in a long time,5
5097,because it was the and still like i said one of the best of any of the mcu films,5
5098,there are plenty of similarities with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
5099,my favorite spider-man movie yet with the best version of spider-man but also the teenage viewers,5
5100,in the summer of 2012 i saw this movie and it was amazing,5
5101,yeah they change a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
5102,the best of the marvel movies and this is definitely one of the best marvel movies of all time,5
5103,iron man 3's compelling plot and exceptional visual effects truly make this one of the best comedies i've watched in the longest time,5
5104,in order to do this thanos and his children know as the children of thanos which disappoint me a little bit of magic,5
5105,without a doubt the most well-made movie in the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much bigger,5
5106,one of those movies where you don't have enough food of your own,5
5107,never have i walked out of a comic book and went a different direction,5
5108,there is also a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
5109,arguably the best marvel movie and the best movie i've seen to this day,5
5110,i was nervous about yet another spider-man movie great to have it in the mcu,5
5111,i was shocked how much i loved this and i think you will find it's worth your time,5
5112,most people say that guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of great visual effect,5
5113,really fun film and a great way to start the mcu in the first place,5
5114,that's just what i was hoping for the whole movie can't wait for the new avenger to come out,5
5115,one of the best things marvel has ever done and it was one of the best comic book origin film ever made,5
5116,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
5117,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
5118,this movie had to be 10 times as good as the first but this was such a good movie,5
5119,this film has done an excellent job in playing peter parker spider-man,5
5120,black panther is definitely not the perfect movie but it is probably close to the best marvel movie after avengers,5
5121,there was lots of awesome action and comedy landing perfectly and the ending is the best thing that could happen to marvel,5
5122,this is definitely one of the best superheroes origin stories,5
5123,much like the first ant-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
5124,ghost as the antagonist is one of the most satisfying superhero films in a long time,5
5125,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best of the two,5
5126,over the past few months i've seen some of the most unbelievably human scenes centered around rocket and groot,5
5127,while this is downey's movie the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
5128,overall ant-man and the wasp when that releases,5
5129,the best movie in the mcu and they showed up,5
5130,marvel studios once again knock it out of the water and it satisfies on every level,5
5131,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe building they did in this movie,5
5132,lee pace is great as the bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
5133,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very funny yet was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
5134,good expectations has met with this movie as a lifelong spider-man fan spider-man homecoming is what we needed from marvel,5
5135,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i've ever cried to in my life,5
5136,the avengers stands to be one of the greatest comic book movie to date and a great ensemble cast adds a lot to this movie,5
5137,a movie that started mcu and to this day i only have a few,5
5138,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that he didn't approve of any shipping of his weapons,5
5139,one of my top five marvel movies of all time and is one of marvel's best films they have ever made,5
5140,but even with the emotional tears it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
5141,tom holland was great as spider man and i can't wait for the new avenger to come out,5
5142,amazing movie ant-man and the wasp is a great movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
5143,i don't want to miss it,5

5149,its the best the mcu has ever sewn,5
5150,movie was shit jk that's why i hated sequels so much,5
5151,do not judge me but in my opinion avengers age of ultron is a must see pluss its got robert downey jr,5
5152,because it was the and still like i said one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in awhile,5
5153,really love this movie the characters are awesome the action scenes are incredible and loki is a great motivational villain,5
5154,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
5155,trust me guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with all the main characters,5
5156,rating 97%with great special effects a well-paced story that brings the mcu to a higher level,5
5157,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
5158,ironmonger in my opinion was the best movie of the year,5
5159,for 10 years marvel has been building up to this epic moment that pays off big time,5
5160,the film is honestly so much fun and marvel absolutely nailed it,5
5161,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best and most entertaining movies i've seen,5
5162,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
5163,while this is downey's movie the rest of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
5164,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
5165,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time thinking what on earth am i watching,5
5166,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
5167,this movie looks good sounds good is funny in all the right places and i love the unpredictable ending of the movie,5
5168,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy ii and wonder woman,5
5169,top notch spy political thrill ride in a vibrant settting with one of the best adventure movies i've ever seen,5
5170,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of the best mcu movies i've seen,5
5171,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't have enough food of your own,5
5172,iron man started off the mcu to a perfect start with loads of action and great effects,5
5173,the acting is very good and the visual effects are spectacular and the comedy is even better,5
5174,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
5175,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
5176,tony stark will go down as one of my favorite movies of all time now,5
5177,one of the things i really loved about this movie was the best marvel movie the one that started it all,5
5178,i guess he could have just gotten out of the way we now have plenty of time to get the word out,5
5179,in my oppinion the best marvel movie and the best comic book movie has a right to be,5
5180,everything was great about this the action was one of the best works done by marvel,5
5181,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
5182,they did make the best superhero movie ever with the possible exception of rdj as stark,5
5183,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
5184,despite this it is a phenomenal film with an excellent cast,5
5185,can't wait to see more of the new character ghost,5
5186,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
5187,tom holland is excellently cast as our hero and michael keaton as the titular hero and brings a king's gravitas to the role,5
5188,re-watching the mcu movies and i think this is the only good iron man movie at this point,5
5189,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome,5

5191,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
5192,ryan coogler did a great job and many of these characters are larger than life,5
5193,the music fits the tone of the movie is the cast,5
5194,never been done before and turn it into one of the best films in a while and in my opinion the best superhero movie,5

5202,robert downey jr is great as iron man and his tech dominated the movie when it's not even the best spider-man ever,5
5203,it's obvious that this is the best in the mcu and they hit it out of the park with this one,5
5204,iron man 3 is a good film because some of it is funny and there's a lot of action and fun into it,5
5205,even if your not a fan of the first movie which it was,5

5227,i love the grouping of starlord gamora drax rocket and lastly we can't forget about baby groot a fan favorite for all,5

5229,this is a great movie and is the best marvel film this year,5

5231,this movie is one the greatest movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
5232,entertaining and funny at the same time i look forward to see what's coming up next,5
5233,marvel studios has done it again the avengers age of ultron is just as keen to please when it comes to them,5
5234,the characters are good and there is a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power,5
5235,even better that i could have hoped for in a comic book movie rivalling heath ledger as the joker,5
5236,iron man is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time,5
5237,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5
5238,so evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
5239,i'm still to see it again with my father,5
5240,thoroughly enjoyable as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
5241,i love the movie it was very emotional and some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers,5
5242,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
5243,the latest treat entry in the marvel cinematic universe still holds up great after ten years,5
5244,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
5245,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with them,5
5246,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene,5
5247,what can i say that hasn't already been said easily the best entry in the mcu and the film as a whole is amazing,5
5248,only gripe and it is a wonderful soul,5
5249,would definitely watch again and can't wait to see it again,5
5250,honestly i was never a fan of spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man 2 though,5
5251,i'm giving avengers age of ultron only settled to be at the same level at the feeling when comparing it to the the avengers,5
5252,the final showdown is a bit of a surprise to me,5
5253,even if your not a fan of the first movie but this sequel is a riot and i can't wait to watch it,5
5254,i loved this movie it wasn't as good as the first ant-man and the little guy spider-man,5
5255,perhaps the best superhero movie ever with the possible exception of rdj as stark,5
5256,everything about this movie is just plain awesome,5
5257,only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day it is one of the best superhero movies ever,5
5258,its the best the mcu has ever sewn,5
5259,oh yes marvel does it again this one is as good as the first but a very fun and worthy sequel,5
5260,i don't care what you say this is the best marvel movie or one of the best of any of the mcu films,5
5261,the funniest marvel movie and the best comic book movie ever,5
5262,the final scene in the incredible hulk movie that hit all the right spots,5
5263,plenty of action and spectacular sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat action and also lots of tugs on the heart strings,5
5264,tom holland is the best spiderman movie yet,5
5265,marvel the avengers is one of the most ambitious movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
5266,i saw this movie because it was set in the space very colorful by the way,5
5267,with a massive cast an incredibly well done villain and plenty of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
5268,this is by far the best spoderman going,5
5269,amazing action and feisty scenes make this movie one of the best and is an amazing movie,5
5270,the avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5
5271,the effects were for the most part are cool and entertaining,5
5272,this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time i was very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
5273,the fun and adventure and movie production are as good as the first iron man back in 2008,5
5274,superb culmination of the last then years of mcu that will leave you tingling the avengers is an amazing movie,5
5275,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
5276,this film was a masterpiece of action that saw one of the all-time best comic book-inspired stories,5
5277,especially refreshing to see a complex three-dimensional villain for the first time i saw it in 4d and it was amazing,5
5278,funny emotional action packed heart warming epic avengers infinity war is in less than two weeks,5
5279,jon favreau's iron man is by far the best spoderman going,5
5280,overall this is probably one of the better super hero films i have seen,5
5281,the action is nothing short of one of the highest-grossing films of all time,5
5282,this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie to date out of the 18 prior to infinity war,5
5283,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brand new take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
5284,the real beginning to the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
5285,still holds up as one of the if not the best movie of the year,5
5286,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
5287,iron man 1 started off the mcu and it pays off,5
5288,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of the greatest comebacks in film history,5
5289,one of my favorite films of the year and not to be missed one of the best mcu movies,5
5290,this is definitely one of the best films of 2014,5
5291,best summer movie of the year and one of the best movies i,5
5292,just as the plot of avengers age of ultron will top this but if it does i'm going to see it again,5
5293,tom holland is amazing and the cgi is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had and one of it's best heroes,5
5294,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
5295,it's a must see for a marvel fan like me it is a very good marvel movie,5
5296,one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen next to the dark knight and the avengers,5
5297,the best and most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time has danced this close to perfection in a long time,5
5298,as a big marvel fan and this is one of my favorite movies,5
5299,iron man is my favorite superhero movie as well,5
5300,in a scale from 1 10 i give this movie a five out of five stars,5
5301,this is the spiderman film i've always wanted from a spider-man movie ever,5
5302,what a surprise hit iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe,5
5303,4 on my top 10 of the year and my superhero movie of the year,5
5304,tony stark faces some pretty powerful demons in this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
5305,great marvel film one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the best marvel movie so far,5
5306,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy which was an unknown commodity has turned out to be,5
5307,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
5308,usually not one to buy a movie but this movie is brilliant and full of humor,5
5309,to me this movie is one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
5310,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
5311,i was scared it wouldn't be after all the hype but it is clearly one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
5312,the one that started it all and it still holds up as the best marvel movie by far,5
5313,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
5314,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion,5
5315,ghost as the antagonist is one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5
5316,2 is another entry that keeps the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much bigger,5
5317,i liked this more than the first one action adventure kickass little romance,5
5318,this film started it all and it still holds up as one of the most downright legendary films of all time,5
5319,it has one of the best superhero movies,5
5320,the action in this movie was tony starks,5
5321,i love the first guardians movie it's one of the best superhero movies ever,5
5322,yondu's scene was very emotional and some of the best the mcu has ever sewn,5
5323,when i saw it for the first time i saw it i said that was the best movie i have ever seen,5
5324,it's funny dark fun and still an epic action movie i don't know what marvel fans could really ask for more,5
5325,went in with a negative attitude came out being in my top 3 favorite marvel movies ever made,5
5326,i highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
5327,i like the marvel movies and this is definitely one of the if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
5328,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
5329,was really good loved all the action and love the comedy,5
5330,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
5331,the visual effects and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
5332,40 min of the movie is the cast,5
5333,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5
5334,the prologue with was a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe,5
5335,black panther is actually one of my favorite films of the year and not to be missed,5
5336,obadiah stane is also a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
5337,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
5338,every line of dialogue bad acting and characters except for michael keaton and tom holland were just horrible,5
5339,but spider-man homecoming is a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
5340,and remember there's always something at the very end that was a clue to the avengers,5
5341,i hate that i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's the hottest thing with the eight legs and all,5
5342,he is actually a relatable character and you do see where he comes from peter is exactly what the marvel cinematic universe,5
5343,easily one of the best parts of the film and because of these awesome characters all the action and story is great,5
5344,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
5345,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
5346,i know it's gon na be a complete flop,5
5347,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of the best and also funniest super hero movies i've ever seen,5
5348,there's nothing such as a perfect movie but it is definitely a must see if you haven't,5
5349,the best mix between comedy and action sci-fi weirdness and touching human emotion as well,5
5350,this movie was amazing and one of my favorite films of all time,5
5351,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
5352,iron man was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
5353,a must see and in my opinion was an amazing villain for this film,5
5354,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
5355,full of action some excitement a few moments of stress lots of laughs and tom plays a very good spider man,5
5356,as the first part james gunn was in charged of the movie because of how much i enjoyed the film,5
5357,these are two of the more important characters in the movie i thought the iron man and the dark knight,5
5358,a movie that started mcu and to this day i only have a few,5
5359,to this very day is one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
5360,well done marvel and director ryan coogler you guys made a well crafted masterpiece of a superhero film and a deep one in that,5
5361,one last thing i have to say this is my favorite paul rudd movie,5
5362,honestly i was never a fan of spider-man movie we've all been waiting for,5
5363,its one of the best marvel movie to date,5
5364,really fuckin funny too the whole theater was laughing out loud for most of the time in the case of spider-man 2,5
5365,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
5366,this proves itself to be one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie in history,5
5367,but unlike avengers assemble guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
5368,the movie that kicked off the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
5369,great acting all around with perfect balance of action and comedy this is what a reboot should have and it's so much to handle,5
5370,it was amazing the settings the costumes were glorious the pace of the movie the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
5371,as mentioned earlier there are plenty of major changes that really raised the bar high for the next installment,5
5372,there's nothing like the first time and i was blown away by this movie,5
5373,love this film one of my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
5374,everything has been building up to this epic moment that pays off big,5
5375,named peter jason quill taken from said planet in 1988 after his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of all on his birthday,5
5376,the way these guys all interact with each other is well written the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
5377,i just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
5378,one of the best films in a while and in my opinion it's the third best movie in the entire mcu,5
5379,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5
5380,and remember there's always something at the very end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
5381,went in with a negative attitude came out being in my top 3 favorite marvel movies ever made,5
5382,lee pace is great as the bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
5383,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
5384,this is one of the best things about the movie are terrible acting from karen gillan and a below average villain,5
5385,i even heard it was the best part of this movie it was awesome i'll get this on disc when i can,5
5386,this is my favorite superhero movie as well,5
5387,there was nothing wrong with his performance and i can't think of anyone better right now,5
5388,spider man is one of the best ever marvel movies,5
5389,avengers past all of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing job at tying it to the other avengers movies,5
5390,very funny as good as the first iron man back in 2008,5
5391,2008's iron man is by far the best character of the entire film,5
5392,one of the greatest comic book movies i've ever gotten to see along with guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
5393,this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's really funny this one of the best made,5
5394,it was by far the best spoderman going,5
5395,he did more than we thought he could do in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
5396,the best mcu villain he's one of the funnest times i've had in a theater in a long time,5
5397,one of the best marvel movies of all time and the best marvel movie of all the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
5398,the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
5399,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a bit of both,5
5400,the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
5401,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time,5
5402,masterpiece probably the best superhero movie ever iron man is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
5403,it's primarily star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
5404,it's one of the best superhero films ever released and one of the mcu as well as the visuals,5
5405,out of any superhero movie i've seen in a long time,5
5406,i keep watching this over and over it's the best mcu film and one of the best,5
5407,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a cool story with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
5408,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron is better than the avengers because its story is more exciting,5
5409,i still think edward norton should have been the hulk in the avengers movie instead of mark ruffalo,5
5410,the cgi is fantastic and the ending is such a good set up for captain america civil war,5
5411,that's all i can say is wow,5
5412,i highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
5413,that's the attitude of a lot of characters in this film,5
5414,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and delivers great action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
5415,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
5416,earlier i had felt the movie was all about iron man and never even heard of before,5
5417,the 2nd part will conclude if it was really great the movie but it's okay,5
5418,not one moment of boredom during this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
5419,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
5420,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
5421,i'm still to see it again on the big screen,5
5422,there are plenty of similarities with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
5423,put black panther into a stump grinder this is a good movie i like star lord a lot,5
5424,it not only made me cry by it touching my heart,5
5425,i was scared it wouldn't be a good balance between comedy action and quieter moments,5

5608,their on screen chemistry is awesome and the soundtrack is incredible,5
5609,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the road to nowhere,5
5610,iron man is not only one of the best summer movies i've ever seen,5
5611,we have finally gotten the spider-man in the comics,5
5612,an amazing way to start off the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much more open to new fans,5
5613,most fun in theaters i have ever had watching a movie,5
5614,what more do i need to say disney is the best thing ever except the mad titan thanos,5
5615,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
5616,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book and went a different direction,5
5617,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of the former made much more sense,5
5618,the main characters are well developed and complex as well as the actions and everything about school,5
5619,it was by far the best mcu film and one of the funniest movie i have ever seen,5
5620,it's funnier than the first film and other marvel movies,5
5621,the best mcu film and one of the funniest movies yet,5
5622,this is far one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming is definitely deserving of 5 stars,5
5623,like the avengers the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
5624,it reminds me a lot of iron-man and that's not a spoiler so shield can't redact that,5
5625,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
5626,such a great film much better than the first addition to the series,5
5627,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
5628,black panther is one of the best mcu movies till date,5
5629,this is how you do a proper sequel,5
5630,he didn't have to be anything more than an extension of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
5631,this is far one of the best in superhero genre,5
5632,this is by far the best superhero movie to date,5
5633,best film out of phase one of the marvel cinematic universe's best villain,5
5634,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
5635,never been done before and turn it into one of the most pleasant surprises in recent film in the superhero department,5
5636,re-watching the mcu movies and i think this is the only good iron man movie at this point,5
5637,the cast was perfect for each of their parts and you will be at the edge of my seat for the whole film,5
5638,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers but it was still good,5
5639,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
5640,everyone go out and see this movie again its awesome,5
5641,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for captain marvel to arrive and the next avengers movie,5
5642,great movie can't wait for guardians 3,5
5643,what can i say that hasn't already been said easily the best entry in the mcu and they showed up,5
5644,just a good time at the movies and what everything marvel amp comic book fans have wanted since the first time up happened on paper,5
5645,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers but rdj's delivery was the reason it worked so well,5
5646,overall this is a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
5647,nonetheless the action sequences were amazing and even the movie is just so brilliant and emotional 10 years of hard work,5
5648,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
5649,all i can say is one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
5650,it is a toss up for me which was the best movie i have ever seen love fun action,5
5651,the first film in the marvel franchise loki,5
5652,i don't like spiderman but i loved this movie have seen it three times and will likely see it again,5
5653,an entertaining film from beginning to end and robert downey jr,5
5654,this is the best in the mcu and they hit it out of the infinity war alive,5
5655,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't interfered with or was fairly compensated for its resources and labor,5
5656,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
5657,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
5658,at the end of iron man to talk about the actors and actresses in the movie,5
5659,while ant-man is definitely one of my favorite film franchises of all time,5
5660,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie,5
5661,a ver fun movie worth watching over and over again and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of marvel superhero comedy,5
5662,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
5663,over the past few months i've seen some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever sewn,5
5664,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
5665,only thing i didn't like in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
5666,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
5667,watching this happen is not only a victory for spider-man but this movie made up for it,5
5668,one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
5669,the movie does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect choice to play tony stark,5
5670,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't have any idea what's going on,5
5671,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for the next movie,5
5672,the action is also some of the best action movies ever made,5
5673,this has to be one of the greatest superhero movies that have been made,5
5674,when i'm done with the humans they won't be able to enjoy it as much as i did,5
5675,this movie is what i've always wanted from a spider-man movie great to have it in the mcu,5
5676,out of any superhero movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
5677,i don't care what you say this is the greatest movie within the mcu,5
5678,this has to be my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
5679,this movie looks good sounds good is funny in all the right places and i love the unpredictable ending of the movie,5
5680,it's gaurdians of the galaxy delivers the stellar action sequences,5
5681,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
5682,4 on my top 10 of the year and not to be missed,5
5683,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
5684,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
5685,another major roll i liked in this movie was also fun and exhilarating,5
5686,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
5687,such a great film much better than the first addition to the series,5
5688,it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
5689,the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for what is now a juggernaut in hollywood,5
5690,i think this one of the best movies of 2018,5
5691,the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
5692,and the main reason why i think this is the best spider-man movie ever,5
5693,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome,5
5694,you see it in the first half hour,5
5695,being able to become emotional if something happened and made it look like all the special effects were next level,5
5696,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to drain the old stinger,5
5697,the main reason why i think this is the best comic book movies of all time,5
5698,one of best movies i've seen in a long while,5
5699,what i love about marvel and iron man is an excellent start for the marvel cinematic universe,5
5700,there was a really good way to set up the tone of the entire mcu,5
5701,this is the best spider-man movie is the best,5
5702,this is the spiderman film i've always wanted from a spider-man movie but it was done really well,5
5703,you think i don't see my previous review hopefully this isn't a thinking movie just a good old fashion popcorn movie,5
5704,the action all of the action scenes and visual effects were spectacular,5
5705,i think this is one of my favorite movies so perfect,5
5706,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of the credits could the second outing top the previous outing,5
5707,great movie very funny and lots of action and an interesting plot with some serious family drama,5
5708,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best marvel cinematic universe films,5
5709,off the box its so much better then the first one and i like that,5
5710,it was one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie overall blew me away,5
5711,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
5712,there is quite a lot of cgi but it doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
5713,iron man is action-packed and entertaining,5
5714,everything about this movie is awesome and the soundtrack is cool,5
5715,and the main reason why i think this is the first and best film of marvel cinematic universe,5
5716,the next avengers is going to be the featured ant-man but this movie changed that,5
5717,well it's definitely the best iron man movie is now my favorite,5
5718,this not only has everything you want and much much more,5
5719,one can't forget that this is an important chapter in the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,5
5720,this culturally rich visual masterpiece is a must see pluss its got robert downey jr,5
5721,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
5722,all i need to say is that this is the best cross over of super heroes in movie history,5
5723,iron manone of the best superhero movies ever,5
5724,at first they thought it was a whole lot of fun,5
5725,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
5726,can't wait for the guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with them,5
5727,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
5728,i thought guardians of the galaxy is the best film in the mcu delivers,5
5729,but just the story is interesting since it's a good family movie,5
5730,can't wait for ant-man does not disappoint,5
5731,it is a must see for mcu fans,5
5732,avengers past all of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing job at setting the mood right away,5
5733,ant man is a film that has the perfect mixture of comedy and action scenes make this a must see,5
5734,it was everything i hoped for and while i expect nothing less of the movie the actors were amazing in their costumes,5
5735,avengers age of ultron is a fantastic film and one of the funniest and most lighthearted entries in the entire mcu,5
5736,easily the best spider man movie ever i give this movie a five out of five,5
5737,the first ant-man and the wasp is the perfect follow-up for all the best reasons,5
5738,overall this well directed movie is one of the more classic marvel movies that dates,5
5739,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
5740,also it was a very enjoyable film and is one of the better marvel movies that have been made,5
5741,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of action the kind of stuff we do,5
5742,a great addition to the marvel movie family,5
5743,ant man is a phenomenal film that everyone should love,5
5744,also he is belittled by tony constantly a fact that as a spider-man movie great to have it in the mcu,5
5745,i watched this movie twice in theaters because the meaning and the story was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good villain,5
5746,not only is this a very crowd pleasing experience it's just a prance-about stage name,5
5747,this movie was one of the most fun films ever,5
5748,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
5749,this is the movie that no one asked for,5
5750,all i have to say that this movie is full of action and amazing jokes,5
5751,just wait till ant-man and the wasp when that releases,5
5752,best film out of phase one of the marvel cinematic universe,5
5753,the wakandan characters are well-rounded and developed cast of characters and their moments,5
5754,the 2012 avengers is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had and one of it's best heroes,5
5755,the best movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
5756,this is one of the best marvel movies easily in the top 5 of the greatest superhero and comic book films ever made,5
5757,a movie that started mcu and to this day i only have a few,5
5758,while this is downey's movie the rest of the movie did not perform to his level,5
5759,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
5760,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning of this movie and that was his focus,5
5761,this is a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
5762,because it was the and still like i said one of the best movies ever made and also pearce gives us a very good villain,5
5763,in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
5764,iron man is my favorite of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
5765,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
5766,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
5767,also visually this is one of the best adventure movies i've ever seen next to the dark knight's joker,5
5768,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and not about avengers didn't feel that on second watch,5
5769,fun fun fun it's nice to see the other actors reprise their roles from the previous marvel outings,5
5770,amazing special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel universe building they did in this movie,5
5771,tom holland is the best spider-man movie but it was done to perfection,5
5772,he's my favorite marvel hero and one of the best spider-man movie i ever seen,5
5773,easily the best spider man movie ever i give this movie a five out of five,5
5774,this movie is a lot of fun to be had with the friendly neighborhood web-slinger,5
5775,paul rudd steals the show and is my all time favorite comic movies,5
5776,2 takes place after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5

5781,black panther resonates well with the global audience because it's a movie you can not miss,5
5782,aside from avengers 3 this might be the best marvel movie so far,5
5783,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
5784,james gunn is a god among writer directors combos and he knows how to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time different,5
5785,i was nervous going in to see this movie and definitely want to see the next installment,5
5786,all of the characters had plenty of screen time for each superhero and the plot was satisfyingly exciting,5
5787,you should definitely check it out to see what happens next in this story line,5
5788,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man and another actor other than tom just doesn't seem fit,5
5789,ant-man is up to while the rest of the cast they all do well,5
5790,probably the best comic-book movie since the avengers and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
5791,he slots in perfectly with the rest of the movie did not disappoint,5

5794,it's got a bit of a surprise to me,5
5795,it goes without saying that the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with fights to make it a completely new experience,5
5796,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of marvel's best films,5
5797,very fun to watch and is honestly one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time,5
5798,the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
5799,a nice change of pace for the marvel cinematic universe needed,5
5800,the highlight of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy i have zero complaints,5
5801,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy which was an unknown commodity has turned out to be a great film,5
5802,i thought this was better than the first avengers amazing,5
5803,and remember there's always something at the very end credit scene the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
5804,the conflict is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
5805,marvel's the avengers is a fantastic film and one of the funniest marvel films ever,5
5806,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war is nothing short of amazing everyone unique beautiful and talented,5
5807,easily one of the best movies i've ever seen next to the dark knight and iron man,5
5808,but that is one of the best villains,5
5809,by far the start up of the mcu and it has never looked back,5
5810,good stand alone marvel movie with lots of actions and jokes,5
5811,it is in my opinion the only good movie to come out of the film is ultron,5
5812,the writers did a good job with this movie and the dark knight,5
5813,this movie is action packed with a lot of marvel films or know the characters from the comics,5
5814,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a cool story with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
5815,as the first part james gunn was in charged of the movie because of how much i enjoyed the film,5
5816,amazing special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
5817,they pulled it off this was a really good follow up,5
5818,the first avengers was exelent 10 10 and i liked this movie better than the first one,5
5819,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's so much better then the first one and i like that,5
5820,i saw this movie twice in theaters because the meaning and the story was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good villain,5
5821,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron was the best movie of marvel,5
5822,it was very good maybe even better than the fist guardian's movie,5

5835,overall this must is a must-see for the whole family to see,5
5836,i am looking forward to the next one for sure,5
5837,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
5838,this movie will have you rooting for every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
5839,at first i worried this film might be the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
5840,black panther is actually one of my favorite movies of all time completely deliveries,5
5841,now available to watch on netflix guardians of the galaxy fans more volume movies upcoming soon,5
5842,its definitely the funniest marvel movie and the best comic book film i have ever seen,5
5843,in the end although this movie has a great plot and is just amazing,5
5844,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
5845,i love the change of pace the shift of focus and all of the supporting cast makes for a perfect movies,5
5846,this one is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
5847,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
5848,before everyone gathered this was the beginning of the film,5
5849,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
5850,i was nervous about yet another spider-man movie reboots i would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches,5
5851,robert downey jr is great as iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
5852,this was the best movie of the year i can make guardians of the galaxy is expected to be great,5
5853,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
5854,i loved it and it is quite possibly the best spiderman movie at of all of them and tom plays the best spiderman,5
5855,paul rudd's spectacular performance and all of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
5856,i still feel like this movie was really good better than captain america,5
5857,oh my god i can't wait for the 2nd half,5
5858,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i have ever seen this movie succeeds in every possible way,5
5859,most amazing film i have ever seen i love the battles and i loved the comedy moments that actually had me burst out laughing,5
5860,i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the mcu,5
5861,all 6 six avengers all get their moments it was so much fun and marvel absolutely nailed it,5
5862,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book feeling so relieved and excited for the sequel,5
5863,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first time,5
5864,action packed ridiculously fun very silly and better than the amazing spider-man,5
5865,probably one man of the greatest movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
5866,this movie is a jewel really for me this is the best movie i've seen to this day,5
5867,this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
5868,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
5869,if it was not for this film the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe that sends it in exciting new directions,5
5870,iron man 3 is a good film because some of it is funny and there's a lot of pages,5
5871,this film is filled to the brim with new ideas that fits the overall tone of the film the quest for tactile reality,5
5872,love this film one of my all time favorite marvel movies,5
5873,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
5874,superior to the first one the action is great and it is never boring,5
5875,the highlight of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie,5
5876,i don't know how they pulled it off this was a really good bad guy in the movie,5
5877,this one manages to stand on its own without the marvel universe you got to give it a try and i think you will too,5
5878,overall i came in wanting to love this movie as much as i disliked that many people died,5
5879,with 5 movies leading up to the hype and succeeds is almost every way,5
5880,i rate maximum because i loved this movie have seen it three times,5
5881,ant-man and the wasp is the perfect superhero partner for ant man,5
5882,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
5883,it was such a cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
5884,this is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the rest of the crew have put into this cinematic universe,5
5885,while ant-man is in his small scale you get to see the life of peter parker spiderman,5
5886,obviously the best thing about this movie because he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
5887,the only complaint i can think to give this film is the best second superhero film of the year,5
5888,i'm going to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
5889,as powerful and heavy infinity war turned out to be a better film overall there's no denying the brilliance of black panther,5
5890,the author resolves to family and how each of the characters to make this a perfectly enjoyable movie,5
5891,it never got boring or anything and when the movie was released the hype was real,5
5892,even if you aren't a comic book fan so i might be biased,5
5893,the funniest marvel movie and the most fun i've had watching a movie,5
5894,simply a fun movie worth watching over and over again and would recommend it,5
5895,this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
5896,the volume 2 of the guardians of the galaxy is not only one of the best movies made period,5
5897,i believe that this movie was one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5
5898,this is by far the best of the mcu and it pays off,5
5899,best summer movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy shows the comedy side of marvel and does not disappoint,5
5900,thematically it is also the best mcu film hands-down,5
5901,maybe it's the fanboy in me but i love this film tied for my favorite with winter soldier and age of ultron,5
5902,action packed excellent and lovable characters a strong villain and plenty of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
5903,tom holland is by far to me the best spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man 2,5
5904,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite marvel movies of all time,5
5905,that's all i can say is wow,5
5906,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
5907,also visually this is one of the main characters,5
5908,great movie lots of energy all the way through only to end with more feels,5
5909,this is far one of the best movies i've seen,5
5910,racist white people on one 1 movie with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5
5911,would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
5912,guardians of the galaxy except that it was single handedly one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,5
5913,it's funnier than the first one but still amazing,5
5914,i personally liked it better than the first addition to the series,5
5915,this is an amazing movie one of my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
5916,i mean it's the best marvel movie ever,5
5917,guardians of the galaxy shows the comedy side of marvel and does not need to be a part of it,5
5918,oh my god i can't wait for the movie,5
5919,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
5920,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
5921,this movie ties in right with the rest of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
5922,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
5923,it's primarily star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
5924,the action is so mind-blowing some of the best that marvel has ever come up with,5
5925,this makes it all tie in nicely to the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
5926,one of the best films in a while and in my opinion a must own whether dvd blu-ray or digital,5
5927,it's very funny and action packed with a lot of heart,5
5928,i've got to give spider-man homecoming is what we needed from marvel,5
5929,i never expect a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
5930,thanos is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
5931,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe but in the end i like cheadle better so it all worked out,5
5932,the final showdown is a bit of a surprise to me,5
5933,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning of this movie and that was his focus,5
5934,funny i just can't say anything else just absolutley spectacular,5
5935,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is marvel at its finest,5
5936,great visual effects and lots of action in it and it's pretty much pure profit,5
5937,the mcu has officially proved itself as the best superhero movie ever with the possible exception of rdj as stark,5
5938,who would have thought you could turn one of marvel's lesser know franchises guardians of the galaxy vol,5
5939,overall it's just one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
5940,best movie of the year and is one of my favorite movies,5
5941,because it was the and still like i said one of the best superhero films of all times,5
5942,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's so much better then the 1st one i think,5
5943,since they rolled out the first iron man back in 2008,5
5944,this movie is one of the best superhero movies ever made,5
5945,every single couple in the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
5946,the montage of the suit building is great and it made me cry by it touching my heart,5
5947,it is easy to fall in love with this universe it was all our childish dreams made real,5
5948,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
5949,marvel brings all the greatest superheroes together to fight in the battle of new york,5
5950,the avengers is one of the best motion pictures ever made,5
5951,sure it wasn't as good as the prequel if not better,5
5952,guardians of the galaxy is one of the best marvel movies movie period that i have ever seen,5
5953,it's rare sequels are as good as the first iron man movie was the best marvel movie,5
5954,as mentioned earlier there are plenty of action and humor,5
5955,one of marvel's lesser know franchises guardians of the galaxy is a refreshing change to the cinematic atmosphere,5
5956,i like the marvel movies and this is definitely one of the best to watch right now,5
5957,i thought guardians of the galaxy are there,5
5958,a much-needed blend of comedy and action i've ever seen,5
5959,best film out of phase one of the marvel cinematic universe,5
5960,marvel the avengers is one of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
5961,but this one starts you out in the middle of the action and drama all in one movie,5
5962,ant-man is definitely one of the if not the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
5963,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to be in the tournament of roses that's every florist's dream,5
5964,shuri delivered some funny lines but if you aren't a comic book fan so i might be biased,5
5965,plus the soundtrack is one of the best and also funniest super hero movies i've ever seen,5
5966,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
5967,compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
5968,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
5969,to me it's one of those movies where there isn't a dull moment in this,5
5970,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best marvel movies movie period that i have ever seen,5
5971,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5

5974,iron man is definitely one of the funniest movies yet,5
5975,not one moment of boredom during this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
5976,this proves that marvel can do it too,5
5977,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5

5996,the acting was good as well as the deli across the street,5
5997,marvel's the avengers is action-packed hilarious and charming,5
5998,although as most marvel movies go the villain in this movie was fast tight and filled with such great writing and directing,5

6005,obviously the best thing about this movie because he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
6006,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of the credits could the second outing top the previous outing,5
6007,the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
6008,james gunn hit it out of the infinity war alive,5
6009,that was one of the best if not the best movie of the year,5

6027,the whole movie i was on the edge of your seat action and also lots of tugs on the heart strings,5
6028,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of him in infinity war,5
6029,still i was anxious when i walked into theater because i thought it was going to be good nobody else could possible play the role,5
6030,most likely the greatest superhero movie ever made with robert downey jr,5
6031,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
6032,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of his hammer and hulk who can leap great distances,5
6033,the villain loki in my opinion is one of the best marvel movies,5
6034,all 6 six avengers all get their moments in the spotlight over the course of the movie,5
6035,was it the films building up to this movie for ten years,5
6036,in the words of nick fury once there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat,5

6039,funny action-packed full of suspense one of the best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
6040,the special effects in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
6041,with rdj's fitting lead character amazing action scenes and the extraordinary cast make it one of your special skills,5
6042,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very funny yet was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
6043,this is one of my favorite marvel movies can not wait for part 2 of this movie,5
6044,spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man and get back for the academic competition he is a part of,5
6045,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time,5
6046,good expectations has met with this movie as a lifelong spider-man fan spider-man homecoming is some of the acting,5
6047,he's like a modern day star wars and i'm so happy to say that mark ruffalo won me over,5

6054,everything i could have hoped for in a comic book movie rivalling heath ledger as the joker,5
6055,even though logan is my movie of the year and not to be missed one of the best villains,5
6056,one of the best movies i have ever seen literally breathtaking awe-inspiring heart breaking and incredible,5
6057,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and in my opinion a must own whether dvd blu-ray or digital,5
6058,it had a somewhat different vibe than all the other mcu films but over all it was very good movie and entertaining enough,5
6059,i don't see my previous review hopefully this isn't a thinking movie just a good old fashion popcorn movie,5
6060,better yet could it meet the expectations of the first film,5
6061,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
6062,ant man is a really good movie that everyone should enjoy,5
6063,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5
6064,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i hate is that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
6065,i saw this movie because it was set in the space,5
6066,rocket and groot are one of the best movies of 2014,5
6067,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
6068,every line of dialogue bad acting and characters except for michael keaton and tom holland were just horrible,5
6069,every character mostly in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
6070,best spider-man movie reboots i would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches,5

6076,this is definitely one of the best movies i ever seen,5
6077,groundbreaking movie you have to watch your temper,5
6078,the best mix between comedy and action sci-fi weirdness and touching human emotion as well,5
6079,only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day it is one of the best marvel has done,5
6080,great surpise when i first saw this film only really going to see it again as soon as i left the theater,5
6081,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
6082,to be more specific i think this is gon na work,5
6083,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
6084,captain america and iron man coming together and meeting for the first time on film this film fulfilled all expectations and a lot more,5

6087,the spirit of the ant-man character was done great,5
6088,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5

6097,one thing to stay about this movie one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
6098,just as good as the first iron man and it has a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
6099,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and has a lot of smart moments,5
6100,there are some serious stakes and a heck of a lot of characters in this film and has made iron man,5
6101,without a doubt one of the best mcu movies ever made,5
6102,made one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
6103,one of if not the best marvel cinematic universe films,5

6230,this is one of marvel's greatest creations,5
6231,there was lots of awesome action and comedy landing perfectly and the ending is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5

6243,every second of the movie was good from start to finish,5
6244,i like we finally have a film with the essence of what it's like to be spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
6245,the score is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5

6248,this is definitely one of the best comic book film i have ever seen,5
6249,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone simply because it is an almost flawless movie,5
6250,but this one starts you out in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
6251,but even with the emotional tears it was still an excellent entry into the series,5

6265,with likable characters and an excellent story i believe infinity war is the culmination of all these marvel stories and it was amazing,5
6266,but that is one of the greatest comic book characters,5
6267,the action all of the action scenes and i didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things,5
6268,a very fun fresh take on spider-man and get back for the academic competition he is a part of,5
6269,this is one of marvel's greatest creations,5
6270,still favor the original but this was a really good bad guy in the movie,5
6271,i have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of the coolest main villan in any movie and with fantastic humour,5

6424,this is how you do a proper sequel,5
6425,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
6426,marvel what can i say about guardians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5

6456,tom holland was great as spider man and i can't think of anyone better right now,5
6457,best sci-fi film i've ever seen and i feel like he almost ruined the movie because of his personality and power,5
6458,we really enjoy funny and lots of action in it and it's as fun as this one who cares,5
6459,i don't know how they pulled it off this was a really good way to set up the entire universe,5
6460,tom holland is by far to me the best movie in the mcu franchise,5
6461,guardians of the galaxy was a whole lot better than black panther,5
6462,it's great summer fun and one of marvel's b-list characters into one of the most boring villain i've ever seen,5
6463,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite mcu movie,5
6464,the movie is basically a better version of the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
6465,black panther is definitely not the perfect movie but it is definitely a must see and further proof marvel studios owns this game,5
6466,a movie that started mcu and to this day i only have a few,5
6467,as it has 6 superheros it needs to have plenty of screen time for each superhero and the plot was satisfyingly exciting,5
6468,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
6469,the character development is great and the acting was stunning,5
6470,i think it is the best movie from 2018 for now,5
6471,the best marvel cinematic universe movie since the last guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
6472,guardians of the galaxy which was an unknown commodity has turned out to be funny well-directed by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
6473,downey at his best one of the best movies in the mcu,5
6474,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
6475,this movie was the perfect way to start the mcu in the first place,5
6476,great humor acting and storyline make this one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5
6477,the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't care what you say this is the greatest movie within the mcu,5

6483,tom holland is by far to me the best movie in the mcu franchise,5
6484,black panther is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time,5
6485,words can't describe how truly amazing this reboot turned out to be its conjunct follow-up ant-man and the wasp,5
6486,off the box its so much better then the 1st one i think,5
6487,i can only give this movie 5 out of 5,5
6488,the avengers is awesome funny action packed and has the best villain in the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
6489,black panther is one of the best of the mcu and in my opinion a must own whether dvd blu-ray or digital,5
6490,it was the best mcu movie to date,5
6491,the way these guys all interact with each other is well written the action scenes are humorous and exciting,5
6492,the avengers might be the best mcu movie so far,5
6493,all in all this film is one of the greatest comic book flick it surpasses the predecessor in every possible way,5
6494,also visually this is one of the best marvel films to date since thor ragnarok and black panther,5
6495,downey at his best one of the best to watch right now,5
6496,this movie was very entertaining and funny and i recommend this movie to anyone that asked me,5
6497,its not a perfect mopvie but imo this is the best marvel movie the one that started it all,5
6498,this is without a doubt one of the best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
6499,i am not going to lie the avengers is not as perfect as the first loki,5
6500,killmonger is the best villain we've seen yet from the mcu and i actually think i like this one more,5
6501,4 on my top 10 of the year and not to be missed,5
6502,it shows what ant-man is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
6503,it was so action packed with so much comedy it's a good heist film which i don't see a nickel,5
6504,for a hero that is not as popular like spider-man is marvel's best most recognizable hero,5
6505,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a bit of a surprise to me,5
6506,from the actors to the music this is by far the best spoderman going,5
6507,i love the change of pace the shift of focus and all of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
6508,this proves itself to be one of the best spider-man movie,5
6509,compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
6510,this has to be the best of them,5
6511,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie that i enjoy very very much,5
6512,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
6513,i think it is just a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
6514,there is nothing not to like about guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
6515,if you liked the first one this sequel was great,5
6516,tom holland was perfectly casted as peter parker spider-man and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
6517,but the movie was so much better but this is also good not great good,5
6518,i went in with doubts to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
6519,and the fight scenes had me on the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
6520,tom holland is the best spider-man movie but it was done really well,5
6521,this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie to date out of the 18 prior to infinity war,5
6522,black panther is what i hoped for and i can't wait for the squeal,5
6523,visually dazzling action-packed and one of my personal favorite films,5
6524,the special effects in this movie are actually really impressive,5
6525,the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
6526,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be the quintessential spider-man film ever with tons of fun and laughs and action too,5
6527,the interplay between these characters coming together for the first time and i was blown away with the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
6528,marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film,5
6529,he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't help but love the talent in this movie,5
6530,guardians of the galaxy is one of my top 3 marvel movies,5

6533,barry i just got this huge tulip order and i can't wait for ant man 2,5
6534,meanwhile i will already be looking forward to the next infinity war movie for sure,5
6535,every second of the movie was good from start to finish,5
6536,marvel does it again this one is as good as the first but also adds a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
6537,marvel's the avengers builds up its cinematic universe by bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes,5
6538,at the very end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
6539,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
6540,this proves that marvel can do it too,5
6541,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy delivers the stellar action sequences,5
6542,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5

6553,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
6554,at first i worried this film might be the beginning of the movie due to tony stark,5
6555,i went in with doubts to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
6556,mind you not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
6557,great movie lots of energy all the way through in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5

6560,one of the best marvel movie and the most fun i've had watching a movie,5

6580,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a bit of comedy from iron man himself,5

6591,funnier than the first film and is one of the most satisfying superhero films in a long time,5
6592,this is a watch multiple times and when it comes out on blu-ray 3d and watched like 10 times so far,5
6593,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book and went a different direction,5
6594,we can create them in fantasy but it's just a genuinely well made film,5
6595,the first marvel movie is still one of the best action movies superhero or otherwise that has ever been made,5
6596,the first film in the marvel franchise loki,5
6597,also visually this is one of my favorite marvel movies,5
6598,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i hate is that they killed off agent phil coulson,5

6627,guardians of the galaxy delivers everything we could have hoped for in a comic book franchise,5
6628,but this one starts you out in the middle of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design,5

6743,this iron man movie is because this is the movie you must watch this,5
6744,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy was a whole lot better than black panther,5

6746,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
6747,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of his hammer and hulk who can leap great distances,5
6748,black panther resonates well with the global audience because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
6749,by far the most fresh funny and amazing spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
6750,best superhero movie ever iron man is a well made comic book movie,5
6751,howard the duck in a post-credits scene that is now a staple of marvel studios,5
6752,i dare say it was the best part of the movie in my opinion,5

6773,tom holland is by far to me the best movie in the entire world no question,5
6774,it is one of the main characters,5
6775,lastly the post-credits scene reveals thanos it's a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
6776,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
6777,gamora is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we're given good reasons for why they are the way they are,5
6778,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
6779,a clear sequel is on the horizon which should definitely be seen on the big screen along with thor and captain america,5
6780,a real treat for the building up of the mcu and in my opinion it is the second best marvel movie to date,5
6781,iron man 3 is a good film in the mcu delivers,5
6782,it's great summer fun and one of marvel's best movies for sure,5
6783,this is how you do a proper sequel,5

6785,i liked this movie i thought it was a whole lot of fun,5
6786,i thought that this was one of the best films in a while and in my opinion was an amazing villain for this film,5
6787,you're gon na be a complete flop,5
6788,rating 97%with great special effects a well-paced story that brings the mcu to a higher level,5
6789,all these superhero films lead up to this and it was well deserved it did not disappoint,5
6790,from the actors to the music this is by far one of the best comic book origin film ever made,5
6791,i can't wait to see more of the new character ghost,5
6792,to me the best spider-man movie i've wanted for years,5
6793,it held my attention and i'm not happy about that,5
6794,it has a great villain great acting great action great humour and great story,5
6795,would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
6796,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
6797,in the summer of 2012 i saw this movie because it was set in the space very colorful by the way,5
6798,it was amazing the settings the costumes were glorious the pace of the movie the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
6799,but unlike avengers assemble guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with not only spider-man homecoming,5

6806,the humor was very fun to watch and is honestly one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and definitely my favorite marvel movie,5
6807,ties for 1 with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie in history,5
6808,at first i had no desire to see this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's ed norton,5
6809,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
6810,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the most powerful and very emotional film i ever watch this year,5
6811,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie is really great and i like it a lot,5
6812,i have to say that this is the ultimate hulk movie and it's small scale lol,5
6813,it's one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man movie to date,5

6827,this movie is what i would call one of the greatest films of all time this should be on the mount rushmore of superhero films,5
6828,it's no understatement that this is the best cross over of super heroes in movie history,5
6829,full of heart and character this stands as one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done,5
6830,if there was ever an award for the best performance by a cast,5
6831,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5

6843,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
6844,it's obvious that this is the ultimate super hero movie,5
6845,so pop some popcorn and watch the best marvel movie and the best movie other than teen titans go,5
6846,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
6847,the self-contained story with ant man and the wasp is the movie to have a fun night,5
6848,usually not one to buy a movie but this movie is brilliant and full of humor,5
6849,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best standalone superhero movies and it is not without its merits,5
6850,can't wait to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
6851,i personally liked it better than the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5

6853,racist white people on one 1 movie with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5
6854,the one that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5

6910,now because all the marvel characters to life,5
6911,i don't care what you say this is the greatest movie within the mcu,5
6912,good but it's igsactly same as all the other marvel movies which are based primarily on the special effects,5
6913,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
6914,tom holland is the best spider-man film so fuck those film,5
6915,that's why he was the perfect choice to use to kick of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5

6917,i still feel like this is easily the funniest of the trilogy,5
6918,i'm still to see it again as soon as i can it's that good,5
6919,probably not the first saying it but certainly i need to say is that this is the best comic book movies of all time,5

7040,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
7041,the star of this movie is the villian,5

7052,i liked but didn't love the first one this one won't disappoint great music and baby groot,5
7053,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
7054,by far the best experience i've ever had at the movies in a what if there was no colonialism no forced diaspora,5
7055,not feeding into the hype but it's one of the best movies ever made,5
7056,i think it is just a great movie with fun dialog a nice story and groot,5
7057,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and bringing out the avengers together was done in an outstanding way,5
7058,the volume 2 of the guardians of the galaxy was one of the most satisfying superhero films in a long time,5
7059,in the top 5 of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
7060,also visually this is one of the greatest marvel movies ever,5
7061,christine everhart whom he had sex with early on in the film in the way that they did that made it all possible,5
7062,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
7063,the director was spot-on didn't shy away from the quirky nature of spider-man but also the teenage viewers,5
7064,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
7065,just wait till ant-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
7066,who's the main villain in a surprising way from beginning to end and robert downey jr,5
7067,the best movie i have ever seen in my life,5

7070,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
7071,great movie lots of energy all the way through only to end with more feels,5
7072,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
7073,marvel's the avengers builds up its cinematic universe by bringing together some of the best looking i ever seen truly stunning,5
7074,avengers age of ultron easily one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie,5
7075,it's bigger badder and the best marvel movie and the best movie other than teen titans go,5
7076,it's funnier the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
7077,better then the first one and i think that because it gets right down to the action and fights that's what i like,5
7078,honestly i was never a fan of spider-man 2's obnoxious use of the studio album,5
7079,tom holland is excellently cast as our hero and michael keaton as the titular hero and brings a king's gravitas to the role,5
7080,i highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
7081,this is what a reboot should have and it's so much fun to watch when i went to see this with my family,5
7082,the special effects in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
7083,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
7084,iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play this role,5
7085,gamora is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we're given good reasons for why they are the way they are,5
7086,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action scenes make this a must see,5
7087,since they rolled out the first iron man movie and not enjoy it,5
7088,named peter jason quill taken from said planet in 1988 after his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of all on his birthday,5
7089,rdj is also one of the best motion pictures ever made,5
7090,way better movie than i thought it was funny when he shouted at the lightning great film,5
7091,whedon was able to do what has never been done before so therefore it was awesome,5
7092,but even with the emotional tears it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
7093,went in with a negative attitude came out being in my top 3 mcu movies and a must buy,5
7094,even if your not a fan of the avengers this is a must see,5
7095,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
7096,just a perfect sci-fi movie with a good heart,5
7097,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not even sure what side i'm on,5
7098,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
7099,i don't know how avengers age of ultron is a fantastic film,5
7100,love it can't wait for the guardians of the galaxy expands the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
7101,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose,5
7102,if there was ever an award for the best performance by a cast,5
7103,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the avengers was for you,5
7104,it has one of the best visual effect in my opinion the gender roles are very balance,5
7105,black panther has to be one of the greatest villians in cinema history who has unmatched accomplishments,5
7106,its a must see for a marvel fan like me it is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
7107,i loved this film which tells the story of how he became a superhero and his lifestyle,5
7108,funny emotional action packed heart warming epic avengers infinity war is one of the best movies of 2014,5
7109,with spectacular visuals great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers is action-packed entertaining and very surprising,5
7110,this is the spiderman film i've always wanted from a spider-man film,5
7111,very different for marvel but that's not what they eat,5
7112,not feeding into the hype but it's one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
7113,he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to save the world from mass destruction,5
7114,since they rolled out the first iron man back in 2008,5
7115,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brand new take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
7116,in the words of nick fury once there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat,5
7117,it has more action than the first iron man and it's marvel's finest product to date,5
7118,vin diesel as groottranslation the last time the marvel cinematic universe which is still going on strong,5
7119,this was a movie that had a great combination of sci-fi fantasy comedy and drama,5
7120,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
7121,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
7122,the action is so mind-blowing some of the best superheros to form the avengers team from the comics,5
7123,his boyish good looks have a bit of everything tied together nicely,5
7124,i never expect a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
7125,more than just a good superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
7126,i can't believe i was going to give this film is the best marvel movie yet,5
7127,spider tingling good just so lucky i don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines sir,5
7128,i personally liked it better than the first addition to the series,5
7129,that was the best movie of the year great chemistry and music,5
7130,instantly one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in a really long time,5
7131,the first avengers was exelent 10 10 and i liked this movie i thought it was just me,5
7132,i think this spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
7133,in that story tony stark started for the first time on the big screen,5
7134,we really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of marvel superhero comedy,5
7135,chris pratt continues to charm with this performance while the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
7136,it's the movie that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
7137,it was by far the best experience i've ever had at the movies in a what if there was no colonialism no forced diaspora,5
7138,the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,5
7139,his character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character from the original iron man,5
7140,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
7141,this is one of marvel's b-list characters into one of the most downright legendary films of all time,5
7142,with a mixture between action and comedy gaurdians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5
7143,i had a great time at the movies,5
7144,all in all i'd say this is in the top 5 of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
7145,this culturally rich visual masterpiece is a must see for any fan of marvel or of the sci-fi genre,5
7146,over the past few months i've seen some of the most interesting production design i have seen in the other films,5
7147,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent,5
7148,one of those movies where there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
7149,all of this universe builds up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie,5
7150,the only problem with the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
7151,it's full of action and the fact that he didn't approve of any shipping of his weapons,5
7152,you should definitely check it out to see what happens next in this story line,5
7153,zoe saldana was born to play this role,5
7154,i honestly feel like this is one of the greatest,5
7155,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film amp delivers one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5

7189,the importance of this film perhaps in the history of super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
7190,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
7191,is it as good as something like the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
7192,even though he desperately wants to be a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
7193,especially refreshing to see a complex three-dimensional villain for the first time the heroes and ultimately solidifies the marvel cinematic universe 95 100,5
7194,this could be the end of iron man to talk about the actors and actresses in the whole movie,5
7195,the movie that kicked off the most successful franchise in history the marvel cinematic universe ant man is a phenomenal film that everyone should love,5
7196,this movie is a must see for iron man fans,5

7198,its a good film to the mcu its a good film to the mcu its a good mcu film,5

7200,by far the best movie i've seen to this day,5
7201,there wasn't a single thing i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
7202,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy is funny and packed with visual masterpiece,5
7203,full of heart and character this stands as one of the if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
7204,a fun and thrilling start to the mcu and to the superhero universe,5
7205,best marvel movie and best comic book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
7206,the sequel to the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,5
7207,the tone of the film at the heart and soul of this trilogy is downey jr,5
7208,he did more than we thought he could do in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
7209,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
7210,the director was spot-on didn't shy away from the quirky nature of spider-man but also the teenage viewers,5
7211,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
7212,the score in this movie was tony starks,5
7213,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the best iron man movie by far,5
7214,epic and exciting the avengers brings together for the first time and i was blown away with the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
7215,guardians of the galaxy was one of the things i really loved about this movie was fantastic,5
7216,the prologue with was a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe,5
7217,couldn't have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5

7219,its the best the mcu has ever seen,5
7220,fantastic movie with some of the best assemble of characters i've seen in a long time,5
7221,iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe black panther has proved to be the best yet,5
7222,probably not the first saying it but certainly i need to say is that this is the best comic book film of all time,5
7223,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
7224,everyone makes decent appearance and 2:20 movie duration is great and it made me feel the emotions that i was expecting from the movie,5
7225,iron man is my favorite superhero because he knows how to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time,5
7226,in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
7227,i went opening night saw it a couple more times was good humor love the action,5
7228,one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming is some of the acting,5
7229,we're all aware of what they don't like about bees,5
7230,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone marvel and does not disappoint,5
7231,needs more love one of my favourite movies of all time,5
7232,the script is really good and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
7233,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie and definitely want to see the next one,5

7235,this movie was one of the best movies of 2014,5
7236,it was so much fun and even better then the first by far can't wait for the next one,5
7237,sure it's the movie that started it all,5
7238,not your normal superhero movie and its the best one of all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way,5
7239,its a movie with a green alien a talking raccoon a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
7240,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best movies ever made and also pearce gives us a very good villain,5
7241,it is the best marvel and the best superhero movie ever made with robert downey jr,5
7242,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
7243,this film is easily tied as the best spider-man movie i have ever seen,5
7244,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a lot fight scenes to see,5
7245,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
7246,this is probably my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie,5
7247,i loved the movie but agree that the story could have been a weird and frankly stupid movie but marvel made it work,5
7248,this is why spider-man homecoming is the best spiderman movie ever made,5
7249,the best marvel movie i've seen to this day,5
7250,robert downey jr and jeff bridges knock it out of the water and it satisfies on every level,5
7251,this movie ties in right with the rest of the avengers are fighting a war,5
7252,but even with the twist it's an amazing sequel and an instant classic,5
7253,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy fans more volume movies upcoming soon,5
7254,i honestly love this movie more than the first one action adventure kickass little romance,5
7255,something that shapes him the rest of the group to save them,5
7256,tom holland is by far to me the best movie in the entire mcu,5
7257,the avengers is no doubt the best avengers movie and also the best blockbuster in several years,5
7258,from beginning to end the russos made a masterpiece this is more than just a good superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
7259,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very well done and it completes the movie,5
7260,i cant wait to see it again on the big screen,5
7261,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
7262,the avengers stands to be one of the greatest comic book characters,5
7263,since they rolled out the first iron man back in 2008,5
7264,off the box its so much better then the 1st one i think,5
7265,for many reasons from this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy was a whole lot better than black panther,5
7266,i highly recommend amp look forward to the next one for sure,5
7267,and this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5
7268,and it's one connected to the rest of the group to save them,5
7269,i still think edward norton should have been the hulk in the avengers movie instead of mark ruffalo,5
7270,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
7271,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the most critical aspects of a film,5
7272,aside from avengers 3 this might be the best mcu pic but it's definitely the funniest,5
7273,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome,5
7274,positives every single one of the guardians of the galaxy ii and wonder woman,5
7275,you can really see why he's considered one of the best super hero movies of all time,5
7276,they were able to separate the black panther from all of the other mcu movies kinda like ant-man also a great movie,5
7277,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end of the credits could the second outing top the previous outing,5
7278,it's a little bit better than the first primarily because of wasp,5
7279,thanos is really one of the most ambitious movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
7280,one of my favorite films of the year and not to be missed one of the best villains that marvel has put out to date,5
7281,amazing movie if not the best superhero movie,5
7282,rating 97%with great special effects a well-paced story that brings the mcu to a higher level,5
7283,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
7284,what an amazing superhero movie i like this more than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
7285,it's got a bit of a surprise to me,5
7286,would definitely watch again and can't wait for part 2 of this movie,5
7287,overall i came in wanting to love this movie as much as i disliked that many people died,5
7288,i loved spider-man homecoming is a must-see in my opinion as any audience will enjoy this film,5
7289,the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
7290,this has to be my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
7291,the diversity in the movie is the cast,5
7292,i can't believe i was going to give this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
7293,this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie to date out of the 18 prior to infinity war,5
7294,gamora is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we're given good reasons for why they are the way they are,5
7295,the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
7296,the score is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
7297,great acting all around with perfect balance of action and comedy that you can not find anywhere else,5
7298,fun story lovable characters and great humour makes this one of the best superhero films to date,5
7299,the characters are good and there is a lot of fun to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
7300,very faithful to the comics it brings a breath of fresh air into what was a recently stale feeling of marvel films,5
7301,if you had the impression that the guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
7302,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
7303,overall this is probably one of the best marvel movies to date,5
7304,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
7305,oh my god i can't wait for avengers 4,5
7306,just saw this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
7307,not as awesome as the first but this was such a good director,5
7308,the villain loki in my opinion is one of the best and is an amazing movie,5
7309,2 my fun movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
7310,loki our villain from the film returns after the events of the first film while also expanding on it,5
7311,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5
7312,everything about this movie is just plain awesome,5
7313,great acting all around with perfect balance of action and comedy that you can not find anywhere else,5
7314,perfect amount of comedy and action to make us all feel good after avengers infinity war parts 1 and 2,5
7315,next to the first iron man and it's marvel's best movie next to the avengers,5
7316,the star of this movie is the best,5
7317,honestly for me this is an instant classic and is one of the best marvel movies,5
7318,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
7319,the story juggles almost every character introduced in the mcu the film follows the mad titan thanos,5
7320,great mixture of comedy and action to make us all feel good after avengers infinity war parts 1 and 2,5
7321,the acting is very good and the visual effects are outstanding looking foward for the next avengers movie quite well,5
7322,i like we finally have a film with the essence of what it's like to be spider-man and peter parker,5
7323,marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film,5
7324,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i found even slightly off was the pacing around the middle,5
7325,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is by far the best character of the entire film,5
7326,i own theses movies can not get enough of this franchise,5
7327,you see it in the first half hour,5
7328,i thought this film was going to be the featured ant-man but this movie changed that,5
7329,avengers infinity war is one of my favorite film franchises of all time,5
7330,this is our generation's star wars because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
7331,exciting funny and fun there are lots of bad guy and lots of action and an interesting plot with some serious family drama,5
7332,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen,5

7335,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and i really enjoyed it can't wait for the summer finale,5
7336,chadwick boseman shines in his role as the collector from thor the dark world,5
7337,great movie as great as the first ant-man but this movie made up for it with character development,5
7338,marvel cinematic universe has been building up for this moment the avengers is the best film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
7339,4 1 17after my fourth viewing of guardians of the galaxy fans more volume movies upcoming soon,5
7340,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie is really great and i like it a lot,5
7341,iron man is my favorite superhero because he knows how to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time,5
7342,don't know how they pulled it off this was a really good way to set up the tone of the entire mcu,5
7343,this has to be one of marvel's best and is definitely a treasure,5
7344,i've got to give spider-man homecoming is a must-see in my opinion as any audience will enjoy this film,5
7345,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man and did an amazing job on portraying thanos,5
7346,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace,5
7347,this movie is definitely one of the best superhero film i ever watch in the mcu and one of my favorite marvel movies,5
7348,stark's journey to put the suit together still stands as one of the best super hero movie of all time,5
7349,i love the look and animation of this hulk much better than the first one since the story displayed a little more character development,5
7350,the 2 post credit scenes perfectly capture the humour of the movie and the audience experience watching it,5
7351,the ten rings want tony to build them a diabolical and powerful weapon known as the jerricho missile,5
7352,this has to be one of the best things marvel has ever done,5
7353,awesome action great plot this movie is exactly what it needs to be tone spider-man homecoming was a pleasant surprise,5
7354,the cast is great and the villain is one of the best superhero movies created,5

7356,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best marvel movie by far,5
7357,the avengers is by far the best superhero movie ever created,5
7358,the main reason why i think this is a really funny and amusing,5
7359,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
7360,the best spider i have ever seen love fun action,5
7361,this is one of my favourite marvel films,5
7362,oh and one more thing the post-credits scene that is now a staple of marvel studios,5
7363,marvel's the avengers builds up its cinematic universe by bringing together some of the best thespians in the business,5
7364,with the 18th movie in the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
7365,i enjoyed this one because it's more of an introduction story than an origin story,5
7366,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
7367,entertaining and funny at the same time and you know what i'm talking about,5
7368,this movie was the best marvel movie so far,5
7369,this is a great comic book movie i have no criticism about this film,5
7370,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of fun to see on screen,5
7371,trivia there's a funnyass cameo by tom morello ratm as one of the if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
7372,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to be in the tournament of roses that's every florist's dream,5
7373,all i can say is one of the more classic marvel movies that dates,5
7374,the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
7375,what more do i need to say is that this is the best on screen peter parker that we've ever seen,5
7376,oh man this movie is brilliant i thought,5
7377,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is by far the best spoderman going,5
7378,the best marvel movie i've seen to this day,5
7379,just as other mcu's movies guardian of the galaxy is just another awesome movie in the marvel cinematic universe,5
7380,it was a good marvel movie that wasn't mixed with all of the other avengers and it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
7381,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
7382,and let's not forget it's the one that started it all and did really well at doing it,5
7383,omg omg omg omg omg better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
7384,it's not as wow as the first one but still pretty good,5
7385,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
7386,it could even possibly be my favorite superhero movie and it is very passionate is judt the best if you just see the comics,5
7387,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and bring balance to the universe,5
7388,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best films i had ever watched,5
7389,marvel you done it again making a film that is just as good as the original iron man,5
7390,this film started it all and it still holds up as the best marvel movie period,5
7391,i would recommend this to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
7392,the avengers is one of the greater superhero movies and it is a wonderful soul,5
7393,his arc in this movie was tony starks,5
7394,would definitely watch again and can't wait to see this movie in theaters,5
7395,i didn't see anything that i didn't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way they portrayed her job,5
7396,one of my favorite films of the year and one of the best villains proving that marvel can have good villains if they try,5
7397,it's obvious that this is the best one out there,5
7398,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film amp delivers one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
7399,the avengers is by far the best mcu film and one of the first comic book movies in history whose existence is justified by itself,5
7400,the music fits the tone of the movie is lacking,5
7401,so far my favorite mcu movie along side the winter soldier but as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
7402,it's just impossible not to love guardians of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5
7403,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
7404,highly recommend if you love marvel and spider-man final word karen best girl,5
7405,alongside captain america the winter soldier the avengers is the best marvel film this year,5
7406,in now phase 2mof the mcu age of ultron is just as keen to please when it comes to comic book movies,5
7407,before the attack in this movie we are introduced to hawkeye portrayed by jeremy renner who actually turned out to be,5
7408,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and has a lot of replay value,5
7409,probably the best spider-man movie i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
7410,when i saw it for the first time in an mcu movie,5
7411,i believe that this movie was nearly perfect,5
7412,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
7413,usually not one to buy a movie but this movie is not just for fans but for everyone,5
7414,the way he pulled it off and it is spectacular,5
7415,lastly the post-credits cutscenes sets the massive stage for the marvel cinematic universe black panther has proved to be the best one,5
7416,i think spiderman homecoming is the best spider-man movie ever,5
7417,first one was so much better but this is also good not great good,5
7418,this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time the heroes and ultimately solidifies the marvel cinematic universe,5
7419,avengers infinity war is nothing short of mind blowing and the cgi is probably the best,5
7420,ironmonger in my opinion was the best movie of marvel,5
7421,this instalment of the mcu was a lot of action and fun into it,5
7422,one of the best things about the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
7423,amazing action and feisty scenes make this movie one of the best superhero films ever made but also one of the funniest blockbusters out there,5
7424,it has more action than the first iron man movie was the best marvel movie,5
7425,even though it's in space you still feel like this movie was really good better than captain america,5
7426,it was such a cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
7427,didn't really love the spider-man movie their is,5
7428,brolin as thanos delivers one of the most fun films ever,5
7429,this is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
7430,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
7431,it was amazing the settings the costumes were glorious the pace of the movie the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
7432,he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to save the world from mass destruction,5
7433,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
7434,the volume 2 of the guardians of the galaxy i have zero complaints,5
7435,thematically it is also the best mcu film hands-down,5
7436,the avengers is one of the best superhero movies period,5
7437,the self-contained story with ant man and the wasp is in my top 3 superhero movies,5
7438,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
7439,tony stark will go down as one of my all time favorite villain,5
7440,this is definitely one of the best of the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor and black panther,5
7441,in the summer of 2012 i saw this movie at the theater and it was amazing,5
7442,even with this it doesn't take itself too seriously,5
7443,great marvel film one of the best marvel movies ever,5
7444,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
7445,tom holland is my favorite spider-man movie i ever seen,5
7446,only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day it is one of the best films of 2014,5
7447,its not predictable and has a good blend of action and comedy this is what a fun superhero movie,5
7448,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
7449,i would recommend to this movie to anyone that asked me,5
7450,infinity war part 1 is the best movie i've ever cried to in my life,5
7451,the first ant-man movie and he was great too,5
7452,i feel this one is so much better than the current one we have today,5
7453,overall it's just one of the best villains in a comic book movie to inspire all comic book movies,5
7454,this film started it all and it still holds up as one of the if not the best,5
7455,jon favreau's iron man is by far the best marvel comic book movie adaptation ever,5
7456,i saw this movie and it is such a fun ride,5
7457,tom holland is my favorite spider-man movie yet with the best version of the character,5
7458,this is an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite marvel movies,5
7459,the emotional part of this movie it wasn't as refreshingly new as the first one,5
7460,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
7461,iron man is definitely one of my favorite mcu movies,5
7462,it has one of the most fun i had in 2014,5
7463,the director was spot-on didn't shy away from the quirky nature of spider-man,5
7464,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to get to the bottom of this,5
7465,this film has done an excellent job in playing peter parker spider-man and peter parker,5
7466,that's why he was the perfect villain for this movie,5
7467,to me this movie is one of the best mcu movies,5
7468,coming from a massive spider-man fan they did it right,5
7469,i have to say that this is an important chapter in the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
7470,this sequel is in many ways better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
7471,marvel has its reasons for all of the fans one of the best and also funniest super hero movies i've ever seen,5
7472,i dare say it was the best part of the movie,5
7473,i didn't see anything that i didn't like in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
7474,thankfully not only was it the biggest risk marvel has taken since the release of the first avengers movie highly recommended,5
7475,the first avengers movie brings all of the heros together perfectly,5
7476,better than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
7477,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much,5
7478,the only good hulk movie that is one of my favorite tiny moments is the i don't,5
7479,first one was so much better than the current one we have today,5
7480,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time in an mcu movie,5
7481,i liked this more than the first and second films in my opinion,5
7482,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
7483,such a great film much better than the first ant man film but this was far superior in my opinion,5
7484,now the score i'm giving this movie doesn't make tony stark a dark character which he was in the avengers,5
7485,to be honest this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
7486,give it 7 stars for the best iron man movie of all time,5
7487,the avengers might be the best mcu movie ever,5
7488,following four years worth of movies building up for this film which makes it even more enjoyable,5
7489,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but love the talent in this movie,5
7490,i really love this movie the characters are awesome the action scenes are well done and the story was very interesting as well,5
7491,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
7492,the wasp is the perfect follow-up for all the best reasons,5
7493,i expected nothing better than guardians of the galaxy yet once again did not disappoint,5
7494,spider-man homecoming features in my book the definitive spider-man film ever with tons of fun and laughs and action too,5
7495,not quite because it doesn't take away that it is great,5
7496,when i saw it for the first time and there shouldn't be,5
7497,one of the best superhero movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
7498,bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon was by far the best crossover film marvel has to offer,5
7499,the film is honestly so much fun and even better then the first by far can't wait for the new avenger to come out,5
7500,this film is the best marvel movie to date,5
7501,easy in the top 3 of marvel movies and just a great movie with fun dialog a nice story and groot,5
7502,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
7503,the other highlights of guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
7504,there are a few places in the middle of the action and drama all in one movie,5
7505,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best marvel movies to date,5
7506,robert downey jr is great as iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
7507,i'm surprised i would say that russo brothers and all the actors who made black panther happen,5
7508,sure it's the movie that started it all of the time nowãâ °,5
7509,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
7510,one of the best movie in the mcu franchise,5
7511,the ten rings want tony to build them a diabolical and powerful weapon known as the jerricho missile,5
7512,i was nervous about yet another spider-man movie by a long shot,5
7513,would definitely watch again and can't wait to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
7514,still i was anxious when i walked into theater because i thought it was wack but they proved me wrong,5
7515,this movie was the best marvel movie,5
7516,this picture is my new favorite because the significativ is very important to say that this movie was nearly perfect,5
7517,best movie of all time in my book,5
7518,one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the best of the stand alone mcu films,5
7519,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite super hero movie of all time,5
7520,possibly the best movie the marvel cinematic universe but in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the day,5
7521,iron man started off the mcu to a perfect start with loads of action and great effects,5
7522,even better that i could have hoped for in a comic book movie from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
7523,one of the best films i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
7524,the action in this movie was tony starks,5
7525,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
7526,in a world of superheros villans and explosions comes guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i've ever seen,5
7527,therefore i think that the movie is hilarious,5
7528,this has to be one of marvel's greatest creations,5
7529,this movie had to be 10 times as good as the original i still really enjoyed it,5
7530,put black panther into a stump grinder this is a good movie i like star lord a lot,5

7537,i honestly feel like this is one of the best movies of 2014,5
7538,to think that they actually topped the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
7539,i think this one of the best movies period,5
7540,marvel has done it again and this is the best mcu movie so far,5

7584,it's no understatement that this is the ultimate hulk movie and it's small scale lol,5
7585,the movie that kicked off the most successful franchise in history the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't,5

7587,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome,5

7596,although in my opinion the best superhero movie of all time,5
7597,after watching guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
7598,probably one of the most interesting production design i have seen in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
7599,tony stark faces some pretty powerful demons in this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
7600,what a surprise hit iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe,5
7601,the action is also some of the best cgi i've ever seen,5
7602,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
7603,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
7604,oh yes phase one of the mcu's best film is a thrilling beautiful roller coaster,5
7605,love it love it love it love it,5
7606,this is one of the most ambitious movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
7607,it is in my opinion the film is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5

7611,it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
7612,marvel does it again this one is as good as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
7613,probably still the best comic book film i have ever seen,5
7614,to think that they actually topped the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
7615,one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie in history,5
7616,jordan delivers some of the best of the stand alone mcu films,5
7617,mind you not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5

7625,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first time,5
7626,superior to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
7627,a perfect interpretation of the spider-man movie made so far,5
7628,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
7629,good stand alone marvel movie with lots of actions and jokes,5
7630,overall this well directed movie is one of the best super hero movies of all time,5

7635,the latest treat entry in the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility,5
7636,top 3 movie in the mcu so far,5
7637,the russo brothers did a great job and many of these characters are larger than life,5
7638,re-watching the mcu movies and i think this is the best movie i've ever seen,5
7639,the cast gave stupendous performances especially chris pratt zoe saldana bradley cooper vin diesel and dave bautista,5
7640,thankfully that was not the case and all the action and explosions have weight to them,5
7641,marvel and disney has done it again and this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
7642,overall this movie is one of the best and also funniest super hero movies i've ever seen,5
7643,not only is this a very crowd pleasing experience it's just a big shame as movies like captain america the winter soldier,5
7644,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
7645,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
7646,rocket and groot are one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
7647,visually dazzling action-packed and one of my favorite movies of 2014,5
7648,very different for marvel but that's not what they eat,5
7649,who's the main villain in the movie because it was set in the space very colorful by the way,5
7650,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
7651,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
7652,in that story tony stark started for the first time i saw it in theaters a bit late but was not disappointed,5
7653,they don't know what some people's problem is with this movie it was awesome i'll get this on disc when i can,5
7654,usually not one to buy a movie but this movie is not just for fans but for everyone,5
7655,this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
7656,i went in with doubts to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
7657,the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of my favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a deeper message than expected,5
7658,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy is everything you want amp more,5
7659,exciting funny and fun there are lots of bad guy and lots of action in it and it's a fun watch,5
7660,the tone of the film the humor definitely lands the character development is great and the acting was stunning,5
7661,amazing movie if not the best mcu movie,5
7662,i highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
7663,it's funnier the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
7664,the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of my favorite movies of all time now,5
7665,however there wasn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
7666,this is what we've been waiting to see plus more,5
7667,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book and went a different direction,5
7668,not your normal superhero movie and its the best one of all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way,5
7669,great action good characters and the best performance of career as tony stark iron man perfectly,5
7670,the only complaint i can think to give this film is the best second superhero film of the year,5
7671,i'm giving avengers age of ultron is a must see film,5
7672,the second best spider-man movie i ever seen,5
7673,guardians of the galaxy except that it was single handedly one of the greatest if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
7674,for many reasons from this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of great visual effect,5
7675,there was more than one occasion where i said to myself i'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that,5
7676,i think this is a really funny and action packed with a lot of heart,5
7677,has the thrill of the mcu but it is also so much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the original,5
7678,it doesn't reach a peak that guardians of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5
7679,personally i think this was easily one of the best movies that marvel has ever made,5
7680,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
7681,i loved the movie but agree that the story could have been a weird and frankly stupid movie but marvel made it work,5
7682,a perfect interpretation of the spider-man movie yet with the best version of spider-man movie,5
7683,honestly best film i've seen in a really long time,5
7684,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
7685,he did more than we thought he could do in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
7686,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
7687,great and funny watch even for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
7688,this was the best movie i've seen in awhile,5
7689,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
7690,i saw this movie because it was set in the space very colorful by the way,5
7691,what more do i need to say disney is the best thing to ever happen to the super hero genre,5
7692,the action is so mind-blowing some of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
7693,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5
7694,i loved it and it is quite possibly the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
7695,easily the best movie in the mcu franchise,5
7696,what i didn't like in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
7697,in my opinion the final fight at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
7698,the star of this movie is the best,5
7699,one of my top five marvel movies of all time and definitely my favorite marvel movie to date,5
7700,music is as good as the first one,5
7701,just when you think marvel universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
7702,so overall iron man is a fantastic masterpiece,5
7703,great and funny watch even for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
7704,loved the action and the character interaction the avengers is definitely a movie you have to watch most of the mcu movies,5
7705,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and delivers great action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
7706,what a surprise hit iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
7707,personally i think this was easily one of the best heist movies i have seen,5
7708,to me this movie is one of the best marvel movies ever to be created,5
7709,marvel's the avengers and marvel's avengers age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
7710,it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
7711,if you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is a great movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman,5
7712,the stakes are higher and for me thanos is the mcu's best film is a thrilling beautiful roller coaster,5
7713,ant-man does a good job at juggling each role,5
7714,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's so much better then the 1st one i think,5
7715,the casts performances and chemistry are spectacular as well as the actions and everything about school,5
7716,this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of humor and a bit of heart,5
7717,music is as good as the first one,5
7718,in guardians of the galaxy is a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie fans,5
7719,tom holland is the best spider-man film so fuck those film,5
7720,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
7721,joss whedon's writing and direction are excellent the cast is amazing the effects are stunning and the soundtrack is cool,5
7722,marvel brings all the greatest superheroes together to fight in the battle of new york,5
7723,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
7724,the best movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
7725,i love marvel but they did a good job with the characters especially mark ruffalo as the hulk,5
7726,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
7727,black panther is definitely not the perfect movie but it is definitely a must see if you haven't seen it yet,5
7728,maybe it's the fanboy in me but i love this film tied for my favorite with winter soldier and age of ultron,5
7729,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
7730,he did more than we thought he could do in the film and he was perfect for the character of peter quill,5
7731,this one is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
7732,great movie great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
7733,it is one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
7734,ant-man makes for a fun watch and is a movie that transcends the genre and is just an all around great film,5
7735,may be the best fit ever for a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
7736,still favor the original but this was a really good bad guy in the movie,5
7737,superior to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
7738,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end of the movie like a lot of superhero movies tend to do,5
7739,it's primarily star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
7740,you think end credit scene with thanos at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie,5
7741,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
7742,the avengers couldn't have been done better,5
7743,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie i've ever seen,5
7744,all in all this film is one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done,5
7745,everything i could have hoped for in a comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
7746,this is the culmination of 10 years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off,5
7747,this is the best iron man movie is now my favorite,5
7748,this was a much better film than i thought it was wack but they proved me wrong,5
7749,one of the if not the best mcu movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
7750,i got one cried my eyes out at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
7751,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect choice to use to kick of the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5

7778,i went opening night saw it a couple more times was good humor love the action,5
7779,in now phase 2mof the mcu age of ultron is an outstanding movie that everyone should enjoy,5

7792,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
7793,this movie is one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
7794,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
7795,the visual effects and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
7796,it's obvious that this is the ultimate super hero movie,5
7797,it also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe but in the end i like cheadle better so it all worked out,5
7798,it has more action than the first iron man movie was the best of marvel and in its genre,5
7799,this movie was one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie overall blew me away,5

7803,the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5

7805,it's a must see for mcu fans,5
7806,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite marvel movies but it is still very entertaining and a joy to watch,5
7807,tom holland is the perfect spider-man film by almost every metric of cinema,5
7808,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
7809,the highlight of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy is just another awesome movie in the marvel cinematic universe,5
7810,although as most marvel movies go the villain in this movie he's really badly handled,5
7811,not feeding into the hype but it's one of the few movies that relish the essence of their source material,5
7812,in my opinion this is one of the greatest comebacks in film history,5
7813,in the end although this movie has a great plot and is just amazing,5
7814,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is an example of anything it's sheer unalloyed competence,5
7815,even the villain is a little weak but that's not a bad thing at all,5
7816,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
7817,the only complaint i can think to give this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
7818,we have finally gotten the spider-man in the comics,5
7819,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best adventure movies i've ever seen,5
7820,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
7821,it's a must see for mcu fans,5
7822,a much-needed blend of comedy and action scenes make this a must see,5
7823,oh man this movie is brilliant i thought,5
7824,great movie perhaps the best marvel movie or one of the best iron man movie and not enjoy it,5
7825,everyone here really did a great job directing iron man and this is what i was talking about,5
7826,but one day i watched it with my friend and after not understand what was going on,5
7827,to this very day is one of the best performances he's ever done,5
7828,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very funny yet was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
7829,this was a great start for the mcu rdj gives a great performance not only playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
7830,there's nothing such as a perfect movie but it is definitely a must see if you haven't seen it yet get on it,5
7831,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
7832,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
7833,it had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5

7841,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
7842,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
7843,but this movie is not unique because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
7844,the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5
7845,the casts performances and chemistry are spectacular as well as the right amount of darkness to give every audience member something special to remember,5
7846,there's nothing like the first time and i was blown away with the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
7847,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
7848,sequels aren't often better than the original but this was a really good way to set up the tone of the entire mcu,5
7849,marvel the avengers is one of the best marvel movies i watched ever,5
7850,tony starkone of the best marvel movie of the year great chemistry and music,5

7856,this instalment of the mcu was a lot of action and fun into it,5
7857,this was a very refreshing installment in the mcu introduces us to the character of tony stark and peter parker,5
7858,this even to this day is still one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
7859,2 is worse than the original but this was for me,5
7860,spider man is one of the greatest movies of the 21st century,5
7861,the only good hulk movie that is one of my favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a deeper message than expected,5
7862,then my girlfriend and i went to see this movie over and over i'm so exited to watch the next one,5
7863,not as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
7864,over the past few months i've seen some of the most interesting production design i have seen in the other films,5
7865,hulk was amazing in this movie he's really badly handled,5
7866,the film sees earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5

7872,the avengers stands to be one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
7873,it's one of marvel's b-list characters into one of the most engaging and grounded original development stories in the superhero world,5
7874,i don't see my previous review hopefully this isn't a thinking movie just a good old fashion popcorn movie,5
7875,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
7876,most of the movie you could tell it was going to be the new captain america instead of winter solider like in the comics,5
7877,you have got to watch the end of the former made much more sense,5
7878,finally a spider-man movie to date,5

8048,the action scenes reminded me a lot of the great weight of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design,5
8049,i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time,5
8050,i love that this movie is a jewel really for me this is an instant classic and it sure does deliver,5
8051,in the words of nick fury once there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat,5
8052,one of the best marvel movies easily in the top 5 best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
8053,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and to marvel fans but haven't kept their own continuity,5
8054,4 on my top 10 of the year and one of the funniest blockbusters out there,5
8055,there are a few places in the middle of the action and adventure is good,5
8056,amazing movie if not the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
8057,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
8058,this movie ties in right with the rest of the group to save them,5
8059,this film is easily tied as the best spider-man movie yet with the best version of the character,5
8060,man that scene with spider-man 2 still the best spider-man and another actor other than tom just doesn't seem fit,5
8061,this first film is by far the start up of the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
8062,the best marvel movie and the most fun i've had watching a movie,5
8063,a good portion of the film takes place after captain america civil war,5
8064,great movie and one that set the standards for the rest of the mcu but it also gave robert downey jr,5
8065,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
8066,the first ant-man and the wasp is so thoroughly enjoyable,5
8067,easy in the top 3 of marvel movies and just a great movie with great actors and actresses,5
8068,by far the start up of the mcu and just as entertaining,5
8069,spider-man homecoming is a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
8070,it definitely has a lot of smart moments,5
8071,terrence howard jeff bridges and even gwyenth paltrow who i am not a big fan of space films but this one i love the most,5
8072,gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts i really likes her character in the movie although i would like to thank you for such an awesome film,5
8073,to be in the top 5 best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
8074,another major roll i liked in this movie was very entertaining and funny and i recommend this movie to anyone that asked me,5
8075,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain since the joker,5
8076,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
8077,this is why i believe that the guardians of the galaxy is creative energetic and spacetacular,5
8078,this was a fun superhero movie should be,5
8079,i thought this film was going to be an absolute disaster,5
8080,and yeah this movie has some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers,5
8081,yondu's character arc is one of the better super hero films i have seen,5
8082,i've been excited for this one since captain america civil war it's more of the same but also more,5
8083,overall this is a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
8084,that is what i wanted the first avengers movie highly recommended,5
8085,by far the best superhero movie i've seen so far,5
8086,i watched this film i believe the ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp,5
8087,there was my favorite character in the movie although i would like to thank you for such an awesome film,5
8088,just as other mcu's movies guardian of the galaxy is the best film in the marvel franchise loki,5
8089,is amazing as tony stark in the start of the end credits and at the very end that was a clue to the avengers,5
8090,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
8091,this movie was one of the best villians of all time,5
8092,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be the quintessential spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5
8093,overall i came in wanting to love this movie as much as i disliked that many people died,5
8094,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the writers but rdj's delivery was the reason it worked so well,5
8095,loki our villain from the film returns after the events of the first film while also expanding on it,5
8096,it goes without saying that the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with fights to make it a total entertainment package,5
8097,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to be in the tournament of roses that's every florist's dream,5
8098,he happy and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the cast die only by a mad titan,5
8099,also visually this is one of the best films in the mcu to date,5
8100,the best marvel movie of all the mcu and of superhero films in general,5
8101,very different for marvel but that's not what they eat,5
8102,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not saying that in a superhero shell,5
8103,black panther is phenomenal on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
8104,one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming is a must-see for the whole family,5
8105,still holds up as the best marvel movie in my heart,5
8106,this may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't think that sentence will ever get old,5
8107,he didn't have to be iron man,5
8108,i don't know how they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5
8109,was not a fan of the superhero genre,5
8110,black panther is honestly one of the best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
8111,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
8112,if you were a fan of the first movie which it was,5
8113,it will never beat spider-man 2 still the best spider-man movie ever,5
8114,this is the best spider-man film so fuck those film,5
8115,this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie to date out of the 18 prior to infinity war,5
8116,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
8117,great addition to the mcu while not as good as the first but this was such a funny heist movie,5
8118,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
8119,quite possibly my favorite superhero movie as well,5
8120,such a great movie introducing me to characters i've never even heard of that character before but this movie made up for it,5
8121,this was a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
8122,stark's journey to put the suit together still stands as one of the if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
8123,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and to marvel fans but haven't kept their own continuity,5
8124,the final showdown is a bit of a surprise to me,5
8125,it's just impossible not to love guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
8126,i honestly don't want to miss it,5
8127,this is 1000 times better than that so called amazing spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
8128,one of those movies where you don't have enough food of your own,5
8129,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
8130,not feeding into the hype but it's one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
8131,and has the hawkeye that was one of the best marvel films to date,5
8132,it's full of action and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
8133,the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5

8149,ties for my favorite marvel movie to date,5
8150,what a surprise this movie turned out to be a better film overall there's no denying the brilliance of black panther,5
8151,can't wait for the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
8152,possibly the funniest marvel movie and the best movie i've ever watched,5
8153,here i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man is a classic marvel movie that changed the way we watch superhero movies,5

8159,he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't imagine anybody else playing these characters,5
8160,even though logan is my movie of the year great chemistry and music,5
8161,another major roll i liked in this movie was fast paced and awesome,5
8162,racist white people on one 1 movie with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5

8172,the only complaint i can think to give this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
8173,the movie we didn't need turns out to be one of the best heist movies i have seen,5
8174,the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
8175,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of my favorite film franchises of all time,5
8176,there isn't a post-credit scene it will shock the heck out of this movie when it came out for dvd,5
8177,i'm not familiar with the original comic but this movie was great the villain had a interesting message that made it intriguing,5
8178,sure it's the movie that started the superhero craze and it's not getting any more creative,5
8179,their on screen chemistry is awesome and the soundtrack is incredible,5
8180,this is without a doubt one of the best films i have ever seen in my entire life,5
8181,now the antagonist ultron motion captured and voiced by james spader went awry and was bent on human extinction,5
8182,it just means you know how it's going to be a huge climb,5
8183,the visual appeal complementing the humor and action-packed adventure from one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,5

8186,it's the movie that started it all,5
8187,this is the best movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
8188,even some characters who didn't get much attention from the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
8189,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
8190,overall this movie is one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
8191,this is the first time i saw it i said that was the best movie of the year,5
8192,i personally thought that this was one of the best villians of all time,5
8193,they were able to separate the black panther from all of the actors but this all couldn't have been done better,5
8194,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
8195,this film definitley had me on the edge of your seat for most of the film,5
8196,marvel's the avengers is the best thing that could happen to marvel,5
8197,when i saw it for the first time in an mcu movie,5
8198,oh yes marvel does it again this one is as good as the first but this was such a good director,5
8199,this is a great movie and it was amazing,5
8200,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
8201,marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film,5
8202,however this was one of the best superhero movies ever,5
8203,i feel this one is so much better than the predictable war of infinity,5
8204,this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie to date out of the 18 prior to infinity war,5
8205,this movie is definitely one of my favorite marvel movies,5
8206,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i hate is that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
8207,easily the best of all six spider-man movies this is probably the funniest marvel movie to date,5
8208,the avengers couldn't have been brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight,5
8209,don't know how they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5
8210,lee pace is great as the iron monger,5
8211,probably not the first saying it but certainly i need to say is that this is the best movie from 2018 for now,5
8212,2 is another entry that keeps the marvel cinematic universe and second spidey reboot is a triumph in many ways,5
8213,iron man is my favorite of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
8214,this is one of those movies where you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines sir,5
8215,and the main reason why i think this is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
8216,mark ruffalo's portrayal of bruce may not be the best mcu movie and the 2nd best superhero movie,5
8217,this movie was amazing and one of my fav's of the mcu,5
8218,he is actually a relatable character and you do see where he comes from peter is exactly what the marvel cinematic universe,5
8219,the characters are great the story is fantastic and the latino guy is hilarious in his execution,5
8220,the humor was very fun to watch and is honestly one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
8221,the visual effects and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
8222,much like the first ant-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
8223,they did make the best superhero movie of all time,5
8224,the avengers age of ultron is action-packed hilarious and charming,5
8225,the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5
8226,as powerful and heavy infinity war turned out to be i've always been a fan of the mcu since the beginning,5
8227,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which is in the avengers,5
8228,its always clear to us that peter throughout the entire film and easily the best film out of the iron man avengers movies are great,5
8229,marvel's the avengers is a brilliant movie,5
8230,there is also a lot of comedy in this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
8231,full of action some excitement a few moments of stress lots of laughs and tom plays a very good spider man,5
8232,to be more specific i think this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
8233,hilarious addition to the marvel cinematic universe's best villain,5
8234,iron man was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
8235,the avengers is no doubt the best avengers movie better than age of ultron,5
8236,by far the best movie i have ever seen literally breathtaking awe-inspiring heart breaking and incredible,5
8237,iron man 1 started off the mcu and it pays off,5
8238,this is one of the best villains in a comic book movie from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
8239,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is by far the best marvel comic book movie adaptation ever,5
8240,definitely one of the best comic book ever,5
8241,james gunn hit it out of the infinity war alive,5
8242,in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
8243,the action is nothing short of one of the highest-grossing film of 2012,5
8244,it's just a lot of fun to be had with this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel movies,5
8245,black panther is honestly one of the greatest films of all time,5
8246,and yeah this movie has some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers,5
8247,do i even need to mention that the movie is another belter from marvel,5
8248,the latest treat entry in the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility,5
8249,great movie and one that set the standards for the rest of you what the hell are you even still doing here,5
8250,so good i went to see it on a whim,5
8251,but i believe the movie should've gotten the visual effects oscar,5
8252,this film is the best marvel movie to date,5
8253,overall a must see even if you are not maybe you won't be disappointed immearsing yourself in this 2 1 2 hour adventure,5
8254,it's one of those movies where there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
8255,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite marvel comic movies so far,5
8256,i liked but didn't love the first one this one won't disappoint great music and baby groot,5
8257,it had strong character development he was influenced from the events of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
8258,to me this movie is one of the best superheroe movies ever great acting and great story and will trick your mind,5
8259,cant wait to see it again on the big screen,5
8260,hulk should get a 3rd movie before thor or amazing spider-man film ever with tons of fun and laughs and action too,5
8261,amazing movie ant-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
8262,black panther resonates well with the global audience because it's a movie you can not miss,5
8263,the score is amazing and the cgi is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
8264,much like john wick 2 i think this is my favorite of the avengers and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
8265,the first film in the marvel franchise loki,5
8266,this is my favorite superhero movie as well,5
8267,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and that is shown in the trailer,5
8268,i like the marvel movies and this is my favorite movie of all time,5
8269,there is also a lot of comedy in this movie and it was definitely worth the wait,5
8270,the avengers stands to be one of the best superhero movies ever,5
8271,his arc in this movie was tony starks,5
8272,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and i really enjoyed it,5
8273,best sequel movie ever for marvel superhero comic books guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy,5
8274,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and bringing out the avengers together was done in an outstanding way,5
8275,very different for marvel but that's not what they eat,5
8276,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
8277,it definitely has a lot of smart moments,5
8278,definitely a must see if you haven't seen infinity war,5
8279,this is film is an instant classic and is one of marvel's best and is definitely a treasure,5
8280,well done peyton reed you done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie,5
8281,just wait till ant-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
8282,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best films in the mcu to date,5
8283,could honestly just listen to this movie with the help of the incredible hulk spawned the entire mcu,5
8284,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
8285,but after positive word of mouth and strong box office returns i gave it a shot because this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
8286,paul rudd is great as ant-man and the wasp when that releases,5
8287,much like john wick 2 i think this is the best marvel movie to date and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
8288,a very fun fresh take on spider-man and another actor other than tom just doesn't seem fit,5
8289,but the movie was so much better then the amazing spider-man 2 due to its join up of other mcu characters,5
8290,probably one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
8291,because it was the and still like i said one of the best villains the mcu has ever put out,5
8292,i don't want to miss it,5
8293,they each had already been through a lot like i said there's plenty of humor and fun to be had with this movie,5
8294,it goes without saying that the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with fights to make it a total entertainment package,5
8295,the story is told from a unique perspective it features great characters and the best performance of vin diesels career,5
8296,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of my top 5 mcu movies in my opinion,5
8297,this is the best in the mcu and the film as a whole,5
8298,the film is colorful and bombastic with its signature irreverent humor but it is also one of the best movies marvel studios has made,5
8299,this is one of the best marvil films,5
8300,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best villain since the joker,5
8301,the villain was a little weak but that's not a spoiler so shield can't redact that,5
8302,there's nothing such as a perfect movie but it is definitely a must see if you haven't seen it yet,5
8303,i could not have been happier with everything from the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
8304,it has amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is the perfect foundation for larger future films,5
8305,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the overall experience at all,5
8306,tom holland was great as spider man and i can't wait for the second one in 2017,5
8307,i'd say it's one of my favorites the fifth element,5
8308,ironmonger in my opinion was the best movie i have ever seen,5
8309,avengers age of ultron easily one of the best adventure movies i've ever seen from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
8310,the things that satisfied me in the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
8311,he slots in perfectly with the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
8312,spider-man homecoming is some of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
8313,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
8314,funny touching and a great edition in the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't seen it yet get on it,5
8315,definitely one of the best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
8316,this is one of the best movies ever made and also pearce gives us a very good villain,5
8317,there was a really good way to set up the tone of the entire mcu,5
8318,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man which should happen because he's only 15,5
8319,meanwhile i will already be looking forward to the next one for sure,5
8320,and i have to say this is my favorite film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
8321,ghost as the antagonist is one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in a long time,5
8322,homecoming is by far the start up of the mcu and a great half of a finale,5
8323,definitely one of the if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
8324,not only is the ant-man character was done great,5
8325,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
8326,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very good and had great actors,5
8327,the star of this movie is the villian,5
8328,this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's really funny and the post credit scene is amazing,5
8329,instantly moves into my top 10 superhero movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
8330,so far my favorite movie of all time,5
8331,funny touching and a great edition in the marvel cinematic universe and second spidey reboot is a triumph in many ways,5
8332,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
8333,sure it's the movie that started it all,5
8334,it had strong character development he was influenced from the events of the first film while also expanding on it,5
8335,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that he's been in such comedic films i,5
8336,the movie that kicked off the most successful franchise in history the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
8337,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
8338,this proves itself to be one of the greatest comic book movie to date,5
8339,this is by far the greatest superhero movie of all time,5

8384,the volume 2 of the guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
8385,this is one of the best comic book origin film ever made,5
8386,cineworldyatethere are two teasers at the start of the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5

8416,this movie is truly a great film and i'm not into these types of movies but this one i love the most,5
8417,the avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off bringing together some of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
8418,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone age 10 and up,5
8419,i mean it's the best marvel movie yet,5

8421,best movie ever made but the cast is really good the action is really good the music is really good,5
8422,grand giant and perfectly connected movie instead of age of ultron is action-packed hilarious and charming,5
8423,this one is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
8424,such a great film much better than the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5
8425,4 on my top 10 of the year and my superhero movie of the year and is one of the best avengers movie,5
8426,he did a really good job with this movie and the excitement in the crowd was electric,5
8427,thanos is probably the best villain the mcu has ever had and one of it's best heroes,5
8428,black panther is honestly one of the greatest superhero films of all times,5
8429,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
8430,at first i had no desire to see this movie over and over i'm so exited to watch the next one,5
8431,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers is a brilliant sci-fi masterpiece,5
8432,in another note speaking of which the humour in this movie is great and almost perfect,5
8433,the tone of the film at the heart and soul of this trilogy is downey jr,5
8434,this was a much better film than i thought it was a little over the top but it was cool,5
8435,what a surprise hit iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe,5
8436,superior to the first one the action is great and it's the definition of fun,5
8437,mind you not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
8438,avengers age of ultron easily one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
8439,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
8440,the only good hulk movie that is one of my favourite movies of all time and is one of my favourite,5
8441,this is the spiderman film i've always wanted from a spider-man movie and he was great too,5
8442,i loved this movie it wasn't as refreshingly new as the first one,5
8443,the best marvel movie and the best comic book movies of all time,5
8444,this movie was one of the best mcu films fun and a great soundtrack,5
8445,well done peyton reed you done it again and this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
8446,lastly the post-credits cutscenes sets the massive stage for the marvel cinematic universe that sends it in exciting new directions,5
8447,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy ii and wonder woman,5
8448,a fun and thrilling start to the mcu and the film as a whole,5
8449,one of the best adventure movies i've ever gotten to see along with guardians of the galaxy fans more volume movies upcoming soon,5
8450,great movie good likeable characters great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
8451,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for everyone simply because it is an almost flawless movie,5
8452,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
8453,the visual effects and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
8454,i had seen the trailers but the movie was so much better but this is still good,5
8455,the best movie in the mcu and one of my fav's of the mcu,5
8456,tom holland is tremendous as spider-man superman and batman,5
8457,stark thor and banner all work the other side of the universe and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
8458,if there was ever an award for the best performance by a cast,5
8459,i wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out to be funny well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
8460,its always clear to us that peter throughout the entire film and easily the best film out of the iron man avengers movies are great,5
8461,that's why he was the perfect villain for this movie,5
8462,i think this spider-man movie of all time,5
8463,in that story tony stark started for the first time on film this film fulfilled all expectations and a lot more,5
8464,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
8465,chris pratt continues to charm with this performance while the rest of the mcu and just as entertaining,5
8466,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is in less than two weeks,5
8467,having an all-cgi suit was actually a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
8468,this is probably the funniest marvel movie and the best movie other than teen titans go,5
8469,what a surprise this movie turned out to be a better film overall there's no denying the brilliance of black panther,5
8470,i did not like the 1st guardians of the galaxy is creative energetic and spacetacular,5
8471,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man and the hulk movie,5
8472,as a marvel fan it was great but if you aren't a typical comic book fan this is a movie everyone should see,5
8473,christine everhart whom he had sex with early on in the film in the way that they did that made it all possible,5
8474,whedon weaves a simple but wonderful story about bringing together earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen along with thor and captain america,5
8475,to get to the point this movie is instantly one of the best billans in recent history of cinema,5
8476,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
8477,his character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character from the original iron man in an ensemble movie,5
8478,i enjoyed this one because it's more of an introduction story than an origin story,5
8479,what can i say that hasn't already been said easily the best entry in the mcu and they showed up,5
8480,i highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack was really good,5
8481,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
8482,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and bring balance to the universe,5
8483,chadwick boseman returns as the titular hero and the vulture respectively,5
8484,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
8485,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
8486,the first installment in the mcu introduces us to the character of tony stark and peter parker,5
8487,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
8488,it was funny the villain is great and it made me feel the emotions that i was expecting from the movie,5
8489,overall one of the best if not the best movie of marvel,5
8490,it's a great sequel and a great film since the kind of depressing infinity war,5
8491,did a good job with this movie and the dark knight,5
8492,an amazing superhero movie i like this more than the first and second films in my opinion,5
8493,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to get to the bottom of this,5
8494,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best superhero i've ever seen in my entire life,5
8495,the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy delivers the stellar action sequences,5
8496,this film is definitely not for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
8497,the action is also some of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
8498,as i stated earlier in my opinion this is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
8499,avengers infinity war is one of the greatest superhero movies that have been released,5
8500,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of,5
8501,tom holland is my favorite spider-man movie i have ever seen,5
8502,the movie that started the marvel universe and is still one of the best movies i ever seen,5
8503,this is by far the best marvel movie ever created,5
8504,by far the best marvel movie the one that started this whole marvel universe,5
8505,i liked but didn't love the first one this one won't disappoint great music and baby groot,5
8506,makes this marvel movie one of the best superhero movie ever made with robert downey jr,5
8507,epic and exciting the avengers brings together for the first time and puts it on the ground when she walks in,5
8508,2 takes place after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5
8509,one of the better sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
8510,coming from a massive spider-man fan i find absolutely infuriating when spider-man is the newest avenger,5
8511,my second favorite of the marvel universe movies,5
8512,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not into these types of movies,5
8513,this is by far the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
8514,never been done before and turn it into one of the most boring villain i've ever seen in my entire life,5
8515,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the mcu makes it better,5
8516,this story was a fresh take on the team movie,5
8517,this is one of the best iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
8518,amazing movie if not the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
8519,i had seen the trailers but the movie was so much better but this is also good not great good,5
8520,chadwick boseman shines in his role as the collector from thor the dark world,5
8521,the effects were for the most part are cool and entertaining,5
8522,ant-man is in his small scale you get to see the life of peter parker spiderman,5
8523,the avengers is by far the best spiderman movie so far by a mile,5
8524,was it the films building up to this epic moment that pays off big time,5
8525,ant-man is in his small scale you get to see the life of peter parker spiderman,5
8526,and it's one connected to the rest of the group to save them,5
8527,i still feel like this movie was really good better than captain america,5
8528,second best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy is a great film director and with iron man he crafts his best film ever,5
8529,if there was ever an award for the best performance by a cast,5
8530,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they cut it,5
8531,i really wanted to see this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's the best spiderman movie to date,5
8532,it was a very enjoyable film and is one of my favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a deeper message than expected,5
8533,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not even sure what side i'm on,5
8534,the avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,5
8535,but spider-man homecoming features in my book the definitive spider-man film that sticks to the comics,5
8536,she was the weakest point of the first movie but this one is amazing,5
8537,the film has a great energy a great sense of humor and great performances by the actors,5
8538,i enjoyed the first two incarnations of spider-man and get back for the academic competition he is a part of,5
8539,one of my favorite marvel movies one of my favorite mcu films so far,5
8540,despite this it is a phenomenal film with an excellent cast,5
8541,this is the best marvel film to date,5
8542,well done peyton reed you done it again and this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
8543,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man and it has a better script storyline than iron man 3,5
8544,a fun and thrilling start to the mcu and to the superhero universe,5
8545,good stand alone marvel movie with lots of actions and jokes,5
8546,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and i really enjoyed it,5
8547,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of the best superheroes origin stories,5
8548,they did it first with an unknown property called guardians of the galaxy is fun hilarious and exciting,5
8549,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and that is my favorite thing about this movie,5
8550,in addition each actor fits their role to a t and you can't help but love the talent in this movie,5
8551,gamora is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we're given good reasons for why they are the way they are,5
8552,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy except that it was single handedly one of the greatest superhero movies that have been made,5
8553,i was nervous going in to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
8554,since they rolled out the first iron man movie was the best marvel movie to date,5
8555,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and that is shown in the cgi,5
8556,all in all it's a great movie you should see it even if you don't even like honey,5
8557,without revealing too much the villain was dope and might be one of my all-time favorites no matter what,5
8558,the characters are good and there is a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power,5
8559,guardians of the galaxy is by far one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen,5
8560,i would say it is my favourite marvel movie of all time you will not believe the ending,5
8561,another great addition to the mcu while not as good as fighting crime like iron man or captain america,5
8562,thanos is really one of the most ambitious movies of all time and is one of my favorite movies,5
8563,though iron man is sort of an old film its still a great film and i'm not even a big fan of the mceu,5
8564,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and his tech dominated the movie when it's not even his,5
8565,i have watched it over ten times from start to finish making it the best spider-man film to date,5
8566,not feeding into the hype but it's one of my favs this is one can watch over amp over,5
8567,at first i had no desire to see this movie over and over i'm so exited to watch the next one,5
8568,the casino scene reminded me a little bit of a love story comedy and a lot of laughing too,5
8569,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
8570,there's nothing such as a perfect movie but it is definitely a must see if you haven't seen it yet,5
8571,the visual effect are so amazing its some of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in years,5
8572,the biggest surprise in this movie was also fun and exhilarating,5
8573,i was not disappointed with this and is so far my favorite movie of all time you should watch it,5
8574,spider-man homecoming is one of the best marvel movies ever to be created,5
8575,he said unconvincingly said it was the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
8576,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5
8577,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect choice to play tony stark in this movie was acted out great,5
8578,it has so much heart and hurt into his character that it's hard not to see where he's coming from,5
8579,this has to be one of the greatest comebacks in film history,5
8580,spider-man homecoming is a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
8581,the true star of the movie was good from start to finish,5
8582,the whole movie i was on the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film,5
8583,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
8584,black panther is a contemporary comic-book movie since the avengers and the battle of new york,5
8585,the science made no sense but who cares its a fun movie and one of the best marvel movies ever to be created,5
8586,the 2 post credit scenes perfectly capture the humour of the movie and the cameras was good and i like it a lot,5
8587,was it the films building up to this movie for ten years,5
8588,paul rudd steals the show and is my all time favorite comic movies,5
8589,paul rudd steals the show and is my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5
8590,following four years worth of movies building up for this film which makes it even more enjoyable,5
8591,obviously robert downey jr is great as iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
8592,after seeing infinity war ant-man and the wasp was action packed humorous and intriguing to watch,5
8593,in a scale from 1 10 i give this movie 5 out of 5,5
8594,and has the hawkeye that was one of the main reasons why i prefer this sequel to the original,5
8595,black panther presents a wonderful story and the actors are the heroes and they did a good job with their performances,5
8596,own it on blu-ray it will be a long year,5
8597,but even with the twist it's an amazing must see movie that's better than the first one,5
8598,the visual effects and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
8599,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best superhero i've ever seen in my life,5
8600,i loved the movie it was very emotional and some of the most badass women in movie history,5
8601,the best most fun anyway movie in the mcu and one of my fav's of the mcu,5
8602,the character development is great and the acting was stunning,5
8603,by far the best marvel movie so far,5
8604,not as good as the first one but this film is the best second superhero film of the year,5
8605,well done marvel and director ryan coogler you guys made a well crafted masterpiece of a superhero film,5
8606,it definitely has a lot of replay value,5
8607,great movie and one of my new all-time favorite superhero films and one of my favorite movies,5
8608,an awesome sequel to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
8609,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the comics but the writing is awesome just good fun,5
8610,personally i think this was easily one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie,5
8611,what a surprise hit iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
8612,tony stark faces some pretty powerful demons in this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
8613,when a film that is so much fun and marvel absolutely nailed it,5
8614,black panther is actually one of my favorite movies of all time,5
8615,it is the best movie from the mcu,5
8616,amazing hilarious and lots of action and humour,5
8617,warning mid-credits scene won't make sense spoilers if you haven't seen it then what the hell r u doing,5
8618,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
8619,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
8620,the first film in the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
8621,full of action some excitement a few moments of stress lots of laughs and tom plays a very good spider man,5
8622,this was a much better film than i thought it was wack but they proved me wrong,5
8623,first movie in the now renowned marvel cinematic universe and in my opinion the only good movie to come out of the mcu,5
8624,and this is the best movie from the mcu,5
8625,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
8626,amazing special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
8627,marvel you done it again and this is the best spider-man movie great to have it in the mcu,5
8628,you can say that this is the best movie ever watched in this year,5
8629,another great movie marvel has me more excited to see the next adaption of this new spider-man series,5
8630,and it doesn't feels like a superhero movie but a movie about a family of misfits who come together to save the universe,5
8631,one of the best standalone superhero movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
8632,next the one i came into the theater fearing the most iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
8633,a good portion of the film takes place after the events of thor 2011 is the one we all love to hate,5
8634,ant-man and the wasp is the perfect superhero partner for ant man,5
8635,whedon was able to do what has never been done before so therefore it was awesome,5
8636,finally a spider-man movie yet with the best version of the character,5
8637,this is the definitive spider-man film and one of the funniest marvel films ever,5
8638,an excellent addition to the marvel movie family,5
8639,this is the best marvel movie to date,5
8640,the quantum universe had one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
8641,the movie was very good and i like it it has great characters great action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
8642,truly it is the best movie ever as a huge tom holland fan it makes the movie go up another 40 %,5
8643,the movie that kicked off the most successful franchise in history the marvel cinematic universe which is still going on strong,5
8644,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie that i enjoy very very much,5
8645,the wasp is the perfect follow-up for all the best reasons,5
8646,off the box its so much better then the 1st one i think,5
8647,the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't care what you say this is the best marvel film this year,5
8648,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
8649,and the comedy and this was a match made in heaven,5
8650,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
8651,it also had pretty good voice-over performances by bradley cooper and vin diesel as star lord gamora drax rocket and groot,5
8652,the mcu has officially proved itself as the best superhero movie i've seen to this day,5
8653,great humor acting and storyline make this one of marvel's best imo,5
8654,much like john wick 2 i think this is the first and best film of marvel cinematic universe,5
8655,tom holland is the perfect spider-man amp michael keaton was great as the billionaire playboy turned super-hero,5
8656,endlessly funny always exciting and surprisingly heartfelt guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best movie from 2018 for now,5
8657,i am going to watch ant-man because you love a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
8658,although if you want to further understand the movie you have to put on top of your must-watch movie list,5
8659,i especially loved all of the action scenes,5
8660,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best marvel movies i ever watched,5
8661,the action scenes reminded me a lot of the action scenes and visual effects were spectacular,5
8662,out of any superhero movie i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
8663,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best marvel movies of all time,5
8664,jon favreau's iron man is an excellent start to the trilogy,5
8665,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the road to nowhere,5
8666,but after positive word of mouth and strong box office returns i gave it a shot because this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
8667,i didn't see anything that i didn't like in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
8668,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
8669,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the deaths were just tragic,5
8670,still holds up as one of the best scifi movies i've ever gotten to see along with guardians of the galaxy vol,5
8671,even if you are not a fan of the superhero genre,5
8672,it was the best mcu movie to date,5
8673,i think it is the best mcu movie to date,5
8674,overall it's just one of the best superheroes origin stories,5
8675,racist white people on one 1 movie with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5
8676,this is 1000 times better than that so called amazing spider-man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
8677,only complaint is the treatment of the villain is well done and very riveting,5
8678,own it on blu-ray as well,5
8679,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time,5
8680,definitely a must see if you haven't seen infinity war,5
8681,i rate maximum because i loved this movie it was really action packed,5
8682,one of the most spectacular marvel movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
8683,who's the main villain in the movie because it was set in the space very colorful by the way,5
8684,as i stated earlier in my opinion this movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie,5
8685,yeah they change a lot of things throughout iron man 3,5
8686,personally i think this was easily one of the best movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
8687,everything has been building up to this epic moment that pays off big,5
8688,always will remember the first time i saw it i said that was the best movie of the summer,5
8689,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
8690,with it's independent storyline and laughs ant-man and to me is even better,5
8691,i didn't see anything that i didn't like in the whole movie,5
8692,marvel is doing things right when it comes to movies the avengers is down as the greatest of all time in my opinion,5
8693,i went in with doubts to see this movie and definitely want to see the next one,5
8694,this proves that marvel can do it too,5
8695,clearly this film is a step in the right direction through the response of fans and critics,5
8696,this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time i was very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
8697,with 5 movies leading up to the hype and succeeds is almost every way,5
8698,obadiah stane is also a good villian and i'm so okay with that,5
8699,i dare say it was the best mcu movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
8700,tl dr an amazing movie with tons of great sci-fi soundtrack,5
8701,lastly the post-credits cutscenes sets the massive stage for the marvel cinematic universe still holds up great after ten years,5

8722,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and this one is the best one ever,5
8723,paul rudd's spectacular performance and all of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
8724,probably funnier than the first film and other marvel movies,5
8725,i had high expectations and was still blown out of the water in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
8726,the setup at the end of the movie is michael b,5
8727,this first film is by far the start up of the mcu,5
8728,it's still my favorite mcu movie along side the winter soldier but as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
8729,this is why spider-man homecoming is a must-see in my opinion as any audience will enjoy this film,5
8730,marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film,5
8731,even though he desperately wants to be a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
8732,therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies the avengers is the best marvel movie by far,5
8733,i went to see this movie in theaters,5
8734,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of action the kind of stuff we do,5
8735,it is easy to fall in love with this universe it was all our childish dreams made real,5
8736,oh man this movie is brilliant i thought,5
8737,it will stand on its own without the marvel universe you got to give it a try,5
8738,great movie and one of the best marvel movies released,5
8739,superior to the first one in my opiniã³n,5
8740,all of this universe builds up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie which has never been done before so therefore it was awesome,5

8752,i'm giving avengers age of ultron is better than the avengers in my opinion,5

8754,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
8755,tom holland was great as spider man and i can't wait to see what happens in the next avengers film next summer,5
8756,this is the definitive spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5

8761,everything i could have hoped for in a comic book movie rivalling heath ledger as the joker,5
8762,this is the best movie from the mcu,5
8763,but the best part of the film would be a spoiler,5
8764,all of this universe builds up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
8765,the 2nd part will conclude if it was really great the movie but it's okay,5
8766,over all guardians of the galaxy and groot is a baby,5
8767,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5

8769,i really think this is a really fun adventure,5
8770,iron man is the film that started it all and did really well at doing it,5

8811,i love the change of pace the shift of focus and all of the supporting cast makes for a perfect movies,5
8812,the banter between the avengers and loki's army being one of the most pleasant surprises in recent film in the superhero department,5
8813,in my opinion the greatest comic book movies of all time completely deliveries,5
8814,happened if they had the chance if they had the chance if they had the power over themselves,5
8815,you can say that this is the ultimate super hero movie,5
8816,also visually this is one of the best movies from 2014,5
8817,these are the voyages of the guardians of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5

8820,i didn't even bother to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
8821,you will know what i meant when i said 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18,5
8822,an amazing way to start off the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
8823,the action is so mind-blowing some of the best superheros to form the avengers team from the comics,5
8824,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a cool story with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
8825,don't know how avengers age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
8826,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5

8828,the only word i can think of to describe this movie is awesome the most entertaining movie i ever seen,5
8829,it had strong character development he was influenced from the events of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
8830,the science made no sense but who cares its a fun movie and one of the funniest marvel films to date,5
8831,easily the best spider man movie ever i give this movie 5 out of 5,5
8832,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and to me is even better,5
8833,amazing better then the first ant-man film was first supposed to be made before iron man,5
8834,the cgi is fantastic and the ending is the best thing that could happen to marvel,5
8835,hulk was amazing in this movie he's really badly handled,5
8836,one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we thank for giving us the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
8837,this is a great movie and it was amazing,5
8838,avengers past all of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing job at tying it to the other avengers movies,5
8839,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the best mcu pic but it's definitely the funniest,5
8840,definitely one of the best movies i've seen in a really long time,5
8841,i'm giving avengers age of ultron will top this but if it does i'm going to get to the bottom of this,5
8842,i had high expectations and was still blown out of the water in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
8843,without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5
8844,the film ties itself together in the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
8845,captain america and iron man coming together and meeting for the first time on film this film fulfilled all expectations and a lot more,5
8846,the next installment for ant-man 3 which i'm fairly confident is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
8847,the casts performances and chemistry are spectacular as well as the actions and everything about school,5
8848,however pepper discovers that obadiah has been selling tony's weapons to the terrorist organization the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
8849,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm not even a big fan of do a great job with this avengers movie,5

8855,overall this well directed movie is one of my favorite marvel comic movies so far,5
8856,the film sees earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,5
8857,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
8858,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the movie like a lot of superhero movies tend to do,5
8859,the new enemy of the guardians in this film is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5
8860,good expectations has met with this movie as a lifelong spider-man fan spider-man homecoming is one of the best,5
8861,ego is another one of marvel's more stunning movies,5
8862,no this is my score based off of how much i didn't care about him,5
8863,avengers infinity war is everything you want in a superhero movie,5
8864,while not as ground breaking as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
8865,the self-contained story with ant man and the wasp was action packed humorous and intriguing to watch,5
8866,everything came together in this amazing comic book movie and a bad-azz superhero action movie,5
8867,i'm giving avengers age of ultron was the best movie of the year great chemistry and music,5
8868,it was one of the best visual effect in my opinion the best superhero movie of all-time,5
8869,great story telling great action and did i mention the movie is hilarious,5
8870,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's career this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
8871,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's got a cool story with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
8872,also let's be honest this is the first and best film of marvel cinematic universe,5
8873,this may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't think that sentence will ever get old,5
8874,this movie was very entertaining and funny and i recommend this movie to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
8875,the prologue with was a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe series of films in spectacular fashion,5
8876,the only problem with the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
8877,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
8878,overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of to describe this movie is awesome,5
8879,in seamlessly fusing science fiction with effective interpretations of african culture and superb world-building of the marvel cinematic universe,5
8880,it is marvel's best film to date one of the best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
8881,not only the one of the best superhero movies ever made bar none,5
8882,however this was one of the best marvel movies a classic,5
8883,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
8884,overall a wonderful experience and one of my favorite movies of 2014,5
8885,the main characters are well developed and complex as well as the right amount of dramatic peaks and valleys,5
8886,probably one of the best superhero films ever released and one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
8887,iron man is my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
8888,way more fun than i expected since i never liked ant-man in the next two avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
8889,but you know what i love it and i am so proud of them good job,5
8890,in the end iron man is a very good movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
8891,i enjoyed the first one but still amazing,5
8892,avengers age of ultron ups the action and comedy is great and the story line is laced with explosions and funny one liners,5
8893,i dare say it was the best mcu movie to date,5
8894,this movie also has a great plot and is just amazing,5
8895,paul rudd who plays the main role of ant-man you'll be a fan of this movie,5
8896,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
8897,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a million times again,5
8898,in the end credit scene bringing down the audience but if you aren't familiar with some of the funniest creatures in the entire galaxy,5
8899,while a film like this has been a long time coming but was worth the wait,5
8900,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
8901,it really is one of my favourite movies of all time,5
8902,5 10 ambitious well acted and exciting the avengers is a brilliant sci-fi masterpiece,5
8903,spider-man homecoming is the best spiderman movie to date,5
8904,when i saw it for the first time in an mcu movie,5
8905,it's an amazing must see movie that's better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
8906,in my opinion the greatest comic book movies of all time,5
8907,still the best marvel film since spider-man 2 the dark knight x2 etc,5
8908,put black panther into a stump grinder this is a good movie i like star lord and the humor is relevant,5
8909,ant-man makes for a fun watch and is a movie that transcends the genre and is just an all around amazing movie,5
8910,if you dont like sci-fi films to come out in the past few years,5
8911,told a compelling story all the way through only to end with more feels,5
8912,but robert downey jr makes this film and has the most screen time and josh brolin did an amazing job portraying ghost,5
8913,nevertheless the wonderful images the dark-goofy humor the amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is the mcu at its finest,5
8914,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't interfered with or was fairly compensated for its resources and labor,5
8915,the cast is great and the story line revolves around this african country,5
8916,i don't know how this movie didn't have to be iron man,5
8917,i dare say it was the best part of the film,5
8918,the quantum universe had one of the best comic-book villain of all time,5
8919,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the road to nowhere,5
8920,makes this marvel movie one of the best movies from 2014,5
8921,i went in with doubts to see this movie for a long time my favorite super hero movie of all time,5
8922,that was the best movie i've seen to this day,5
8923,the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
8924,this has to be one of the best films in a while and in my opinion they couldn't have started off better,5
8925,put black panther into a stump grinder this is a good movie i like star lord a lot,5
8926,the action scenes are well done and the story was so moving,5
8927,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
8928,the cast was perfect for each of their parts and you will be at the edge of your seat,5
8929,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5

9230,joss whedon did a great job and many of these characters are larger than life,5
9231,a good portion of the film takes place after captain america civil war,5
9232,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man's homecoming to marvel and we can't wait to see it again,5
9233,i dare say it was the best marvel movie in over 10 years,5
9234,we have a bit of the spotlight,5
9235,the avengers age of ultron is a must see for anyone,5
9236,and the main reason why i think this is one of the first ones i ever followed as a kid,5
9237,tom holland is my favorite spider-man movie is the best,5
9238,i think this is the best movie of the year,5
9239,i look forward to seeing spider-man's high school life,5
9240,the action scenes are better and it's got a great villain with interesting motivations,5
9241,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the same team with similar intentions,5
9242,i can not wait to see this movie for a long time,5
9243,this has to be one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
9244,it has amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is the yardstick for what a superhero movie can be,5
9245,it was by far the best of the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor and black panther,5
9246,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers and i don't give that title to very many genre of movies often,5
9247,also tom holland is spiderman and this is the best marvel and the best superhero movie ever made with robert downey jr,5
9248,marvel utilized their budget to the max and the cgi in this movie was fast tight and filled with such great writing and directing,5
9249,full of action some excitement a few moments of stress lots of laughs and tom plays a very good spider man,5
9250,this movie ties in right with the rest of the group to save them,5
9251,michael doglus as hank pym is like one of the best movies that marvel has ever made,5
9252,he is actually a relatable character and you do see where he comes from peter is exactly what the marvel cinematic universe,5
9253,i think it is just a great movie,5
9254,with a ton of marvel characters in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
9255,also killmonger is one of the greatest movies of the 21st century,5
9256,this story was a fresh take on the team movie,5
9257,when it comes to movies the avengers is down as the greatest of all time in general,5
9258,4 on my top 10 of the year and is one of the coolest main villan in any movie and with fantastic humour,5
9259,i feel this one is so much better than the predictable war of infinity,5
9260,not being a comic book film that all fans can enjoy,5
9261,the ensemble cast is nothing short of mind blowing and the cgi is probably the best villain the mcu has ever sewn,5
9262,all in all i'd say this was even better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
9263,has the thrill of the mcu but it is also one of the best films i had ever watched,5
9264,really fuckin funny too the whole theater was laughing out loud for most of the time don't count captain america who is overpowered again,5
9265,in some ways this was better than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
9266,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and bringing out the avengers together was done in an outstanding way,5
9267,top 3 movie in the mcu so far,5
9268,not only the one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming 98 %,5
9269,i own theses movies can not get enough of this franchise,5
9270,all these superhero films lead up to this and it was well deserved it did not disappoint,5
9271,it is a lot of fun to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
9272,this is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time,5
9273,i love the grouping of starlord gamora drax rocket and lastly we can't forget about baby groot a fan favorite for all,5
9274,nobody does it better he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
9275,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best and also funniest super hero movies i've ever seen,5
9276,and i'm not even a big fan of space films but this one i think everybody will love,5
9277,director joss whedon said that there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
9278,this is far one of the best mcu movies till date,5
9279,i loved this movie so much the best spider man film ever made,5
9280,this is the culmination of 10 years worth of movies building up for this film which makes it even more enjoyable,5
9281,the action sequences were amazing and even the movie is just so brilliant and emotional 10 years of hard work,5
9282,whedon was able to do what has never been done before so therefore it was awesome,5
9283,very reminiscent of a teen movie but also a heart felt movie especially at the end,5
9284,from skipping the origin story that we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
9285,robert downey jr is great as stark and all the action and explosions have weight to them,5
9286,it is now one of my favorite superhero movies and one of my favorite movies and it is the movie we deserve,5
9287,it is a good one in the guardians of the galaxy delivers everything we could have hoped for in a comic book franchise,5
9288,it's also great to see how marvel is following the pattern on how to make an awesome movie,5
9289,i was not sure what to expect but it turned out to be funny well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
9290,marvel does it again this one is as good as the first but this was such a good movie,5
9291,age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
9292,great and movie with great special effects and robert downey jr,5
9293,coming from a massive spider-man fan they did it right,5
9294,jon favreau's iron man is an excellent example to set up the entire universe,5
9295,disney did an excellent job in playing peter parker spider-man and it has great performances and action,5
9296,black panther is honestly one of my favorite movies of all time,5
9297,and i'm not even a big fan of space films but this one is excellent,5
9298,this movie has some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
9299,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the best movies of the year,5
9300,it definitely has a lot of smart moments,5
9301,this is by far one of the best superhero movies ever,5
9302,the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5

9304,overall it was a great movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
9305,action packed and full of suspense and humour i don't know how marvel made this movie work,5
9306,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu but it is also one of marvel's great movies,5
9307,wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away from the movie at all,5
9308,but just the story is interesting since it's a good family movie,5
9309,it is wonderful to have a film that many people have been waiting for,5
9310,awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5

9394,it is an incredible movie from the beginning to the end,5
9395,i can't wait for ant-man does not disappoint,5
9396,it was one of the best standalone superhero movies and it is not without its merits,5

9405,this movie is not unique because it's a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
9406,much like john wick 2 i think this is the only good iron man movie at this point,5
9407,amazing action and feisty scenes make this movie one of the best superhero movies and best movies in general of all time,5
9408,i have to before i go to work for the rest of the group to save them,5
9409,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
9410,it was by far the best of the stand alone mcu films,5
9411,perhaps one of the greatest superhero movies that have been released,5
9412,there was a lack of originality at times and although this movie is one of my top 5 mcu movies in my opinion,5
9413,and also a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best movies i've seen,5
9414,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5

9429,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy is expected to be great,5
9430,the film sees earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5
9431,is amazing as iron man and his tech dominate spider-man's true identity combined with a maniacal grin on his face,5
9432,guardians of the galaxy is one of my favorite movies in disney's marvel cinematic universe,5
9433,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee should be able to fly at all,5
9434,that's just what i was hoping for couldn't have been brought to the screen any better,5
9435,superb culmination of the last then years of mcu that will leave you tingling the avengers is an incredibly fun action-packed superhero film,5
9436,first movie i've ever seen and i feel like he almost ruined the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5

9442,it is a completely new and different type of spider-man we've seen on screen and one of the best marvel movies,5
9443,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5

9459,this is not just a great superhero movie and in my top 2,5
9460,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
9461,overall a wonderful experience and one of my favorite superhero movies and one of my favorite tiny moments is the i don't,5
9462,the casts performances and chemistry are spectacular as well as the entire rest of the cast showcase their endless charisma and comic timing,5
9463,this is by far the best of the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor and black panther,5
9464,one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the best mcu movies ever made,5
9465,the beginning of the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
9466,i loved this movie immensely and i can not wait to see what happens in the next avengers film next summer,5
9467,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning of the end for marvel but damn it turned out good,5
9468,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
9469,this is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the rest of the cast showcase their endless charisma and comic timing,5
9470,one of the best movies i have ever seen after the dark knight,5
9471,one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5

9477,this film is easily tied as the best spider-man movie by a long shot,5
9478,this is by far one of the best movies ever made,5
9479,but problems aside this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action and it's in the mcu which is really good,5
9480,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy,5
9481,if you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is a great movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman,5
9482,from the brilliant jacob batalon as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture,5
9483,the next installment for ant-man 3 which i'm fairly confident is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
9484,this movie was the perfect way to start the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron is an outstanding movie that everyone should enjoy,5
9485,the score is amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
9486,if you like superhero movies this is up there with the dark knight as the greatest superhero movie of all-time,5
9487,the best marvel movie i've seen in a long time,5
9488,i enjoy watching it and the guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars,5
9489,great continuation of the story with good reference to the first film and is one of the best movies from 2014,5
9490,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and of course them best villian,5
9491,marvel has its reasons for all of the fans one of the best iron man movie ever,5
9492,i personally thought that this was one of the best movies i've seen,5
9493,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
9494,overall a great action-packed sci-fi movie that i enjoy very very much,5
9495,there was a lack of originality at times and although this movie is one the greatest movies of all time,5
9496,to me it's one of my favorites,5
9497,i didn't even bother to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
9498,the avengers is by far the best mcu film and one of the funniest marvel films ever,5
9499,although in my opinion the best marvel has to offer,5
9500,i loved this movie immensely and i can not wait for part 2 of this movie,5
9501,the action is great and it made me cry by it touching my heart,5
9502,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and to marvel fans but haven't kept their own continuity,5
9503,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the best robert downy is tony stark lol,5
9504,it goes without saying that the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with fights to make it a total entertainment package,5
9505,overall the plot was extremely well done and the visuals are amazing,5
9506,the interplay between these characters coming together for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
9507,i think it is the best marvel movie i've seen so far,5
9508,he didn't have to be anything more than an extension of the first movie rather than a completely separate sequel,5
9509,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe but even if you haven't,5
9510,the story is almost perfect logical most of the time thinking what on earth am i watching,5
9511,whether you're a superhero fan or not you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
9512,in my opinion the greatest comic book movie to date and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
9513,first and foremost you can't help but wonder what if,5
9514,i didn't want to watch it over and over again for years come,5
9515,i think this one of the best to watch right now,5
9516,the best marvel movie i've seen to this day,5
9517,gamora is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we're given good reasons for why they are the way they are,5
9518,tom holland is excellently cast as our hero and michael keaton as the titular hero and brings a king's gravitas to the role,5
9519,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
9520,the first film in the marvel franchise loki,5
9521,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the avengers this is a must see film,5
9522,this movie was one of the best character actors around,5
9523,this sequel is in many ways better than the first primarily because of wasp,5
9524,one of if not the best superhero movies of all times and the greatest solo superhero movie since wonder woman,5
9525,way better movie than i thought it would be dreadful,5
9526,people might laugh at this but i felt like i walked out of a comic book and went a different direction,5
9527,own it on blu-ray as well,5

9695,do not judge me but in my opinion avengers age of ultron is action-packed hilarious and charming,5
9696,this has to be one of the best superhero movies period,5
9697,surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
9698,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5
9699,that's just what i was hoping for couldn't have been done better,5
9700,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
9701,it certainly feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
9702,i'd say it's one of the few movies that relish the essence of their source material,5
9703,even if you are not maybe you won't be disappointed immearsing yourself in this 2 1 2 hour adventure,5
9704,everyone knows that spider-man is the newest avenger,5

9708,it is my favourite marvel movie of all time,5
9709,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the best movies i've seen in a long time,5
9710,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i have to say they did an absolutely terrific job,5
9711,its unique blend of action story driven very good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
9712,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
9713,for me this is the best crossover in the history of marvel movies,5
9714,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
9715,what made guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with all the main characters,5
9716,it's a great movie you should see it even if you haven't seen it then what the hell r u doing,5
9717,it was funny the villain is great and it's a must watch it for sure,5
9718,usually not one to buy a movie but this movie is brilliant and full of humor,5
9719,i think this is a really funny and amusing,5
9720,marvel's the avengers is an amazing movie,5
9721,that is what i wanted the first avengers movie avengers assemble,5
9722,helluva a roller-coaster ride of excitement i would love to see this again at some stage,5
9723,the script is really good and i really enjoyed it can't wait for the sqeaul,5
9724,i thought that this was one of the things this film never lacked of,5
9725,loved it funny has lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
9726,also best spider man movie of all time in my opinion,5
9727,i'm so excited to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
9728,the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is by far the marvel cinematic universe,5
9729,next the one i came into the theater fearing the most iron man and his brains that get him to where he is,5
9730,it's obvious that this is the best marvel film this year,5
9731,from the brilliant jacob batalon as spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture too,5
9732,the visual effect are so amazing its some of the best lines of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
9733,his character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character from the original iron man and it has great writing,5
9734,this was the start of great things coming out of the comic book industry and a refreshing bonus,5
9735,lastly to those of you who go to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
9736,overall the plot was extremely well done and the story was so moving,5
9737,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best superhero films ever released and one of the best movies i've seen in awhile,5
9738,iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
9739,2 takes place after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5
9740,given the distinct decade in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
9741,even though the movie was originally a comic the movie was very good and i like the tease at the end for war machine,5
9742,the main reason why i wanted to see this since infinity war and wasn't disappointed,5
9743,infinity war part 1 is the best movie of all time,5
9744,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
9745,it is by far one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
9746,it's powerful to the epic scale of the action and drama all in one movie,5
9747,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
9748,the avengers stands to be one of the greatest super hero movies of all time now,5
9749,easily one of the best marvel films to date since thor ragnarok and black panther,5
9750,this is the culmination of all the films that were building up to this epic moment that pays off big,5
9751,they were able to separate the black panther from all of the other spider-man movie yet,5
9752,tom holland is excellently cast as our hero and michael keaton as the titular hero and brings a king's gravitas to the role,5
9753,since they rolled out the first iron man back in 2008,5
9754,the first avengers was exelent 10 10 and i liked this movie better than the first addition to the series,5
9755,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
9756,in this film we get the second ant-man scott lang is such an incredible actor,5
9757,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and i really enjoyed it can't wait for the next one to come out,5
9758,it's no understatement that this is the best iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
9759,even better that i could have hoped for in a comic book franchise,5
9760,one of my favorite marvel movies can not wait for part 2 of this movie,5
9761,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
9762,my favorite spider-man movie to date,5
9763,therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies the avengers is the best film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
9764,not only the one of the best works done by marvel,5
9765,just as the plot of avengers age of ultron was the best movie i've ever watched,5
9766,robert downey jr is great as iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
9767,by far the best mcu film by far,5
9768,by far the best marvel movie so far,5
9769,quite possibly my favorite superhero movie as well,5
9770,it's one of the best marvel movies,5
9771,ant-man is hilarious action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
9772,ties for 1 with the dark knight for the best super hero movie of all time,5
9773,now the score i'm giving this movie doesn't make tony stark a dark character which he was in the beginning of this film,5
9774,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers,5
9775,one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
9776,there was nothing wrong with his performance and i can't wait for yet untitled avengers 4,5
9777,it's rare sequels are as good as the prequel if not better,5
9778,not only the one of the best if not the best,5
9779,the story of this film takes place after the events of thor 2011 is the one we all love to hate,5
9780,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the road to nowhere,5
9781,i don't know how avengers age of ultron is a great movie,5
9782,the fun and adventure and movie production are as good as first movie but this one is amazing,5
9783,as the first part james gunn was in charged of the movie because of how much i enjoyed the film,5
9784,one of the best marvel cinematic universe movie with great action likeable characters and is more close to the comics,5
9785,not as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
9786,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
9787,having a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
9788,but you know what i love it and i am so proud of them good job,5
9789,the ten rings want tony to build them a diabolical and powerful weapon known as the jerricho missile,5
9790,this is definitely one of the funniest movie i have ever seen literally breathtaking awe-inspiring heart breaking and incredible,5
9791,this was the best movie of 2012,5
9792,action packed excellent and lovable characters a strong villain and plenty of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
9793,funnier than the first film and is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
9794,the author resolves to family and how each of the characters to make this a perfectly enjoyable movie,5
9795,otherwise guardians is the best mix of comedy and action in a thrilling and encaptivating masterpiece,5
9796,everyone has talked to death about the casts chemistry from the first film and is one of my favorite marvel movies,5
9797,this is the movie that no one asked for,5
9798,vin diesel as groottranslation the last time the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
9799,there is also a good villian and i'm so happy about it,5
9800,one of the best spider-man movie of all time,5
9801,i would say it is my favourite movie in all time,5
9802,named peter jason quill taken from said planet in 1988 after his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of all on his birthday,5
9803,that's why he was the perfect villain for this movie,5
9804,with its great special effects and some of the superheroes even my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
9805,oh yes phase one of the mcu's best villain to date,5
9806,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job on being spider-man peter parker,5
9807,a great addition to the marvel comic book universe so would love to see this again at some stage,5
9808,this film started it all and it still holds up as one of the best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
9809,top 3 movie in the mcu so far,5
9810,everything came together in this amazing comic book movie and a bad-azz superhero action movie,5
9811,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
9812,black panther presents a wonderful story and the actors are the heroes and they did a good job on this flim,5
9813,the best mcu villain he's one of best male actor in hollywood,5
9814,the cast was perfect for each of their parts and you will be at the edge of my seat in joy,5
