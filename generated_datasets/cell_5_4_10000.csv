0,and i was ready to upgrade to a better phone but didn't want a second txt,5
1,overall the pros outweight the cons and the phone is not an issue for me,5
2,i had been using a similar case on mine but the rubber over the buttons is a little hard to press,5
3,she loves it and it goes in and out with ease,5
4,you know where your phone is at 20-25,5
5,the suction cup is very strong and the bendable arm is amazing very strong,5
6,this takes us to the downside of this one is of high quality,5
7,they contacted me to make sure a replacement battery was sent to me for review purposes,5
8,the smaller size makes if convenient to carry in a bag since you can fold it and put in your pocket for an outing,5
9,i was really not impressed with the packaging and the include content cleaning cloth squeegy and mini spray bottle,5
10,i don't know how many times and for how long you need to press them a little hard,5
11,if your needs are so strong that it will last a very long time to deliver,5
12,it definitely was privacy proof though because sometimes i couldn't even find a mark where the case hit the ground,5
13,this is hard to do and i like how it is hugs my phone,5
14,the response you get from your oem battery,5
15,this ice mark ii screen protector shield is one of the best features of the battery pack,5
16,even with the slight buzzing from time to time but they are otherwise identical,5
17,the battery life is not all that great but its not noticable from day to day wear tear,5
18,in fact you won't hardly notice that there is a kickstand on the back is very sturdy and heavy duty without being stiff,5
19,just because of how well it would work in our truck,5
20,it is labeled as a universal car mount look no further than this ezopower dock,5
21,if you're going to use the cimo s-line case for protection from drops and spills that happen with any phone,5
22,this will also work fine with devices that charge via usb and i have just one extra for when i need it,5
23,speaking from experience you simply won't find a dock that will make this usable,5
24,you can also charge more than one phone when we are on the road as well,5
25,the battery true is not the best because of glare,5
26,only setback is it does not plug in properly because of the case it is a secure protected place for carrying your smart phone,5
27,we bought tjis as an extra charger for my kindle fire,5
28,oftentimes i was able to purchase the case friendly ultimate screen protector,5
29,it's a note 3 it's a welcome accessory for the iphone,5
30,also after using a 100 % charged phone and battery,5
31,the only thing that could be said it that there is no confusion on which one to pick,5
32,i really like this wallet case the first 2-3 minutes after i opened it up it looked like the picture,5
33,use my phone with the new galaxys 3 and my kindle,5
34,don't try this at home and the usb cable plug seats firmly in the charging port of the headset,5
35,i have no issues with this great case from cute pie inc,5
36,the initial charge does take a while for the best phone out there the iphone or the top line samsung phones,5
37,still great add long as you do not have access to power i,5
38,great case for the phone is adjustable to make room for other stuff,5
39,i ordered two more for my hubby and he loves it,5
40,will order some more just because i don't use any data,5
41,otherwise its invisible providing you get the bubbles out near the speaker thing at the top,5
42,great cheap price for a a quality screen protector for a phone,5
43,add on a nice screen protector for a while now and i have no intention of putting the phone in the golf cart,5
44,update 03-04-2014everyone should have one of this product so the phone doesn't have to lug any around,5
45,it is working great and it is just what it says it will do and does it well,5
46,i get compliments daily on how cute it is and people touching the pink plastic to see if it works any better,5
47,pairing is simple the battery life is well just insane and i don't have to edit my review,5
48,fits perfectly on my phone verizon version phone,5
49,the case doesn't add a lot of bulk with a full case lile hte spigen linear ex metal or the spigen neo hybrid cases,5
50,5 micro usb cable that was included with my otterbox commuter case,5
51,there are some green led lights in the case do a great job for such a small device,5
52,but the problem is on google's end and i used a charger and just left it on,5
53,after using it for two months and it has not bubbled with a case on it,5
54,even at work there would be no risk to try it,5
55,it is amazing that there can be a 10 difference,5
56,we connected the phone to the car stereo,5
57,with the wall charger and usb cord this is an all-around good purchase and worth the approximate 25 i spent,5
58,these are amazing i have the white gn3 and it shows all of the phones i have,5
59,i used it with an ipod iphone and two computers in only a few hours a day and yeah i rarely charge,5
60,this one grips is from the side which makes it much easier to find and use,5
61,as long as you're not paying for it either,5
62,this is nice so that the user can see there is a charge for each mobile device you own this solves that issue,5
63,0 media player this is a free country but in my experience with an iphone 3 g,5
64,now i can type on the keyboard while it's sitting the parking lot,5
65,would recommend it to anyone who needs a car charger with at least two of us will have a dying battery and need the charger,5
66,comes in a little plastic case for battery,5
67,nice size and shape if you need this item to charge the charger and it worked great,5
68,it has no screen protector but thats not the case with this charger,5
69,from the apple newton through the palm and windows mobile devices i can honestly say this is the best money i have spent so far,5
70,i recently fell into a lake and my phone was not damaged at all on the touch screen better than without the protector,5
71,this is not an option this battery should be required for any power hungry device,5
72,so much more functional for me as i have some from my old devices,5
73,5 5 and the only con i have is lint magnet but i can deal with it,5
74,cord is a bit short and there are no malfunctions when plugging in,5
75,works great nice look and the price was great the cover is really nice too,5
76,i ordered the same product for my ipad 3 only it's 10 feet long,5
77,i use them both usually when i'm watching movies such as on a plane,5
78,only thing that i don't have to remove the phone,5
79,the usb a male end fits into your computer or a stand-alone gps navigators into the cup it is truly versatile,5
80,travel charger u250 for htc thunderbolt designed for non-apple devices clearly labeled a and na,5
81,i could complain about especially a year later with all sorts of cables stuck into the phone coming out and mount worked the same,5
82,its sleek design makes it easy to hold,5
83,wish the gooseneck was a little more frosted than i expected,5
84,it's useful to me and i am just as pleasss with it as i am,5
85,this is to keep the phone from sliding around on the dash of an suv,5
86,i don't usually have so much trouble with this gesture,5
87,to be fair i don't get a phone with a built in cable but it doesn't come out,5
88,05 02 2014 update i've been using the case for a dock it takes some maneuvering,5
89,for example place an index card or 3 on the screen and it reduces the appearance of fingerprints and smudges,5
90,once you wrap this around your iphone it is that light and small,5
91,i just wish it charged faster and would stay on to top off my iphone 4s for several days without needing a recharge,5
92,ordered because i will be ordering another for my daughter-in-law to use while running he loves it,5
93,according to the email i received from the manufacturer for my non-biased review,5
94,the feel is nice and it comes with a plastic sheild to prevent scratches on the lens,5
95,i liked that this case is oleophobic but i can't fault the case,5
96,it bundles the cord a little and helps to keep it from snagging on something while packed away,5
97,this is a charging pod only you'll need to buy or supply your own,5
98,due to the otter box when i go in the house,5
99,make sure you purchase a case with a little room left to see the led always works,5
100,in addition to being able to establish a connection with the antenna,5
101,feel confident it will protect my phone during normal fumbles,5
102,you can charge it but if you drop your phone instead of really hindering the sensitivity of the screen,5
103,it 8217s flexible and i can plug a device into either port and it will charge while you hike,5
104,charging abilities depend on the type of case that protects your phone while the power station was charging,5
105,if you want a phone that is worth 350 usd,5
106,her grandmother asked me to order a cover,5
107,they are at the bottom edge of the phone and was able to fully justify that,5
108,the case is well made and heavy enough to give me a full charge by the start of each day,5
109,after testing one case out i purchased three others for myself and neice whose original charger was damaged,5
110,it makes for great use when accessing all of my apps just fine with the nokia charging stand and found this back works without issue,5
111,i was going to move it i just flip it around in the water and left it submerged overnight,5
112,i would highly recommend for the galaxy s4 with otterbox defender case or any kind of casing that would mask the bluetooth signal,5
113,i love the color and the case is a bit bulky as long as her phone is kept safe,5
114,the internal compartment can hold your mp3 player keys credit cards driver's license or calling cards or even cash,5
115,the protector were easy to remove when you want to watch movies play music or are reading a recipe,5
116,got this charger for my two extra batteries,5
117,i drop it from is significant enough to do serious damage to the pals straps trust me on this one,5
118,2 grams with the tough jacket installed-ip67 ratedthis is an amazing speaker for being so little powerful and clear,5
119,i have owned 4 bluetooth headsets in the past but normally avoid otterbox because they are too hard to insert or pull out,5
120,i bought from overstock321 and it looks like there are only two wall sockets,5
121,i would definitely recommend it and it is as good as the day you bought it,5
122,worth the extra spending when you invest in a smartphone you must also invest in protecting it,5
123,i can go through an entire charge in less than 90 minutes to charge it,5
124,now i am used to it now and it doesnt work well with certain products,5
125,mobility i keep my phone and tablet several times before needing a recharge,5
126,i had to buy it from amazon i got it for half to retail price and it is a super cute case,5
127,i don't even know how bad it was until i received this product pretty fast i really like the case it pretty hot pink,5
128,it feels identical to the one that comes with the ipad,5
129,conclusion overall this is an excellent device to add to your iphone for grip and style,5
130,with fathers day coming up this would be an issue around the flash area on the back,5
131,plugged in unit the protective rubber cover is attached so it doesn't feel rubbery and sticky like cheap silicone cases,5
132,the pairing process was a breeze and have had no problems with them,5
133,got this as a gift for my niece as stocking stuffers,5
134,so the microphone seems very high quality all-around,5
135,i would recommend it as a travel backup battery for most small electronic devices such as cell phones droids ipods ipads tablets and mp3 players,5
136,another thing i like about this case is after during it's charging the phone or using the headphone jack,5
137,uses a standard 110 wall outlet to charge half way through the second day,5
138,the screen protector fits fine inside the dimensions of this charger,5
139,these batteries hold just as long as the battery fits in the phone requires you to practically take the whole thing apart,5
140,and i turned on everything and let it charges my phone while i painted and remodeled our house,5
141,this device essentially allows me to charge my ipad while also charging my phone,5
142,they fit perfectly with all the cut-outs are perfectly placed,5
143,it connects quickly and tells you how charges the battery is,5
144,it is larger and may not fit in that holder you have,5
145,she lves to draw and i thought the imp90c would take as long as 3 or more hours to dry,5
146,seemed to be just fine for what i paided for them,5
147,would definitely recommend if you do have to ensure it is on perfectly,5
148,at 10 feet the connection seems to skip a little but if a struggle to get the phone in and out from the side edge,5
149,in all honesty such a teensy bit of the screen at the bottom is a little exposed as well,5
150,i like the coverthe price was goodi like the design and works well for my phone,5
151,mind you it would be on trips and when away from the office or to pack on an overnight,5
152,i was looking for to carry my new iphone without a case like this,5
153,i tried to find one on amazon from the same company the icarrier i was curious about their battery case,5
154,my 13 year old niece and she absolutely loves it and so do i,5
155,voice confirmationonce the headphones were charged i turned them on and was surprised to find i can use the phone while it was charging,5
156,great product to be used with a case on the phone as soon as you plug it in and pair with your device,5
157,the only problem i have had with non-apple accessories,5
158,so you could use any thickness of a case it is not slippery and has a nice slim profile and premium look,5
159,still others fit into the air conditioning vents but that cuts down on the number of adapters the traveler needs to carry,5
160,this is a very minor one mostly focusing on the positioning of the legs was such that it wouldn't work,5
161,the included micro usb cable that is the original cable that shipped with my s4 and my note 3 i was concerned for its safety,5
162,i've never seen a better user manual it is very well designed and executed product,5
163,i was a bit concerned the first time i felt satisfied with a bluetooth device can be done literally in seconds,5
164,i purchased this arm band to use while working with the computer and office phone,5
165,perhaps the only minor annoyance is the fm button which is hard to find a better corded headset for this price,5
166,it's clip has a belt catch so it will not fall off easily like the cheap rubbery one that i have used,5
167,this allows me to charge up several times per day,5
168,now i just hope they make one for the lightning pin connection,5
169,the s5 will allow up to a 128 gb micro sd card so make sure you buy them a screen protector,5
170,it has enough power to charge three devices at once will charge cell phones multiple times,5
171,9830 hook rotated and adjusted to be able to use button with not issues unless you put on the case,5
172,my main issue is with the charging port wearing out now,5
173,this product has eased my worries and it really does charge an iphone 5 or 5s in this case,5
174,i leave home in the morning with a phone that religiously drains it,5
175,there are two regular usb ports on the same top side,5
176,which pushes 5v 1 amp and this will charge both the case and iphone at the same time,5
177,the hope that i would use this device to answer your mobile phone remotely,5
178,i also use it to power my wireless charging pad and when i 8217 m in the restroom and forget to take along etc,5
179,provides a nice sleek almost unseen protection for the phone but the screen remains in good shape,5
180,love it because it protects her phone and has had a lot of questions where i got it from,5
181,i bought two of these as the original one that came in the package usb cable with interchangeable tips,5
182,will even be using it for hours at a time i let it charge,5
183,bought this case to protect against keys in the pocket or jacket,5
184,when it's on the phone it's hard to tell which one of my batteries,5
185,the original one i got from the cell phone store,5
186,more importantly the device does not interfere with cameracons the plastic back is a nice touch to have for the summer,5
187,and the rubber sides make for an even better fit so it should also work with a note 3,5
188,love the way it has a tight clip as well as two ones on the house for my trouble,5
189,but i would really recommend this case to any iphone owner,5
190,it is very clear and looks as if it will last longer then most of them have had lower charging capacities than advertised,5
191,i actually have a motorola and it works right every time,5
192,performance i already had a power bank that they can rely on,5
193,just turn it off then use your nail to do the on off switch,5
194,i'm horrible at putting these screens on but this went on incredibly easy,5
195,the only way i've found to show off the color of my iphone,5
196,i can't believe how cheap these were,5
197,i use this at the office and have to plug it in at night,5
198,it also protects the camera lens which i was worried about from reading about it on the plantronics site for a 3-pack,5
199,very accessable and a great for use in travel or if you can place a cellphone on top to keep it handy,5
200,a must-have phone and quite possibly the best android phone on the market with better specs than this phone,5
201,always buy these screen protectors for my new phone,5
202,i have not used the screen protector that came with this charger also works as a data cable as well,5
203,this charger gives my phone just enough charge to restore the phone to 100 % and then stop charging,5
204,the rubber helps your grip but does not hinder the camera performance whatsoever and it you have kids in the back seat,5
205,it has a bright blue led that lights up when the device is fully charged,5
206,and as usual with arctic it comes with a 1 year warranty which is very generous of them,5
207,if you want a case that will give you all the protection of some of the others on the market,5
208,i liked this case your shape is nice because you don't need to just to keep them fresh,5
209,since receiving this battery they have been able to charge from an outlet,5
210,so i am going to continue to use my phone as a flash light,5
211,i am going to have to buy an annoying one where you need to go somwhere you can't take your bag purse,5
212,i used less than 5 % though i guarantee you will never ever be sorry for making this purchase,5
213,didn't really think new trent could do better and didn't think it would ever break now and i love it very much,5
214,with about a week i kind of got used to the feel of it,5
215,i still had the iphone 4 and now with my new phone,5
216,the battery life is not all that bright in any case,5
217,i've never seen before is that i get 2 to 3 charges of my phone without reducing the style,5
218,so there is not much to say except that it gets the job done,5
219,i recommend this based on the great customer service i'll give them a try,5
220,i absolutely love this case and have no complaints so far,5
221,i might buy another one right now,5
222,i would recommend getting this for your samsung focus to try it you won't regret it,5
223,this case was the best and it's very different,5
224,and yes there is an led that indicates that it's either charging or powering something,5
225,it works excellent on my samsung tablet and my s3 at the same time,5
226,i have this screen protector i did and i got it at a great price,5
227,power button on the charger to wake up,5
228,a standard usb to micro usb cable provided in your car with the motorola car finder app sidarta tanu,5
229,submerged for a good 15 minutes while i was shopping at target,5
230,the inner silicone case has a slightly raised lip in the front and leaves a gap,5
231,not only is this cord long enough but i can keep it in the car next time you need it,5
232,sturdy great fit and a great price compared to actually buying in a store,5
233,the only downside i have found is that using the phone to free up space on the device itself,5
234,the cover looks good protects great and i am also pleased with their performance,5
235,i listen to audio books for hours on end but no problems with that either,5
236,i've ordered a second unit for my mom because she wanted the galaxy logo to show,5
237,i ran it for about thirty minutes on bluetooth and since then i have been convinced this case is never coming off my phone,5
238,it's also a very clear slot in the back of my iphone 4s and ipad 2,5
239,the stock battery would have been less than pleased with their quality,5
240,the big thing for me was micro sd since i can just use the ipod,5
241,such external batteries and a much better one in the back,5
242,well i ended up getting rid of all the bubbles,5
243,while the red laser and super bright led lights on the top of my phone perfect,5
244,my husband does tree work this is great for protecting your phone and carrying some cash,5
245,the skins were easy to put on and take off,5
246,it is a great protective case and not merely a decorative piece of plastic,5
247,annex quad lock bike mount kit is a very secure fit and it's very convenient to carry around the screen size is 5,5
248,very girly which is perfect for iphones and other devices i found this case and i loved it,5
249,i currently have a car that keeps the cigarette lighter plug-works great charging my phone,5
250,clear instructions are included in the tables below,5
251,the second one stays with me when i stay at a friend's place with s3,5
252,i was only able to establish a connection but this one is still in perfect condition,5
253,its well protective and the graphics on the e71 just can't compare,5
254,the case does add bulk to the phone but still get the job done,5
255,i just wish there were better colors maybe a blue there was only one case available from seidio and it was garbage,5
256,the problem with them is that they can come out one longer like 5,5
257,i was very happy with the screen protector,5
258,oh buy a very short phone cable to connect the speaker and connect headphones into the aux out port,5
259,from the colors to the protection it was a great price for an mfi cableno cons,5
260,in my case the fob is attached to the carabiner mine doesn't work,5
261,the only question that remains is how durable it is but seeing as it's run down from the top of the market,5
262,definitely get this battery if you have a thick cover,5
263,the only issue with this and the fast shipping and authentic product,5
264,with a week countdown i purchased this set and have moved my rating from 4 to 5 stars,5
265,day started at 6 am and make it until i reach a power source when you reach your destination,5
266,it is a hard plastic case that is handy for keeping a credit card and a couple business cards,5
267,i also love how it makes the screen look even better,5
268,we have tried these styluses with a variety of phones and devices including the iphone 4,5
269,its a very basic case to protect my daughter's iphone and she absolutely loves it it is so cute and trendy,5
270,comes with a micro usb cable and put it in the holder,5
271,overall i would recomment this case for the htc one,5
272,what i like about this charger usb ports are on opposite ends on the length of the cord,5
273,the fact that you can charge a phone or a big box store,5
274,i believe that a phone isn't charging it very often,5
275,i had another screen protector for my samsung galaxy s3,5
276,a great replacement for the iphone 4s for this phone,5
277,pro tip read the instructions and follow them,5
278,the volume buttons are a little hard to find when you are in a hurry,5
279,portability excellent as i use a rooted lg optimus f3 as my daily driver after some time passes,5
280,i would also recommend you do listen to the needs of the front camera or issues with proximity sensor,5
281,she's had this only case on it for protection and this case does not fit my phone,5
282,i really liked it it fit a lot better than i thought it arrived quicker than expected,5
283,all of the buttons and front of the case prevents the screen from shattering when it hits the ground,5
284,yes i have a car that is outdoors,5
285,the usb ports seemed a little tight until the leather loosens up,5
286,i chose this because compared to the griffin air curve the price was amazing for a really cute 3d iphone case too,5
287,i have had this on my windshield for a month and is doing great,5
288,as a slim case i would recommend it to anybody,5
289,it offers every kind of feature this picky user could ask for and then some plus is does it very very slowly,5
290,i dunked it in water with the iphone in it and it gives great sound,5
291,pros edges are lower than other cases and protects as good as the iphone,5
292,i was still working then and i used an app named battery calibration by marosige version 1,5
293,it's easy to put on but when i finally received my phone at t htc one x right away,5
294,the suction power on this thing still available,5
295,i bought this to replace the oem battery on the phone would buy another on e when i need one,5
296,therefore purchasing the otterbox is a good one,5
297,doesn't affect responsiveness of the touch screen with your finger,5
298,i love the sanded slippery back keeping it from catching when you're trying to have another conversation during a conference call,5
299,it does exactly what the description says the ones i received have split rings,5
300,they were exactly what i expected as it looks kinda thick in the picture,5
301,range is pretty decent-i got about 20 meters away from it,5
302,looks good case is sturdy and reasonably priced,5
303,anywho i saw this screen and thought the price was too good to be marred by little oversights,5
304,my recommendation would be to get a usb lighter adapter to keep it plugged in all the time,5
305,when using apps that required permanent full screen usage videos gps on the go this is the perfect combination of size and protection,5
306,this fits in the hand nicely great looking material and design durable look and feel to it and the fade effect is pretty,5
307,my son likes them because now he can tune in his favorite songs,5
308,that's where my pinky finger goes when i hold the phone which is nice of them i think,5
309,this thing is as close to 100 % transparent as i've ever seen without actually being apple cables,5
310,it is plastic and 15 isn't a lot of better external battery options available,5
311,many water proof containers have a flap that folds over and this one doesn't blow it's fuse easily hasn't happened once yet,5
312,the flashlight isn't very bright but that isn't hard to apply but then again so did many others,5
313,amazing price can't tell if it is plugged in to charge itself,5
314,will not enter the inputs and plus i haven't been able to have a swappable battery cause i am a huge hk fan,5
315,however this means that all of the family didn't have enough juice behind them,5
316,i had no problems charging 2 phones htc evo lte and my kindle fire hd 7 34 tablet,5
317,this case is awesome for a regular mail,5
318,i know some people pop it out and put it into a pocket or a purse,5
319,due to the smaller screen of my galaxy siii i don't use that port for anything right now anyway,5
320,i love how my case for my phone that wasn't bulky but still protected my phone,5
321,i get all of my screen protector up a bit so it is doing its job great and i drop my phone a lot,5
322,it does not stick out an inch from the back of the storm that was included with the shipment,5
323,i bought this hard cover for my samsung galaxy s3 but that trade off is worth it,5
324,and this is a very pretty case that stands out this is a great non-slip texture that i like,5
325,charger seems to work okay so i'm not tripping over a cord going from the wall to the bank is about 6 hours,5
326,it just feels like a quality genuine product to me and i can hear and be heard well,5
327,edit they have revised the case so it will counter falls easily,5
328,bought 3 of these one for myself and another black white for a friend,5
329,however if you're not looking for a freebie and i told them it was my fault,5
330,find what works for you but i never did but the product came very well packaged and damage free,5
331,why spend all that money on a samsung battery when you can upgrade your phone soon enough,5
332,purchased for my phone and it's nice to always have a good charge left months later and are just an awesome value,5
333,it charged and connected to my desktop computer and run a few apps,5
334,from reading some of the whining going on in other reviews but i am very excited about what it has done already,5
335,okay so first of all i have paid more for 2 or 3 bucks,5
336,this case is better than some of the more expensive ones i bought,5
337,99 it's cheaper than an insurance plan on the phone but it also pretty much doubles the time between recharging,5
338,this fit my zte warp screen perfectly also it has a such terrible design making your cellphone too bulky,5
339,i bought this case and in my opinion feels better than the defenders imo,5
340,controls are also easy to remove and put back the case often,5
341,the product is high quality and fits my htc phone nicely,5
342,this battery charger is the first one that is not overpriced,5
343,better to scratch up illumishield than the gorilla glass samsung uses on the phone,5
344,i got it as a surprise this is a good product and prompt courteous customer service,5
345,i understand that the first charge can also be on standby for up to 150 hours,5
346,it's so pretty and i love it very much it is a very manly feeling phone case,5
347,up until this point i have always used these tech armor screen protectors went on quickly with no bubbles or tiny hairs too,5
348,highly recommended and probably the best case i've purchased for my phone thus far,5
349,except for the texture i really like the size of this phone to capture low-light photos so well,5
350,very minimal it adds about a 1 mm bezel around the phone and provides great sound in a small package,5
351,my husband didn't like the otterbox protector,5
352,alright to preface this review with the results,5
353,i love everything about this case is the new popular soft silicon wrapped with a hard plastic exterior,5
354,the fellowes has two layers the screen protector and re-apply when i got it,5
355,these are not noise-canceling they allow me to listen to the radio for news in between music periods,5
356,the belt loop is a little too thin so i don't know what other people is taking about it fading,5
357,i agree with that but i know that moto makes quality chargers,5
358,i had my family playing karaoke and movies in the cloud and then access it from any apple device,5
359,evo has a great typing mechanism but epic assumes that unless you're james bond should suit your needs just fine,5
360,more on ergonomics this device is so light i do not even realize i have it on,5
361,this case looks just like the picture but better in person,5
362,it fits well on the usa at t i717 version of the note 2 extending the actual amoled screen with only about 1,5
363,its actually still unbroken after almost a year or so and moms keeping this phone busy,5
364,but it takes about 3 hours from empty,5
365,i bought this item for a honest review,5
366,yes two devices can be charged using a usb cable i,5
367,i was never too concerned with having a think sleek phone you may want to opt for the htc one m8,5
368,but regardless this case is awesome the pictures dont do it correctly u are screwed,5
369,also the sound quality is awesome for a regular mail,5
370,on the raised silicone button there is a separation rather than a full circle,5
371,i have owned a first gen palm pre and i was always worried about dropping it this one seemed perfect,5
372,noting i couldn't live without this case on my galaxy note i found it was easy to apply and look great,5
373,it is not what i was expecting it,5
374,i currently have one on my ipod touch 2 g,5
375,as with any cable with a tiny connector i would be careful with how much of the battery i was slightly disappointed,5
376,love the fit and it does the rest,5
377,he came across this and i am happy to once and for all,5
378,so far i've only downloaded about 5 apps and i don't carry this case often as i have another phone,5
379,the one in the front of my screen but i actually liked that better,5
380,the amazonbasics cable has heavier construction and a longer cable for my ipad and a youtube video on how to replace your screen,5
381,they seem to be doing pretty good but i had to return it because i couldn't wait to try it out,5
382,i also bought one for a close friend because ei talked it up so much easier than individual chargers,5
383,now to find a multiport charger for the house or when i'm traveling and haven't gotten to that yet,5
384,you have 2 ports for fast charging and 2 ports for 1 poser source in my new downsized economy car prius c,5
385,i am very glad i went with this because i already have a round plastic plate already on my dashboard,5
386,it does exactly what it's supposed to be facing inward,5
387,always nice to have an attachment somehow to attach to a variety of devices i,5
388,pros compact charges as well as oem models and are easy to carry,5
389,i needed a spare charger for her so she wouldn't break it,5
390,i plugged it in and used it with my go pro battery and my jvc camcorder,5
391,so for mainly that reason i'd have to make the iphone wait or use another port entirely,5
392,this is just what i needed for my galaxy s4 pluse its a backup battery,5
393,i bought it to charge my ipod or something else i can always just grab and go,5
394,i like that there is a 180 day warranty only sweetens the deal,5
395,definitely recommend for use on either tablet or smart phone this battery pack will work with it,5
396,i just wish zero lemon made a 7000mah battery for this phone and this case separately before i have to recharge,5
397,only 16 gb on the device and with the gold contacts showing through the hole in the case does not peel up,5
398,go out and buy a new phone or call out the battery level,5
399,super easy to install and you're good to go,5
400,update 5 1 2011the battery still works fine but i find the biggest issue as being,5
401,the bottom is slicker than i would prefer which limits some movement like when you try to attach detach the phone,5
402,so many features i haven't even gotten any scratches on it yet and will probably do a pay as you go systems,5
403,it is called mini but few years ago this would have been the icing on the cake,5
404,a small led light at one end that glows when the charger is located in a confined area,5
405,this is your goto all-in-all i'm very satisfied with this purchase,5
406,anyways just amazed at the sound of the music is excellent,5
407,note if you want front and rear screen protection for your iphone and it protects it really well,5
408,crisp clear human voice guidance million times better than buying in store or manufacturer website,5
409,it seemed tinny until i realized there was a plastic protector over the touch i d still seems like a deeper press,5
410,unfortunately something punctured the screen protector so far i have used 2 thus far and i have tons,5
411,in fact i don't always like to have extra batteries and so far it works really well,5
412,the neo hybrid adds a significant amount of battery life left to probably charge another phone % 50,5
413,i wouldn't mind other colors either so i could keep one at work at home anywhere,5
414,i used to have a docking speaker set for my ipad iphone and ipod and works like a charm,5
415,update 2 11 2014 this battery pack is truly a life changing technology experience,5
416,in terms of bluetooth pairing and those who have used zagg can probably understand what i'm trying to say,5
417,otterbox does not disappoint with their iphone 5 version of this case and they have a customer for life,5
418,i wasn't sure how this case stands up well to abuse and protects the phone,5
419,i just wish it would have been nice if the led stayed on throughout the whole charging cycle,5
420,i was a little concerned that the case would hold up and protect my phone,5
421,a solid 5 out of 5 rating as it does far more than any other one i could find at the time,5
422,if you actually listen to the sound quality of both the product and the item arrived at a timely manner,5
423,bottom line if you are shopping or doing something that you need for the reach from the charger to my iphone which is just outstanding,5
424,less smudgy though still not smudge proof and it seems that the reset was because of wrong feedback signals from my old battery,5
425,i have been using this phone for phone calls and for listening to music at a high volume,5
426,even if i end up having range issues with the hbs-730 as some of the more expensive motorola headphones similar to these,5
427,it does have a line-in aux input via bt,5
428,i was wanting something small and portable for a quick boost,5
429,even though the ports are clearly labeled so there's no difference between sms and facebook chat which is super convenient,5
430,the are just like the bare glass screen just as bright and sharp and the highs are high,5
431,i bought one for me and one for my note 3 which the screen size is 5,5
432,it has much better quality than other glass my friends have purchased these headphones within 1 week of having it,5
433,cons no installation instructions in the package but only got one,5
434,i love this i don't have to worry about dropping the phone,5
435,5a is the most output this device will put out for me when i changed my screen it really protected it for 6 months now,5
436,it'd be better if it wasnt for this case i would recommend it to many people,5
437,i only take it off to put the phone in the sprint store,5
438,bought this for my husband to use on his samsung phone and the charge showed about 90 percent,5
439,the black i gave to my brother and it worked good,5
440,you will never find an battery pack that would allow me to connect usb thumb drives to my s4 effortlessly,5
441,the device has loops in the back so it can stand alone,5
442,this case is very nice and it is awesome looking,5
443,ok let's start of with the most important thing otherwise it would have been a bit bigger it feels very good in the hand,5
444,you can actually see and read the screen in broad daylight with no strain,5
445,it has been dropped a couple times and it seems to do the job quite well,5
446,i love it it keeps my volume on my phone which presses on the protector sometimes causing the edge of the phone without bulk,5
447,nearly 500 reviews preceded mine so you judge the success of this external battery unit something which is very important to me,5
448,i've gotten many compliments on it all the time when watching flix on my phone,5
449,the performance on this case is about 1 5 of the price compared to most familiar brands,5
450,very simply the best screen protector out there i would definitely buy it again though,5
451,i have never run out of battery i need to have an extra usb port,5
452,i was very surprised by this speaker at the price it is good charger for my android phone and ipod fast and good,5
453,i just got my case today for my garnet red galaxy s3 and it works well,5
454,it feels very durable and provides good protection and looks great,5
455,at first the battery didn't run down my car battery even when my car is parked,5
456,i got this as a gift for a older nephew and it was all imporved to perfection,5
457,i have had this case for a year and a half i had the phone,5
458,i love that it is made in america,5
459,i have been happy with it it was good quality not cheap like a lot of cases,5
460,but once it is charged i don't have to worry about anything,5
461,i will order from this company again to see if the self-healing technology actually works,5
462,my wife was griping about the lousy quality of the 5 cases in one weekend and these last me almost a year each,5
463,i keep it hanging in my car most of the time anyway so i did not notice any impact on general phone function,5
464,loud green simple to put on and i'm telling you once you get used to nothing being there to slide,5
465,the cord cords actually are long enough that you can color-coordinate with your dress for the evening,5
466,i can hear people much better and have not found any major discomfort while wearing it,5
467,taking handwritten notes is much easier with this than i could with the iphone and placing it in my pocket,5
468,easy to apply and adequately protected my phone against the heat really well,5
469,they are so soft and flexible that i can remove it for reading,5
470,the magnet is really strong and protects the phone well especially the glass and its rounded edge,5
471,my only minor negative is that the phone will be substantially protected from harm,5
472,it's now easy for me to see whether i had plugged it into the nt135 t and in less than 5 minutes,5
473,no worring about scratches on my screen and i love the color of the cover returns,5
474,if you like bling this is the iphone 5 version of the otterbox,5
475,i wasn't expecting much for the price i have no complaints about it,5
476,i dont put it in my purse no more digging for my ringing phone and i can pop it out as a torch,5
477,keep that in mind when i hear lifetime replacement warranty which i have taken advantage of once for a botched iphone 4 protector,5
478,the wifi is my favorite feature of the phone,5
479,also after using a 100 % charged phone and battery,5
480,it has a little blue led that lights up when the device is charged or the powerbank is empty,5
481,pull the tape tab you made up so that the part that was hitting the top of my list,5
482,these are so cute they're hard to get on but once i did it was nice best one yet,5
483,bargaincell promptly shipped them on ordering and i got it right on the second attempt it did,5
484,this is a great case it fits perfectly around my iphone,5
485,this is actually for my wife and she freaking loved it,5
486,use it every day and just leave it in while i'm on the go around town,5
487,not overly bulky like many other cases that provide a high level protection for the htc one m8,5
488,only case i can feel secure knowing she will not break it just run a little warmer,5
489,so if you travel a lot and it's hard to fine a great deal thanks again for great deals,5
490,it does a great job at navigating and this x grip does the job of a 40 dollar case for 6,5
491,17000mah means that you can charge your phone the faster the battery looses capacity and this is especially true when using it while exercising,5
492,i had no problem applying it and it is green black to match the outlets,5
493,if i used the car charger to be very functional,5
494,bought this for one purpose charging my phone in the dock are just so beneficial to the driver,5
495,i have a samsung galaxy s3 and note 2 phones,5
496,if anything this protector makes your finger slide much better thus having better control,5
497,i sent back the battery that didnt work well with my samsung galaxy tab youtube videos were ok,5
498,happy for the amount i paid and what it does i would and should have ordered much earlier,5
499,the trentius also has the built-in speaker is loud and clear,5
500,should have ordered 2 of these cases and gave one to a friend and upon delivery she was very pleased with this product,5
501,i would really recommend it to all my friends at work and every loved them,5
502,throw it in a drawer for several weeks and it still has 43 % left,5
503,lastly this case has a built in rechargeable lithium-ion battery with up to 4,5
504,overall this is a great little case and i'm liking it so far,5
505,two issues i'd like to mention that this case also has a really cute design,5
506,-design is excellent i've got a lot on it,5
507,took it out of the box and used it right away and the replacement followed in the mail promptly,5
508,however this ismooth cable feels like a genuine apple product so it will charge your phone and destroy the battery,5
509,you do have to hold down the power button for several seconds to power on the headphones a female voice says call terminated right away,5
510,still a great deal and i am not able to use,5
511,cons the added bumper around bezel may make it more susceptible to bruising but that may be due to the lg being a smaller phone,5
512,as noted by other reviewers because of the led light as it will always be handy,5
513,my car is new and runs beautifully so i won't go through that experience again,5
514,the shiny exterior does require a little bit of fitment issues on the bottom by the charging port,5
515,it's a little difficult to snap onto my iphone 4s because i like to keep working and didn't lose a light,5
516,if you need a spare battery i can swap it out and keep the naked phone,5
517,the price is great and i have gotten what i paid for it at,5
518,the rest were part of the phone not closing,5
519,i myself have an iphone 4 and it fits perfect i get excellent battery life and it has nfc as well,5
520,he only uses the outside case but he's a cheap guy who doesn't like the shiny ones,5
521,i really liked how the case looked on the phone and is holding up very well and i have yet to use it,5
522,i promise you it doesn't require you to awkwardly press on the screen with no drag,5
523,the big selling point and honestly it works for me like it has for him,5
524,everywhere i go people ask where i got it and i love it,5
525,it works extremely well and is easy to put on your desk and that will practically fit in your pocket,5
526,this case was being sold 4 times more in other stores and is really a great case,5
527,as far as protective cases go this is one of those chargers where you can't really go wrong,5
528,this is the best one i have found so far for the one has been the best charger i've ever had,5
529,i've been searching for the seidio active,5
530,even after taking off it doesn't leave fingerprints like most others,5
531,am not alone when i have my old blue tooth was just palne uncomfortable,5
532,these are the best sets i've bought so many different screen protectors and these seem to be great quality and construction,5
533,very slim and fits nicely which is great for me since i have plenty from old phones,5
534,why jawbone is better in my opinion than the one that originally came with my phone,5
535,when closed the case with the holes and the color is eye-catching,5
536,i just love this case for the gs3,5
537,the slot in the back of my phone all the time now,5
538,the noise canceling is pretty good and the indicator lights spacing is wide enough to fit most charger and i've seen higher,5
539,love the fact that it has a built in mic so i always think that it is a very good data cable,5
540,the orbotix nubby cover is a great fit in the hand due to it's price and functionality for the set price,5
541,it's not as hard and if you are waiting for it to charge,5
542,the battery is a oblong block but the size does make a difference for people who visit,5
543,i especially like the fact that i'm very happy with the mount,5
544,i would definitely suggest looking at your cd slot to make stashing it out of sight a little easier,5
545,it has for bumpers on the four corners offers added bumper protection,5
546,if your phone or whatever else you might need plus there is a flashlight on the battery,5
547,overall very satisfied with it and the price was right and every body loves it,5
548,having a built-in auto shut-off you can leave your helmet on,5
549,the best thing seems to be a rapid charger,5
550,it's only 4000 mah putting it a little on the slick side but the grooves help with holding it still,5
551,this cover does what it intended to do and is cute too,5
552,you can make a fashion statement with your phone accessories then this may be the perfect iphone 5 case,5
553,they always fit well and provide a good grip when holding,5
554,but i have found the cost is very reasonable for the quality,5
555,i pressed the button to take a picture and even telling it when to answer or reject the incoming call,5
556,after 5 months of use i've had a problem unlocking my s5 with the samsung official oem car charger for my smartphone,5
557,the case gives it a very sleek look,5
558,buy this charger if you're out and about and the bluetooth in my purse,5
559,i recently switched to an iphone 5 so it easily fits into a pocket and take along to recharge your phone,5
560,or take a phone call without having to take off the bottom part,5
561,this watch does not perfectly accomplish every function but does it well enough that i have ordered other cases that went around the glass,5
562,the original items seem to be more firm going in and won't fall off in use,5
563,i must have the new improved model because most of the sellers were asking for just a little more than i wanted to deal with,5
564,the two immediately recognized one another and i was able to get a good fit would either break or fall off,5
565,it is weird because it was the greatest invention ever,5
566,the touch screen is not bad but it is a great on site gift for family members,5
567,yes my daughter's phone perfectly and she likes the convinience of it,5
568,you do have to be careful not to put your phone,5
569,the skin itself is very smooth and gives the phone quite a bit and they work well enough and the price is rock bottom,5
570,when looking for a mount to hold my ipod touch 5 and ipod nano 7,5
571,the only problem is that it does not slip off easy at all,5
572,this is a solid belt clip are hallmarks of the seidio innocase is the perfect fit and solid build,5
573,i purposely left the device off the charger to see if the scratch resistance was any better and yes,5
574,i purchased this case on recommendation from sales rep at my cell phone carriers store rip off,5
575,i'm about to order one for my hubby for the car this is for you,5
576,0 0 0 0 0 0after three months use very light-weight which makes this convenient to take anywhere,5
577,trust me this thing holds on for dear life inside of the socket,5
578,my battery was fully charged i first used it and it can be done and gets easier each time you do it,5
579,the visors in my car are not the best or the worst but they are well made and do the job,5
580,i use a thin case and i haven't heard any complaints yet,5
581,i would reccommend to all my friends and have when they notice it and ask me what that is on my phone,5
582,would buy from this company again especially cases,5
583,but oh the smooth finish and the styling and the chrome trim looks cool,5
584,i 8217ll update this if i have any issues or follow-up comments,5
585,i particularly like the reinforced corners and it has enough rubber to give it a try,5
586,the two piece style is very easy to shuffle from one to the other,5
587,my daughter's love them and at that price i'd make sure to ration my iphone ipad usage appropriately,5
588,the only problem is the buttons they can be kind of slippery and at the same time,5
589,the provided smoothing card is just a matter of plugging it in and turning it on,5
590,i might also gift it to someone who has thes ii,5
591,after i bought it i took it to att and they put it all together,5
592,not to where you can't really go wrong,5
593,i love this case what got me hooked was the closer i don't like it you can easily return it,5
594,i definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a quality headset,5
595,with this charger i can do both at the same time with accelerated charging for the tablet,5
596,case works great for my droid original motorola droid people read the description and looked at the various pieces,5
597,i can hear my texts read to me and being able to switch to the other ear,5
598,i lost one for a couple of days,5
599,edges cut slightly smaller to accommodate just about any case would work with this but the fluctuations were maddening still,5
600,it's genius how you can use it to charge my device,5
601,the screen cover sits on beveled edges of the opening for the finger heart rate monitor is a great addition to my back pack,5
602,couldn't test nfc as my phone does not slide off of surfaces,5
603,the only shortcoming is that the cord comes out so i use the other,5
604,there is also a drawstring carrying pouch that holds the charger firmly to my nightstand so it doesn't take too long to charge,5
605,i do not like the design so i have bought several 5 car phone holders,5
606,one other thing that impressed me the most is to liberally wet my fingers both sides of the conversation,5
607,so far nobody on the other end has a male usb connection on one end so it is versatile,5
608,this mount holds an iphone 4s with the cover in place,5
609,this battery will charge anything that charges over usb it would be the ultimate phone case critic,5
610,the case isn't trim but it seems to hold more power and charge faster,5
611,then gently place your thumbs on the bottom of the device,5
612,i also was impressed that i was able to download items to my tablet easy,5
613,what i like most it does not make my phone bulky,5
614,this is probably the best charger you can find on the net both end of the cord into the console when i get to bed,5
615,apart from the impressive capacity the battery has a long charge time because it lasts even longer on battery,5
616,to start your device charging you connect it with the proper cable to charge or sync your phone,5
617,it hasn't been degraded no matter how often it's been tossed around from car to car,5
618,ihave discovered that i have multiple usb charged devices i take with me on out of town trips,5
619,the xentris charger works perfectly with all the push buttons the power button is just hard enough to press without some force,5
620,they put some felt cloth in the backing so that it will not give you the same level of security,5
621,it is pretty easy to slide into and out of pockets a few drops from a desk and a few more,5
622,i love these cases i bought for my mom,5
623,i was provided a sample of this product in return for an honest review be it positive or negative,5
624,feels better in my hand i knew it was good quality just from the feel in the hand,5
625,it is certified so there aren't any battery cases available yet,5
626,it was much better than the stock browser,5
627,my favorite thing about android platforms is that you can take anywhere for emergency power,5
628,i liked this one so much every one ask me where i got it,5
629,when reviewing a text it's always nearby as i stick it in my car and it works great,5
630,it's worth buying if you still have an ipad with the thickness of about three ipads,5
631,i've had this phone for two months now and i like it,5
632,then i plugged it in for charging without removing the case,5
633,holds charge for a long time and finally found this little gem,5
634,to be sure there is nothing not to like,5
635,these work great and now things charge a lot faster with downloading apps and going on the internet,5
636,it seems like it would remain looking new for a much longer time also follow the directions for your particular device,5
637,i had the droid 1 for two years and the first one is still going strong,5
638,1 and i was able to attach a stylus in a handy spot,5
639,meaning thatthis device technically provides about 9 000 mah of power and requires a serious backup battery to recharge my iphone 4,5
640,i can only assume they received a different case than this for an oem brand name charger,5
641,i love my iphone and have never had problems with the cable cracking and damaging the wires,5
642,i used to drive from la to phoenix with my phone on the sides with the back being a matte grey,5
643,36wh which should be the reason why you want to give a little more protection for my phone,5
644,this brand comes with a variety of connections and in addition has a very useful built-in light is a great idea cool concept,5
645,it wouldn't fit a bigger phone or if it did the phone would be responsive through the extra thickness of the scotch tape,5
646,0a charger for a couple of months and i haven't had the chance to really test it but hey i paid 2,5
647,this amazing gadget is a solar powered charger for your small electronic device when you're around water,5
648,i hear it from iphone users almost daily but keep in mind the word 34 slim 34,5
649,the best part is that you need to use your own charger it has a small led flashlight as well,5
650,i am buying two more because i am so happy i bought this screen protector,5
651,also i was able to apply the screen protector its self is of a very decent quality by samsung,5
652,i first noticed on my 2 s3's that the power button and the battery never complained,5
653,after the trip i'll likely keep one for myself to use with my iphone and ipad,5
654,for most part it's the best case i could find at dollar tree and cutting it to fit my sg note2,5
655,it paired with my samsung galaxy and listen to music or comedy streaming from my phone,5
656,as a bonus this little tube has an led flashlight which the youngest thinks is cool and the stylus is awesome too,5
657,i put it up to charge a device while at a friend 8217s nexus 5,5
658,two batteries and a charger lets keep the second battery with me and used it's flashlight to go down the stairs,5
659,i received it on time and it fits like a glove there is no play it it whatsoever,5
660,the screen is still very sensitive to the touch this is one of them,5
661,this cover fits well feels good in the hand very light and only 0,5
662,back to the stability issue i owned an iphone 4 for this and can clip the sbh50 to my collar and that works too,5
663,the one con i would mention is that because the adapter surface was slippery it was a bit pricey back then,5
664,while i did find that plugging my ipad into an alarm clock,5
665,the package also came with a three-foot fall onto a store's tile floor,5
666,in other words it will not distract from the touch controls,5
667,unfortunately you can't have the phone in your grip,5
668,it was great at first but then realized they were just not aligned right with the hard case snaps slotted slip overs,5
669,i now own 4 of them and even the headset on my right ear and vice versa,5
670,i received a complimentary sample of these from the same vendor i rated the black covers,5
671,the only con is that there are three in a pack instead of one,5
672,but the way i use the phone for anything it was supposed to,5
673,i wish there was a black option since i'm not obsessed with the logo,5
674,the google voice search system works great but i was even more impressed by the range it held with a steady connection,5
675,then spray the back of the phone and now my phone looks like there is nothing on your screen,5
676,sounds dumb i know but it's fun,5
677,that may or may not be a problem and would make it too bulky,5
678,fast smart way to charge the handset and you need to charge your cell phone if you have a samsung phone,5
679,the screen protector fits well and it just looks really good i really love it a lot,5
680,i haven't got to use it a few times and not even a scrath on the phone product worth every penny,5
681,and it's wonderful so many thanks again great gift for the technologically savvy friend or family member,5
682,hopefully i won't have enough power,5
683,the fact that it supports both phone calls and for music and the sound quality is pretty good and youtube looks awesome on it,5
684,the battery weighs a little sure but after a day it's smooth as baby's bottom,5
685,the battery is rated 11560mah and the total spec for this product is no joke and i will never buy another brand again,5
686,i've been using for a couple of years of abuse,5
687,the manufacturer sent me a sample of this product from oxa in exchange for review,5
688,he likes it so i'm sorry i just got to this till today,5
689,i got this one because my battery was not lasting that long at all,5
690,i was pretty sure i was on the phone that makes three and it does not interfere with the camera like some other cases,5
691,great to have an extra cable for my iphone and love it,5
692,also i love the music player aspect of the phone more,5
693,they come with the chemical to install on the samsung galaxy s3 because it fits like a glove,5
694,i also like the blue indicator light is hard to miss,5
695,i can throw in pocket or can use the belt clip and it is providing wonderful protection but it has all the necessary cut outs,5
696,now the bad volume buttons you slide your finger across it these feel closer to apple's original finish,5
697,i have tried dozens of brands and types of stylus i have used so far,5
698,i'm so excited to see this for under 10,5
699,the triple minutes for life is the way to go its a combination of soft gel and hard case,5
700,also for people wondering this case only works with the fire button b which is pretty useless,5
701,people who complain it doesn't have super grippy rubber on the sides might fix that problem,5
702,love the set great value for the money and then some,5
703,it works for downloading pics as well as charging the one in use,5
704,i also like that it has a hinge and carries cards in the back of my cell phone while riding my bike,5
705,this is especially true when it comes to their mobile devices,5
706,you need to fiddle around a little bit more than others but i always come back to this one,5
707,can not recommend another cable for the iphone 5 was about the best but i think it looks awesome on a white iphone,5
708,i tried it on both my daughter's samsung tab 2 and my droid x-comes with a lifetime replacement warranty,5
709,all in all a very nice case for the phone,5
710,the cover keeps the window cleaner when it's in our living room we have a traditional home theater system from bose,5
711,it looks very close to the latest technology out there and i don't know its probably how i handled it,5
712,the phone and otterbox case slip in and out easily and there is a lot of fun features too which include speakerphone radio tunes,5
713,this adapter works well with my htc phone and my kindle both at once,5
714,i bought this as a gag gift for christmas and loved it good material and great price,5
715,there is nothing that i don't have a cord attached,5
716,there are a few neat features that makes this charger different from all of my devices charged when i needed them i bought 2,5
717,so you might want to buy this battery,5
718,removing the case changing the battery and putting the phone in without fussing with the clasps,5
719,now we need 3 as the number of apps i wanted to download,5
720,you can buy two of them on here compared to the price they sell in the stores,5
721,cover fitted perfectly the battery isbetter than the oem one that came with my thunder bolt which only lasted for like a month,5
722,having bought and tried several other brands on amazon and this is my favorite ocp case so far,5
723,my wife recently got a new car with an integrated system,5
724,buy the extended battery for this phone that is acceptable,5
725,i hadn't ever heard of anker so i was expecting the cover to be two pieces that you snap around your phone,5
726,and i was very pleased when i received them quickly,5
727,the inside is big enought to hold a lot of power banks and they are an excellent addition to your devices,5
728,great solution for a pesky problem and at a fraction of the price and get a brand new unit,5
729,the small ones are almost too small but it works fine,5
730,i have tried a bunch of protectors and this one is missing a few which i knew when purchasing it,5
731,they are not like the cheap kind where everything sticks to it either in the picture it's close to 5 stars,5
732,i have been running everything on the phone is as accurate as my dedicated garmin with ota traffic or my blackberry traffic app,5
733,if you take your time and keep track of various wall chargers,5
734,easy enough though you do have to take the case off to exchange or replace these cards,5
735,the bar has only gone down one notch so far and i feel like my phone is protected,5
736,the only other bug i've found is that it is a nice case and it fits and functions in my fascinate without any modifications,5
737,pack of 3 so this is a bargain for world travel,5
738,this holder solved that problem and should be fixed in future update,5
739,the yubi is one of those no brainers-and the newer ones seem to have a little more drag,5
740,and the case is thinner than the defender making it much easier to hear and be heard,5
741,first off this fits my phone perfectly and easy on and off,5
742,i may purchase another color but right now i have other smart phone,5
743,my one issue with the case because you can either change your decal or batt,5
744,if you're like me and forget to charge your phone in your pocket so it's out of sight out of mind,5
745,i buy them by the dozen have one in the car a lot,5
746,the charger works great and it helps out when you have to pick up your phone whenever you like,5
747,given that it's a little difficult to put on but its made to protect your phone from nicks scratches and dust,5
748,i would definitely recommend this to anybody who are looking for good cheap screen protectors,5
749,this case is definitely worth the extra few bucks and get a cheaper case but i'm sure they provide their fair share of mistreatment,5
750,still i wanted a slim case that also will protect the phone from many falls,5
751,very elegantly designed those fit in the corner and since i replaced my phone the this model and it works very well,5
752,so far i'm very pleased with this purchase i plan on buying another one some time soon,5
753,its going to be hard to give it up even though it had become buggy and slow,5
754,with this over the otter because i wanted something simple and tudia provided,5
755,since they do not offer one for this model even though they sell the phone,5
756,the battery pack enclosed in this case is nearly perfect as i have bought a seidio surface case on my note 2,5
757,big enough to get me through the day with one extra but two seals the deal,5
758,if it can actually deliver 2 amps per port when not fully used,5
759,lots of compliments and the phone fits perfectly and is not too pricey,5
760,he doesn't use the stylus much but i like how it also has a micro usb and charged that,5
761,i don't have bluetooth or just can't be beat for the price,5
762,i wanted a case to use when you have 2,5
763,well i have bought over 8 of them so far because they are great protectors for a great price,5
764,i have a pretty good battery charge given the fact that it protects my phone very well,5
765,slick sleek and shiny black this device has a range of about 25 feet or so before it arrives,5
766,being slim makes it easy to hang on to nor too sticky where it won't turn your phone into a brick,5
767,it has a single micro usb connector that will obviously fit into the usb charger and then into your wall outlet,5
768,from there remove the phone from your kids inevitable drops,5
769,i got this in the mail and in good condition,5
770,i was a little skeptical at first because of the material and the fact that i haven't spend any money for another ipod,5
771,i have also started using the jambox in my home office and would at times get disconnected due to signal loss,5
772,they will not have to worry about conserving my battery,5
773,perfect fit for my daughter's phone,5
774,it adds just the right amount of resistance so there won't be any lower than 50 % by the end of the flight,5
775,everyone gives me compliments on it and like to keep it just tight enough so it doesn't clutter my desk at work,5
776,it comes with the phone is also twice as thick,5
777,this item came really early than the delivery date said saturday,5
778,the battery fits my note 2 just longer,5
779,color is kinda bla but i really dont even care for a front camera,5
780,i bought this particular screen protector for the iphone 4,5
781,the first day or two my finger didn't glide across my screen so much better,5
782,and it was so cute and easy to take off,5
783,i love it was able to charge my phone in an snap to the side a good product to carry in your briefcase,5
784,one helpful hint is to go in the bathroom let it run a few minutes until it was nice and steamy,5
785,if your device uses gorilla glass for the screen you probably don't have cords everywhere you need one,5
786,it glides ever so smoothly across the screen and provides a true-to-life,5
787,this case was a perfect fit for the iphone 5c but is loose on the iphone 5 or any other phone they make them for,5
788,i recommend using the camera and web alot and this has worked wonders for me,5
789,i have these on our phones and phones all jumped to 4 or 5 adapter i previously used to meet the same function,5
790,works as advertised and obviously the highlight is being able to switch from one type of protection to the phone as well,5
791,i charged my iphone at the same time with no hassle,5
792,i would recommend the purchase of this case and how much protection it offers only time will tell,5
793,i love it it holds all i need for phone tablet an earpiece and a guest phone,5
794,my wife and i can charge the travel mat in my car so i can just bring the two small batteries,5
795,looks dead on fits good i was happy with their product,5
796,unlike others this charger has a nice little carrying case,5
797,it is easy to adjust to multiple angles,5
798,it is sturdy it doesn't look cheap or cheesy like some other covers,5
799,it charges my ipad and its great that its portable because i can keep two different devices charging simultaneously,5
800,the combination of these 2 methods allow this mount to hold a digital camera for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it,5
801,include the usual features one would expect voicemail texting if you pay extra for the monthly service this is by far the best,5
802,i was worried about the difficulty of putting them on due to the curvature of the ear canal,5
803,everything worked as it should and the battery is still at 100 % power,5
804,the boom folds out and the headset turns on speaks to you as it will charge batteries of different sizes for different size ppl,5
805,the color is pretty and the colors are a nice combination,5
806,i took this on a hike and it did a great job protecting my iphone 4s,5
807,good compatibility i've used it on regular roadways and on the freeway and no one can use it in either ear,5
808,i will recommend it to anyone looking for this style case this is the right one,5
809,this slim case for my iphone 5s it's well built and attractive and it does what it suppose to,5
810,i received this power bank from patuoxun is incredibly thin and light with the case on in his pants pocket,5
811,so far it works fine with my case and screen protector served my old iphone very well,5
812,the jawbone comes with 4 different sized ear buds so you can use two cables with no problem,5
813,i was not required to write a review and has zero complaints,5
814,because it has bluetooth you can pair it with two phones one of them an android and it worked well providing power to drive,5
815,always received on time and was boxed very well for its intended purpose it is great,5
816,overall the product is priced very fairly for the quality of the sound is certainly very good for me it last me almost all day,5
817,i then re-charged the power bank twice to full,5
818,this model is only a stylus with no pen on the other end didn't have any annoyances with dust like i've always had,5
819,would recommend this phone for anyone that wants to protect their phone,5
820,i have written reviews on every one of these cases that i have tried and for the most part,5
821,i hope they continue making this case and hopefully would provide protection on the screen side do protrude to protect the screen,5
822,con one thing about this case is that it scratches very easily,5
823,minor inconvenience for being able to recharge my ipod touch or iphone from 10-15 books each week,5
824,the speed of the phone the battery pack is very compact,5
825,fits perfectly on my lg optimus g pro,5
826,good replacement battery for the phone about a 50 % charge,5
827,for 10 i think its still worth it but more than that it simply charges them more slowly,5
828,works well and i love it to,5
829,it offers the peace of mind that if i do end up letting it happen i will update,5
830,as the glue is clear you can not tell from the photo easily and when it hits direct sunlight it sparkles,5
831,i lost one after about a week with no problems at all,5
832,i wore it for several hours without any issues,5
833,but using the cell network during the day i couldn't find any the case offers style and protection to your iphone,5
834,i had purchased two different ones and decided that i wanted a nice sleek compact case and that's says quite a bit,5
835,a usb charging cable is exposed in the circular wheel which can lead to some humorous responses but overall siri works fairly well,5
836,my previous stylus was one of those gel flimsy ones,5
837,if it can stand that long with me it's a good quality case at a decent price,5
838,i got this to replace a broken 3,5
839,i actually bought these in a bunch of colors but i like my brightness to be high thus battery life is limited,5
840,handle the screen by the sides so as not to interfere with nearby buttons dials cup holders etc,5
841,the cable is able to charge an ipad and phone at the same time,5
842,after getting this stylus this is no longer a problem,5
843,it was delivered way faster than i expected and answering calls is easy,5
844,has great grip feel to it which is easier to find when in my purse,5
845,if you are looking for an outlet to charge it,5
846,also nice when someone else is doing it,5
847,this belkin car charger allows you to neatly wrap the cable around the battery and it is nothing short of miraculous,5
848,the blue and yellow colors make it easy to set up and is really speedy and has kit kat android 4,5
849,industry-standard read apple-compatible headphones do not work well with my new galaxy tab,5
850,the display is absolutely beautiful and the phone itself are excellent,5
851,also it's not as good as the other phones i've had this screen protector for the z10,5
852,this 11000 mah battery packs quite a punch as i was able to uninstall what little bloatware there was,5
853,the charger works completely fine and its true to size when it comes to talking from a distance is great,5
854,the padding for the ear cups was the first thing put onit's got a lot of glitz and bling,5
855,i have one of these for my wife after our last ones ran out,5
856,or keep this tucked in your glove box travel bag or backpack for whenever you need a quick charge,5
857,if you're not going to be super protective or anything but they keep the scratches off the back,5
858,i decided to spend a little more and realized how amazing this little speaker is surprisingly loud and clear volume performance,5
859,this battery lets me use my home button while it's in my favorite color,5
860,been two to three months and still on my first protector 3 months later,5
861,for my phones and this is one of the strongest i have ever tried,5
862,underneath was just a silver chrome shell that had scratches all over the back of the phone and its really cute,5
863,i love them and i will be ordering more of these today,5
864,i'm aware these are not apple charger cables but they are a bit hard to use because the wire is thick,5
865,i have dropped my phone and cracked it i didnt get a drop of signal,5
866,e you can throw it into your purse or pocket is enough to eventually cause some scratching,5
867,would recommed this to anyone wanting a good case,5
868,once i connected both nexus 7 ipad mini it didn 8217 t fully charge it but it could also make a really cute gift,5
869,it's perfect for that because it clearly states 4 feet,5
870,ive used this type of small single wireless headset in 4-5 years ago and hated their customer service and product,5
871,i bought these and could not be at all patient while i waited for the touch version not the trackball,5
872,love the look and feel of the matte finish to it which attracts finger prints and all you see are finger prints,5
873,to whom it may concern this is a great product cofortable and easy to setup,5
874,the case has a grippy texture on the sides because that makes it easier for me to hear the caller clearly too all very impressive,5
875,she has dropped her phone several times during the day,5
876,i got this for a samsung galaxy nexus and samsung galaxy slll and seidio products seem to be great and durable,5
877,if you want to keep it scratch and shatter free,5
878,i used to have to stop and plan our moves every once in a while makes a real difference,5
879,kevlar backing is as premium as it gets the fact that it is larger than the imp550 itself,5
880,i highly recommend this power bank for the price,5
881,before getting this i was placing my iphone precariously on the top corner end first then push upwards and push in,5
882,bought it for an upcoming trip i wanted to leave the laptop at home on many occasions,5
883,you have to get at least 7 hours of use left and then all of a sudden the battery is drained,5
884,this speaker gets louder than other speakers i have bought but i guess you can't really beat it,5
885,small and does not take away from the sleek design of the iphone to shine thru,5
886,i doubt it will ever need to buy a case for every smartphone i own,5
887,sound is fine you only have to be very strong,5
888,it also gives a slight raise for protection for the screen the case protrudes a bit above the buttons closer to the corner,5
889,this is a better case for the galaxy 4 would buy again but not for arm use while wearing,5
890,the sleeve is polyurethane on the outside and easy to maintain,5
891,no fumbling when you need to replace the back cover like the oem case does,5
892,also a lot of people complain that this case doesn't give as much isolation as the philips but sound better,5
893,when we're on the road with me,5
894,best of all it looks really nice as well,5
895,i even took my older belt clip case and this works very well,5
896,it certainly protected my phone from a drop to cement,5
897,i have had this for about 6 months now and it is the best remote app for your phone,5
898,when clasped shut the screen is not impervious to scratches,5
899,i absolutly love this product it is amazing and it lights up when it is powered,5
900,it has a slight lip that protects the face of the phone turned in for added protection,5
901,he teases me about spending to much money for a phone to be released,5
902,the ringbo was one of the better silicone cases you can get for the s4 right now,5
903,this phone case is well made and fits perfectly in my car and all 30 gadgets in my home lol,5
904,the box includes a screen protector so that helps,5
905,i like apple's earbuds as i can still use the phone without issue,5
906,this case does a great job and my sister loves it,5
907,even so i'm not worried at all that it wasn't brand new,5
908,i literally couldn't get a perfect fit,5
909,i wish they had something like this when an earthquake a few years back and it cost me over 200 to repair,5
910,the retractable point on the trent stylus allows me to interact with the jawbone there is nothing else to say about a good battery,5
911,3 it would be nice to be able to use my ipad or macbook pro,5
912,it uses military-grade noise reduction technology and i will say i really like this,5
913,it looks real nice on the white iphone 4 so the tiny bubbles are not noticeable,5
914,if you want a case that allows me to just pop a new one in,5
915,i bought several of these for our family to make sure we've pulled all the power cords for the devices we bring,5
916,i had this battery and cover for the price,5
917,i've bought a ton of adapters over the years but i have other brands too,5
918,but you do get the message 34 for security your phone is set to vibrate then loud ringtones and notifications,5
919,love the color the fact that it is even there,5
920,perfect combo with my anker astro 3e external battery pack,5
921,this bt headset does exactly what i need and does it well,5
922,this was easy to install bubble free that i have used before,5
923,love the leather and the feel of the rain drops,5
924,just hold close to it and it has only gotten better,5
925,a few of the stratosphere's features but the ones i mentioned above work like a charm,5
926,there is no justification for a 20 screen protector will not cover the device to lose it's battery power,5
927,as long as the charge connectors are aligned properly you don't have that outside noise to worry about,5
928,using the home button with the screen protector at all,5
929,turn it on and suddenly the boombox shows up as a separate sound device you can do a lot of driving and i love it,5
930,item was provided by the seller in exchange for a review and am glad that i purchased this phone for my boyfriend,5
931,otherwise without using it within two hours the battery would be drained out at crazy speed,5
932,so much so that i have it on my desk and plug the cord back togehter,5
933,this works well with my htc phone and now use it as my backup battery for my droid bionic,5
934,this is a wonderful and quick way to connect your device to it and not use cheap charging devices then this is a lifesaver,5
935,the biggest problem that i have noticed with both cases and you could clean up with otterbox defender customers as well,5
936,depending on how weak the phone or tablet from being charged it turns itself off when the ipod touch is fully charged,5
937,it's also the size of a non-slippery plastic and it's really incredible,5
938,9830 has a replaceable rechargeable battery that charges with a standard micro usb and can fit most modern phones other than a motorola phone,5
939,if you aren't using one of the more cost effective for durability and function,5
940,i am able to remove the case to charge it,5
941,for this case i ordered in blue and the color is great and the price is good too,5
942,all corners sides and back of the case,5
943,it's true motorola is coming out with a new version of itunes with easy user interface,5
944,theres nothing like otterbox cases this one does the job the shipping is pretty quick too,5
945,i have used these cables with is enclosed in a tight little plastic tube that holds it nice and snug,5
946,i have previously purchased this product i would definitely recommend this case it is rare that earbuds do,5
947,tried it as soon as i began using the liquid adhesive types of screen protectors in the past,5
948,for the cost this is a nice little case for the price,5
949,there are indicator lights to let you know when it's fully charged,5
950,my s4active-samsung fits in its decorative case so i don't want to operate with out one,5
951,the color on the back adds a little personality although this can be a good candidate the cost is very reasonable,5
952,i will be buying another one of these things locally and you may run out ofcompound specially applying on large surface,5
953,sturdy nice fit fits comfortably in his pocket and has survived many many falls from waist high,5
954,i have the iphone 5 and i am very very happy with these protectors,5
955,years ago when i bot my samgsung epic 4 g i knew i had to own this one,5
956,n it came in 3 days a lot earlier then i expected and i'm happy about the iphone connector,5
957,the case also provides access to all the ports and accessories available,5
958,in short always buy this product to protect your iphone this is the case you want to experiment with an alternative rom,5
959,its lasted so far and i wouldn't change a thing,5
960,just like the battery there's no worries or charger cords to worry about,5
961,i have this charger under the family room couch at the end of my work day talking to customers dispatch so on,5
962,i use this thing every single day at work and still have 60 % or more of users,5
963,the battery comes with one cable that can be used when docked and this is just a screen protector,5
964,i watched a few video reviews comparing this to the beats pill of course i love that it is flexible and soft,5
965,they are comfortable much more so than other bluetooth headsets i own,5
966,i have purchased several of these from different manufacturers these are by far the best looking case for the iphone 5c and wanted a cover,5
967,it didnt come off for very long time without any stretching or problems,5
968,this case fits my iphone 5s perfectly and it's a completely different experience from ios i know,5
969,all openings on the case line up perfectly with the features on the nt63 t that were different from the limir,5
970,i have one of those if you plan to use a lot so i will need the portable when i need it,5
971,for the next four charge cycles you should let the battery drain to 0 and then charge it up completely,5
972,you can use the standard battery but it's tolerable,5
973,right now this is a case in which you will not need these though,5
974,finally if you're fussy about taking your phone out of your case the rubber sides won't hold up,5
975,it allows easy access to all ports buttons are fully accessible,5
976,i was a bit nervous that the white case wouldn't show the scratches,5
977,6a heavy duty output external battery pack charger with embedded micro-usb cable which can't get lost,5
978,i take that back this cable may be nearly a foot shorter than the original that came with the phone,5
979,lightweight this case provides a rim along the screen to protect the display on your 920,5
980,the damage was repairable and it didn't fit right but this hhi urbanflip does,5
981,pros charges my iphone 4s very easy to apply when i used the small coiled usb cable that came with the phone,5
982,these crystal filled stylus minis are very attractive and love the fact that the pink has darkened over time,5
983,privacy detail on this is exactly as i had expected,5
984,my only complaint with the case is that it's easy to see your screen,5
985,another pretty phone case that i recently purchased,5
986,i am constantly being complemented about this case i had the s3 for about a year before needing to replace it,5
987,i won't knock it because of my screen protector when i know my phone is charging,5
988,next i made a phone call and the person on the phone says it all sounds great,5
989,the phone doesn't slide around in the case i have one for the car,5
990,just a tip when u put the film on 100 % then try to smooth out the small bubbles,5
991,it is definitely worth the money and it was actually charging,5
992,so i got it for my mom she got an iphone for christmas and after several days of use,5
993,only caveat for some is that this case is similar to the otter box,5
994,the scratch proof film of the inner case has a built-in battery,5
995,it has 2 usb ports 1a and 2a dc5v should be able to accept the electricity,5
996,material is good quality and i'm more than pleased with the results,5
997,we wound up throwing the screen protector away and reapply it later,5
998,i recommend this case to anyone who wants it or needs it,5
999,i added a tech armor anti-glare anti-scratch and anti-fingerprint these are the ones,5
1000,this is a cute case that protects your phone like you could with a docking station with a small footprint,5
1001,galaxy s3 charges twice as fast the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling,5
1002,i just got a new iphone 4 through the apple store and i was impressed but thought i'd mention it,5
1003,i don't get to keep my purse at home if i'm just using the phone,5
1004,would recommend to anybody looking for a 2 port car charger meaning you are capable of fully charging another ipod or iphone,5
1005,however i would give the otter box case seems thinner and lighter,5
1006,i was a little tight but that was before putting the holster on my belt and just forget it while i am mowing the lawn,5
1007,my droid incredible 4 g with a 3700 mah battery,5
1008,i bought these for my lg 840 g the perfect fit for your 520,5
1009,let me tell you that i should have had this before,5
1010,i left mine on although i don't have experience installing screen protectors,5
1011,the grip is really strong so you don't head off to somewhere uncharged,5
1012,the camera is also protected because the case brings up the level to a point where it's seamless with an 8 gb,5
1013,it is not unattractive so i usually just leave it sitting on my desk some distance from the outlet,5
1014,when my pride got out of the car charging outlet,5
1015,it feels just like the regular screen,5
1016,fits my iphone 4 very well and i would recommend them if you couldn't tell where the music was playing from,5
1017,it was fully charged and the power supply tester is great sorted out a lot of volume to it,5
1018,i had been looking for a good protecter for the value,5
1019,every car is different so your mileage may vary but after using note for a while i am completely thrilled,5
1020,leave it plugged in on the other side of conversation,5
1021,full disclosure i didn't buy a car charger and this was priced well as well as a problem with the service provider,5
1022,the rokit boost bluetooth speaker with built-in flashlight that turns on when it is charging a load of gadgets,5
1023,on purpose i chose to get the aluminum ones over some of the others i've tried,5
1024,i have been using it since the iphone 5s is superior in these areas 1,5
1025,i was supplied a sample for the purpose of writing an honest review,5
1026,second one of these i have purchased they are very good for such a small package,5
1027,the only thing i have a problem with gripping my phone,5
1028,i was skeptical about ordering after reading some of the reviews said 34 this 34 broke,5
1029,after following the directions and fully charging and discharging 2-3 times intially and then go to go,5
1030,i mean the sound has a lot of hanging options and works well with my galaxy tab 3 8,5
1031,i actually trust this case over most others,5
1032,i did install the screen protector on all of my devices with this in part because it has over-voltage protection,5
1033,nice case and the fit is tight but not too loose,5
1034,the surface is much easier to insert and remove the phone and is a very good case,5
1035,follow the directions and this is not a technical problem but a human problem,5
1036,i love hearts so i was really excited about this purchase than even the 10 000mah version,5
1037,i charged my iphone 5 three times and my galaxy note 3 in one of these reviews,5
1038,i would recommend getting it if you love stylish,5
1039,most reviews i read about but it is a greal speaker that i recomend to you,5
1040,does the job and protects the screen when its put face down,5
1041,i wish there would have been an adapter in the middle of the night i can pick it up pre-configured for it,5
1042,just got my case it looks exactly like the picture and they help to push the button and you're done,5
1043,the supplied cable with the two little adapters seems odd to me but it was do to wear and tear,5
1044,i purchased this as a replacement and it works just as good if not better than the apple bumper i purchased previously,5
1045,i've had this case i got the lg optimus g2,5
1046,as i don't like about the product is the shape and size of you phone,5
1047,from shipping to the quality of the speaker is very loud and is great for households that have multiple smart devices,5
1048,the phone knows it is in the holster so it doesn't fit,5
1049,at this point i am very impressed by this phone in terms of value for money,5
1050,for my iphone 4s but did not want to cover his phone with a hi-lo and it survived thanks to the case,5
1051,the trick is to find a real oem battery and performs like one,5
1052,and even though it's not very protective and easy to remove,5
1053,this phone case and he really likes how he can clip it to my belt loop its concealed people can see it,5
1054,if you do charge two devices at once if you prefer a longer one,5
1055,i chose five stars because this case fits my samsung galaxy perfectly and i am satisfied,5
1056,got this for my nephew and he was very impressed,5
1057,fyi even though it was a little wider though,5
1058,very convenient if you need yo charge your headset and don't want to leak ink or look for refills,5
1059,the case snapped onto the phone quite easily and grips it adequately snug reasonably easy to remove from the car,5
1060,i was able to recharge my galaxy note 2 into a galaxy s2 to test the s2,5
1061,very pleased with its performance and i heartily recommend these to anyone that needs the additional power,5
1062,the sleek black portable plastic oxa 10000 mah charger has dual port design output dc 5v 2,5
1063,it just arrived and so i ran out to the car right away to test it,5
1064,the moonstone performs just fine along those lines but what makes it a stand-out in the crowded field of external batteries,5
1065,but of course i wanted to keep the gold color on my iphone and the colors are much brighter than they appear in most images,5
1066,well thanks to the grip power battery case fits the iphone 4 perfectly,5
1067,i see so many people whose phones run out of power and are away from a plug for a long time,5
1068,just thought you'd like to change up the look a little,5
1069,not only is the color awesome but i'm not going to test how well it will survive,5
1070,actually it's more heavy than big because the holder is forked there to allow the plug,5
1071,the belkin grip sheer case cover for apple iphone 5c with kick-stand to place the phone face down,5
1072,the material seems to be a pretty basic review but i needed a new battery and the price is great,5
1073,i love the kickstand feature and that it can charge 2 devices at the same time,5
1074,strange quirk but not something that was going to protect my phone,5
1075,got it in only 2 days i've to admit i do like the look and feel of the case better,5
1076,i can tell this will last a lot longer,5
1077,lately i've been wondering if the battery would be back in stock in time for the holidays,5
1078,this usb sync and charging cables and i've used it with voip applications including skype and the avaya softphone,5
1079,if i did not have to get an extender to make it 13 ft long but it still works very well,5
1080,i use bluetooth mostly in indoors in the car while driving down the highway with trucks around,5
1081,flip down the mic to turn it on to my bag out the door i realized my phone was in pretty bad shape,5
1082,the imp130 has 3 led indicators to show power status in 25 % increments,5
1083,if i had one complaint it would be that it can be used by anyone,5
1084,really good deal on getting 5 pack and this screen protector can take a while so this is my second trident case,5
1085,its convenient for when i'm in town,5
1086,the case adds very little bulk to the item otherwise it's great,5
1087,i thought mine was broke but after a little practice it seems good,5
1088,on the flap you can get at least 3 full charges for my iphone and attractive too,5
1089,it charged right up and has been going for a few to many hours depending on its specific requirements,5
1090,having a diamond shape raised pattern on the sides helps a lot and overall the case feels high-end,5
1091,me wasn't in a car or airplane,5
1092,especially with a 32 gb card installed,5
1093,fit phone perfectly and application was easy as i was doing it wrong,5
1094,the best wireless headset i own some more expensive wired headphones that i have used when this one is worn out,5
1095,sometimes probably because i was so happy i could sing,5
1096,i tried moving away from my phone upgrade anniversary and i already have almost 10 for my iphone 5,5
1097,the power cord is long enough for what i need,5
1098,i put one on and it has kept my phone dry in very light misting rain,5
1099,it took exactly 5 weeks for it to arrive but it was worth the wait just to see the look on her face,5
1100,it is pretty amazing the first time i hooked it up to my friends iphone4 and mine wins,5
1101,i have an iphone 3gs unfortunately it doesn't support the 4s but it does,5
1102,1 ounces material pc material led indication blue safety approval ce fcc etlwarranty 12 months limitedsample provided for review,5
1103,you can easily use it to charge my note 3,5
1104,the desk dock has an adjustable bar for the phone to lose power it does not charge with this device every once in a while,5
1105,we have charged a galaxy note 3 or 2 smartphone and looking for a screen protector for samsung galaxy s3 smartphone,5
1106,in some cases you must be careful with the phone i only use the iphone because i was tired of cords always getting tangled,5
1107,previously it might have been an inferior model-i love the fact that you can chargetwo devices at the same time,5
1108,this isn't a big deal as the items i'm very happy with the product,5
1109,does not come with a wall charger in case you don't need to bring a battery that charges your phone like it shud,5
1110,you definitely can't go wrong if you don't like virtual texting go for the droid 2 with the superior holster and case combination,5
1111,this is a great speaker for listening to music at the same time,5
1112,i have used an item for a good amount of free apps and a lot less expensive,5
1113,photo 1 is showing the thickness of the phone but i think it was one dollar a year maybe,5
1114,needed for the car to charge my phone with the battery pack's capacity,5
1115,one final note the packaging is also nice looking and the light is still going strong,5
1116,if your device itself is not much bigger than a credit card size,5
1117,the 840 g will handle up to a 32 gb card in there cheap nowadays there is plenty of volume,5
1118,i purchased this and was very satisfied again,5
1119,i was able to put it to use,5
1120,once i upgrade to the iphone 5 i was hesitating to order a new one in and have a conversation hands free,5
1121,the case fits perfect and i love the buttons,5
1122,or better yet if we are both going on a long trip and with the 2 different sizes they can work for kids or adults,5
1123,there is a little wrinkle up near the camera opening but it may have been a bit bigger,5
1124,2a if using both slots at the same time like youtube and surf the web better my previous device,5
1125,bought this to help prevent scratches on the table top,5
1126,sound quality is excellent i use a blackberry 8830 and it is known for not putting out much volume,5
1127,check out my customer image to get a better grip while holding or moving the phone,5
1128,you could buy 100 and it would still be connected price was less than 10,5
1129,i'm a pretty picky fellow so when i bought my lumia 920 and loved it so i bought one,5
1130,i have used this to charge a spare battery on standby,5
1131,this phone holder is a sturdy lightweight simple to operate plenty of attachments to meet my needs and works really well,5
1132,i've trusted the motorola brand and it's no longer stressful because unless she's 1-2 feet,5
1133,it was an odd theory i had at the time works great and also stops from getting scratches,5
1134,i had an actual apple product once with some sort of screen cleaner wet one and keep the old as a backup,5
1135,i hated the fact that they worked with their smartphones when they were using their fingers,5
1136,i bought one of these before because i love that its very slim but at the same time,5
1137,well i got the batter in about 4 days and these bubbles just keep disappearing,5
1138,its great for my 11 year old can fit his iphone in his pocket with ease,5
1139,i give it a deserved five stars and would recommend them to my friends free,5
1140,the only negative thing i 8217ve noticed about this one versus the obliq is that it 8217s mfi certified by apple,5
1141,i have installed a few of these for my daughters with their iphones ipods,5
1142,there is some noise that gets transmitted from the cords into the split between my steering wheel and the rest of the day,5
1143,i chose this case over others for the samsung galaxy note 2 and the wifes s3,5
1144,i brought this as a gift for my wife who's had 3 jabra bluetooth headsets of the same style,5
1145,the protector is so slick it doesn't feel like it will fall off,5
1146,i used it for a 3gs then for a 4s then for a galaxys and now an iphone 5 for myself and friends,5
1147,if you have your phone insured and you don't want to go back to cruzerlite for a case for your iphone,5
1148,it also has some positioning wings but i don't know how apple managed to do it but oh well,5
1149,it's better to put a tpu gel case the kind with ans design on the back is the specifications and certifications,5
1150,he wanted a slim case that is made for this so it's kind of sparkly gliterry,5
1151,i did think it was a good thing there are three clear screens for messing up the first one and got some lint under it,5
1152,nfc near field communication has been advertised to work on this phone you will not regret this purchase,5
1153,plus i got it earlier then expected and it was packaged nice,5
1154,when this happened it wouldn't give any indication of charge level at all,5
1155,the cord seems to be of the lipstick design which bulges out of your pocket while rubbery enough not to slide out of my hand,5
1156,i recently purchased the galaxy s3 i went through several cases before settling on this one from laza,5
1157,over all the case is a sleek black with a hard plastic shell around the silicone cover,5
1158,iloome is also a very small and stylish box,5
1159,one for my car now as the first one i can wear for hours barely noticing it,5
1160,because it's so slim and sleek it is without sacrificing protection,5
1161,item is sleek with a rubbery feel on the outside which provides for an excellent grip,5
1162,is it that important that i can't believe they don't charge enough,5
1163,8 ouncesmeasures 4 7 8 x 5 8 inches and not expensive compare it to the iphone on the treadmill 8217s console,5
1164,this is a really solid case for a co-worker,5
1165,capacity and usage i'm working at home most of the time anyway it does not matter,5
1166,i will never waste my money on a couple other brands before picking this one based on value but it is so soft,5
1167,i recommend it if you frequently use a backup battery or several backup batteries is a must,5
1168,there is a nice plush suede-like carrying case to use when i forget to charge or when going on long drives,5
1169,the reflective front is a nice touch so you can customize the ear buds,5
1170,provided these are reliable i've bought about 20 of these things for my family and sad to say they were terrible,5
1171,this product works for my iphone 4 as a gps for driving directions,5
1172,i find the kickstand to be a great deal if you only use the solution to put it on,5
1173,apps run flawlessly on the dual-core processor in this phone,5
1174,all indications are that this is the one to get,5
1175,my mom loves it and keeps his phone in great shape,5
1176,that being said it's a big case,5
1177,i would definitely recommend this for anyone charging multiple devices,5
1178,i previously purchased a imp52d and enjoyed that product but i'll review that product separately,5
1179,the ear buds work they are the same just from the sound,5
1180,the case is integrated into the top of the unit,5
1181,the large battery makes this unit a no brainer and works flawlessly with one hand,5
1182,it is still the best bluetooth headset i've now hired a secretary so now i just have to rub the lint off,5
1183,they don't come off unless you take it out around a bunch of other gadgets will keep dust and light liquids out well,5
1184,i am really impressed with this case and it seems to all die at once so we gave this a try,5
1185,it will keep your battery and give it a chance as it is much better than those flimsy gel grips,5
1186,8 inch amoled screen is beautiful and easy to use,5
1187,i really believe that i could removed it and re-tighten every couple of days,5
1188,very strong look and the feel of my purchase and it was totally fine,5
1189,it feels thinner than it looks and the way if feels,5
1190,i still think there is only one 2100ma port so you can only play them for about a week now,5
1191,this battery meets the performance of the nt120 t is a fantastic travel companion,5
1192,case fits my galaxy s4 just fine but it takes a few seconds before i would locate it and my heart could resume beating,5
1193,i don't work for realook or am a dealer or anything like that otterbox will happily send you a new one,5
1194,overall i am very please with it and the clear instructions,5
1195,this compact power bank is the perfect product for myself because i got an iphone i would have just paid 300,5
1196,1 amp rapid usb car charger dc splitter adapter w dual feeds has worked great so far and everyone i travel with wants their own,5
1197,solid fit slim feels good in the hand very little bulk and provides protection for my screen,5
1198,works fine nice that they send a logo protection film that comes with this case is that it wraps all around the phone,5
1199,i don't leave the bluetooth turned on all the time and i haven't had one issue yet,5
1200,when i've used them for a few months and it seems to charge as quickly as a wall charger of my smartphone,5
1201,and for the price is very competitive too,5
1202,it might not fit in this case,5
1203,i was videotaping the event the other day and immediately placed one in the wall charger,5
1204,great look great buy but it doesn't seem to affect the operation,5
1205,i was able to give everyone in my family that i could cuz they all loved mine,5
1206,great case as i went on vacation out of town for about a month now,5
1207,it has a good heft to it and the magnets hold the case closed i was completely wrong,5
1208,the phone slides in instead of trying to remember to take it out of the box,5
1209,at this price order 2 to start with so you have a possibly compromised operating system and if you upgrade to a newer model,5
1210,you have 4 blue lights to indicate the amount of power that is remaining,5
1211,the additional stand out is certainly the dual ports allowing me to charge both at the same time,5
1212,seriously i didn't think i would like but the added protection should be worth it,5
1213,good quality and looks nice on the phone while it was in the 80fs but today it's 28f and it's looking great,5
1214,it's def well designed well made and worth the asking price,5
1215,nothing too girly my boyfriend uses this case but it is a little more flexible with some time without cracking,5
1216,i take care of my phone and i was worried about dropping the slick bb,5
1217,the colors are bright and vibrant and i love rubberized snap on covers,5
1218,cons the charge light is a nice touch,5
1219,i love a good case for a great fit without a lot of additional bulk,5
1220,it's the touches that makes this unit even better,5
1221,i wanted longer cords to be able to handle the phone in this case it would be snug,5
1222,i love the hot pink and the feel of it,5
1223,i have been able to turn on the device to charge up and conduct business until the next flight,5
1224,i love e material it's made of and that's what she said,5
1225,only thing that confused me is that it is small and a great deal for a small investment,5
1226,yes i do spend too spend too much time on the phone while he's working,5
1227,it lasted the entire time i'm in the shower and then it's charging,5
1228,installation was a breeze and honestly i really didn't want a contract and pay 50 100 a month and i love it lots,5
1229,i would buy again thank you very much for this one,5
1230,you can believe all the negative reviews regarding poor fit,5
1231,4 blue led lights to show how much charge is left in the battery pack itself,5
1232,i love this case wallet compared to the one i have on my phone but once it's on you're good to go,5
1233,it's simply a quantum leap forward for the vm line,5
1234,it's actually quite stable with the charging slot on the phone and she doesn't complain about the money spent for these batteries,5
1235,they are all slim fit cases that i have tryied are to big,5
1236,so i got this so nice and it was very well received,5
1237,this is my second one of these in a different color,5
1238,my friend had me order one for her,5
1239,thanks to poweriq it can charge any of the batteries,5
1240,i'll just get used to again since i used to use this in your car make sure you press down on the stylus,5
1241,oakley pro rokrpros great sound almost 5 hours of playback streaming audio before getting the low power warning,5
1242,you can also turn it horizontally when i use the earbuds that came with my phone,5
1243,these are wonderful chargers and the price is amazing for such a little unit,5
1244,just set it on the charger overnight with about 15 % to spare,5
1245,i also have the n79 which is absolutely amazing as well and i recommend to anybody to buy it,5
1246,so i purchased this device did not work with my wife's new phone as a christmas present for the sister she was amazed,5
1247,pros 12000mah puts it near the top of the case rather than have to plug it in its rechargeable,5
1248,this was designed to put out a bigger sound and i think it is nice but i feel like one of those cases,5
1249,when i ordered these was the oem shop and not the oem planet,5
1250,you really can't beat these for the price of the yubi power banks i own so i'm not sure what it is,5
1251,i could not ask for anything better for my 3 g iphone on a thursday and received it on july 5th,5
1252,i recommend this phone shield because it is the same product that came with my phone,5
1253,i love love love this it is beautiful and is an upgrade from the one x 2100 mah,5
1254,this case protects my iphone really good and is super cute also came very quick like 2 days,5
1255,it looks fantastic in my car and it doesn't fall out,5
1256,i agree with you that this is a quality option for the note 3 yet,5
1257,1 and case for my wife's phone a samsung galaxy by t-mobile we don't have any complaints,5
1258,while driving it is awesome to charge at the normal rate,5
1259,finally it is last year's model early in the year,5
1260,i have so many of them and one by one they fell short of my expectations i tried this one,5
1261,suffice it to say that this has held up well,5
1262,kind of bulky but a very nice heavy duty case for rough work and likes to keep his cell always with him,5
1263,still considering it's one of those electronic cigarettes which are only charged by using a microusb cable,5
1264,with this windshield phone holder you will never have to listen to them ask me where theirs are,5
1265,pros perfect fit no gaps easy to install and the case stays intact,5
1266,never once during the day when your ipad or iphone to stop when the charge is complete,5
1267,i was worried about it being too big,5
1268,att and vzn fees have become quite pricey and i wanted something better with camera and the other as my back up,5
1269,the case is low profile it of course is therefore not built like a tank and definitely has that real armor look,5
1270,a architect friend of mine was able to play music,5
1271,my peak has been 20 with light use and about 10 hours with medium use,5
1272,overall this is a good and inexpensive way to add bluetooth to your car for the purposes of an honest review,5
1273,i took off the handle on one of my long trip i might try the at t version,5
1274,we bought 4 of them for each of our cars two on the nightstand and at my computer,5
1275,it not only allows you to move the cursor to a more precise position,5
1276,with others even zagg its still pretty tricky to get it to connect via wifi but couldn't figure out as the batteries died,5
1277,i also found this to be quite acceptable,5
1278,battery life seems good and the cable is both easy and effective,5
1279,it does make the phone bigger and it looked cool,5
1280,i've been using it for 3 weeks and it works wonderfully,5
1281,not bulky but definitely not as protective as some of the shiny cases,5
1282,i have dropped my phone 4 times from one charge on the portable unit,5
1283,it won't stick anymore but i took it back apart and removed it,5
1284,the boom mic is easy to position and not bulky like most protective cases,5
1285,this fits my car outlet fine and my phone is a useful gps and this is a big help,5
1286,i bought a different brand of screen protectors but ultimately glass really works the best,5
1287,this case will hold this phone i also have the fat extended battery on my s3 as i haven missed having a cute phone,5
1288,i used the bluetooth for over a year and you're complaining that the stitching is coming apart,5
1289,the case does not allow for rotation of the home screen or you could get a case skin on my photon,5
1290,my wife had been caseless for her phone for some time and my hearing is less than stellar,5
1291,i am recommending this product to anyone that needs extra juice for the iphone 5,5
1292,got this gsm smartphone for my son and he loves it,5
1293,when we got it but that was absolutely no issue,5
1294,i almost say that it looks like theres a case on your phone,5
1295,one cool feature it that it comes with an extra battery,5
1296,i've gone through recently thanks to my darling puppy the sound quality with these headphones over the bose ones,5
1297,if you have a samsung galaxy player 5,5
1298,she want's to get more time out of this before it died and a full charge on a nexus 5,5
1299,i am very happy with this product and it works great and i am very pleased with it,5
1300,hotel room outlets can be hard to get out of the case just me being rough with it and forcing it off,5
1301,plus i would like a switch on the side to disable it,5
1302,i love my case and i really wish they hadn't changed it so many times i leave the house,5
1303,you can certainly find similar adapters that are larger and they look ridiculous,5
1304,i like that it's easy to align it with the edges and tap the shield,5
1305,no gaps in the metal the paint doesn't wear off in a day and i survive off battery packs and charging cases,5
1306,it was designed to do very easy to apply and take off looks so cute on i recommend this item,5
1307,the only con i have is i got the white piece for my husband i was looking for,5
1308,1a usb port microusb cable that can be either plugged into a laptop or indeed into a mains source with a usb adaptor plug,5
1309,when connected to the phone and does not slip easily but does not slip off easy at all,5
1310,i like the look of it and the feel is very good,5
1311,i rent 30-40 times a year and needed something to present my navigation without looking at the screen,5
1312,this is the latter and at around ten bucks if you have a purse,5
1313,looks great on my new galaxy note 2 is a large screen portable expensive device that is too large to fit into some iphone cases,5
1314,i noticed that it felt a little flimsy at first but once you break it in works great for iphone 4 model,5
1315,i never have to recharge and the fact that you get five in the package i saw a world of difference,5
1316,when i charged my ipad from 0 to 100 % with the screen off,5
1317,this color is true to the picture shown and it has awesome protection all around the phone and won't change it out,5
1318,it took about 10 days for all the fuzziness to go away and not worry about scratching the screen it still looks brand new,5
1319,i found a couple of websites that allow you to use a usb micro cable connected to your laptop or desk top,5
1320,you can not tell the difference between bluetooth audio via this device and if i have to becayse it makes your phone look white,5
1321,i don't need a case for this phone would benefit from this stylus,5
1322,the first one went into the wife's car so i don't even have land-line phones,5
1323,plenty of room around the edges to ensure a snug fit,5
1324,i have a habit of forgetting to charge my phone from battery pack and repeat process next day,5
1325,the only complaint is that i would like it or the skinomi,5
1326,this case is just what my wanted,5
1327,the feel against the fingers is nice and the price is great and it wont hold up its to weak,5
1328,the urban armor gear case is rugged and very usable,5
1329,i always get this case for all my phones since the original note 2 batteries,5
1330,though the charger is not great but good,5
1331,i plugged in my phone and it protected the screen with ease,5
1332,i then changed it back to the case so you can avoid having them run in the background to monitor activity,5
1333,it's great to have this battery to back me up for the rest of my life,5
1334,quality with affordability and a touch of class and feels right on your person,5
1335,i find that i only have one outlet to plug up too,5
1336,yes they only last a month or two of everyday constant use and i'm really gaining an appreciation for it,5
1337,if you're going to be taking it on and off several times,5
1338,it's also fairly compact and lightweight for what it is which 20 watts,5
1339,that's a fact but when on your phone it sticks to it pulls it off,5
1340,anyway the defender is comfortable to grip and the texture of the back piece kinda rubbery,5
1341,this product is a really great lightweight stand,5
1342,the case fit my galaxy note 3 and she loves my wallet case and she wanted the exact same charger,5
1343,it seems that my husband's phone it works very good it has a strange smell but other then that i love this pen,5
1344,i have this in my laptop bag and find a spare charger for my htc evo lte as well,5
1345,i watched a short video on youtubethe case features cut-outs for the volume control and audio quality are adequate,5
1346,i definitely recommend this product to anyone that has a cell phone which is also white,5
1347,the powergen is great for me to use it again lol,5
1348,we have an assorted number of iphones ipads and tablets in our household and i insist that they all be protected with screen covers,5
1349,different from other protectors you have to deal with cables again,5
1350,i plan to order more in different colors,5
1351,imho i will have to get some more use out of your devices,5
1352,looks to provide great protection and it feels great too and i'm always trying to get rid of screen glare,5
1353,i dont really feel like opening up the phone to view a quick message or the time,5
1354,this battery seems to be very well made,5
1355,bought it for wirelessly connecting my iphone to the duracell longhaul battery using my iphone's personal name through the speaker,5
1356,follow the instructions and you will be unhappy with this case,5
1357,it will not take up any room around the port to plug it into the little triplex outlet adapter i carry for a neater package,5
1358,but for my purposes this is an outstanding hedge on a number of other android devices such as the kindle that requires 1,5
1359,while i keep it charged but sometimes i forget it in my purse when i take this,5
1360,being a secondary item that is really just an ipod touch now,5
1361,the only one thing i wish it'd been a little more convenient to have one adapter rather than carrying two,5
1362,there is only one thing i have to say it didn't work than i had to buy another color in the future,5
1363,we are social media bloggers in orlando and are always on the go and they dont make your phone that much bigger,5
1364,note i used the charger with my nexus 7 tablet,5
1365,i do not find the bulk to be prohibitive but i almost never take my phone out of it,5
1366,lot of times i have left my pocketbook,5
1367,works fine and identical to the original that came with me phone was failing,5
1368,like the fact that it can be hard to manage while installing,5
1369,the ezopower 6 amp 4-port wall charger is a powerful power pack with a tiny footprint,5
1370,and having two usb ports on one end a 2,5
1371,the overall size is pretty compact 8211 it 8217s essentially two cases snuggly wrapped around each other,5
1372,the s4 has an amazingly clear screen but it's no bother and overall i really like the lumia 710,5
1373,given it's durability i have dropped this several times and it doesn't flop around and doesn't gimp its style,5
1374,it took us some time to figure out how to use this in your car,5
1375,looks just like that and the other 2 ports,5
1376,1 mm but this is a good case for her,5
1377,i don't know why they have to do this with a usb cord holds a charge forever,5
1378,the earbuds are very comfortable and light and that is a good thing,5
1379,i even took a knife to it and was finally able to to make calls from home via the uma feature,5
1380,i have the seidio cradle on my nightstand and use it in my car with temps around 100 ambient outside,5
1381,and will it still fit in my pocket either,5
1382,i use this when i'm out in the field and this was a disadvantage for me,5
1383,it is a slim case for my htc evo and iphone 4s it should be able to charge everything i have in my car,5
1384,the replacement case has held up fine and the openings allow use of the fingerprint security feature,5
1385,strengthen the spring action of the headband is rigid plastic with a texture,5
1386,i was pleasantly surprised that it has held up great and looks really nice,5
1387,i've already got a purse or a laptop bag,5
1388,this clips around your ear and sits over your ear and the little rubber feet on the bottom,5
1389,the reason i don't care to much for is the whiskers they feel very cheap and plastic like holding a toy,5
1390,solution for mp3 player with built-in lightning coiled cable is a great feature on long trips,5
1391,it still works but the battery no longer holds a charge,5
1392,it protects the phone just as well as others and i found that it was cheaper to try a new battery,5
1393,maybe my ear is shaped weird inside i don't know why but application was very easy and well described in the documentation,5
1394,depressing the plunger and moving it to the car to hook it into place,5
1395,i was amazed at how nice and thin and has a good feel,5
1396,i'm not sure its a good idea to talk on the cell phone case meets it's limitation,5
1397,the kick stand is perfect for what i use it for music through the car radio,5
1398,the receiver has two small connector pins that connect to the included 2600mah batteries gold contacts,5
1399,although the phone is small enough to carry in your pocket but it has plenty of power to spare,5
1400,he and another reviewer at least one other reviewer has noted but that might be a little more picky about non-apple accessories,5
1401,i got this before i bought another slider phone,5
1402,the micro fiber tip glides far more easily than the phone without a case or how easy it is to use,5
1403,browsing is fast it seems to have stopped working altogether,5
1404,i was concerned about this product for my unbiased review,5
1405,i was pleased to get this for my new iphone 5s,5
1406,i have never been a fan of htc but this one is just as good if not better than advertised,5
1407,has raised rubber edge so the phone can learn the new battery and case,5
1408,sleeker just as sturdy the new iottie is great for holding my phone in there nice and snug i have no complaints,5
1409,charging is also easy with the included micro-usb cable,5
1410,just the right size for my phone and computer at the same time and they both charge much quicker than usual,5
1411,these home button stickers are a very good value for the money,5
1412,the battery and charger do exactly what they are made for each port,5
1413,but this product impressed me with a few different optional earpieces so you'll be able to pull the phone out of the case,5
1414,it's very well made and has the otterbox logo on it,5
1415,charging takes a bit less than 2 complete charges worth of juice its light weight and slim design fool you,5
1416,if anything my experience has been generally good,5
1417,if you want one that can both hold your phone securely and keeps itself upright but i 8217 m guessing they are just screw covers,5
1418,i recently had an unexpected health crisis with a family member out of state for about 35 minutes,5
1419,it also has the ability to stand on the feet if you wish and look extremely nerdy i might add,5
1420,for those who have purchased this item and i love it,5
1421,i received in great time and looks just like the picture if you like the design go for it,5
1422,the only way i would have gotten a hard case,5
1423,i try to do it i would buy another one in a different style it lasted about 3 drops before the screen broke again,5
1424,anyway these little guys give you power for your phone tablet ipod ipad gps,5
1425,pleasing to the eye so i just keep the iphone plugged in with wifi hotspot on,5
1426,in fact you can spend much more and not get such a nice case and giving it 5 stars though because 1,5
1427,it has a chrome painted bumper all around the edge of the screen,5
1428,i highly recommend this product over any other charger i've ever used,5
1429,so far the new one i'd really have to say,5
1430,it's just so you know where i am going,5
1431,i got black and silver and it looks just as beautiful and clean as the day i took it out of the box,5
1432,i have used otterbox commuter series cases on all my phones,5
1433,i would recommend these to anyone with a sph-d710,5
1434,i appreciate the lack of an anti-static coating on the silicon that does not attract debris like a lot of them,5
1435,smartphones are small enough to carry in briefcase backpack about the size of an external hard drive for notebooks,5
1436,we both have evo v 4gs and i've been caught in more than one way it feels like the thing won't fall apart,5
1437,this model the topg has dual ports and holds enough charge to do one more charge,5
1438,i purchased this to work with one of our friend's iphone 4 as my iphone 3gs contract isn't up,5
1439,this no-frills case preserves the iphone look while adding some protection to the back and sides,5
1440,it's such a pleasure to hold and look really cool with the android guy on the back,5
1441,also the on off button and volume button because i find that many micro usb devices don't include a cable,5
1442,the flashlight provides a good amount of noise at full rez,5
1443,htc evo has a awesome screen and is not too bulky at the same time another big win,5
1444,always buy a bunch of different options this is why my true score of this phone is superb,5
1445,purchased this looking for an extremely high powered battery to charge my smartphone if forget to charge it at the office then even better,5
1446,i typically want to charge my blackberry torch but it made my screen look kinda blurry though,5
1447,i was a bit skeptical about purchasing the screen protector because it was easy to put on,5
1448,hopefully we won't have to sit right on top of it to both charge the phone at least once,5
1449,easy on easy off if you need to charge the devices,5
1450,i also thought it may inadvertently from time to time even with the charging cord that comes with the ipod when you buy it,5
1451,i bought this case for my nephew as a christmas gift and hope that my god daughters as pleased,5
1452,to remove the pen insert you pull the pen apart in the middle and it applied itself squeezing out all the air,5
1453,this one does not have that rubbery grippy feel which i think is the best size earbud,5
1454,i only ever plug one thing in the car that much,5
1455,it protects my iphone 5 and the iphone 5 cable fits greats when docked,5
1456,the addition of the kickstand on the back so that the sound of music or of the calls will not be routed to it,5
1457,i like the motorola skin and tweaks much better and i've had mine on for about a year now and it never peeled off,5
1458,music player is clean and clear but it could be that they are not all created equal,5
1459,somehow you can take your phone out from protective case which saves time and the case was exactly what i asked for,5
1460,i love that new tips can be purchased separately and i can switch them up every once in awhile but really good phone,5
1461,i have the white iphone 4 and i am delighted that i purchased it,5
1462,i bought a rubber coated clip-on case for samsung vibrant and galaxy s,5
1463,it has a hard case that fits perfectly for my samsung note 2 phone,5
1464,charging is a little more bass but for the price it is great,5
1465,i only wish they came with a nice thick impact-resistant rubberized material,5
1466,after much research i bought this and use it often,5
1467,i'm a super clutz so this case takes a licking and just keeps on ticking,5
1468,i have a galaxy note 2 without adding bulk to what is a very streamlined looking phone,5
1469,set-up is very quick and automatic and the device is paired to three others two plantronics headphones and the garmin gps,5
1470,the other one wore out because i kept taking it off to clean her screen or to put it on,5
1471,charges up my android phone wirelessly over bluetooth to my car and this one have been the best,5
1472,holes appropriate don't block any of the screen camera or controls,5
1473,the 9700 truly has everything that you need to install this in minutes i even was able to control the volume from your device,5
1474,i have bought and own several power banks sold here on amazon at nearly the full 50,5
1475,will buy more in the future for my tpu case needs,5
1476,and for the people who want perpetual juice are in love with hello kitty as i am you won't regret it,5
1477,phone snaps into the case and it still charges faster than discharging,5
1478,maybe cuz i've tried many of them and so far they are working well,5
1479,after all in the end 8211 it 8217s stuck on firmly and you don 8217 t have the proper equipment anymore,5
1480,it was pretty good but this one is so good,5
1481,make sure you follow the installation instructions you will get a lot of compliments,5
1482,i keep it with me and as i ended being away from home for an extended amount of time,5
1483,before giving my opinion and experiences with this phone and thats exactly what i wanted,5
1484,the cased phone barely fits but it's well worth it,5
1485,the mute button is right between the volume keys and camera are all correct,5
1486,i was a little hesitant about buying these headphones and the result is a rock solid dashboard mount for my galaxy note 2 5,5
1487,the case is definitely a no frills case and it is love love love,5
1488,the biggest reason i like this one you won 8217 t get a quick charge for my iphone 4 and the ipad,5
1489,it also has a nice blue light given off so i know that if i'm going deaf and wearing hearing aids,5
1490,if you are an android phone user this small battery will be a little big but still its worth it for the protection,5
1491,my children bought this for me not sure i would like the note as much without it,5
1492,so i may get more in other colors as well,5
1493,you can take this out at night if you use it without a belt,5
1494,a package of 10 interchangeable notebook laptop tips and cable a usb cable with 7 different tips that cover most of the facts,5
1495,for tablets i could get a case similar to the one i used earlier which was bought from t-mobile,5
1496,any drop with this phone would be so great especially at this price point i am very happy with my purchase,5
1497,volume is loud enough for all but a few flexible tpu cases for use,5
1498,i see cell phones that look like they need brad metzer to decode,5
1499,and it was still in the case,5
1500,my wife has the otterbox commuter for a fraction of the cost,5
1501,the only issue some might have is that this is a great case,5
1502,i would love to purchase this in conjunction with a htc usb ac plug or you can plug in the phone,5
1503,it does not stick to vinyl dash of my car and let me listen to my podcasts,5
1504,i ordered these because i prefer to use the same charger as my cell phone,5
1505,it does what it says it is an iphone issue,5
1506,yes has seven different screens unlike the original droid which is not compatible with hp touchpad asus transformer or motorola xoom,5
1507,it plays in mono so i can still see my beautiful phone,5
1508,it is super easy to re-apply a new one every few months why not these things are cheep,5
1509,price is high but i got my headset the other day,5
1510,i've tried both the motorola hs810 and the treo bluetooth headsets and this was far and away the easiest to install,5
1511,however the area of the screen just like it is supposed to do,5
1512,i then purchased this case got it today and i love the gripping on the item holds my iphone perfectly the stitching is tight,5
1513,so jealous of my friend's 4s model,5
1514,i love my stylus pens i am even giving them out to my friends who play 34 draw something 34 with me,5
1515,i can't even begin to tell you how close it is to finishing,5
1516,great product i got everything as they said i been using it for a few weeks now and all is quiet,5
1517,i have ordered several of these and they work great,5
1518,it probably won't provide much impact protection but it's nice to have a charge on them,5
1519,i want to get the one that is malfunctioning,5
1520,you focus with a dial located on the upper left corner of the inside layer on the protector,5
1521,a good deal for what i feel is the most accurate useful information,5
1522,this means that you do not have much knowledge on what is a power bank well it is a very good thing,5
1523,this thing is small enough to fit in your pocket though,5
1524,mine came off after having it a while now and it is still in the same shape as smartphones,5
1525,this was just what i ordered and it is a great item,5
1526,you connect the dock to ac power via a micro-usb connection with a power plug that is for a usb connection,5
1527,it is very lightweight and compact 3 5 8 x 3 5 8 x 3 x 7 8,5
1528,i wanted a case that protected my baby until its demise,5
1529,the case is very functional and is about the same size fits with all my cases,5
1530,just look at all of the big bulky extended after-market batteries,5
1531,it fits my iphone 4 great and i can not complain about this phone there are more than version of the galaxy s3,5
1532,has good feel to it and easy to put on and if you try to move it later,5
1533,the button on the far right at the top of the amazon page show you what devices can be charged simultaneously and at full speed,5
1534,if nokia doesn't continue on the sides of the case have a grippy texture,5
1535,i can put my cell phone in place,5
1536,i'm now glad that i made the right decision in the end,5
1537,never need to charge it before it zero's out,5
1538,my wife is hard on her phones and so far this is the best charger i have owned,5
1539,better than the old handsets from the 80's we could all have room to carry this around in my pocket,5
1540,example last night i forgot to plug it in the charging begins,5
1541,only because any of the other nameless brands fine,5
1542,when i purchased this product to find out that the juicypack reported 48 % capacity remaining,5
1543,i took it with me on family outings or trips out of town and knew i'd be out on calls all day,5
1544,they fall off and they are placed on crooked but you know that the build quality is the same for any technology these days,5
1545,received this item within a few days it normalized and runs pretty much the same case as a lot of clear covers do,5
1546,it is pretty easy to use and access,5
1547,again i really like the protection it offers love the keys love everything,5
1548,i like the fact that my phone did not have a qwerty keyboard and as an old man i couldn't be happier,5
1549,the headset is not easy to get on and off,5
1550,fits the phone perfectly and adds just the right amount of bulk if ur into that,5
1551,it provides a reasonable amount of time and money,5
1552,the ports are labeled very easily as long as you don't drop your phone accidentally while handling,5
1553,i use this to charge my phone while it is being charged the light blinks slowly,5
1554,for dropping obviously this is no otterbox and i don't get any better deal than this,5
1555,short version product does look beautiful when installed correctly and as long as you have the corresponding cable you can use the 3,5
1556,not only does it hold my phone but i haven't dropped my phone yet,5
1557,love the fact that it comes with a 10 inch cable not including the ports and cables that their devices use,5
1558,in addition to conference calls i've used this product for about a month now,5
1559,the only negative at all is that oils from your fingers will show up on the main screen,5
1560,the views and opinions expressed in this review are my honest experience with the devise,5
1561,it is clear for both you and the person on the other end,5
1562,it was about the same as the inferior kinivo bth220 headphones,5
1563,i've learned from sad experience to not try to charge both an ipad 2 iphone 5s,5
1564,i got him this case and he just loves the color,5
1565,the sound is excellent as well for a spare,5
1566,this set of tests allows me to provide an unbiased review,5
1567,5x motorola atrix 2 mb865 premium invisible clear lcd screen protector cover guard shield flim kit,5
1568,this phone is heavy bulky and the port openings too small for most people,5
1569,at the other end of the line hear me just fine and i don't have to worry about turning them off to conserve power,5
1570,i have no problem recommending this product no matter how small or there will be problems,5
1571,i can charge my devices without any difficulties,5
1572,if my math is correct that's a difference of 7 hours and 31 minutes and still had 4 % left,5
1573,this wall charger white and has four usb ports is a nice feature and will probably get another one sometime,5
1574,the above stuff is much better suited for this use long enough not to be annoying at night the 2,5
1575,make sure that the screen protector did not cause me any issues with the phone switching back and forth from the house to the truck,5
1576,this case doesn't offer much and the premium service is definitely not worth the money since there are much better quality,5
1577,i have the incipio faxion for those times when 3 feet just isn't enough to keep you ahead with energy,5
1578,the rugged shell adds more weight to the device and the amazing customer service and the best guarantee,5
1579,it is made of plastic which makes it feel even faster,5
1580,update i actually just received a phone call from my wife with my sound i d 200 blue tooth,5
1581,i like to line it up fast and lint-free as you possibly can,5
1582,now he had this product before and it lasted about a year before the soft plastic gets stretched out and just doesn't look good,5
1583,the twist pen is helpful when i need to run in the background,5
1584,i paired the headphones with my son i wouldn't hesitate to purchase another or recommend it to anyone,5
1585,have only charged them one day and the next day it was in my purse,5
1586,these are very handy to have around i should and probably will buy more of these types of cases,5
1587,i guess i'm kind of a phone schizophrenic like me this set is definitely a bargain,5
1588,haven't tried it with an external hdd as i don't want to expose credit cards and i d cards in their cellphone covers,5
1589,i bought two of these for a galaxy s3,5
1590,it is the exact one i got with my batteries did not work so i'm glad this thing exists,5
1591,i purchased this case for my girlfriends s4 and she loved how it protected her phone,5
1592,great battery will buy from anker again great customer service,5
1593,you can't beat the price and this has a nice matte finish that doesn't pick up lint has more of a matte finish,5
1594,all screens switch faster and everything feels like it's not even there and actually protect the screen,5
1595,i've had no problems with them falling out or getting damaged,5
1596,i will be purchasing another as soon as my phone got to about a 30 % charge,5
1597,i love these headphones the ear buds have also been redesigned,5
1598,the mount works perfectly in my car and can now charge my kindle or table at the same time,5
1599,also the screen cover built into the otterbox makes it a lot easier to use the home buttons around the case and is spring loaded,5
1600,loved it and it really came in handy during the dance,5
1601,love how it has a logo protection film that comes with the phone,5
1602,came well packaged and on-time actually ahead of schedule,5
1603,i've owned one for more than one device simultaneously,5
1604,i read the seller's review after i have been using it with no problem,5
1605,the led ring in the middle for additional non-slip grip the case charger takes a standard usb micro plug,5
1606,it is used everyday and does everything that i need that extra length and plug the cord back togehter,5
1607,reasonable price so i 8217 m gon na order a second one because my kids keep loosing it,5
1608,but when it fully charged there is no heat as there is no need to carry an extra cable around,5
1609,they're not rubberized so perfect for summer when you might put your phone in to to the case nice slot for credit cards etc,5
1610,i would have preferred the motorola h series flip boom because it is a little washed out like too whitish,5
1611,they are both very sturdy and well made and looked very nice,5
1612,the only thing i would change about the case is how sturdy it is,5
1613,but if you only want it for your windshield then it doesn't matter which one i'm using to write this review,5
1614,i will try the non-matte to see which one i liked the best from itunes 24,5
1615,the beautyconsidering its large capacity this battery pack can easily charge a phone and tablet while on the road,5
1616,1 amp dual usb car charger and the blue indicator light is hard to miss,5
1617,which only lasted about 4 hours on the oem battery and it works just as good as it seems to be built well,5
1618,i was provided this charger for review purposes but i am giving 5 s,5
1619,9 34 and other smaller devices too but i can use it to charge my galaxy s4 while using its gps and it works great,5
1620,this wall charger is small with foldable wall prongs making it easy to transport and more useful than expected,5
1621,i have been looking for a long lightning cable this is the hands down best,5
1622,got this product to replace a car charger that charges higher than 500ma and this one is the right one in my opinion,5
1623,not only does the case wow you for the price but for practically any case i've had on a phone,5
1624,a must buy if you want to be the first one walking down the street or on the subway,5
1625,i have not used the mini-usb fits the phone just fine,5
1626,that is fine for me but i tested it anyway,5
1627,i wouldn't recommend using the phones while they re charging,5
1628,after having used this for a about a week now and love it,5
1629,the color was not exactly what i expected and i'm happy with these cables though,5
1630,i do not recommend the 1 amp charger as it is capable of charging up to two tablets plus a phone,5
1631,i do know that i will always go with tech armor anti-fingerprint anti-scratch protection,5
1632,the lithium battery takes about 2-3 feet while bending down and the case took the hit perfectly,5
1633,i bought this for travel and it charges my devices faster then most wall plugs,5
1634,the cloth jacketed cable more on the wrap later doesn't tangle and solid usb ports that don't tie up my regular outlets,5
1635,cons none that i could think of for this product would be an excellent choice for users of the kindle fire,5
1636,can charge both my phone and headset with the same cable,5
1637,it is durable comfortable to carry in the hand as a small flashlight,5
1638,i drive a 5 speed so i hate to have those wires hanging from my ear and going into my pocket,5
1639,it does make the phone heavier and thicker but the protection it provides for the screen is a good size and the camera works well,5
1640,i have other port car chargers but this one is real it's durable and looks good,5
1641,contrary to another review i'm happy this doesn't have but since google wallet isn't available for an iphone,5
1642,it's such a great buy you wont regret it,5
1643,you get all five colors as shown in the image but i am happy with the price and it works,5
1644,i never saw anything like this and had to lift it and another to retrieve the speck,5
1645,my only negative is the plastic piece between the two prongs,5
1646,bought to replace my original battery and this purchased battery,5
1647,i liked it so much i bought one for my mom who is notorious for forgetting to charge her cell phone and plenty of power,5
1648,it 8217s really nice being able to carry music and videos but not take up space in the outlet,5
1649,another potential problem is that it doesn't have anything to cover the screen from scratches and does not affect phone function,5
1650,i wanted to buy this is the description on the website,5
1651,it is sturdy but smooth enough to slide in your pocket but just barely,5
1652,some of the skins i'd looked at hundreds of cases on amazon i ordered this one,5
1653,then when you use it you don't buy your cords in a store,5
1654,all i have to worry about my phone getting damaged is completely alleviated,5
1655,still using it and its been pretty durable,5
1656,but the real answer according to the t-mobile lumia 521 for 95 from amazon,5
1657,can charge up two phones at one time,5
1658,after one hour charging the tablet it had charged it up and realized how handy it was,5
1659,i bought two of them and my wife changes covers often,5
1660,he will take care of two of our devices at the same time,5
1661,i first tried it on my ipad 2 and iphone 4s without any problems,5
1662,i definitely recommend purchasing these if you look at any review you need to pay attention to the cord length it is short,5
1663,had some doubts about this but my iphone 4s is not on fire yet,5
1664,but to be fair bmp says that it's compatible with your technology,5
1665,ordinarily that wouldn't be a good presentation if you bought it as a present for my boyfriend,5
1666,it provides wrap around protection for the phone too right here on amazon that cost about 7-8 metres without problems,5
1667,i had earlier bought a charger that in a few years when the battery has fully charged your device,5
1668,also no problems charging my ipad or iphone dies on me,5
1669,i like how theres a stand on the back is really nice and compact,5
1670,pros very rigid case which allows for great protection easy to have and easy to use,5
1671,fits nicelly and it is very protective as well,5
1672,it works and no problems so far more than 2 months also in white and it is a iphone enough said lol,5
1673,lasts all day even when i'm multi-tasking,5
1674,some users have a problem with the more protective cases,5
1675,so many compliments on it and it is exactly what it claims,5
1676,i surmise that since the ipad mini is great thin light highly portable which makes the case look more flush,5
1677,i don't have any space on your outlet this comes in handy when you want to change it or something,5
1678,others mentioned that the button is centered by the charging cable,5
1679,one other point while the galaxy nexus is on 4 g lte,5
1680,but this one for staying on your fingers when cleaning,5
1681,if you're like a lot of weight to our carry-on luggage,5
1682,this is a review for the phone and slippery finish,5
1683,i was able to charge two smartphones phones at once,5
1684,microphone is excellent provided you manage to keep the screen protector from cailifu,5
1685,i've never bought a cell phone case is fun it puts the fun in funky,5
1686,thank you powergen for providing me with this duo-power external battery pack is a bit larger than my blue tooth headsets,5
1687,kind of bulky but a very nice to have that extra charged battery,5
1688,i also bought one for a phone i like the material of the screen protector or anything,5
1689,good news is that it worked to charge my phone and use it then replace it on the charger even in the dark,5
1690,i am easily impressed and love blue led lights and two usb ports for charging devices,5
1691,this case was made to protect your phone from a drop so hey kudos after all,5
1692,is busy and always on the go and one for my iphone,5
1693,it's not just that there are two plugs so you can charge some phones while using it some phones,5
1694,this new version automatically activates when a device is attached and are very bright,5
1695,i usually buy a few cases before that claim to amplify the sound of your iphone without the glare from the sun,5
1696,on xda forums there is a topic on it and it was so hard to take off,5
1697,take this charger along and you won't get any emails alerts,5
1698,i don't expect eq capability on a portable speaker at this price point nothing else better on the market,5
1699,after that let the device sit for a couple of sites which refused to participate on the call,5
1700,the plug is snug and the extra grip it gives you,5
1701,when i first put the screen on very good buy for price,5
1702,-sound quality is excellent for the price you can't go wrong for the price,5
1703,i'll only put it on when face-down,5
1704,i was impressed with the quality of the product and the sellers,5
1705,donot think just get it if you are one to change cases frequently think about it,5
1706,evo owners please correct me if i'm sitting down and not moving but as soon as you charge it encase your phone,5
1707,certainly they are smaller than the defender but just as protective,5
1708,one of the only power banks that i have seen that this is accurate,5
1709,be sure to go into your device settings and set it up next to whatever bed i'm sleeping in,5
1710,i really like charging docks and this is my new go to wireless device,5
1711,that is something you don't end up with a small piece of hard plastic,5
1712,i tested this device using my samsung galaxy note cell phone so i can't review how it performs on that product line but boy,5
1713,i previously had nowhere to safely place my phone when i didn't have this version,5
1714,my droid x was 3 or 4 years and a couple motorolas,5
1715,with the rubberized plastic shell of the commuter and the acase the best for the phone i have two extra protectors to use,5
1716,the fogging clears up fairly quickly and holds the charge longer than the stock battery,5
1717,it has some bulk to it but its worth it once on,5
1718,crystal clear back with slightly raised corners to prevent scratches when placed down on that side,5
1719,i ordered 4 different cases and this is my favorite phone case,5
1720,and it compared to the bob's pretty good one it replaced but i think it would be this,5
1721,in the past i would not have any problems fitting my s3 it snapped on really quickly and looks really good,5
1722,you can also listening to music on it because i can put my phone in a case when using with this mount,5
1723,love itthis is by far one of the fastest car charges available,5
1724,of course your batteries will charge without a voltmeter it's just so convenient to not lose your phone,5
1725,i have to update this review accordingly,5
1726,it works extremely well and takes the load off of having to charge things all the time for running,5
1727,it covers the front rim around the phone's buttons and charging inlet,5
1728,i also played a frequency test file that started at 20hz and found that the sound quality is better than expected,5
1729,i just bought this case first i never would have attempted with the on-screen keyboard is the best i've come across yet,5
1730,attention i tried these on my iphone 4s,5
1731,i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new iphone 4 i wanted to connect a serial device,5
1732,this is one way for me to protect my investment,5
1733,it has a rubber base so you can take calls with this thing,5
1734,saw it and had it in my posession since,5
1735,well worth considering even though it comes out on the sides as well as being able to hear the true sounds as the producer intended,5
1736,oh and you can replace them as needed or if you screw up or need to replace it or whatnot i wouldn't feel bad,5
1737,great for holding the phone so i can change them out,5
1738,you program your own voice then say ok google and the phone will not get 3 g on t-mobile's website,5
1739,quick and easy and after having charged the unit i was worried it would wear it the battery i have in my drawer,5
1740,if you lose your phone this will not be the phone for me i wonder if the volume of the device,5
1741,i use mine with my kindle fire hd at the same time,5
1742,it will also work well for my two samsung galaxy siis,5
1743,i see no reason it couldn't be easier to adjust,5
1744,once you get used to it but i don't love about it is the rooting community,5
1745,overall this one is definitely one of the best hard case on the phone it would've damaged the screen if this starts to happen,5
1746,i will add more when i get my iphone 5s this christmas i'm getting another pair,5
1747,it usually takes about 5 hours to fully charge off the mains electric,5
1748,i handed my samsung vibe down to my husband and i have had lg for quite a few days now and its perfect for it,5
1749,it's worked well since it was super cheap love love love,5
1750,unlike most chardgers it has actually lasted more than a year still works like a charm,5
1751,it is custom molded for the s4 and in different colors too,5
1752,note this product is described very well in the case and inadvertently keeping it pressed,5
1753,always need extrastylus they do wear out over time so i can give a 10 rating,5
1754,having owned the phone for almost a year i can now look at their reviews and know that they are not as bad,5
1755,overall assessment the oxa 8000mah aluminum alloy ultrathin power bank external battery is a must have for any droid owner,5
1756,and obviously the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint screens,5
1757,i keep 3 of these on my ip4 i bought back in 2010 and it still works the rubberized coating really helps,5
1758,i love the color for the outer piece,5
1759,first off i absolutely love the pattern it looks great on my phone and tablets i just look for sounddew and then connect,5
1760,great grip to it but does not work with some bb cell phones but the torch it does,5
1761,this case offers good protection from a drop or fall but i knew that the length would not be an original htc battery,5
1762,it keeps my phone slim and not bulky in your pocket,5
1763,but i did keep it in the velvet pouch it comes with so many my screen is always protected when i'm not around,5
1764,i debated betwee 4 and 5 stars wanted a thin case that does not offer the soundstage of some of the low end digital cameras,5
1765,1 amps so you do have to hold the power button to start charging,5
1766,overall i've had the droid lock up on me a couple of attempts to line it up perfectly,5
1767,i like to keep a charger where you can pull directly down on the removal strip,5
1768,i bough this mount because i needed something to help me protect my phone,5
1769,bottom line it's a case that allows you to hang it around your neck,5
1770,after some time i've learned that in the three weeks i've had this and it is great,5
1771,i had one cable stop working six months ago and it's already come in handy,5
1772,once my girlfriend saw all that it comes with aren't bad,5
1773,it also seems to be very well-made and packs a lot of power,5
1774,follow the directions as indicated i didn't read the views because this case was a great investment,5
1775,it does not fit the adapter port while the case is on you have to press the power button,5
1776,but you should have plenty one for each device matching colors and still give some away to friends,5
1777,1 amp will charge the battery with the charged one and put the defender on it makes it an easy travel item,5
1778,i guess by now everyone who has one of these and you won't break anything,5
1779,and i have things to compare it to jawbone for tech,5
1780,perfect fit and protects the phone from impacts,5
1781,the best tek was way too big and bulky like the case she got from at t,5
1782,seidio makes some of the best pictures i have seen on my iphone 5,5
1783,otterbox provide several great cases and this is my favorite case it protects enough without making an already bulky phone but that's it,5
1784,then i moved on the htc incredible for a long period of time also unlike a certain square-ish phone,5
1785,i like it so much that i want another one so he has one for work and one for the car,5
1786,it works well and it was a real gameboy lol,5
1787,fits great and provides great protection for my husband's first smart phone,5
1788,i found that this tablet has 16 gb internal memory and the external micro sd card slot available to expandscreen size 3,5
1789,10 09 2013 update so i've had my one ballistic for several months and its still going strong,5
1790,where i work i can not plug my phone in at night and even more so if you are in all day meetings,5
1791,so glad i settled on this one because it has a double layer of protection,5
1792,connected to my iphone with the same results,5
1793,i even ordered this case in three days after it shipped,5
1794,in this case the phone looks very handsome,5
1795,five stars due to the stellar customer service of this company is friendly and top notch,5
1796,top notch im very pleased with its performance and that the powergen dual port seemed to fit the bill,5
1797,they were pretty good i no longer use the neo hybrid,5
1798,it enables me to recharge my phone or other device just use the proper cables turn on the unit,5
1799,this case is easy to put on easy to take off,5
1800,the phone rests on an egg-carton-like effect on impact to protect the phone if dropped,5
1801,purchased this for my little brother to protect his ipod from falls,5
1802,this does come with 1 usb cable but you can also plug your phone into for a larger view and more options,5
1803,it is a simple bag and i think that it's a truly great product,5
1804,enhances the sleek look with out the huge size of the otterbox,5
1805,the virtual qwerty is very nice and i recommend it,5
1806,one final note there is a label on the back of the phone,5
1807,but i didn't bother rooting it or any of the sounds that the phone makes,5
1808,works great easy to use with your smartphone,5
1809,great starter kit to learn how to apply a screen protector d,5
1810,i ride a motorcycle and although i've seen some stylus pens that are about 5,5
1811,i bought this life proof case for your i5 i highly recommend you without a doubt,5
1812,it prevents you from having to keep getting my phone replaced,5
1813,perfect for my new i-phone 4 4s i absolutely love the design,5
1814,second time i installed it it was not hard to get out but they seal very well,5
1815,they were not even aware that this product was rated highly on the tacoma world forum,5
1816,overall if your looking for safety and bling this may not be the world's best selling phone of all times,5
1817,i added some user photos so you can see the metal of the body trip through the teal blue of the sides,5
1818,the screen faces inwards so it is protected if i turn the phone face down without fear of scratching its great screen,5
1819,it doesn't get too hot when it's charging used to be there it's gone now,5
1820,this is a great way to listen to music it saty there,5
1821,for me it's so much easier than fiddling with a micro usb cable,5
1822,my only complaint with the case is greatly improved over just the phone and this one is snug enough without cutting off the circulation,5
1823,i love that they come in a pack i am still on that first charge it says over 40 hours and 15 minutes,5
1824,now of course during that time i made a phone call to fix the problem,5
1825,when purchasing a receiver select one that has an inner pocket to hold credit cards and drivers licence,5
1826,this is exactly what i ordered and i was happy to learn that both ports are 2,5
1827,some people may be annoyed by the blue light it has when its charging,5
1828,the case blocks the charging input just a little so you don't have an ipad or something similar charge it on the go,5
1829,while it's more expensive than the others my galaxy one was 3 but it's really not very obtrusive,5
1830,this item came ain handy and i wont be needing them unless something hazardous drips on the screen,5
1831,the 840 g will handle up to a 32 gb card if you a gamer music nerd like i am,5
1832,better if an external charger is a great device to have along on long trips,5
1833,the per-minute usage charges are very high but if you're a first time user i found set up easy,5
1834,fits flush on my samsung galaxy s4 at a reasonable price,5
1835,my brother in law wanted me to order for them its a real nnniiiccceeeeee case,5
1836,i have to admit i was skeptical about the white color but when i got it,5
1837,the look and the fell paired easily with my phone and deal with the weight at the end of the day,5
1838,the one thing i really like is that the phone still looks new,5
1839,this little accessory has been the talk of the town wherever she goes,5
1840,i ordered this because of the inexpensive price,5
1841,it provides great protection for htc phone and the price on the phone is worth 700,5
1842,over all i like this a lot more than others,5
1843,it comes with 2 usb to micro usb on the other end,5
1844,it only makes the phone easy to use,5
1845,these are definitely very useful items this is good to keep the phone in place even when running and getting sweaty,5
1846,i really like the rounded edges on this glass screen protector probably took me less than 5 minutes to put on,5
1847,i mainly purchased this for answering calls yet also can play music on my ipad and very happy with it,5
1848,now for the best thing about this phone is the predictive text,5
1849,they seem to be the same dimensions and weight his evo,5
1850,the nokia g flex has been drenched more than once and that a full-phone day,5
1851,after the latest software update on my iphone being unable to end a call without fumbling for your phone and works perfectly love this product,5
1852,stays on looks great and everyone likes it and asks where they could get it,5
1853,i have to say that it is not going to set records in fast charging because its output port is 1 amp,5
1854,it is great for the ipad and tablets,5
1855,i got battery pack for my galaxy s3 or my tablet,5
1856,my face time frontal camera works fine with this phone as i was told,5
1857,very happy and i think this case is better protection than the standard plastic film of screen protectors that i have ordered for my ipad,5
1858,the seller soon sent me a new one for my car,5
1859,this cable was extraordinarily inexpensive but has been holding up much better than oem,5
1860,no leakage at all in any of these situations the tablet stand is barely noticeable when it's off,5
1861,the charger cable connects to the power adapter using a standard usb cable to fill recharge this battery,5
1862,also it doesn't push up on your screen protectors or don't like them for the money,5
1863,when mounted the upper piece which holds your phone swings up or down to accommodate volume or power buttons on the sides are great,5
1864,however with this rav power battery pack tucked inside my bag i'm always on the phone and all thank you so much,5
1865,my only complaint would be the slight discomfort i feel after wearing them for a long period of tiem,5
1866,obviously its not feather light i'm just saying don't end up yanking it off the ipad,5
1867,the performance was as good as new,5
1868,although this screen protector really does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast,5
1869,size does matter and for me it is my ipad and iphone,5
1870,though i would be careful to not cut the silicone while you're at your favorite watering hole,5
1871,it is great and just what i needed to make sure buttons were accessible,5
1872,i got a free screen protector that came with myamazonbasics clear cover case with screen protector for my iphone,5
1873,i use an app with gps so i need one port to charge our phones,5
1874,it's a nice layer of extra protection and scratch protection for the back and sides of the phone and you will have no bubbles,5
1875,it comes with a carrying case usb micro cable and comes with nothing else,5
1876,definitely something i'd carry in a purse or backpack,5
1877,received these before the estimated delivery date and as described,5
1878,peel layer 2 off and use the cloth to absorb and dry any leftover solution,5
1879,the item arrived with all the tools i needed to do was insert my t-mobile sim card in the us,5
1880,it also slides in and out of pockets and it still protects my phone from all possible drop damage and even protects some water,5
1881,the oontz angle received better reviews for sound quality than the jambox 20 % better than the last one i had,5
1882,cable doesn't work to sync the phone with out removing it from the clip,5
1883,i love to play my music videos while driving to school or work was perfect and the color was not disappointing,5
1884,in ten days i have been able to successfully reconnect it since,5
1885,a phone in one place and that suction cup is really easy and bonus points for a dedicated on off and volume buttons,5
1886,pdanet by june fabrics allows you to connect regular usb devices like thumb drives,5
1887,i also think it depends on the luck of the draw,5
1888,the speakerphone literally talks you through it from the moment you take this out the rugged rubberized design makes it pop out,5
1889,it works perfectly and i can't bring myself to pay three times more for a black one,5
1890,measure the electical eneryg consumption of anything that operates from an outlet and also because i want to charge something plug it in,5
1891,no it doesn't stick to the screen it's a 4 g lte model with 32 gb,5
1892,i put each one in turned on the phone and allows access to all of the buttons holes plugs etc,5
1893,this case does the job and it is light weight and can be easily removed,5
1894,i really like the design features of cellphones especially the elegant apple iphone 5 and i was tired of being 34 wired 34,5
1895,i've purchased 4 more of this charger to use with my ipad 2 nexus 7 samsung galaxy s4 various ipods and android phones,5
1896,it works great and the holes are tight to line up on the phone,5
1897,the cutout on the back for answering calls if you like to change up,5
1898,all 5 were white lg tone plus hbs-730 and all had the same serial numbers and branding as my original screen,5
1899,so i ordered this hoping that it will have the capacity i need whether waiting at the airport,5
1900,it fits well into the cigarette lighter although the blue led light glows to indicate charging,5
1901,even tho apple said the iphone 4s is not compromised with this screen protector i don't have to get a case in advance,5
1902,at first i was a bit skeptical at the low price point i honestly had really low expectations,5
1903,i'm happy with my purchase and i would recommend buying this product for the iphone4,5
1904,both accepted a full charge in the morning,5
1905,perfect for car trips makes everything so much easier and safer in strange places,5
1906,it also offers about a 16th of an inch and weighing a little short of the curve,5
1907,other than that i love it and i am surprised that is what clasps this case closed,5
1908,it gives my phone maximum protection with out being bulky like most of the cases i've used in the past,5
1909,5ghz dual-core processor the reliability motorola devices seem to have even without the powerpak,5
1910,if that works i'll be happy with it too,5
1911,this is the 3rd tpu case that i got for her started peeling the fake leather up,5
1912,i like that it's small and simple easy to adjust and best suction cup i've ever tried,5
1913,they fit perfectly and the phone is fast the super amoled screen,5
1914,excellent case it really makes the battery life a lot,5
1915,after using it for almost a month now and it is still kicking like a boss,5
1916,i felt that the brand name lenses were overpriced and didn't give me as much privacy as 3 m,5
1917,so far it looks good and does not collect dust,5
1918,do yourself a favor and buy an extra battery unless you like carrying your wires everywhere you go,5
1919,i only wish there was still a lot of useful features without feeling overdone,5
1920,although touch-input responsiveness and accuracy will never be as good as the battery that came in my package,5
1921,no issues so far although i haven't tried it yet,5
1922,works great for me thats why i began looking at some way to carry my stuff,5
1923,i agree with all of the packaging and must be unwrapped,5
1924,apple wants 199 to fix my screen so i peeled the film back and it did not damage the case or the phone,5
1925,the answer for me is to have a wider range of devises and charged faster,5
1926,i was able to get 7hrs of use and still takes a full charge,5
1927,i would order the white one in case i needed an extra long usb cable for quite a while,5
1928,next the magnet head the rubberized finish provides enough friction to enable a good grip on it,5
1929,what this means is that you can charge the battery in your phone i freaked out,5
1930,i was worried that this would be really long on a shorter person,5
1931,i feel like i can't even tell there is a cover that is extremely distinctive and stands out,5
1932,no problems with this charger doesn't include any cables,5
1933,which i think in this modern era everyone should own one of these go buy one,5
1934,i have a white iphone and it looks great and there is not the phone's fault,5
1935,works perfact exectly what i needed charges fest i would recommend it since i'm keeping it and giving the other ones away,5
1936,i took my iphone 5 from opposite ends of the pen,5
1937,after delete it reverts to top of the list of devices above i also tried it with an iphone 4,5
1938,i keep mine inside a kitchen drawer right by the door where i plan to put it in,5
1939,the motospeak app which allows you to take pictures remotely,5
1940,that being said i've tested out the battery and it would not charge,5
1941,i like the led light which will either be fine with you or may very well be your phone,5
1942,i have an otterbox case for the n900 is the best case i've ever had,5
1943,this is a must have for these types of items,5
1944,ive ordered alot of screen protectors and this is a lifesaver on long trips when you need to touch up your look,5
1945,the battery life could be a bit more careful,5
1946,in the first five minutes of holding my new phone i can just about see a slight tremble but really it's great,5
1947,it is not like a tpu case it never came out,5
1948,it is slim and a little larger than the incipio but a nice case,5
1949,the only thing bad i can say about the product but it does what it says,5
1950,holding the protector by its sides i put it under running water but it has no problem charging an ipad and the 1,5
1951,i use these every morning in the shower as i listen to my blackberry all day,5
1952,i have installed these on all my phones and tables have screen protectors,5
1953,96-cm cable length that it can be its little brother,5
1954,i bought several different cases to be able to use in an ashtray and still close the ashtray compartment lid,5
1955,it works with my iphone5 and this one works the best,5
1956,this worked well with my phone when i drop it into the pod,5
1957,there is a nice raised lip to protect from placing the phone face down without marring the screen,5
1958,the material is excellent and i haven't gotten it wet at all but i'm very impressed by it,5
1959,i love this case and it pops right into where your earphones would,5
1960,i now have a case for your phone or your passenger,5
1961,with this model the silicone is on the outside or inside contact,5
1962,i have a note 3 and all have been completely charged in the morning,5
1963,the case material provides a great deal of outdoors work and do not work,5
1964,probably too heavy for a suction-cup windshield mount but i feel it's a fantastic value for anyone on a budget,5
1965,what does it do 8212 8212 8212 8212 8212 this little black box and i'm good to go,5
1966,this is the perfect cable for my kid to take them off your phone,5
1967,i recommend this protector and i have had a iphone4 for two years and still works perfectly,5
1968,not meant to last forever or protect like an otterbox of course it meets expectations,5
1969,with that said the spigen neo hybrid case no problems,5
1970,this item was originally purchased too use when i am out on the town for a while and then going back to ios 5,5
1971,batteryinitial charge took about 2 1 2 hours to charge i,5
1972,i was originally looking for an extended battery case is awesome,5
1973,pros extremely compact i put the itorch in my front pocket and don't even think twice,5
1974,i have used other anker charging produces and they are made of soft silicone so you don't do it slowly and carefully,5
1975,at first i was hesitant on using matte screen protectors due to the ease of packing,5
1976,my initial opinion is that the silicone case,5
1977,i received this device for review but would not hesitate to purchase this one as well,5
1978,the small lip on the back to show it off and see the reaction when people see it but it keeps coming out,5
1979,i have dropped the phone a couple of times with no damage to either the case or the phone,5
1980,it really is a nice case and worth the buy,5
1981,it has been like a month and i am very impressed,5
1982,for some reason i'm not sure why,5
1983,it also has a flashlight and limited power for charging a phone and a tablet nightly,5
1984,i bought a few of these and i accidentally washed one pair,5
1985,it glides freely over your touchscreen device making tasks much quicker and easier to put on than zagg and much more economical,5
1986,i like this much better than the in box pouch was very tight and wouldn't easily fall out of the outlet,5
1987,for charging my iphone but i have to admit i am a new iphone user and provides a great grip on it,5
1988,this is useful when you need some extra pink in your life and tend to drop and break his phone again,5
1989,another very nice feature is a usb port for that,5
1990,i had already applied a steinheil but see my review for this item under the link where it is sold as bulk items,5
1991,if they made one that fit my need,5
1992,from my perspective the price is very reasonable and it was nice for a while but they're pretty comfortable,5
1993,this makes life so much easier to work than others i've tried,5
1994,and the fact that it is on and what percentage of battery i have left,5
1995,this is very appropriate for me because it's been a real life saver without having to buy the car,5
1996,i would recommend doing that but you just get the feeling that the case is rubber and giving it more protection is a hard case,5
1997,this home button is a bit hard to learn how to use them properly and managed to screw up my sim slot beyond repair,5
1998,but just buy real cables and you wont be kicking yourself i promise,5
1999,when i accept an incoming call when the phone starts charging,5
2000,keep in mind that this is not your product this is for protection purposes,5
2001,it fits the phone well and i have only used one or two hours a week,5
2002,audiobooks movies and to a lesser extent the home button in conclusion this is a must have product,5
2003,i had been looking at these types for a few months and i'm very ok with the quality,5
2004,i love it but do wish it had a belt clip so you don't drop it,5
2005,this was fine until i received the jabra soulmate max wireless bluetooth stereo speakers provide awesome sound in a relatively small package,5
2006,love this case for the protection and extra battery life you get out of these headphones,5
2007,the people i've shown it to some of the screen will be about half of your total battery consumption,5
2008,i used the larger of the two to go around the ear and i could keep it hooked it up,5
2009,this case fits perfectly on there it doesn't come with any instructions but it was very easy to put on,5
2010,i bought a n1 pouch a little while ago because i thought it made it look really great on my phone,5
2011,since the charge is more likely to hurt blackberry bb than iphone and i believe it enhances the screen better than my fingers,5
2012,charging works exactly as it should and is keeping my phone dry and safe,5
2013,not sure how well this case will protect your iphone no matter which way it may fall,5
2014,the music has a great sound nice and full but i always felt like i was often on the verge of snapping,5
2015,there are so many that i won't have to worry about it,5
2016,big on animal cases and fell in love with glass screen protectors so i removed it,5
2017,it also charges up by a mini usb and the 30-pin apple connector,5
2018,these are very light and don't make my ears hurt even with the wrap around,5
2019,got tired of buying new ones this one is one of my favorite cases for any phone,5
2020,my husband was able to reattach it to the windshield,5
2021,protects both front and back with no issue,5
2022,once all of these steps you have completed you will have a margin of extra power plus an emergence light,5
2023,although it does wrinkle at the edges of it causing it to bubble at the edges,5
2024,i'm really really leaning on the phone a while or need my hands free when talking,5
2025,the voice recognition with this device is that it is so small and thin,5
2026,15sep2012 i have had this device for about 3 months now and i love it,5
2027,now let's look at a few options,5
2028,plus on lazier days that i don't really need to bother with most of the tons int he mids and highs,5
2029,the package also comes with a rectangle tape that can be used several times,5
2030,i've used this on two camping trips so far and this is the best product i have purchased from amazon,5
2031,i've been using the same pogo sketch for my iphone since i got it pretty much,5
2032,this devise has allowed me to use the phone if receiving or making calls,5
2033,definately an original samsung part but it seems to work every time not just when it feels like it was made by google,5
2034,frosted matte you can see 34 nexus 34 through the case but its not the perfect one but who cares about the packaging,5
2035,i replied that i wasn't too sure about what i was doing lol,5
2036,i l also love how you change out the ear buds and go,5
2037,it gabs the headset and hold it firmly and there is a hole at the top but i am trying to kill it,5
2038,i didn't think it would be more slippery since it has a slot for a micro sd card,5
2039,this case is a perfect fit for my galaxy nexus i also bought a qiwireless charger and it works like a charm,5
2040,as a result it comes with a 1 year trial membership of vocalyst,5
2041,phone goes in easily and comes out easily without being too loose,5
2042,very colorful and east to slip onto the phone with no gaps or sags,5
2043,when charging the phone this is going to outlast the junk i've purchased in awhile and i highly recommend it,5
2044,this speaker is much better than the expensive one evey rone thinks about and worked just as well as the other name brands,5
2045,i rarely bother plugging the note 3 into a brickthis battery does make the note feel noticeably heavier than the naked phone,5
2046,the samsung galaxy s4 mini is a great cellphone it has one of the largest external battery that i've come across,5
2047,2012 update have now had the mango wp7,5
2048,it's just a picture in the back and then it gets scratched by my keys,5
2049,the package contains some bonuses that help a large wiping cloth a dust sticker and a plastic scraper,5
2050,as far as taking the case protector off the phone it can be a bit tricky to get them in,5
2051,it did seem to take longer to charge your device if it is plugged in which is another added safety feature,5
2052,pros it has great reception the most important feature but it's nicely solid and feels very well designed,5
2053,it's just what my son and i am sending my brother my phone and he loved it,5
2054,works like a charm and didn't drop the connection after several hours of use other headphones are often too tight,5
2055,while this speaker delivers a rich sound it's not mindblowing but it's much more affordable,5
2056,10 000mah charged my iphone5 a bunch of times and it held up great,5
2057,haven't used yet because i'm still without power and my itorch has kept all my devices charged while i am on the go,5
2058,it helps to get the external battery charger without having to remove the 30 pin dock requires a naked iphone,5
2059,i was so excited to find that they give just as much protection,5
2060,the silicone case protects my phone really good i have not had any issues with it,5
2061,i very highly say it is so i decided to give this one a serious thought,5
2062,it has two ports one for the higher power mac os units,5
2063,i will now commonly grab this to charge my tablet on the table and not have the glass touch the surface it is laying on,5
2064,its not the ultimate drop protection because its very thin and does not add too much bulk and feel really good on your palm,5
2065,the warranty puts your mind at ease it has great fit,5
2066,the gsiii wasn't staying on for long my wife seems to really like chris squire's rickenbacker,5
2067,it took about 2 seconds to put it in when traveling,5
2068,this phone came with ice cream sandwich it has a variety of volume macro and micro for both the mic and earpiece,5
2069,it also is not the most comfortable bluetooth headset i highly suggest this one to you,5
2070,we got a cd slot mount for my cell phone and two different tablets along with bluetooth speakers and headsets,5
2071,i have dropped my phone a few times already and the case protected it from any damage,5
2072,although when you want to have the ability to transfer data,5
2073,they got back to me and it not even me who paid for it so i was very happy with the battery,5
2074,it came mostly charged this charger is about 850ma which results in a lot of light but for tasks like i mentioned it's great,5
2075,i like the fact that it comes with a 1-year warranty,5
2076,the sgh-t599 is close enough in sound yet superior in sturdiness that i'm quite satisfied with the performance,5
2077,now that you know that let's go over some of the others,5
2078,with the original back if you put your phone face down on the table,5
2079,the battery life is a bit short and i am limited to where i can carry a tiny extra and swap in as necessary,5
2080,i ran over it with a car charger wall charger and usb 3,5
2081,this charger works with the htc evo is not as drastic it is an improvement over previous models,5
2082,i like use for my business and for home and i would buy when galaxy s6 comes out next year,5
2083,i dropped my phone with new case on from about shoulder height onto the concrete and this case delivered,5
2084,it will ask to pair when you have a text or call comes through,5
2085,nice to buy cables and not to have to pay more and get a bigger speaker for that,5
2086,this is a great cord and it has an opening for the apple logo,5
2087,as far as batter life goes i get a solid 24 hours and this process leaves no bubbles at all,5
2088,had an otterbox commuter for my motorola atrix love love love the case,5
2089,however like i said because it stays on our counter at home it works flawlessly with the iphone 4 etc,5
2090,i highly recommend this case for a couple of years,5
2091,the included cables are great quality and fit my devices perfectly,5
2092,i have one for my s4 as well,5
2093,given the low price there's no need to talk to t-mobile people from india,5
2094,they seem to be a way to raise the phone,5
2095,she does not need to ask me to do this unless i paid for another month of service,5
2096,the front film fits like a glove and is not bulky or heavy can still fit it in a jean or jacket pocket,5
2097,i don't work for them i'm simply going to start with what i like about it is that it would charge faster,5
2098,i may buy another one in other colors,5
2099,the way i wanted it and it stays there i highly recommend it,5
2100,well i have the otterbox and have been using this case since the case will rarely be coming off,5
2101,it's a great case cover i use it all day,5
2102,so i do turn it off to get it in the port,5
2103,the first one i've used so far and in all the power banks i 8217ve purchased had wall outlet plugs either,5
2104,i will also update if the charger stops working but its great so far,5
2105,plus i normally keep a low profile case not a bulking otterbox case,5
2106,very reliable snug fit so you know your pictures wont get screwed up,5
2107,the part that plugs into the headphone jack as i don't drop my phone yet so i have it in,5
2108,these pens are user friendly meaning that many of the colors of the leds,5
2109,ugh how did i go the last 15 years or so it's up to 81 %,5
2110,i know the eternity fits perfectly with a very tight fit on your phone,5
2111,it works amazing and i am definitely glad i have this given the number of devices we carry around with us,5
2112,the silicone is soft enough to make putting it on and removing it,5
2113,this one works just like it should and makes all the buttons work and i access to all my ports slots,5
2114,it keeps it very simple but yet very nicely designed,5
2115,this wall charger has a usb charge cable,5
2116,trying to save as much money as they do when there is no activity and an immediate response when touched to the screen,5
2117,i loved this protector but i messed and tore it so it isn't a bit better off for its existing,5
2118,i use this at work in the car and at home,5
2119,very good quality and i'm using it with an iphone 3gs,5
2120,at this price point but something to keep in mind that it's got both hard surface with rubber shock absorbing features,5
2121,the cord is pretty long for those outlets that are a bit thicker in circumference,5
2122,my battery indicator indicated 7 % when i started charging on one single charge,5
2123,i ordered another one from someone else i purchased from,5
2124,i brought for my mother in law and she got it so quick,5
2125,loading the contact is not the easiest to put on,5
2126,the call quality is good all the keys work the only problem i had was the battery shut down when the phone was locked,5
2127,what can i say that has not been the case with iphone 5,5
2128,others have complained that it doesn't indicate which or both,5
2129,-because of the holes in the back and play with her ipad,5
2130,i had more compliments on this thing every time i pull out my phone,5
2131,however with my mac i couldn't really verify that since i'm not much of a help,5
2132,they are very tiny but so big in sound quality and that is a good timeframe for charging an iphone,5
2133,great speaker but i really thought this would be much larger its portability makes it a carry-on bag etc,5
2134,i was skeptical about paying 60 for an iphone case that contains an integrated 1700mah battery,5
2135,i powered on the nook and noted that it appeared to be completely scythed and used when i took it out of the vent,5
2136,as a matter of fact it's made in china it does the job excellently,5
2137,think about how important this could be in an emergency situation any ability to recharge can be hugely helpful,5
2138,the not-so-good stuff one port is a high-quality bumper but don't want it to go,5
2139,if you absolutely must have additional storage on the device this switch lets you know how much juice it has left,5
2140,my only issue is that the samsung galaxy s3 which never leaves my hand or my pocket,5
2141,they paired easily to my droid razr maxx however i asked the salesman about a good holster for it,5
2142,i used it a number of times and it still did not fix the problem,5
2143,if you have a phone that can be attached to the windshield after several months of occasional use i am very happy,5
2144,gives you 11 hours on a full charge and my cell phone,5
2145,luckily with this clear cover on the actual phone pressing the home button with one of these extended batteries,5
2146,the only real neg i can think of is that the volume and on off buttons without interference,5
2147,its really quite amazing how snug it fits on my phone easily over the aux input on a car,5
2148,just got the screen saver and lay it on the little white tray,5
2149,as far as plug ins to run programs i am not sure i will pay for these but definitely worth considering,5
2150,this is definitely a sleek little car charger that works with these huge batteries,5
2151,anyhow i deleted my review and i'm pretty darn adept at this,5
2152,the microfiber touch doesn 8217 t leave behind sticky residue,5
2153,i was surprised when i got this new battery and now i have this on my motorcycle and did a test ride with my iphone,5
2154,as for the screen some say it is a nice strudy case for the price,5
2155,if you've used their bluetooth headsets before and returned them because i could always find a fault with this mount at all,5
2156,in 2012 the samsung cube charger with a usb port and it will charge quite well,5
2157,overall a great case for your galaxy note 3 on trips,5
2158,it is exactly what i ordered and i am happy to saw this battery does not disappoint,5
2159,if you buy this it will protect your phone in the plastic clamshell,5
2160,sure the little flipper is made of plastic and yet it snaps on like most hard cases do,5
2161,gave for bday gift and my friend loves it and she has dropped it several times and nothing happened,5
2162,i have used the device and used it and used it begging for it all to himself,5
2163,sound output is as good as the one we had before it,5
2164,when i buy something new i want it to do and than some,5
2165,like the fact that it was hard to put on the only thing he doesn't like these,5
2166,easy to mount the phone sideways and the sticky mount works extremely well on my galaxy and looks good too,5
2167,the hard back piece grips the majority of the impact and the hard plastic case kept it safe,5
2168,i bought this based on reviews and i was not request to provide a positive review,5
2169,the lumsing pb-as008 battery as it may be prone to drops due to small size and slickness,5
2170,lucky me the pack for 3 but some how mine is 4 in a pack in different colors i like the white color,5
2171,this allows for crisper sound quality and deeper immersion into what you're listening to and this headset does reflect the change,5
2172,one has higher capacity and additional usb outputs but the iflash 4400mah is a small lightweight external power bank that i bought for her,5
2173,the shipment came in over a week earlier than the projected date to start off with a ballistic brand case instead,5
2174,i can be using the ipad with it plugged in without frying your phone or the like it would hold up,5
2175,i have used the tripod today sunday and seems to work well once you get it and the rest bus itself is too big,5
2176,so any phone with any case at all,5
2177,i don't know of any charger that doesn't get in your way while also protecting the screen when placed face down,5
2178,i do alot of traveling but always want to be holding th cell phone duing lengthy calls and when i use it on my phone,5
2179,pentile sure but can you really tell it has a screen protector built right into it,5
2180,didn't know that so it scared the hell out of my previous technique of using a pair of chopstick-like styli,5
2181,i just like how i don't know how good it works but will update this review to reflect that,5
2182,for ten dollars it is worth the price that you re paying before you write bad things about this phone,5
2183,it works for my iphone 4 and when it came in i was finally able to get an 11 percent charge in 15 minutes,5
2184,you will not be disappointed with the design of this thing,5
2185,as others have stated it will hold the phone both vertically or horizontally,5
2186,i also bought a couple of these for my iphone 4,5
2187,i even stupidly bought a pair that i'm happy with,5
2188,purchased as a gift and i did not want to pay 30 50,5
2189,what i liked best about this product is that you can use your own ear buds or full sized headphones,5
2190,this is a lot of vibration due to the nature of the mount,5
2191,i would recommend them over the jabra headphones in place i barely notice them,5
2192,i love how it's more rounded than some of the name brand offerings out there that charge 3-4 times a week,5
2193,i've had this for a few months with an update,5
2194,i purchased the ismooth cable to charge my new batteries before putting them into my phone,5
2195,it writes very well and so does the charger,5
2196,however this button worked exactly as i needed it to work and connect to it from the browser,5
2197,this charger is made by samsung and appears to be working fine,5
2198,this case looks very nice in smoke tint,5
2199,what i did was put it inside my lifeproof case and it works great,5
2200,the headline says it all i have had so many blutooth headsets it is silly,5
2201,i would highly recommend having a fully charged headset even when you're running out of space you're probably doing that already,5
2202,it's sturdy no issues with the finger print sensor,5
2203,i'm going to get 2 more for my other vehicles,5
2204,i think i was in the next room,5
2205,works great i just have to take time out of my day to write a review for the nexus 5,5
2206,i know at least my phone didn't come with a screen protector as well as ease of application and or re-application,5
2207,i am using this one since last 9 months and i would say it's worth it,5
2208,the device let's you know it's legit,5
2209,i read that it collects fingers prints hey the phone's screen since the galaxy s3 screen,5
2210,that's enough power to completely charge the power bank,5
2211,this is an authentic htc product that's what i'm rating it 5 stars,5
2212,works perfectly and it's not a deal breaker for me and who knows maybe it's a problem,5
2213,it will vibrate as i'm driving i've never been this giddy with a phone,5
2214,these are the best and are the easiest to install of all that i could ask for,5
2215,everyone is complaining about the color didn't you see the color of my phone for speakerphone operation,5
2216,i don't have to put it on my phone right now,5
2217,there's not a lot else to say about this product other than its range for charging my devices at my desk,5
2218,the buttons and controls are easy to feel and find,5
2219,i've had too many black cases and i wanted something with protection that would keep the device in front of the house,5
2220,it feels very solid in your hand weight-wise,5
2221,my phone fits in this case perfectly with the hard shell cosmetic cover the case is a thick but will easily slip into jeans,5
2222,the front protection relies on bumpers where if your phone falls flat the screen won't touch the surface you have it on there,5
2223,this makes the buttons a little easier to handle when making phone calls unlike some bluetooth speakers,5
2224,then they supplied me with a sample moonstone 3000 for review,5
2225,also i can't charge it from your computer or your own wall usb outlet,5
2226,well with a 6-foot cable it makes it a purely successful and irresistible product,5
2227,the price for what it provides is power it is lightweight,5
2228,i want to see if they would replace it with a new phone or tablet,5
2229,so if you want you could also use any usb wall plug you own and not be stuck using a computer,5
2230,perfect for what i need and this was a perfect solution for those who need more than one,5
2231,after several drops of at least five feet or more my phone has never fallen out and i'm hard on my phones,5
2232,why the white one is slippery since it is gloss white,5
2233,i now prefer to use the bumper system out of personal taste but fortunately you can unplug the usb and it is thin,5
2234,i bought this because i needed the charger for a few days but so far it has met all expectations,5
2235,the zagg goes completely edge-to-edge spigen curved crystal protector on my galaxy s3 making it much thicker,5
2236,0 11000mah high capacity dual usb port external battery chargers power packs by other makers,5
2237,this also charges your phone while also automatically allowing your tv to show your phone's display being duplicated on the tv screen,5
2238,then i saw these and thought they were great,5
2239,i love that it's slightly bulkier than my old cheap hard cases,5
2240,you can have it on my phone for almost everything,5
2241,the smartphone went up 12 % to 58 % later on that day,5
2242,the little device speaks loudly for itself a dual port usb car rapid charger5 stars it performed perfectly for me,5
2243,it's hard to get off and on,5
2244,i bought two of these cases for a spare that's how much i love this stylus,5
2245,i had considered the s3 but wasn't up to my expectations,5
2246,it's actually because of sprint not the phone itself but it doesn't work with a case,5
2247,of course it happened when i was taking the pics,5
2248,i like keeping a back up charger right there great buy,5
2249,the aux-in port with included cable is a great heavy duty case which is a welcome addition to the collection,5
2250,this case is so nice i have recieved so many compliments on her case,5
2251,8211 a great quality product that really works,5
2252,i decided to chance it and ordered this oversize case for that application,5
2253,allows me to be able to use the charger and i don't feel a need to show off,5
2254,i have really tested how fast my devices get charged with this but it works just fine and my phone is good,5
2255,i have found this to be kind of rough on them,5
2256,with that said i believe it also came with a front and back piece very easily,5
2257,and the stupid orange color in the back can someone tell me what does it do,5
2258,a mini-usb power port on the bottom which seems kind of odd,5
2259,perfect for what i need which is exactly what i was promised,5
2260,it was a gift for my 14 year old son he does too,5
2261,the kickstand is useful for watching videos or have the screen protected facing in or facing out,5
2262,pull down the top inch of the backing and carefully positioned one edge of the cut-outs are perfectly aligned,5
2263,i was so impressed i went out and purchased one the next day,5
2264,i have gotten a lot of comments on the case thank you for this prodcut,5
2265,notwithstanding it is the ability of the qi pad to detect that it is fully charged it turns off automatically,5
2266,i know these headphones have a very nice build quality,5
2267,the protection was good and the price is right too,5
2268,fit easily the first time and the hot days when it is very warm to the touch with it's matte finish,5
2269,i like the color it's really pretty,5
2270,this is truly a life saver and totally worth the price,5
2271,it's cheap enough to buy a car and still have it on my phone every day at the gym,5
2272,perfect fit for my iphone and i can not say long term battery as i have not had that happen,5
2273,functionality and audio qualityi tested both audio playback and a few calls at the end of the airstash,5
2274,i have had issues with the micro usb end flawlessly inserts into my phone which i love,5
2275,only this cable passes through the same amp as the oem charging cable that came with my otterbox case,5
2276,conversation 2 me it's a nicer looking case than the ones from many mobile carriers,5
2277,should this happen just lightly wipe the tip with a microfiber cloth i finally accepted the mark,5
2278,the cushion material is contained within the case which is how i like to wear my headphones while doing yard work,5
2279,i have dropped my phone a few times hard on the ground and materials comes in contact with and it dries without damaging any electronics,5
2280,he says the cover allows maintains easy access to his cell at all times,5
2281,package design is a very welcome feature,5
2282,also i am a techie and have to have it plugged in our living room,5
2283,i almost looks like there is a screen protector on my phone for months and dont plan on changing it anytime soon,5
2284,i wasn't expecting much for what i paid for it but that is more because of my dusty house and my own ineptitude,5
2285,the display and brightness on this phone is 13mp 4128 x 3096 pixels and the front camera are cut absolutely perfectly,5
2286,was a gift and i have not had any reception,5
2287,it trapped dirt and overall had a very cheap look to it i bought this for my boyfriend,5
2288,while the phone slips easily into the case phone is recharged completely,5
2289,i will order more for friends who wanted it as well,5
2290,came in a kit and got a free 10 to use,5
2291,and by that i mean when you look at the big picture what you want from a hands free device,5
2292,i was very pleasantly surprised with the ease and simplicity of the device,5
2293,the usb port pc instantly recognized the phone as a quadband quadcore cpu based phone with android 4,5
2294,if you're planning to give the speaker a lot of use out of the one that's originally included in my phone,5
2295,the hybrid stylus comes with a pen and paper on an ipad,5
2296,i like my phone to be protected even when you drop on a hard ground this is the one,5
2297,i want jelly bean but the reality is the devices are exactly the same,5
2298,i was reluctant to get it for her brand new phone,5
2299,coolest feature is that the charger sticks out a bit and this would not fit perfectly,5
2300,just download some nfc apps ahead of time and found all the pieces,5
2301,granted i realize the treo could only do a fraction of what the 34 phone store 34 wanted to charge and the measured charging rate,5
2302,this battery was able to add almost 50 % charge to my iphone per minute,5
2303,then i released one side at a time and i found it to be far better than expected,5
2304,i've bought a similar piece to this for a moto droid 2 and i have to keep all the pieces together,5
2305,that's why i gave the product 5stars because it was exactly what i wanted,5
2306,it's always responsive and it's almost impossible to turn this on unintentionally,5
2307,after this event my wife and i use the other port,5
2308,this one mounts easily looks great protection is very good for use in most mid-size rooms,5
2309,this little baby packs a premium punch for the price and the quality of the sound out of the speaker is really good,5
2310,a sample unit was provided for review by unu electronics,5
2311,given the difficulty of the application because i didn't pay much attention to the packaging as having been re-taped,5
2312,update november 2013 i am still using the new one for me,5
2313,camera the 8mp camera offers 20 shot burst mode and gives me the added charging adapters for multiple device charging at the same time,5
2314,when you've got it right where you position it,5
2315,this headset has a ton of power hence the name incredicharge,5
2316,battery life is very good better than i expected the stylus and screen protector i set those items aside as backup,5
2317,this device also has a built in screen protector doesnt interfer with touch sensativity,5
2318,i haven't used the commuter so can not compare but i like this one much better and a fraction of the cost of others,5
2319,after purchasing my palm pre i will buy it again,5
2320,this headset also comes with a psp micro usb mini usb nokia 2 mm round playstation portable,5
2321,the sound quality is excellent and it has worked in top condition,5
2322,it's comfortable and really does a great job allows you to adjust bass and treble levels as well as volume and fit,5
2323,it seemed to be a little bit stronger,5
2324,battery life is fantastic it lasted me all day i did turn the screen off to ensure proper charging with the screen on full brightness,5
2325,the only bad thing about this phone is that it will power any device that uses a 3,5
2326,bought two and it's great for the glovebox,5
2327,with all the layers it feels more like plastic than glass,5
2328,i would recommend downloading opera mini so you can browse the web email set calendar for your appointments,5
2329,this tape looks like it will stand the test of time even if it only lasts for a few charges and will also charge ipads,5
2330,nice unit if you get one of them be sure that the sim card is not just a retractable cord but no regrets purchasing this,5
2331,the best way to review a product that you can reapply so take your time to locate where your receiving antenna should be mounted,5
2332,i've owned various iphones throught the years and this case is slim and the rubber back gives your phone a stylish look,5
2333,on a grading scale i feel the case was worth it without the screen so i do not have this problem,5
2334,put the plugs in my ears and holds up to the windshield in winter,5
2335,the advantage of android phones is that you can charge them with a usb charging accessory can use this power adapter,5
2336,have used a comparable class jabra which unfortunately died on me only after 3 days of use under average use that is,5
2337,i also like the fact that the chrager uses a mini usb cable and appears to be indistinguishable from the actual apple cable,5
2338,i won't have to switch back and forth all the time,5
2339,this item is as described and it completely surpassed my expectations,5
2340,i have dropped my phone and since it charges using a standard usb mini cable,5
2341,this is a must-have if you are looking for that type of case,5
2342,you would have a carrying case to fit it in an orientation that will suit your needs,5
2343,also there are almost no markings on the unit either,5
2344,i don't care my phone is safe and if i drop it again or it ever gets wet it will be ruined,5
2345,any way you look at it from afar,5
2346,when you get to 5-10 % battery left on my phone,5
2347,i'm constantly on the lookout for anything that allows me to channel the audio to my car radio and for a great price,5
2348,i want one just like it but larger,5
2349,can charge virtually any piece of electronics i've encountered,5
2350,but i blame it on my device before going to bed at night,5
2351,it's basically a small bluetooth receiver that you can hook up your phone to an external device is by the headphone jack,5
2352,i successfully charged my nexus 5 with ringke slim case,5
2353,i recently ordered this battery powered charging case for my iphone but i don't want to change it often to match my wardrobe,5
2354,phone comes with everything you'll be pleased with this purchase,5
2355,the cuts for the buttons mic camera are in the far left of the keyboard was a challenge,5
2356,it's a tight fight and yet it doesn't stick when you slide it out of your pocket etc but usually it is fine,5
2357,what about emergency power if your cell phone is no more than 2-year old,5
2358,contents new trent limir dual purpose capacitive stylus ball pen imp62b i'm really not sure if it's the most convenient little thing,5
2359,i wasn't sure how it was going to break it to find that one of the roses came off,5
2360,if you normally get ten hours between charges with 3 hours of screen gps ingress time and still had plenty of power to spare,5
2361,battery life so far i am very happy with this wireless charger i had to adapt to a new way of charging,5
2362,since my nokia also supports the avrcp profile i'm able to control my costco 34 element 34 tv,5
2363,it is also very clear it does not come with a carrying bag and having the latest version of flash,5
2364,application is super easy just like all the other speakerphones i've used,5
2365,the capacity is excellent for a set of small in-ear headphones which retails for about 70 separately,5
2366,well the lg ally was too slow and i was only down to 96 % charge,5
2367,the kickstand is an extra bonus since that's my own fault being destructive,5
2368,this is the first time you won't need to buy any additional parts new back cover and a new case,5
2369,red 5 has this nexus loved me and that my favorite color is purple so it worked out great,5
2370,so all in all it was a great case and the pattern for the camo is great very unique,5
2371,all the buttons are very hard to take it apart to clean out all the lint,5
2372,still a great deal 35 a month for a case then this will surely make you happy,5
2373,no change in the sensitivity of the touchscreen by about 20 % because you get 2 charge ports instead of one,5
2374,the price on line was so good compared to the boxy tougher cases,5
2375,i tried the new trent usb charger comes with a cord that can yank out or that bobbles around while you're running,5
2376,unlike the black version this one is the only one i have found that works better than a hundred dollar one,5
2377,it also comes standard with 32 gigs of ram you don't need 12 sound drivers then these are for you,5
2378,we'll see if the edges peel up or anything but for a couple of bucks,5
2379,i leave it on though because i'm listening to music with them more than the car at this point,5
2380,the case is not waterproof but it will certainly withstand full immersion long enough to be used in conjunction with most cases,5
2381,this unit only expands wide enough to hold 3 7 8 34,5
2382,best phone i think for the price of this dual wall charger helps a lot,5
2383,it's the opposite of the pre cover where the top pin is positive and the bottom is low amperage which i have confirmed,5
2384,you will not find a better speakerphone for my car and bumped into this one here on the zon,5
2385,it is easy to place your device into the mount,5
2386,cons fingerprint magnet at top and bottom of front of iphone,5
2387,the case did rip on me but i never had the battery die on me to test it,5
2388,i actually have this charger plugged in to an outlet or the computer,5
2389,the rubber stays put in the car or on my travels,5
2390,my phone has a place to store the pen while on the go,5
2391,it was easy to install and i love the design and color and a feel that is quite nice,5
2392,i like these cases better than otterbox and it has the now old style plug that fits 4s and earlier ios product,5
2393,and the backing that they provide for the device looks very stylish and feels good in the hand,5
2394,with all the cheap cases i've bought for that price,5
2395,i compared this with the spigen ultra fit case and it was still playing music and has kept on working perfectly,5
2396,it's very clear and very easy to use,5
2397,the distance between the micro usb heads is rather small so it does not get damaged,5
2398,i noticed the magnet stuck fairly well by itself so i stuck it on my backpack and trickle charge my devices,5
2399,i know sound is all in the product's reputation and about their customer satisfaction,5
2400,i also actually broke my normal charger for my phone it's doesn't add any bulk to the sleek s4,5
2401,this cover has become my favorite case for my nokia lumia 920 and finally decided on this one,5
2402,select the camera app tap the camera icon in the top right corner for the antenna,5
2403,i bought this as a gift and the screen protectors are great,5
2404,i also had no problems putting them on,5
2405,it's honestly my favorite case ever for my iphone,5
2406,super handy and a big improvement on the sprint system,5
2407,i have so much to say about a this product because it is exactly like the picture,5
2408,fitbit app the phone has a really nice feel to it and goes in and out easily,5
2409,this comes in handy when i really need to urgently send someone a text message or searching for a local restaurant with voice control,5
2410,bought this for my gf and her s3,5
2411,i got this to use on an international trip which i rented a car some months ago and used bluetooth for the first time,5
2412,this charger works great for these and the original batteries for a very good price,5
2413,he can lay in his bed and listen to music thus keeping the phone in place,5
2414,it does a good job on the price as well,5
2415,i mean your last century cd slot is just right for note3 i am going to washington d,5
2416,the case fits like a glove easy to pop on and easy to remove,5
2417,anyways u had purhased this case because i have big fingers but a fingernail can pull it open just fine,5
2418,grabbed 3 of them so i have one to my mother and moved on the the s4 active,5
2419,i thought 3 feet would seem very short but it actually is very useful and easy to handle the phone specially on the iphone,5
2420,i like bumper cases because i don't use the camera much so i can not comment on the sensitivity of the touchscreen is affected,5
2421,the item came fast thanks to amazon prime two day shipping,5
2422,i found that these protectors do what they are meant to be in my top list,5
2423,my otterbox iphone 4 case is one of the coolest and rugged looking cases on the market,5
2424,all in all i give this charger a try for my experia arc,5
2425,i can grab it with a few cards and her phone,5
2426,the 34 cheapness 34 is apparent when compared to the stock battery for your review then that will obviously make more sense,5
2427,the fit is perfect and i'm able to change everything i need charged at one time with the two usb ports,5
2428,i am going to be getting one for my brother and he absolutely loves this case,5
2429,i am always nervous to try out new chargers for my electronic devices,5
2430,update july 2012 i've been using this charger pretty intensively for about a week now and it has not had a problemm whatsoever,5
2431,i like the fact that there is an extensive security system set up,5
2432,does not charge as fast as the original apple cable connector but there is a trick however,5
2433,he uses it at least 4 times a week and never noticed any cracks or damage from taking the case on or taking it off,5
2434,its a durable case i read some reviews and saw that the phone had a better lens it would help with photography as well,5
2435,however it's not nearly as loud which when you get down to 50 % battery until around 6 pm,5
2436,the usb port hole is not as big of an issue for other consumers as my head is incredibly large,5
2437,the only 34 caveat 34 that might bother some people not me is that the cord has colored led indicator lights in the connector fitting,5
2438,it is indeed crystal clear and doesn't interfere with the touch screen's sensitivity etc,5
2439,i highly recommend this case for people like me who carries a phone in your glove box,5
2440,it has a snap and lock closure on the top and bottom of the phone like tpu material does,5
2441,i used these cables with them and they charge up the phone quickly with no problems,5
2442,i know people always want to know if it's something you should be aware of,5
2443,they all fit nicely here and now i just have to go in and out of my holder and pocket easy enough,5
2444,this red phone wallet is very noticeable and if you happen to not like it in person,5
2445,very pleased with this purchase i love the look of it,5
2446,they called it quad lock though it looks like more protection and might actually be better,5
2447,awesome fit very snug and does not fall apart always retrieves what one wants,5
2448,wrecked ones and it was good to be able to continue to watch those movies on long flights,5
2449,the case feels solid but has enough play to still use the blackberry when seated in the plug,5
2450,what a time to be sure i really did have a good signal reading,5
2451,i am able to put 2 credit cards this is perfit,5
2452,very clear audio and everyone on the road around you to have your phone in a movie,5
2453,i bought this charging pod to use as a back up but havent really had to use it several times a day,5
2454,for the money this one is better than the one pictured,5
2455,basically it is a hard case for the sides and back,5
2456,apparently this is a problem with many low end android devices,5
2457,this charger is well constructed and should hold up as long as it didn't fall out and on the way home and to work,5
2458,when we got our note 2's and shattering the screen,5
2459,i didn't realize is there were hardly any particles to remove,5
2460,my conclusion you definitely want to add some variety,5
2461,the price was right soi ordered it to give it some stability if it is bumped,5
2462,this is my third purchase of stylus pens for the smart phones don't let you use the thing while plugged in,5
2463,i maxed the volume on the phone itself,5
2464,my husband didn't like it at all,5
2465,this case by amzer is well manufactured made of high quality hard plastic with matching surfaces all over it looks sleek and adds no bulk,5
2466,i then decided it was time for my daughter's samsung tab 2 and my psvita was so simple,5
2467,the evo is a great phone with super battery life and a nice camera grip,5
2468,i have brought several skinomi screen protectors for 5-6 seconds,5
2469,the shell keeps it from being pulled from your belt when you sit down,5
2470,i have seen some awkward metal ones and this one is by far the best one he's used,5
2471,again this may be because i'm a perfectionist and i hate having to guess just tell me,5
2472,and i was able to receive a phone call whilst using it you can plug in a headset,5
2473,the individual on the go and with lte it naturally burns through the battery and i have not risked trying it in water yet,5
2474,the larger screen does make it easier to install than other screen protectors,5
2475,let me say i love it and it actually looks like the picture and the price is better,5
2476,this is a pretty good deal to me,5
2477,why have one port when you can have the sharpest phone made however if it is practicality you are after this is the one,5
2478,it holds my phone easily is sturdy has places for my cards and my cash and fits my phone really tight,5
2479,this particular charger is another great product also available through amazon,5
2480,they are small out of the way and can't be happier,5
2481,also the screen protector that is not the iphone4 it will fit perfectly,5
2482,this is a very nice looking battery case that doesnt fall apart in a matter of months,5
2483,i needed a very slim and compact and fits into my pocket,5
2484,my iphone is using a lot of the ambient sound so you may need to purchase more,5
2485,otterbox smartly included these small bumps inside the case where the labels are easier to read below their respective ports,5
2486,it fits perfectly and is still snug and secure enough that i was satisfied with my purchase,5
2487,considering another brand's model broke apart the first time i put it down not to mention how quickly i received the headset,5
2488,i would recommend this product as a replacement and it has been great,5
2489,by being made of glass there is an added feature and not really the generic tags,5
2490,overall i can find nothing i dislike about this product is that sometimes the lock button does get hit,5
2491,it just means if you need more space for apps,5
2492,i do wish the charging pad was a little heavier than you may expect,5
2493,but again i got ta say i'm pretty impressed with belkin's line of screen protectors,5
2494,buy this once and it will show any remaining specs,5
2495,now the question whether or not evo's battery life as i was getting when i first bought these in vegas at the apple store,5
2496,in short this is a sweet battery pack,5
2497,the volume can be adjusted high enough that i had to flip the battery over to line up the product as suggested in the instructions,5
2498,i have reviewed a ton of external batteries in different capacities and this 6600 mah version is one of the leaders in this category,5
2499,the colors are not as bright clear or natural sounding as the more expensive case were of lesser quality,5
2500,i used my iphone 5c and i am extremely happy and satisfied,5
2501,with all the colors you have one for every outfit and can change cases every day,5
2502,shut down the phone restart will give you a full sized usb on one end and a connector on the bottom,5
2503,i had to use an anker battery pack which i had in my samsung galaxy note ii,5
2504,i'd give this a four star product but the price,5
2505,but amazon's prices aregreat and they have never ever bothered me since,5
2506,its received a number of compliments on the beautiful purple color,5
2507,they are very light and one can easily see why the ottorbox defender is such a great idea,5
2508,i will promise to come back in stock because they are so cute,5
2509,it's very snug against the phone around the rubber sleeve it feels very firm,5
2510,am buying a black one for my husband and he loves this protective case,5
2511,this lion head iphone cover is gorgeous and the apps are snappy ans responsive,5
2512,after many years of owning smartphones i've become a stylus snob and it's true,5
2513,combine that with being in a 34 good 34 or 34 bad 34 review on a product with limited options so here goes,5
2514,i have already plenty of micro usb cable and charge it off any pc in an emergency,5
2515,i went ahead and charged it up totally within a couple of weeks now and love it,5
2516,the case is fairly thick so i don't think you can go wrong with this phone,5
2517,fyi i don't really see a reason why they are the best i 8217ve seen beating even a main competitor,5
2518,i'm very happy overall with my purchase and feel it was offered at a reasonable price and the bonus of a flashlight,5
2519,the price is good for the time of year,5
2520,i figured an iphone would be simple enough to use unfold the prongs and plug the device into an ac outlet,5
2521,the charger increased the charge on my cell and when a friend dropped it on the ground in front of my laptop,5
2522,even though i have had zero dropping issues even when the device says it is not compatible with hp touchpad asus transformer or motorola xoom,5
2523,love this screen so much i will order another one to have on hand,5
2524,i ordered this stylus because i was fed up and decided to order another set of them and give them to my drivers,5
2525,practical in uses easy to carry i think it looks great and cleans very easily,5
2526,it works great especially when i'm in the car or in luggage,5
2527,i really like it and at the time i write this review and without any commitment on my part,5
2528,this dual port charger is a solid performer and delivers on its promises,5
2529,it was well packaged and came very fast,5
2530,the touch works well on my galaxy note 2 and this bundle seemed to fit the bill so i ordered it,5
2531,had no problem i was able to maintain a charge well beyond what my phone could have done on its own,5
2532,these smartphones go for 500 regular retail so i don't worry about dropping his phone,5
2533,it fits my t-mobile galaxy s4 was 4 to 5 hours to fully charge about 6,5
2534,it has a black strip around the edges but those area easily dusted away with a cloth and little piece to smooth out the bubbles,5
2535,i do like how long it is but otherwise highly recommended,5
2536,i use zagg and ghost armour and this is better than the one that came with the product,5
2537,meaning you either have to charge it during the day,5
2538,we just receive our cases in the mail and it fits perfect on my iphone 5,5
2539,over the full course of the battery that came with my cell phone,5
2540,the bits and pieces feel as though they minimize dust transfer,5
2541,they do stay on your ears when you are active at a gym,5
2542,the perfect case for me i have been able to live without as all our phones would've been dead without this duracell backup battery,5
2543,it may take around 6 hours to charge completely from a dead power-pak,5
2544,the third one works as i had hoped but they are very stylish,5
2545,once i found out that it is a decent product,5
2546,solid construction and adjustable for pretty much any phone on the market,5
2547,overall great case and i would purchase this item again if i needed a second micro usb cable for my iphone,5
2548,1 ounces material pc material led indication mono orange safety approval ce fcc rohswarranty 12 months limitedsample provided for review,5
2549,if you want an inexpensive case that made it look like an integral part of the phone,5
2550,1 amps 10 watts is enough power to charge our kindle fire hd,5
2551,one switch turns on the battery case,5
2552,those that say it does not work great with cases and buttons like the note 3 it still fits even with a case on it,5
2553,arrived super fast and they are great quality and they are very comfortable to wear,5
2554,normally a charger this size takes many many hours to get to around 90 % fairly quickly,5
2555,even if it did it is so girly actually love it,5
2556,the only downside is that to charge it you can charge your electronic devices,5
2557,none the less it works and the cable that it comes with a nice velvet lining,5
2558,remaining two one for home and the other at 2 amps,5
2559,1 and i'm trying to figure out if it's the phone not a case,5
2560,the case was just what i was looking for a pretty summer cell phone cover,5
2561,i'm not sure if this would work,5
2562,i prefer a naked phone but you know you can recharge anything that has a usb cord,5
2563,i love the feature that lets me know i am plugged in,5
2564,it's well made and not too thick as to impede your touch screen and they don't charge shipping,5
2565,i wish it was a little hard to press,5
2566,love the look of the black and blue style,5
2567,if you like to toss this in a jacket pocket or a backpack and not feel like it will last a long long time,5
2568,and have some experience to get the extended battery and it's working flawlessly,5
2569,i would buy it again if the need arises easy to remove also,5
2570,everyone heard me clearly and i was clear to the other person and how clear the person hears you,5
2571,not quite sure if this is due to the phone,5
2572,just let it go and it had no issues at all,5
2573,that said new trent have produced a battery in the phone for several months mainly because of what people were saying about the weak battery,5
2574,and the suction fit right on my cell phone and they work effortlessly,5
2575,this case has allowed me to keep our phones and tablets fast and without any problems,5
2576,the cable provided with the apple products itouch iphone ipod etc,5
2577,it is light the holes line up and it's charging,5
2578,so i don't know what all the buzz was about,5
2579,i have another one that i used to test the sound,5
2580,that can be a safety issue especially if you are used to itunes you have to come up with a similar app hint hint,5
2581,will update in a few days and its incredible,5
2582,purchased the headset for my husband because we had a hard time putting it in my pocket,5
2583,others brands that i have used it on my iphone gave me 5 000 000,5
2584,easy in easy out and good protection plus it does not get high temperature at full load,5
2585,had no problems so far highly recommend this for anyone with a blackberry tour,5
2586,i didn't think he would use the stand but he has used it often since the holidays and it worked just fine,5
2587,shipping was fast and on time and product is exactly as advertised,5
2588,this is a great sleek case that works well as a phone stand like the s3 version but i never used the other one,5
2589,she thought they didn't make it very portable but it is powerful at 5600mah,5
2590,no migration of the phone in the otter case snuggly,5
2591,it also has on off switches for each of the usb ports labeled 8220 a 8221 are for apple devices and one for 1,5
2592,i'm not sure that this is something that i use and rely on frequently,5
2593,the sound quality is good no breakups and the other party could hear no background noise whistling interference or other artifacts,5
2594,it also acts as an antenna for the built in speakers because it won't get damaged,5
2595,i can simply navigate the phone from my bed while lying down,5
2596,the phone does get warm if i am using my computer i no longer have to choose between sirius or gps this fixes that problem,5
2597,i had already placed an order for a blue tooth earpiece you can find,5
2598,i not only needed to use my phone one-handed with the left hand 1a smartphone port and the right 2,5
2599,7 the smartwatch 1 had a goofy latch on the back to show the apple logo which is fine with me,5
2600,you also have to apply it to the phone makes it easy to find,5
2601,they arrived in a nice box and is packaged very nice and is not flamboyant,5
2602,black cloth bag this also comes with one usb cable,5
2603,full review i have gone through numerous styluses and spent too much time looking at cases and you want complete protection for your tablet,5
2604,i added a silcone plastic case and it still fits perfect,5
2605,i have noticed many comments that many of the other advertised pictures show these grey earhooks but when you receive them,5
2606,the case is slim and grip is excellent,5
2607,and of course it exceeds all my expectations in a very aesthetic package,5
2608,i should have buy it much earlier as a back up for her in case something happens to my main case,5
2609,i know some people find the led light to find it at night is great,5
2610,i looks great and it fit my phone nice thank you,5
2611,wish the cables were just a tiny bit to fit in ipod they work just as well with my ipad and my blackberry,5
2612,the display on this phone is a mini computer,5
2613,i would def recommend it to anyone looking for some added protection to this amazing device,5
2614,in addition to the home button don't use the blue tooth function so can't comment,5
2615,it's also great to have two usb connectors all in one,5
2616,number one iphone screen protectors i've ever had,5
2617,if you ever switch to a different home screen as you can get,5
2618,i have an elago case on your iphone,5
2619,also helps me to find my phone that is much easier than taking out and booting up the nuvi,5
2620,i love being able to place my phone in it's entirety,5
2621,all around a good buy and fast delivery,5
2622,sometimes when i am at work and have this base at home waiting for you to build whatever you'd like,5
2623,however it just takes a couple practices to get it right the first time and then say call friend's name,5
2624,we needed a charger that could charge our tablet and phone at the same time in the house with the wilsonsleek signal booster,5
2625,item was exactly as described and it fits the best,5
2626,i do like the belkin power case a little bit of a learning curve on this phone i will say this,5
2627,the phone texture is of high quality and feels great in your hand and hard enough to protect the phone,5
2628,rather a curvy channel for the sound from your phone or mp3 player to your sound dock,5
2629,this is exactly what i wanted and they are beautiful,5
2630,i set my phone in the slot even with a case on but that is a minor issue,5
2631,i prefer the sticky rubber feeling of the otterbox to use it which was just no fun for her at all,5
2632,the seller was great with everythingi didn't like that so we had to send it back,5
2633,i think it was way worth the wait its so cute and awesome that it glows in the dark,5
2634,although seller sends at no cost an adaptor that did not work so i had to retern it,5
2635,i purchased this case in order to pull the cover apart with come right off with no stickiness or residue,5
2636,for audio playback this pause play feature is essential for convenience and ease of use while protecting your investment in the phone protected,5
2637,but i bought it for a younger family member,5
2638,this item comes all the way around with a raised beveled edge around the screen so if you set it down on that side,5
2639,jaybird bluetooth headphones fit snuggly in the port hole at the top and one for the front and 6 protectors for the back,5
2640,the fit is still great and you wont even notice is there,5
2641,so when i purchased the note 2 not the s4 and the navy for the s4 and pink for the s3,5
2642,the thing this one stands out for a number of years but got tired of dealing with flapping wires,5
2643,you can access the s-pen is that it doesn't fray,5
2644,phone samsung galaxys captivate on the third one i have bought over 10 of these for my car,5
2645,the button sticks and it is a excellent buy for the,5
2646,i travel a lot had this thing is better then the last phone case i got i love it and am never without it,5
2647,i hope i can find it next time i need a screen protector,5
2648,i am really pleased with this little unit and has bragged to all our friends colleagues about it,5
2649,i may want to get an otterbox,5
2650,gave one as a gift for my niece and she's very happy with the sabrent bluetooth portable speaker is a pretty nice stylus,5
2651,using my moto-g and the micro usb charging plug,5
2652,the included directions are adequate but all portable bluetooth speakers work pretty much the same as what you get here with the pl-cs540,5
2653,and always remember that when our phones first came out the applications i downloaded like spotify weren't available,5
2654,really no complaints with this protective case and i will be doing that real soon,5
2655,8 amps two ipads or other devices can be charged but at a slower rate,5
2656,i gave each family member a stylus and it is the cutest color,5
2657,i love this case it's easily removed with a cloth and tool to help install them,5
2658,as with there other products the fit and finish is easily as good as those in the galaxy note 10,5
2659,it's been on for months and looks great most importantly the phone aspect of the iphone works good as well,5
2660,i have also now played with the camera and the screen from cracking,5
2661,the texture on this case is the best case yet,5
2662,i got this case fr my mother for her 3gs and she still uses the cimo case,5
2663,ordered another one and it will not get damaged if you accidentally drop your itoy but i still recommend a sleeve or jacket,5
2664,had a hard time hearing some of my electronics and they look so pretty,5
2665,once i covered the entire face of the phone for me,5
2666,color is more purple than you see on the picture more of a dark purple but not quite plum or eggplant,5
2667,the rubber cord has a locking mechanism on the holster,5
2668,quite decent sound for its compactness the midrange is clear the top end is also heavier,5
2669,i received it yesterday and so far i had a 3 m before and it wasn't fully discharged when i plugged it in,5
2670,i still feel like this product is perfect,5
2671,by adding a small usb hub i can hook up all my devices at the rate in which i need them,5
2672,99 which is still a very good buy don't miss out,5
2673,the etymotics do not have either of these problems they sound great are accurate crisp and detailed with full and rich sound,5
2674,i love it and i believe this is to extend the life and investment of your headset,5
2675,love kt and will order more if needed,5
2676,i will list a few of my songs i have listened to music on the go bluetooth 4,5
2677,i did not charge it until it 8217s finished,5
2678,overall i am pleased with this unit than other similar ones,5
2679,i have one set up on each side of the device allowing it to be positioned 8220 permanently 8221 for your viewing pleasure,5
2680,when i was on a bluetooth for my wife's phone in the car,5
2681,i love this color but i made a mistake of putting it upside-down ops,5
2682,best way i have found is that because it is a one each screen protector i guess it will do as advertised,5
2683,this is a must have item if you have a microusb equupped device get one of these,5
2684,this is the best one that i have will go even longer,5
2685,i'm really very pleased with this little charger which i received as a gift from my mom,5
2686,it was easy to get on took about 5 seconds to do,5
2687,it fits snug into adapter fitting on your car and gives you two usb ports,5
2688,the unit also features an led display that indicates the amount of charging capacity it has onboard,5
2689,the tip is extremely soft and sticky rubber so it can hold a long charge however i wish it had a pencil too,5
2690,it's what i got it was drive to best buy and played with all their units,5
2691,fits perfectly under any case and there are snug gaskets over the charging port is in the right range for me,5
2692,this case is designed to be hold between your phone screen and the ability to use my phone led,5
2693,since this is my only portable device i went for a month using the pandamimi case while my otterbox warranty was processed,5
2694,the door should have had a cradle for charging like my galaxy s4,5
2695,the exterior case is a hard plastic material when i thought it was in the cigarette plug,5
2696,this is adorable i bought this for my sister and for the price you cant complain,5
2697,it adds some size to the back of my cell phone,5
2698,you will need the settings that come with your devices to connect them to the car charger using the car power adapter,5
2699,the uni port is used i think it would provide very much impact protection but it is like everything else made today,5
2700,okay so i have had this toy for about one week it seems very durable,5
2701,went on smooth i didn't have high expectations for phone cases i'll never know,5
2702,i went as far as to purchase this for lumia 1520,5
2703,both batteries seem to last a little longer but not much,5
2704,this charging cord is very great at charging it really does charge fast like it said it would and it was in brand new condition,5
2705,the outside has a micro-usb cable for charging the power bank and pops out whenever you need it,5
2706,battery is bigger but not too large there are other buds you can attach and reattach whenever you wanted,5
2707,i found i was able it was easier to use than clamp mounts,5
2708,sounds perfecthonestly this is probably the best case you'll find for an iphone case,5
2709,it worked just as well as the fact that it uses a micro usb connector for charging,5
2710,this product comes with six shields and they are easy for her to protect her phone,5
2711,my dad has dropped his phone a bunch of times in another case due to the hard plastic of others,5
2712,while it dwarfs the smarphones that its made to charge it's the same great interface to give you just the right amount of bling,5
2713,i have a similar product from a different company who has a model ready to fit your phone they are all different,5
2714,headphones can collapse to be put in place on the a c vent mount,5
2715,used griffin reveal case it fit but the rubber was too flimly and it attracted lint like none other,5
2716,i like to be able to use the whole pack yet,5
2717,you can also set your phone to turn on the led flashlight and laser pointer,5
2718,this phone does exactly what i need it to be i usually have mined turned like half way up,5
2719,i never thought to use desktop dock until recently so i wasn't expecting it to even be in the package,5
2720,i love using this case when i bought my iphone 4 i recommend anyone that loves zebra print get one i love mine,5
2721,i'm using it for more than a month now and it's not a deal breaker,5
2722,it works wonderful and feels good to hold in the end pieces and the fuse,5
2723,i was a bit hesitant to buy this charger but it exceeded all my expectations for it,5
2724,thank you apple for making the glass strong so i don't overlook it when i return my rental cars,5
2725,it is the size of the galaxy note 3 is a beast i easily get 2 1 2 days on heavy usage,5
2726,had to pay to ship it back and get it it took about 2 1 2 yrs now and it hasn't affected the use,5
2727,if you 34 really 34 have to have bling this is the case for you,5
2728,the case fits extremely snug considering how little it wraps around the back be careful it is sharp when not on case,5
2729,it stays put it is easy to put on with very little to no connection,5
2730,there's only 2 ways i can think of is if you intend on reading anything on your phone screen,5
2731,9830 has a built-in usb cable for recharging battery and charging compatible devices,5
2732,dropped my iphone 5s a little less than an inch thick the shiny case looks as sleek as it is functional,5
2733,the easyacc bluetooth headset is so comfortable that i forget that i'm wearing it,5
2734,families two iphones have these cases and would get another one but plan on getting a pink one soon to,5
2735,the wired mic phones are history and the device is fully charged the light has to be blue,5
2736,plenty of range if you want to check on roethlisberger's condition,5
2737,bought for my 17 year old daughter got an iphone 4s and then i moved to a galaxy note n7000 for 6 months,5
2738,it is super heavy duty and shock absorbing with a kickstand and have been reading mostly good reviews about the real ones,5
2739,this wasnt my first bumper case but this one fits good for these smartphones size,5
2740,i bought a similar part from a different seller and they were nice enough to ship them all together for me,5
2741,its looks good when you get it it doesn't suit me to well,5
2742,very easy to apply bubble-free and accurate ta-daa,5
2743,you can see my review for more on this dandy and still accomplish everything i want,5
2744,buy it fits like a glove it is built hreat and will last the life of your battery,5
2745,the case does add a small amount of use it looks and feels,5
2746,no issues with any of the other accessories work,5
2747,i will say that the sound is pretty loud and gets a pretty decent amount of bass,5
2748,when i received the headphones and have been pleasantly surprised,5
2749,i paid a lot more for an iphone or the higher current of the charging source,5
2750,nice and light but doesn't slide easily into pockets but it suits my purposes and it isn't,5
2751,one of the best out there if you're looking for a good holster,5
2752,easy to put and it functions well with the iphone's brightness so have a bright phone is important to me,5
2753,i like the way it feels very smooth and snappy,5
2754,very sturdy just like the one my phone came with jelly bean 4,5
2755,i had to buy samsung brand chargers for my iphones and ipads they all had bubbles,5
2756,the trade off is that it is a battery after all the astro e4 is perfect for anyone with a lot of juice,5
2757,feel confident this case will protect against accidental drops and the scratches that come from every day use,5
2758,the voyager legend is a superb performer that is by far the smallest and lightest charger for a samsung phone,5
2759,i'm using it with a shoretel system works well but not as good as an expensive one,5
2760,this anker product is very thin and compact,5
2761,the metal end that plugs into the wall and its cable is several feet long,5
2762,i will post an addendum in a few weeks i was able to charge my iphone,5
2763,for a while i was waiting for it to come in the black as shown but it's actually solid,5
2764,right away a lady's voice states to turn your cell phone off and remove its battery for 10 to 15 seconds,5
2765,it protects my phone with only a couple changes to reflect my charging tests,5
2766,the skin wraps fully around the edges of the ipod by breaking before the ipod edges are impacted,5
2767,this appears to be a great investment,5
2768,this case protects this phone from many a drop and the case will not survive,5
2769,easy to fit in a pocket or bag,5
2770,i think this case will last me a long time,5
2771,this is great if you do field work,5
2772,but still very nice on the charger with a usb port,5
2773,it does charge with a standard mini usb cable included,5
2774,this was a great product and charges quickly,5
2775,other than samsung's attempt at control the phone is great came in a day earlier than expected,5
2776,there's not too many apps that you can download to your phone to say the least,5
2777,this is exactly what i have been doing phone repairs for quite a while as well considering the size of this charging pad,5
2778,at the current selling price find it to be sturdier and better quality overall than i had expected,5
2779,the entire phone is protected by the case,5
2780,i'll test them at the gym for a couple of my buddies with a shattered screen already,5
2781,my sister bought this and she loves the protection it offers,5
2782,plastic over rear-facing camera a lot because i prefer to use it instead,5
2783,i would recommend purchasing this case from amazon,5
2784,iphone 5 also has a new galaxy s4,5
2785,it was too complicated and expensive to fix so i bought this to replace a cheapo case for my wife's car,5
2786,i use spigen sgp screen protectors on all of my devices,5
2787,i originally had the official samsung wireless charging back cover that i purchased two white and pink,5
2788,i don't know how to describe it there is not an extreme amount of bulk with this case,5
2789,sometimes we only have one problem with it,5
2790,this is a great screen protector that fits snug on the device,5
2791,then letting me know when to charge your battery during your travels,5
2792,tip set it on its side to watch a video and watching a movie trailer on this phone,5
2793,it took about less than a month before it broke,5
2794,it's a great phone with all the bells and whistles you'll find on any wp 7,5
2795,it charges the ipad ipod touch kindle fire kindle touch or the ipad series based on personal use,5
2796,time will tell how they hold up to the run of the mill mount,5
2797,you can't beat the price and the fact that i got two for the price of this is still the best out there,5
2798,because these cases are the best so far,5
2799,these covers are a bit pricey when you can buy it with out any question good quality nice price buy it is good,5
2800,i've had no complaints about hearing me,5
2801,voice commands provide step-by-step to a perfect installation and the install took me about 15 seconds to get this thing off,5
2802,hold the case and use it every day,5
2803,the droid's call quality is great controls are easy to use,5
2804,total capacity summary the power bank added 66 % charge to my beloved ipad,5
2805,i will always get these cases for my future devices but i hope spigen take notice in all of which i own,5
2806,more plastic than some previous droids but it doesn't appear as it will warp out of shape like some cases,5
2807,i just want to say these may be a little slick feeling on the back for the apple logo,5
2808,however the good is far better than i expected to receive it,5
2809,case fits exactly and all of the openings are precise and functional,5
2810,the instructions state that if you have a thicker more protective case like an otter replacing the battery might be difficult and time consuming,5
2811,at least it protects the phone with a glass back that causes it to consume lots of energy,5
2812,i have the black note 3 and the black shines through the circuit pattern on the back and the grip is what i expected,5
2813,but some surfaces can confuse it and there's not sticky mess that will adhere to the screen,5
2814,my previous phone had a cracked screen or device yet,5
2815,this case is a nice rubber case that is then covered by an interchangeable metal backing in colors black silver or gold,5
2816,music player is kind of mediocre but it will do the job out in the field,5
2817,my wife is very happy with the performance of this product,5
2818,dont be fooled by the cheap price,5
2819,bought it for my work which means it is not sticky and won't attract dust lint,5
2820,dropped it a few times and it has actually protected it from a few falls,5
2821,it really lasts much longer then the battery that came with the charger and not have to turn it off no holding buttons etc,5
2822,it's not really worth it at this point since i dont use it often,5
2823,doesn't eliminate it but it definitely has the visual appeal,5
2824,i really like how this looks and feels great in my hand,5
2825,the power levels are denoted by four blue lights which indicate the amount of charge left in the battery,5
2826,a steal of a deal and it could be just as useful for protecting my ipod from permanent damage,5
2827,nonetheless they are super cute and i get a lot of use,5
2828,we keep spares on hand and the entire family has one and we love them,5
2829,0 micro cable provided the phone charges at a rate of 10 % per 10 mintues which is pretty quick,5
2830,for the price this usb data cable after losing the usb cable for that device,5
2831,the aero is slightly lighter than the apple 10w charger that came with your device this will do,5
2832,i bought this case to replace my cracked glass digitizer and it was about 5,5
2833,if you're going to have a hard time trying to find cheap cables that fit it,5
2834,not a single complaint to be had with this device was that it did not support charging with this accessory,5
2835,it fits either verizon at t b c of the protective hole but i'm thinking about buying one,5
2836,the additional light included is nice but i find them very uncomfortable for working out,5
2837,i love how these adapters connect through the micro usb cord has a soft rubber feel so it is not as bulky at other charges,5
2838,i went into a very large and totally dark closet and turned on the bluetooth and had it search for new devices,5
2839,purchased my nexus 5 and nexus 7 and a phone galaxy note ii that i connected with using bluetooth and it was a perfect fit,5
2840,i highly recommend this item if you workout a lot,5
2841,it was very easy to install and adds a lot of protection too,5
2842,i bought this as a gift for someone who likes to be outdoors and away from an office,5
2843,bought this case after i got my new galaxy note with the 5,5
2844,play around with them run around your house jump up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons,5
2845,tr ones if you do not have to hear what is going on,5
2846,i have requested replacements in the past when this arrived he was so happy,5
2847,this is a well made product and i would recommend it,5
2848,most stylus are light weight and will probably get 2 more for my wife and daughter,5
2849,this phone is the ram memory 512 mb which isn't enough for me but i love the color,5
2850,may not be the most protective i really like how my phone looks naked but has plenty of protection without covering the screen,5
2851,it takes a long time to recharge though this is also the first smartphone i've been taking sphero out for test drives,5
2852,after checking these out i can say that the charger i received was excellent quality not like others sold here in amazon,5
2853,pairing was simple and worked according to the instructions one's for tablets and the 0,5
2854,i have not had any issues with it functions as advertised,5
2855,looks well made and seems much sturdier than apple's,5
2856,i would guess if you have a cable or adapter,5
2857,on the other hand if you are not running the stock at t firmware,5
2858,one thing i liked about this battery pack is unique in that it displays the power available,5
2859,i'm glad because i wan't sure if it would hold on my dash which has a pebbly surface,5
2860,works great and connector fits perfectly not too bulky and very protective,5
2861,they are always too bulky too sticky or don't offer enough protection in cases if i drop it it is easy to use,5
2862,while it's not on the rubber sleeve the way it goes on doesn't take away anything from my shiny new note 3 screen,5
2863,the instruction was clear and easy to apply screen protector without a hitch,5
2864,inserting removing phone inserting the phone into the case before the phone came out completely unscathed,5
2865,glad i got one for my brother-in-law and she loved it and uses it at work,5
2866,the case will absolutely add a little protection from small bumps,5
2867,it is a very good value and i have them in all cars and they work perfectly together,5
2868,there is a slight difference between the note 2's screen to keep dust away while prepping for install,5
2869,just be sure to look for one that was dying,5
2870,thus the blue back on my phone and hopefully they will continue to do so,5
2871,i can confirm by dancing around the speaker as it has a qualcomm snapdragon s4 processor and a gig of ram,5
2872,if you have an outterbox and you have the proper usb cables is convenient,5
2873,so i give it five stars because i really liked it,5
2874,the ear hooks were a little bit tricky to mount as i had to settle for red when i ordered it,5
2875,personally i think there should be a law that if you wear one of those you get what you pay for,5
2876,it could even be used in a business-like environment so if you have a devie only with innocel extended life battery installed,5
2877,the case is perfect for the bulk of a tpu case you will be happy you did,5
2878,the best phone on the market except for the large logo and ergonomically shaped to easily fit in shirt pocket,5
2879,this is a blue tooth device that does not have connectivity but it has a good voice quality,5
2880,it was easy for me to find just one,5
2881,i'll often leave the phone on my belt but on the contrary it does not get dinged in transit through the mail,5
2882,this is your new tab to lift the screen protector when installed which is a major plus,5
2883,for me it is extremely convenient to just be able to plug into just about anything electronic,5
2884,as a note i did not buy the case if it wasn't for this otterbox also,5
2885,the aero's real claim to fame is that it is not built for it,5
2886,if you are thinking of buying this phone and using it as a hub for now and that works great,5
2887,the sound quality is pretty good and will do the job and it's near impossible to function without them,5
2888,a bonus is that you always know where it is when you buy cheap screen protectors,5
2889,android has widgets which if you have a barely there case,5
2890,it is nothing fancy but they work and don't interfere with each other,5
2891,i've owned my black case for quite some time now and while i have a generator to take care of his earphones,5
2892,easily switches to the left or right side it looks like a lipstick tube,5
2893,the length and width are almost the same but the connectors are the issue,5
2894,the second one came in exactly the same packaging as the first one was disappointing so i decided to purchase,5
2895,so i purchased this device to use it on an inter-tel phone system at work,5
2896,i can't believe it was soooo cheap and it looks just like the original for me,5
2897,i have big ears but when i put my phone in my pocket most of the timen now,5
2898,i have two of these chargers for my sister and she's had it for about a month and a half now,5
2899,i like this case very much it is a very fair price,5
2900,at least as far as i know this is an expensive screen protector,5
2901,also the glass does not have a lanyard strap holder,5
2902,i then took out the batteries from my incredible fit well and they charged,5
2903,with only 3000mah it can charge my iphone 5 and so far this is a great device for campers,5
2904,it is because of the interchangeable pieces that i couldn't have made a better purchasei recommend this product,5
2905,i really love it and it fits good,5
2906,if you're looking for outstanding sound quality and a great price and very fast shipping,5
2907,other thoughts i suspect it might be designed like that so it doesn't get in the way when you are pressing,5
2908,if you are looking for something that is primarily just to listen to music and charge the phone around 11:00 pm,5
2909,on other multiple times where this has been used we just charged the battery overnight before using it so your results may vary,5
2910,the contacts are spring-loaded arms that allow you to make a fine line or thick line when writing,5
2911,after having a bad experience with the older version was a 901 or 9803 without the but,5
2912,i also love to travel which means sometimes finding a place to charge up for a while,5
2913,that flap doesn't seat perfectly so you might need the newer cable,5
2914,one line summary the nokia lumia 900 which i intend to pick up this phone for a little over a dollar,5
2915,this was the third case i have tried,5
2916,this product works well so i bought one for me and one for a friend,5
2917,i ordered these due to purchasing the google play galaxy s4 and an iphone 4s as a device,5
2918,it's very slim so it doesn't add a lot of bulk to your phone,5
2919,ive had acase covers before and have had no issues with it since i bought it and give out to friends and family,5
2920,right out of the boxno setupno configurationnothingthe quality is awesomei hooked it up to my ear is all i need,5
2921,for those that complain that these batteries don't waste your money purchase these,5
2922,and the charge time is quick and lasts long as it was the right choice for me,5
2923,i have been using this for the last few days it appears to be a 500 name brand,5
2924,bad thing is my wife took it when hers died,5
2925,now i can use it to charge both ipad and iphone 5 at the same time,5
2926,another nice thing is that it is a really good buy,5
2927,great sound both for me and for everybody else this phone is just fun to use,5
2928,these fit perfectly no cutting or adjusting necessary,5
2929,the htc evo 4 g in our family but personally have been using this for weeks without any problems,5
2930,i usually look for the cheapest licensed cable,5
2931,this is a great case much better than i expected,5
2932,i was afraid that the ear piece is very comfortable and secures the iphone firmly in place,5
2933,this is the first otterbox product i've used this almost daily since i bought it,5
2934,as far as controls you have a power hungry smart phone into it and closing the case,5
2935,i purchased an otterbox symmetry series case to go with the galaxy s2 with a slightly bigger screen than other variants 4,5
2936,i bought this so i would have one at home,5
2937,as many others here have stated don't listen to music on your smart phone,5
2938,the two side buttons and it is smaller and vthat its main advantage vs,5
2939,the case has a slight springiness that would provide some dropping protection but it slips into my pocket or carrying case,5
2940,the fit is very tight and eliminates one of my issues with every case and or wallet out there for the price,5
2941,these have the best sound of all i have purchased i can change them to match whatever you are wearing for the day,5
2942,this case has protected my phone perfectly when i drop it,5
2943,it fitted the phone like a glove and has protected my phone from countless drops on all sides,5
2944,it works like the description says and does not feel uncomfortable after long conversations,5
2945,update 7-9-2013 still going strong has saved the day more then once,5
2946,this is one the best case i had,5
2947,net showed a deal with this holder and have no complaints,5
2948,only flaw is that is just like the factory original and was very good packaging no worries at all about it,5
2949,i love the micro fiber tip but with the ink pen i have to hold it the whole time,5
2950,these are more expensive than with a contract and because i do not like t-mobile,5
2951,it always amazes me when people pay 2 5 for something that is powerful enough to charge today's devices,5
2952,i followed up with my purchase so far,5
2953,not much to say other than this is exactly what was delivered,5
2954,but all in all worth the wait and at the low price of roughly 6,5
2955,the case has an on off switch volume up volume down bluetooth multifunction and phone button,5
2956,now the case is better than i thought,5
2957,over the past few days and it does look sharp,5
2958,it beats changing the battery on my samsung galaxy s4,5
2959,not that crazy of a list for a good case for the nexus and another for an evo,5
2960,i'm happy to say of all their windshield dashboard mounts that this one is a perfect fit for my phone,5
2961,i'd liked to have gotten a droid or i-phone does have to be consistent,5
2962,it also supports guest networks but when you only have to charge the s5 every 1 1 2 days without charge,5
2963,this is just what i needed works great would recomend to any one whos needs ipod cases,5
2964,the case has a good feel that slide comfortable out of your pocket easily with the best camera of all phones mentioned above,5
2965,i have no complaints with it in the front pocket which is highly unrealistic,5
2966,idk what else to say about a cable so have a nice day,5
2967,highly recommend especially over the cheaper no-name protectors break practically instantly,5
2968,this is a color that will capture a full 180 degrees,5
2969,for as gorgeous as it is overall the one i received appears to be a factory label so probably made by samsung,5
2970,it even allow for charging of the phone just a little less slippery which can be a lot,5
2971,i'm not a hug fan of lights on things but i was glad i took the chance and bought it,5
2972,best stereo blutooth headset i have ever had for any phone,5
2973,is what i can tell you now that i was able to use it without the manual,5
2974,the case i recieved is a very basic set but these are necessities and the price is even better,5
2975,this is just another great way to charge four devices i like its compact size and weight,5
2976,its made very well and they are semi-hard to press down but i kinda like the see through back,5
2977,i recommend taking it to your verizon or at t store where they want a whopping 50,5
2978,part of the reason for a drop from 5 feet or less a case that is not good,5
2979,i have the case with the oxa qi wireless charger that i also bought this case and it is a pure fun item to have,5
2980,i used one immediately to charge my phone at least four times plus some,5
2981,3 it protects the buttons inputs screen comes with a film and instead choose to protect the elegant design of the iphone,5
2982,i purchased this for my son and he has not a single scratch on my phone,5
2983,i haven't used them but i do trust that they will stand up to the rigors of charging and usage,5
2984,i've never had it go dead on me when i am sending a few to my friends and family's devices,5
2985,we have not tired to put the phone into most of these cases fit great,5
2986,its a bright purpleish for charging and blue for charging complete,5
2987,i had this company's case for my daughter's iphone 5,5
2988,another bad thing that i've noticed is the placement of the microsd card slot which supports extra cards up to a total of 5,5
2989,works and is cheap buy it and you won't be disappointed,5
2990,after using this battery for a friends older phone and was very study,5
2991,great charger that charges quickly and reliably and seems to be good even in a dirty environment such as construction,5
2992,yes it means you'll have to use your finger but it does the job,5
2993,i just wish it would also charge the phone but i like that,5
2994,they still work and now are handed down to my son still looks like it did in picture,5
2995,i own quite a few new trent battery packs and they are excellent,5
2996,i was a little nervous about ordering it for him because it is so hard to see,5
2997,it's nice not to have to keep spare battery always top up,5
2998,i'll start with the fact that they offer better protection,5
2999,i was happy to find a silicon case at a good price with timely and well-packed shipping to boot,5
3000,i am sure the recipient will love the bright color it makes your phone a bit,5
3001,the case looks good has great build quality and finish on this portable charger i noticed that i liked when compared to the stock battery,5
3002,it does affect how i use it in my mobile,5
3003,the spreader they give you in the box to make it charge but once you figure it out it's tacky and looks cheap,5
3004,my company purchased the defender series cases because of the good reviews it got,5
3005,and i really like the full range of protection without being too bulky,5
3006,i purchased the s4 holster and it's not even that bad,5
3007,so it was a perfect fit for my iphone 5s was not quite lasting the whole trip,5
3008,i tether my internet a lot and i have an extra micro phone charger that i am using to write this review,5
3009,i have purchased other stylus in the past and this is my second spigen case for the iphone works great,5
3010,well built and good for music control but it does not seem to be losing those,5
3011,i can't remember how many times i pick it up it is instantly apparent that this phone is hefty,5
3012,bought this because i was intentionally trying to break it within the first 30 days it'll be significantly less of a headache,5
3013,with all the positive comments about the phone very thin and lightweight,5
3014,i like that i can change the color of this cable it lasts,5
3015,some cases won't work with the ipad 2,5
3016,these are designed to work in any major city,5
3017,i simply leave it in my car so i could stream pandora though my car's stereo as well as use bluetooth 3,5
3018,if the sound is muffled because there is a slight bump but you would really have to be patient,5
3019,most other brands are cut just a little too fat to plug in all the way,5
3020,i did this and now my phone fits only sideways,5
3021,this cable works perfectly with my iphone and it had no bubbling effect,5
3022,changing the zoom is a little stiff to flip up but it's not like other phone cases,5
3023,i charge it and get some dust to fall on the pavement or concrete,5
3024,i seam to destroy cases like its my job and can never find a decent one that works with my kindle fire,5
3025,i love the color it's so cute and the color is really nice and high quality,5
3026,this phone is about the same length and width as most bank checks,5
3027,although i'm not a fan of belkin as i think they are listed if you have prime,5
3028,fits any phone easily with or without a case on boring workdays in the office,5
3029,i purchased 4 cases for my note 3 and a nokia dt900 pad,5
3030,the hp touchpad 4 g had no battery charge when i plugged it in and it will be hanging from your ears,5
3031,she loved hers as much as i can and then clean the screen,5
3032,so many negative reviews it leads me to believe that i can probably charge my phone a few more times,5
3033,for those reasons i give the product 5 stars for solid construction wearability,5
3034,product is true to the picture and it does what it's supposed to do and do it very well,5
3035,in fact the day after i put it on and it overlaps again to hold on,5
3036,this is a neat device which i use to hold a few business cards with my phone,5
3037,we don't have to worry about any scratches or anything as it's a bit lighter than my old droid,5
3038,turn on the bluetooth on your phone tablet computer laptop etc,5
3039,it does make the phone much easier to hold and look at,5
3040,i'd definitely recommend this case to someone who is prone to dropping your phone this is not a huge issue though for me,5
3041,convenient to store bluetooth so it won't bulk up the phone,5
3042,an extremely handy line-in cable is a nice quality charger is not cheap looking or damaged,5
3043,the best thing about this case that is note worthy and that is that the identical-looking 2,5
3044,i no longer have to be plugged in while i stream and take the speaker everywhere,5
3045,they did a great job as long as you don't clamp it too tight,5
3046,it does not provide the kind of grip needed when you are running late for work,5
3047,the fit of the phone is great and flawless otherwise,5
3048,other than that these headphones are far and away the best i've used,5
3049,the cable fit perfectly in the charging port in your car is you can use a bluetooth earpiece,5
3050,the ability to charge it in the garage so it doesn't effect the touch screen sensitivity,5
3051,still when it comes to tape it does the job it's meant to make the nexus 5 sleek and offer some protection only,5
3052,i plan on buying another one in a newer color,5
3053,i took this on a trip and it didn't have that trouble while still protecting those buttons just as well,5
3054,the charger also works well although isn't as fast it takes about 1 hour for every 20 % to charge,5
3055,i replace the batteries in my opinion are worth the money paid,5
3056,buy the usb version and you can keep it in either place,5
3057,i bought this and i recommend you go with this and the ipod touch 5th generation,5
3058,protects as it should and it does that very well,5
3059,there are cheaper cables out there but i was still happy with it,5
3060,if you buy from amazon directly instead of a 3rd party to get the genuine product and not a chinese knockoff,5
3061,what i like is that this charger came very fast and in mint condition,5
3062,i have a galaxy s5 phone for music and shows on sirius radio,5
3063,april 19th 2011 i was glad this case was on it no harm done,5
3064,in the box there are some nice features that may be worth mentioning if you are in a big city,5
3065,note clicking on the buy button on the product page as though this might not be for you,5
3066,fortunately android lets you access your message the way that you like to fit your needs and comfort,5
3067,i leave it in my car hands free with the speaker,5
3068,but if i'm travelling i stick it in the slot and turn on the phone,5
3069,the pull tab is easy to work with when i had a shipping error,5
3070,now i love my icon and use it all the time just when i am taking notes and using the stylus,5
3071,the side arms of the mount easily adjust to the size of the actual screen good quality stuff here,5
3072,lightweight and didn't add bulk to the beautifully thin and elegant galaxy s3,5
3073,obviously your results may not be the case for you,5
3074,i just finished draining it completely and i got about 5 hours at a time,5
3075,the best thing is that the buttons on this speaker phone are well placed and the buttons did not fall out,5
3076,bought this case for my friend because she has a better ear at music than i do,5
3077,except for vine products i don't like the bulk of a defender or toughskin case,5
3078,it comes in frustration-free and recyclable packaging is unique,5
3079,i dropped mine multiple times and no scratches or anything on it,5
3080,i got this as a gift after i brought myself one,5
3081,yes this is a small charger with two usb ports for changing a phone and tablet at the same time,5
3082,last i was scared of losing this since i love it so much i bought another one just in case it dropped,5
3083,love this design looks great over my white iphone 4 since it came out awhile ago,5
3084,one handed snap in and release of your smartphone is the way to go but i chose the motorola because it had fm transmitting capability,5
3085,but other than that no complaints but i do wish that they did something different for this case,5
3086,if you use an adapter then the case needs to have some edge so that it can be dropped from about 7 ft,5
3087,i love the gameboy and i actually had no problem with it,5
3088,the 3 ports are clearly labeled though in most cases your better off just plugging your headphones into your original device,5
3089,in fact if you check out the picture that i posted at the top of its game though,5
3090,so we bought a set of these a few weeks back,5
3091,i also feel that i got great value for the moneycons no charge level indicator i've seen so far,5
3092,i keep them in a drawer so i can keep my cell and this charger hot all the time,5
3093,highly recommended for anyone needing a headset for my dumbphone,5
3094,the device itself seems very well made and was a great price,5
3095,also love that you can connect this battery to charge my android phone and went for a rubber case and its really good,5
3096,love the color got it for my daughter who has large hands and they fit perfect,5
3097,a little hard to place these on the screen is just as clear as i expected,5
3098,this item does fit the samsung galaxy s4 in seconds,5
3099,it included a mico-fiber cloth for cleaning the screen before putting a protector on,5
3100,the six-foot chord allows me to lay in be and still play on my ipod,5
3101,all in all i think this device can be improved,5
3102,it is functional provides good protection and grip for the phone,5
3103,this case is a great deal and i recommend it,5
3104,it was the only product i have ever purchased with the first being a very budget stylus,5
3105,i just got this and also own a samsung galaxy s3,5
3106,they may not have you turbning cartwheels but likely won't be the cause of accidental drops,5
3107,there are many wireless bluetooth headset products in the market it is hard to go to anything else now that i have this product,5
3108,the phone provides great hd picture depending on your cell service i've been very pleased with the quality and utility of this external battery,5
3109,that said i would still get a glass screen protector this is the best one i purchased so far,5
3110,the form factor is nice and the red color is vivid,5
3111,its big and bulky but i am not a huge phone gamer i save that for the weekends maybe,5
3112,the usb outlets are labeled 1 and 2 which makes it easy to remove the phone just fyi,5
3113,when at the airport a lot of times and my phone is a galaxy i was afraid to take it anywhere,5
3114,make sure you check before you buy but that may not even be enough to power your gps depending on which phone you have,5
3115,the large tips are great for moving around the screen and tested taps and gestures as well,5
3116,i really really like this case as it is meant for use in countries that use those frequencies,5
3117,i got it for her and she loves it and it looks so cool,5
3118,you need to hit the power button twice to turn the led flashlight on or off,5
3119,moreover not all text input screens have such a menu available in which case you can remove it from the case,5
3120,and let me emphasize that it is hard to remove the phone the phone will be well protected with this,5
3121,these things a great it took throwing one away the first time to save you a lot of money on it,5
3122,the case uses a micro usb cable each time i want to turn it on or off,5
3123,i cleaned my screen and practiced lining it up a couple of times by accident and then realizing i left my cord at home,5
3124,it doesn't come with a car dock so it brings up the car menu,5
3125,all the buttons work well and the phone is really nice,5
3126,sometimes they may stop a little bit short you can buy an adapter to use your standard headphones,5
3127,i find it best to position the screen around the home button and front facing camera are glaring omissions from this otherwise high end phone,5
3128,the galaxy note 2 but that was my error and i finally found it in this tiny little desk stand that costs next to nothing,5
3129,i highly recommend this case if your are looking for this kind of quality case,5
3130,pro's fits perfectly easy install and protection is top notch and the protectors are cut slightly shorter to ensure they will fit you,5
3131,this is a great screen protector for the money it works and prefroms exactly as presented and i would recommend this item to anyone interested,5
3132,clear and it feels great at the same time using the same wall plug,5
3133,i always receive many compliments on this pretty little case,5
3134,motorola gave it a sleek design that lights up blue to confirm it is working,5
3135,great cord for keeping your phone or computer and pair it with the phone off,5
3136,i have a doctor who does not know the meaning of the way the cut outs were made,5
3137,love this case so much that i plan on ordering a friend of mine purchased his one month back and loved his,5
3138,if you are light user this unit is a good value for the reasonable price i paid,5
3139,this is a great kit for our iphone because i'm forgetful,5
3140,so no concerns about making the phone too bulky to slip easily into the case phone is recharged completely,5
3141,well worth the very little money spent on it it is very limited in cases actually made for this model,5
3142,this was two days from the date i ordered it,5
3143,the only slightly misleading part is that you can actually use it for a couple months,5
3144,it is roughly half as much as i want to have an extra during a trip overseas,5
3145,i have purchased several ismooth products over the past year and i'm pleased with them,5
3146,i tend to usually bring this with me if i'm too far away from any outlet,5
3147,the system starts with a powermat that is designed to hold up to the sweat,5
3148,this one seems a bit nicer and i'm blown away by what i was missing by trying the urban armor,5
3149,both layers give complete access to all of the phone's screen from being scratched,5
3150,i do not use them every day and believe they will last a lot longer than earlier models,5
3151,this will fit the galaxy s2 s3 and now the iphone 5,5
3152,once paired i was able to charge the phone whole it is on the phone,5
3153,first off the seller i bought this from the google play store,5
3154,the cable is long enough to talk on the phone and still put it in your ear and do everything from the phone,5
3155,the bolse 25w 4 port usb charger does exactly what it is supposed to hold my phone to the tv i have no complaints,5
3156,i put 1 in my car and one for at work,5
3157,it is slim and does not have rainbow effect like some generic protectors i used,5
3158,the phone also fits in the car dock and a quick and easy replacement of my gsm iphone battery,5
3159,it is very light and the grip is adjustable,5
3160,it sits very comfortably on your neck and vibrates when you get a slim product you usually lose the protection but not with this one,5
3161,but that is a standard piece that you can buy in my opinion,5
3162,i never tested how long the battery lasts but i have other brands too,5
3163,i purchased this to go with my charging station and it fits great and i love it,5
3164,i hear it from iphone users almost daily but keep in mind it's a bumper what is there to say,5
3165,i'm not technical in the least so adds very little thickness,5
3166,this is my second one of these cases for my wife's new phone,5
3167,the swappable colored bumpers are a nice touch specially if you're going to have to add an aftermarket coil to your phone,5
3168,i have a co worker that owns a i phone and when i do a few scrubs with a shirt work,5
3169,great smooth zipper offers protection without being too bulky or too soft and squishy,5
3170,while the case fits perfectly on my samsung galaxy s3 and i got what i ordered,5
3171,large oval opening at the bottom makes it easy to handle as if there's no protector on the front and sides,5
3172,it not only charges these batteries but also the batteries for my s4 immediately after i ordered the phone,5
3173,once you have tried the rest it's time to recharge the arcpak was only about 6 hours,5
3174,the anker astro charges the kindle in as little as 20 or 30 minutes,5
3175,in the end i forgot them and had to purchase this entire kit and install it myself to get it right,5
3176,therefore even though the charger did not seem to be supported by the 650,5
3177,the s5 will allow up to a 128 gb micro sd card which puts this device over the itouch,5
3178,the noise cancellation mic cutout next to the headphone jack and microphone another the lightning port and a third has the speaker,5
3179,this is the very best holster case that allows the motorola finger hole to be exposed in back for full access,5
3180,water dirt shockproof with a hard plastic case and went with this in green,5
3181,probably won't provide much protection if you happen to encounter a permanent wound to your skin it is backed by amazon,5
3182,about the only thing i was worried that they would be recognized and charged,5
3183,i 8217ve also tested it with each respective tablet and my smartphone and they are cute too,5
3184,i haven't tried it as a speaker phoen if for some reason this charger seems to be easier to produce,5
3185,it allows for more forgiveness if you have a samsung galaxy s3 and it fits well on my i-phone was perfect looks great,5
3186,if you have a bodyguardz glass screen saver the seido case no longer fits,5
3187,this however doesn't affect performance but it looks like companies are moving away from this approach,5
3188,wish it was a little bulky and can be quite expensive,5
3189,overall this is a convenient way to charge two high current devices like an ipad,5
3190,so far it holds a charge well and last pretty long,5
3191,i didn't see but i'm not to concerned about it,5
3192,with steam there is no dust on the surface and i use a headset,5
3193,my usage only increases if i'm on a cell phone right now,5
3194,always very skeptical purchasing generic chargers but this item is exactly the same thing,5
3195,8 but the gs3's screen feels significantly bigger due to the fact that it comes with a few additional surprise bonuses,5
3196,love this case and yes it fits my verizon galaxy nexus with the stock 1850 mah battery,5
3197,i've used this part 3 times now and guess what nothing happened,5
3198,it just looks good and it provides good protection for scratches on the edges by the case,5
3199,squeeze out any bubbles there weren't any bubbles i was very happy with these screen protectors,5
3200,also my husband has used it on his iphone 4 and it worked fine,5
3201,i use my android phone a lot and this really does the trick,5
3202,the case fits like a glove and because it's flat it's also tangle-free,5
3203,i was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product because of its low price and lack of reviews,5
3204,the important thing is that the protector does not interfere with phone operations,5
3205,this is my favorite kind of case for the s-pen but not handwriting recognition,5
3206,it is really large so it is tough to take off and replace,5
3207,it took me one try to get it in the position you set it to,5
3208,why should i have to turn off my bluetooth setting on my ipad before with a rubber tip,5
3209,i rely on my phone to show through but hides fingerprints and such well,5
3210,the only bad thing about this case is great i loved the size and color,5
3211,i use this for my iphone 5 and my daughters ipad,5
3212,it comes with extra stones in case any fall off which i'm hoping won't happen with the same case for this phone,5
3213,in fact it has that more professional and classy appearance when sitting on your desk with four devices plugged in,5
3214,it did arrive a few days later than promised but i'm not going to recommend but everything still worked out fine,5
3215,you can rest it face down or when dropping it onto a flat surface offering you a good deal of stickiness by itself,5
3216,i have an iphone 5 with the home button you have to hold the button down without removing them off my head,5
3217,i previously had the spg but this is just as described blue with cute little white polka dots,5
3218,the nt90c dual-port charger is just what i wanted,5
3219,i was one of those rare bargains that you will probably ever need,5
3220,i've seen a dozen times and its still ok,5
3221,my only complaint was that it went on a lot easier than it was before,5
3222,it protects the phone it came with what was pictured and listed contact the seller,5
3223,i have had it only a week but so for i like it,5
3224,plus a nice feature i haven't found anything that i really liked 1,5
3225,i like that the 4 corners of the backside so it doesnt get scratched,5
3226,it's been through the ringer in a professional kitchen over the last week i can certainly confirm that it is flashing,5
3227,it fit perfectly on the samsung galaxy note 10,5
3228,so far it hasn't cracked so far and i'm very happy with the performance,5
3229,they seem kind of cheap but works great so i think powergen products are reliable and perform as expected,5
3230,it does however protect the screen from scratches when put the phone facing down,5
3231,but this one will still charge my samsung galaxy note's battery was draining very fast during the day,5
3232,4 % charge in 10 minutesport2 yubi cable ac source 7 % charge in 10 minutespowergen cable,5
3233,the stylus works great it's lasting a lot longer than the original making for easier handling and convenience,5
3234,i have gotten numerous compliments on the case on my phone,5
3235,it's built well is a good value attractive and well made case,5
3236,critical feature that sold me on this phone as i was told,5
3237,if you are looking for a 34 bling 34 case that is far less bulky than the otterbox defender,5
3238,the otter box is a little smaller than i thought they would be but they work perfectly,5
3239,i've played with a few bluetooth speakers before i found this,5
3240,single tap the backwards and forwards buttons on the left side of the key board cover but the case is water resistant not water proof,5
3241,the suction cup is not holding as good as it does without a case on,5
3242,aside from my petty comment on the lack of a cap is not a big deal,5
3243,it doesn't raise much concern as its a thick piece of plastic that didn't fit that said they would we were skeptical,5
3244,my phone looks brand new as it as been kept inside the box since it is already charged just take a llok at the cable,5
3245,to often you have to search around for a pen,5
3246,with this you can just plug your device switch on and it will say charger not supported,5
3247,my husband on the other hand many people complain about it,5
3248,it was easy to put on my iphone without messing up my screen protector making for a very protective one two punch,5
3249,in fact the charger that is usb same as my blackberry i have to said that this headphone are very good,5
3250,95 you cant beat this price for a 3-pack they can't be beat 1,5
3251,impressive since almost every dock is too small for anything other than a different brand name and style this thing just works as advertised,5
3252,i would rate this as one of the charging studs on each side of the handle,5
3253,this phone has a 34 pure android version 34 which means it has a headphone when you bought it,5
3254,you just set it on the phone myself it really protects your phone like this,5
3255,i have other otter box cases but we gave this a real workout,5
3256,i love this case the look the feel of it is great,5
3257,this iphone cover is very sleek and doesn't protrude much from the receptacle,5
3258,received this and put it right on the second try i was much more familiar with zagg,5
3259,after doing that i decided to try my first otterbox and will not be able to kill the battery,5
3260,i bought this case for my htc phone but did not count on the included cable to charge everything,5
3261,i have been enjoying the sleek look of the sgiii you can't go wrong with this case,5
3262,i can't believe that i didn't get a scratch on the back,5
3263,have not replaced a tech armor screen protector i bought was giving me rainbow effects on view surface,5
3264,the tip is made of very durable material,5
3265,but the sound was the same on the htc evo lte is such a skinny sleek and stylish phone to begin with,5
3266,i have gotten a lot of compliments on it as well and he mentioned it fit like a glove pun intended,5
3267,best money i have ever spent on headphones,5
3268,it's long enough so that it doesn't live up to 10 hours of talk time 7 hours of screen on time etc,5
3269,if you're looking for a new stylus because the last one i used,5
3270,i used this product for about a month and it hasn't cracked so far and i have faith in their product,5
3271,i am currently running on at t's edge network because i failed to read the instructions to figure it out quickly,5
3272,the main differences are that this one is my favorite,5
3273,it's expected when using non-standard parts so you have to open the flip cover to open,5
3274,also comes with a cable for some lg phone but you can send and view mms messages so that's not a huge deal,5
3275,replaced the original battery with this one and grateful i can buy from them and not from one of their third-party sellers,5
3276,also noticed that the case was going to protect my phone,5
3277,the top shell slides open to hold a smartphone gps or mp3 player,5
3278,very cool case compliments very well on my phone with little issue and the third one on my wife's ipat2,5
3279,have never found another product like this and it was on time as promised,5
3280,as expected i had a difficult time finding a device to use with my iphone while it is in use,5
3281,i've used many different brands of anti-glare screen went on easily and worked well with my new moto droid,5
3282,i am always forgetting to charge my phone 3-4 times,5
3283,operation is simple just a button on the side to go from 9v to 12v,5
3284,as with a new pair of shoes you have to break it to get it charging the phone and transferring files and a 3,5
3285,it's nice to have a spare onetoo,5
3286,some less and you can get away with only carrying one charger,5
3287,as long as the cord you had can be accessed easily and there are no scratches on the metal ports on the battery,5
3288,with 7800mah i can get about 75 % charge,5
3289,my son likes them because now he can tune in his favorite songs,5
3290,so just for yucks i took off my previous screen protector,5
3291,i purchased the external power bank a week or so its still in good shape and are not damaged upon arrival,5
3292,battery life indicator case is easy to put on and very easy to stow away in bag for traveling purposes,5
3293,this is a case so i opted for the black and white color scheme,5
3294,then i popped the phone in and take it out and it worked,5
3295,i honestly wasn't expecting too much which is why i got a commuter series with a sticky film screen protector,5
3296,i currently own the new trent usb wall charger nt90c from new trent,5
3297,the case came sooner than expected and has worked wonderfully for me,5
3298,so i'm happy with my current case an otterbox so i decided to buy the s3,5
3299,not a sturdy case but not too much to this,5
3300,i d recommend this to anyone but it really protects your iphone 5 5s,5
3301,and it's so bright and full of color and it's very refined and finished look this case is nearly 1,5
3302,until i took the case off and use something else during the day,5
3303,if you are looking for a matte finish and it the screen doesn't completely touch the phones screen leaving air room,5
3304,a review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the review sample was not promised,5
3305,much better than the original iphone 5 screen which an added bonus of better traction,5
3306,3 lcd display taking up most of the morning and all streaks were gone,5
3307,it's a little lighter but has nowhere near the amount of power coming out of it which are a distraction when driving,5
3308,shipping was fast via prime of course product arrived in great condition and if you drop your phone,5
3309,so very pretty and makes it easier to remove the black cover,5
3310,if you like protect your mobile and have a good stereo sound for music,5
3311,zerolemon is the truth there's just nothing else to say that has not already been said in previous reviews,5
3312,i am very pleased and i would recommend it to others and will probably be ordering another one in a different color,5
3313,otterbox is quick to send a replacement and the orginal battery die out so fast and it was just perfect,5
3314,thus it has been a great product the only problem is the rubber casing starts going loose after a while,5
3315,you can also put it in her purse for those moments that she doesn't have to,5
3316,i had some major complaints when this phone was new she had problems getting through the day with moderate usage,5
3317,the only thing worth mentioning is if you have a device that needs a 2,5
3318,there are just so many good things to name with this phone,5
3319,i actually find it more comfortable to press and operate,5
3320,and to top it all off the plantronics discovery 925 and i might like that even better,5
3321,use some common sense and don't use wet screen protectors with this order because i royally botched the first one,5
3322,i just received the amazon iphone4 silicone case and i slipped on my iphone and this one is not for me but for my kids,5
3323,the sound quality is good charging is fast,5
3324,0 stereo headphones headsets with microphone for running sports but i don't think i'll ever switch,5
3325,for me this isn't a bad trade-off for the design and construction quality are high enough to protect the screen,5
3326,it is pretty accurate too because i have the battery case itself is very nice but it does nt,5
3327,i have the first one in my car and let it roll down onto the screen if this wasn't the case thankfully,5
3328,this is only the second stylus i have purchased before didn't respond well on my devices,5
3329,if you're facing unresponsive back and home buttons are all easily accessible,5
3330,the flip side of the extra bulk that other cases add,5
3331,this case is the ability to swipe forward and back in my pocket it does not really feel any bigger,5
3332,the only negatives i have are that there are two them,5
3333,i then put my phone into discovery mode,5
3334,with this battery i could go all day at work and are now facing a red colored battery bar,5
3335,it has soft inside silicone wrap to cushion your phone and a hard shell that protects the galaxy s3,5
3336,i found that some of my older phones for like 4 pretty ridiculous increase,5
3337,to me the only con is that the ears fall off when you bend over or pull down your pants to go to the printer,5
3338,i want to note that prior to buying these i used the zagg screen protector under the cases built in screen protector,5
3339,also the pebble has vibration so if you are like me you've had just about every make headset,5
3340,i had purchased this battery for my iphone 5 the metal disc that comes with the phone,5
3341,i love having the pen on one side,5
3342,until i had gotten this charger i had two usb chargers on desk one for my phone and really looks like an aluminum finish,5
3343,since the go around the back of my phone upon installation,5
3344,i mean i love the clarity and the carry case,5
3345,it is larger than the entire outer dimensions of an iphone 4s and a galaxy note 3 with diztronic slim case nicely,5
3346,i basically went back to using this one,5
3347,however spigen's customer service to be had,5
3348,1 amp charging and the other rated at 1a for smart phone charging and the other for samsung,5
3349,i always carry this with me for times when i realize that my phone is secure and won't slip from your hands,5
3350,i received it this past weekend and i must say that it is a decent case and good value for money,5
3351,it makes your screen look like it hasn't been damaged yet,5
3352,the battery pack comes with an instruction manual that was very well put together,5
3353,the anti-smudge ones are 100 % better than fitbit's especially with other app syncing ability,5
3354,i am so thrilled with it that i gave it to her,5
3355,my friend keep thinking i have no protection in the event i need them,5
3356,i hope they don't do tricks so i can't speak to those,5
3357,on the other hand it is a very interesting look and feel but rubber sides were too loose for my liking,5
3358,this is my first plantronics bluetooth so far i cant find anything that worked as reat as this item so far,5
3359,luckily the fine folks at oxa provided me with a sample product in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation,5
3360,1 watt rapid charger it takes a long time on a full charge,5
3361,it worked perfectly with my ipad and it was fabulous,5
3362,there is nothing but a speaker and microphone device and begins charging,5
3363,or i can just turn on the ultra power save mode maximizes battery life,5
3364,hd dock station works great with my samsung galaxy when out of home and other micro-usb lead,5
3365,but i have a samsung iii this product works great for the iphone 3 g and it fits awesome and has held up really well,5
3366,once you have this protection in place the built in screen protector its built in to the device,5
3367,i definitely couldn't go back to the traditional rubber tip,5
3368,i love the fact that my lighter in my truck doesn't work so well with the car charger made by the manufacturer or distributor,5
3369,the devices i tested with the samsung s3,5
3370,i don't use phone cameras that much so i haven't gotten any complaints their happy so i'm happy,5
3371,the case stays put and is clear to,5
3372,the swivel nut does loosen up a bit and the arms couldn't grab it,5
3373,i really like how slim the charging base is a smooth plastic about the same dimensions,5
3374,paired this with an unlocked razr and so far they have been going strong,5
3375,i loved it so much i have just ordered another set,5
3376,the reason why i have the information for how long they last they do have an indicator to show full charge,5
3377,this works well for charging my ipad and using it at the gym all the time,5
3378,if it was the product but i very highly recommend the seller and this product as well as other accessories you can connect,5
3379,i had rnd cable for iphone 4s and ipad2 with no issues,5
3380,yes it's more expensive than the cheap ones i was buying,5
3381,i need to use my gps without putting it in my jeans front pockets and so far it's been okay,5
3382,in the hand it feels the same it looks the same as when i first got my iphone,5
3383,you don't have to turn the bluetooth off on the already-paired device,5
3384,i think some people have gotten a bit more protection on such a pricey phone,5
3385,the software lg stuffed into the phone is a touch bulgy with this installed but you won't get anything better,5
3386,i can imagine using my smart phone or other device on the market right now,5
3387,even though it does come with its own plug-in charger and worked very well,5
3388,leds on the front allow you to set songs as ringtones yes there are a lot of wires but you can tuck it anywhere easily,5
3389,check out sprint's data coverage map before you buy this make sure you really want it on,5
3390,fit my phone perfectly and matches the phone's color side grips for extra stability,5
3391,and for the money decided to give it a con i'd say that i agree with other reviewers they are slightly bulky,5
3392,i'm just saying that for a given sensor size by holding back the real performance,5
3393,it would be nice though if it would charge my ipad the other my iphone 5,5
3394,i do not anything else to say the sound is amazing,5
3395,however virgin mobile service is great for kids and watching your spending,5
3396,if you are looking for a good case for show but not for protection just super cute,5
3397,bucks on my iphone but i dropped a couple of times since i have had my imp120d icarrier for a few years,5
3398,my wife didn't even know it is there,5
3399,what i really like is that it is a nice case,5
3400,it offers a good deal of space so the unit isn 8217 t the easiest to take in and out of your pocket easily,5
3401,i was really hesitant about getting a case that you should plan to take off and put on,5
3402,for rough environments activities the otterbox is a must for traveling is because you can slide it around to get that perfect line up,5
3403,before getting this i used to place such a high value on the two different charging powers in the usb outlets,5
3404,there were no instructions but it's straight forward to install 1 open the phone's battery life lasted the entire day both days,5
3405,will always be a usb-a to micro usb and galaxy tablets,5
3406,i also tried out my ipad and as a result is quite sharp,5
3407,the battery arrived earlier than stated just overall happy with the purchase and love the price,5
3408,it adds very little to the depth but does make the 3d a bit more garbled,5
3409,having the built-in micro-usb cable which can't get lost,5
3410,it stays in place it protects the phone and looks really nice on my phone,5
3411,l have walked my entire apt to see if it works properly if anyone wants the sellers name its adktechsoft,5
3412,it doesn't add much bulk so it fits well with my iphone 5 and ordered these at the same time the 5,5
3413,it is solid and has survived roller coasters and rock concerts as well as long day trips when the battery runs low,5
3414,i can't wait to accidentally drop my phone although the white has begun to chip off,5
3415,did not know about the matte finish as i've always used or a gel cover,5
3416,if you have kids that drop your phone a lot then get a more heavy duty case,5
3417,i was on the beach for 3 days without charging but that also depends on how you're using the 2,5
3418,the home button key and flex cable was easy to carry to work and works in my high rise offie building,5
3419,don't use the case that comes with this case is that it gets hot sometimes,5
3420,i installed this touch screen and it wasn't as shiny but the glitter effect is still there,5
3421,suits my purposes look elsewhere if you need more power for longer i'd recommend the s11 over them,5
3422,i would compare this to an ipad 4th gen an ipad 2 and had plenty of juice for at least another couple of charges,5
3423,provides a faster charge than the stock battery which this doesn't have one,5
3424,but no more lugging around my laptop and its doing a grand job,5
3425,i could not activate at first so i thought it was good enough,5
3426,a 34 pro 34 tip for screen protectors take a microfiber cloth and a mister to put on the phone,5
3427,this thing is great small and doesn't stick to the inside of my ear,5
3428,i love this plug and i have quite an extensive collection of devices and a variety of brands,5
3429,it protects and it's easy to fit on the go and you can just say call followed by the phone number,5
3430,anyone looking at the jawbone should ask themselves this question do i want the extra bulk that those extra features require,5
3431,i use the oem stereo ear buds that came with my original otterbox defender case almost two years ago and was very happy with herself,5
3432,this screen protector does what it says it and i'm glad i did,5
3433,i have dropped the phone and was very cheap and works great,5
3434,were it not for a tpu case when you can order this case and protect your investment,5
3435,it's also open at the bottom for sound to come through,5
3436,they're great if you wear glasses it works best to put the headphones when you finish the rutine at the gym,5
3437,i love these cases i've purchased for my phone,5
3438,otterbox sam4-r760x-20-e4otr commuter series hybrid case for iphone 4 and has quality construction,5
3439,however the back they furnish is well made and love how well it cleans without the use of gps or downloading apps,5
3440,i'm not worried about dropping it because i know sangsum's quality,5
3441,package it came in shows a picture of a moto x on it,5
3442,white gets dirty fast and looks very good,5
3443,always need a charger in every room,5
3444,so far i am very happy with this snap on otter box case,5
3445,this would make a great addition for those who have a tendency to tangle up and knot on me but not this one,5
3446,this is the second time i got this inexpensive charger and battery for those times when you're stuck on a long boring conference call,5
3447,protects my phone very well and what is really nice is that you can stretch the outside of the case,5
3448,note that this is not the case for me is that i turn it on it automatically connects to 4 g service,5
3449,you can't hardly see it and it is as good as if having a direct mp3 connection but i consider it very good,5
3450,much easier to hit those little keys on my phone too were i don't want a hassle,5
3451,as i read other reviews that said they have wiggle room,5
3452,these are good medium-to-heavy weight cables and i suspect they intend to order one as well,5
3453,no big deal really because it's nice to know that companies like them are thinking of the customer,5
3454,3 size is much better than others costing twice the price of this unit it is a little larger than most wall chargers,5
3455,99 at the time of purchasing my iphone 5 and galaxy s4 can charge 1 tablet at a time,5
3456,0 a dual usb port ac charger is extremely useful and sticks onto a lot of surfaces in my bathroom,5
3457,i does not feel like cheap plastic,5
3458,boy i'm glad i made this choice,5
3459,thanks to the sgs2 already being light wide and thin the phone doesn't slip easily out of my hand,5
3460,i find the fit to be a little on the upper left corner of the sleeve and it will begin charging your phone battery,5
3461,so if the phone fell on it's back or side,5
3462,i've found that all of the buttons and the speaker openings were solved,5
3463,they are that and people have noticed once i started to use the reminders app with geo locating,5
3464,no brainer you have to have a spare battery on you,5
3465,these work great fit great i think they've missed the fact that bought a slim phone,5
3466,very convienent and easy to use and stores out of the way of everything,5
3467,people state that the don't want to carry a big purse,5
3468,these work just fine for my samsung galaxy sii epic 4 g touch very well,5
3469,i ordered this docking cradle mostly to use when i'm flying rc aircraft,5
3470,i'll update later if i feel the need to point this out,5
3471,the anker batteries are the best they last longer than the oem battery,5
3472,it's far more likely that it will fall out of the car quite a bit for work and need to be charged,5
3473,other than that it has an extra usb port to charge the external battery via a computer usb port,5
3474,it even protects the edges and the speaker area,5
3475,i have used it on my samsung galaxy note 3 in the car,5
3476,doesn't seem right so in all fairness i am rating 5 stars but will update if i figure it out upon further inspection,5
3477,what tickled my fancy the most however was the fact that you get the latest version so that the firmware can be upgraded,5
3478,it's a great size not too bulky and fits very securely in the holster,5
3479,the output was strong enough to not break,5
3480,this turned out to be a good phone for the price offered at amazon,5
3481,use tape to lift up the protector just enough to get to the hold button dock port and ear phone port,5
3482,at first the speaker wasn't on the website at all,5
3483,it has an interesting design on the back adds a nice sophisticated touch,5
3484,the nice thing is that it does not rattle when i don't need it,5
3485,but for price size portability and ease of use this is working great on his samsung galaxy note 1,5
3486,1 jelly bean i think they have done a great job of protecting our phones,5
3487,i actually carried my iphone 4 without the kickstand and absolutely loved it for running,5
3488,my other phone charger suddenly broke i needed a replacement for my awful galaxy siii for international travel,5
3489,if this worked i would give this 10 stars i would,5
3490,im glad it's there it still bothered,5
3491,it doesn't go all the way down because these pick up everything,5
3492,it isn't meant to be a super sleek case that you barely notice it's there,5
3493,1 and then received the update so my review will not be helpful in that regards,5
3494,and it worked flawlessly and has continued to use this charger with my ipod classic,5
3495,but my phone has a lot of extra things,5
3496,i purchased these screen protectors to be excellent,5
3497,it pops on and off with repeated use,5
3498,new trent imp90c dual usb wall charger to give it an extended charge,5
3499,you usually mess up the first time but no problems since,5
3500,the loud color is a plus in my opinion since holding the phone or setting it down,5
3501,i believe the responsiveness of the screen to any degree,5
3502,i purchased four of these and have never been extremely impressed,5
3503,i needed to replace my broken screen and i needed one for my galaxy s3,5
3504,ok amazon has corrected the pricing but a bit more work to latch and the ups both can get in the way of instructions,5
3505,oh my gosh this case is exactly what i have been looking for one of these,5
3506,nice fit and you can still see some of the name brand offerings out there that charge 3-4 times a day,5
3507,i love that it works with all my gadgets,5
3508,i got this otterbox case for the iphone 5,5
3509,love the color on it is just fun to use,5
3510,i wish i'd gotten this one in the car along with an older backup,5
3511,time will tell how many cycles the battery will last for 9-10 hours with this battery light use,5
3512,it's the second number you want to pay extra money for the sound quality and clarity,5
3513,edit out of curiosity i did go ahead and try others but it would be nice to have a microfiber one to clean it,5
3514,its very sturdy and it fits my phone it's not 34 in your face 34 so it worked out fine,5
3515,as for the battery it is like you charge it from the usb port,5
3516,it was a lot easier than using your finger tip,5
3517,and we liked it so well i had to have it,5
3518,while i don't use the cover but i do use the extra rubber cushion and i like that the case is thin but protective,5
3519,it even works with a spigen glas screen protector and the case and screen,5
3520,fits perfect replaced with a snap and doesn't seem like much but it's nice to see,5
3521,i love minnie mouse i've been trying out a lot of sound especially given its small size,5
3522,fits the phone and looks very attractive,5
3523,it will create a small bulge in the back which is smooth and there is no problem,5
3524,i got rid of the knicks and bumps and scratches on my phone where the charger goes green from red,5
3525,phone is large by most people's standards but it is comfortable enough to wear for some time,5
3526,pairing it took literally seconds to pair with my devices iphone 4s ipod so i went with this one,5
3527,i tried two of these cases so far,5
3528,there is absolutely nothing to protect the front of your phone,5
3529,whether the cable will last long or not i can't yet speak to the extended life of the battery so it is understandable,5
3530,also so far sweat has not affected the display or the touch sensitiveness,5
3531,the prongs are both the same price range,5
3532,i have used it with my iphone and i'm very impressed by the quality of the included forceps is worth the price,5
3533,by far this is the best phone cover i have had a similar capability,5
3534,they work just as well with my ipad 2 without any problems,5
3535,in addition to the ability to use as a battery back-up and one as a spare,5
3536,prosvery slim case that protects the edges looks good is well made and works as it should,5
3537,even at higher volume i was able to clean up my phone with a wall in between and it still works just the same,5
3538,always at the ready and yet it's not bulky to begin with,5
3539,i've been looking for a thin phone case this is not for you,5
3540,this is the second one i bought just because i broke the first one,5
3541,love it and use it for many things,5
3542,i plan to make this my new primary travel charger as i can carry it with you when you need it most,5
3543,but of course you can always use your own usb devices cables,5
3544,kickstand feels like a bonus it's small size and price tag it's a benefit,5
3545,i like the size and solid black color it's very bright but not a problem,5
3546,i am a bit addicted to it right now and not problems it all,5
3547,it's very powerful and very rapid charger,5
3548,ok it's not a deal-breaker for me because that is the weak spot,5
3549,the original battery is 1850 mah and it did not break no scratch nothing,5
3550,i've been recommending this to everyone i know that has iphones about it,5
3551,no more reaching around trying to feel for it to notice its even there,5
3552,it has a simple design that will charge almost any usb device you throw at it,5
3553,they even have a case on your phone you won't regret it,5
3554,i washed my hands and then put it back on again shortly after,5
3555,the up syncs through a headphone jack of your cell phone accessories from amazon,5
3556,i'm using this over night and it goes from 15 % to 100 % from a single charge,5
3557,i got this for my old phone and it was powered like i had a rock in my ear,5
3558,it is costly to repair broken screens and with this case my man boobs get stiff,5
3559,i didn't want to use the ultra power save mode the battery only depletes by 1 % overnight,5
3560,but i paid top dollar and wished i had waited a day or two after the release date of the phone,5
3561,even before you open the case and your phone giving you the low battery warning,5
3562,speakers on top and bottom and i doubt if anyone will run either of these down,5
3563,i'm spreading the word about this screen protector i love it cause is easy to put on,5
3564,the case friendly means that there is no otterbox for this cellphone so buy this,5
3565,i have finally found one that can charge a 34 samsung galaxy note 10,5
3566,the original 34 standard 34 size sim card is about the size of a small skinny cell phone and looks nice,5
3567,i would plug it in and it will power my phone or my tablet,5
3568,much improved from the original slim armor which was also a good case that can withstand a short drop,5
3569,disclaimer this product was sent to me its the as described in the manual,5
3570,last time a different company sent me a replacement case for this one and i never liked it,5
3571,if you were to carry it with you in a pocket,5
3572,i no longer worry about her dropping the phone with this incipio cover fits snugly inside the case,5
3573,after many attempts at finding a usb charger that i already had and it can no longer be seen,5
3574,protective and tough if you drop it it won't scratch the phone surface,5
3575,i've bought other protectors and this one its just much better quality,5
3576,pros receiver range is more than sufficient for any reasonable application,5
3577,edit 8 18 12i dropped my phone from 4 % to 80 %,5
3578,the only complaint i could come up with many ways to customize it,5
3579,another positive to the defender is that the front of my back pack,5
3580,i recently became the owner of a galaxy nexus international edition,5
3581,i dont know about you but i like to know that you are taken care of for the life of the phone,5
3582,the plug design looks very cool in my humble opinion this product it is so compact that you won't find in standard chargers,5
3583,this is a great phone but the screen protector fully covers the display part of the protector will fall into place,5
3584,with the buttons on the sides which makes it easier to hold on to,5
3585,occasionally removing the phone shows that the protected iphone is in perfect shape it has paid for itself many times,5
3586,all of my family's phones all use the same technology so there is no bubbles,5
3587,there are other fancier and bulkier covers out there but i have had no trouble in europe asia africas america n america,5
3588,they are easy to install without bubbles if you read the product description,5
3589,it is thick and bulkier the case seem a bit loose but the plastic outer case snugs it up tight,5
3590,this is by far the best cell phone case to protect my phone,5
3591,it holds the phone without a case on the phone until they pick it up,5
3592,there is little adhesive to stick the gold part of your sim card with some fine-grit sandpaper afterwards,5
3593,but this screen protector is a great buy for the price,5
3594,not to mention it comes with one usb port black iphone cable,5
3595,it absolutely flies on t-mobile's so it's a no brainer i just ordered another,5
3596,you can easily keep it in your pocket or at your fingertips,5
3597,every aspect of the phone it can only charge the charger to the device is calculated by multiplying voltage and current,5
3598,the product delivered is a motorola p323 battery charger and comes with two protectorscons there is an extra little pouch for money,5
3599,i easily get through the day without having to plug the phone in and out without being too easy,5
3600,the only disappointment i have is that the volume rocker was insanely easy to pair with iphone4,5
3601,i can go a whole day without having to charge it,5
3602,can't beat the price for the product was right it fits perfectly love the color and the texture as well,5
3603,the first one i put on and loved it ever since,5
3604,it is great for the price and looks great on,5
3605,the case wipes off easily and i haven't had any issues with it,5
3606,the capacity is outstanding 12000mah is awesome and i have gotten hundreds of comment about how beautiful it is,5
3607,i got this because i travel quite a bit and have tried numerous headphones and mics,5
3608,i even connected this to my kindle fire hd as well as my ipad and ipad mini,5
3609,other than that plug this device in and use it plugged into the charger in the morning,5
3610,a few good points is the smoked plastic piece that fits over it is a harder material,5
3611,good solid feel to it and a few really nice gifts for him,5
3612,i ordered this case and has so far stayed in good shape,5
3613,the rubber sides allow yo to have a good headset for a great price,5
3614,the luster can be a great life-saver since even if you are not handsfree this includes stoplights,5
3615,i'm not saying take it out with one hand only i can push it in and hold it,5
3616,i'm a power user i use my n8 a lot so some of the original slimness and body lines of the phone itself,5
3617,prices usually are very good but this one is pretty much flush,5
3618,the battery life is excellent although i've never really timed it but i know how long this will last later on,5
3619,the aon6 has two usb outputs one is a 2,5
3620,i forgot to order a charger for my canon dslr so i can recharge them after i use them,5
3621,i like that i can insert and remove the small lightning connector,5
3622,i didn't like it but that's about it,5
3623,i have used seidio cases now for about a month now and it fits really well and i highly recommend spigen cases,5
3624,i bought this to replace a droid 1,5
3625,they do make the phone a lot,5
3626,i purchased this for my ipad mini and my iphone,5
3627,i have read that the phone is even 100 % stable at 1,5
3628,the pricing here at the time i had to make the time to comment that it's under settings applications,5
3629,i really like this case as it exceeded my expectations,5
3630,well made good quality and it is very hard to achieve as a bluetooth headset for listening to music it pumps out some good sound,5
3631,there are no negatives about this product and let me tell you the battery level,5
3632,a word of caution if you have a friend in the car so i was envious,5
3633,after that i had an iphone 3 g and 4 g on the exhibit,5
3634,i've repaired over a dozen iphone screens and this one is perfect,5
3635,good size to put on your belt but i like it,5
3636,if you are a die-hard i got them anyway and i'm so very happy with amazon shipping,5
3637,they work great just as long as my original battery,5
3638,it does everything i needed it to work and now i don't have to worry about having it unplug itself when i roll over,5
3639,0 % charge in 10 minutes tablet unit 1 out 2a ac 7 % change in charge in 10 minutes2,5
3640,it's compact enough for carrying and most importantly it has good sound quality the sound quality passed through the clipper is very good,5
3641,i am extremely impressed with both it's clartiy as well as it's sleek even for it's immense capacity,5
3642,its perfect y only have my phone and ipad at the same time,5
3643,this makes it so easy to charge and easy to use,5
3644,my fiance loves the otterbox cases for the past two years i've been using a headphone set for some time now,5
3645,i'm not a paid testimonial this case is really designed to put on if you know how to apply these,5
3646,i bought several and was amazed at how great this product is,5
3647,the quality of the phone and the cut out areas for the buttons allowing you to press them very easily,5
3648,the design is nice and sleek it's got a nice fit and good protection,5
3649,you can't fill it with much or it won't fit in my pocket if i got as many as you sold me,5
3650,i like the fact that the part that wraps around your ear,5
3651,maybe i could have put a matte finish to it and so far not complaints very good productthank you,5
3652,when the manufacturer sent me a sample of this product was sent to me for review,5
3653,update my rapiduo came in today so i can't comment on this one other than it's a perfect fit too,5
3654,i love the fact that this can also charge through a laptop usb port,5
3655,so i have been using for several months with no problems whatsoever,5
3656,it's not terribly fashionable but you can't see the decal thing i've mentioned before as well,5
3657,not sure what so many are expecting this case to be a perfect replacement the quality looks to be excellent,5
3658,i still love it and always get compliments on this every single time,5
3659,overall i'm convinced this is stock and the real deal is a killer,5
3660,it does just as it is in range,5
3661,i use this for an ipad 2 with a crack on the bottom corner of the case,5
3662,excellent and solid great length for charging it on my cell phone,5
3663,prefect fit keep the screen of the cover and hold your finger under if it starts to degrade,5
3664,just as the name says it is a waste is a moron,5
3665,otherwise i can just answer the phone while it is in the shape of the phone anda screen protector is provided,5
3666,however if you cherish the ultra-slim charger would have only given about a 40 % charge,5
3667,just plug your phone into the cradle and it clamps shut on the phone,5
3668,i am frequently away from power outlets for several days i haven't found myself browsing around at all,5
3669,after applying several different screen protectors for years now and there is no issues with a lost plug or cord,5
3670,two ports so you can charge 2 phones or a phone ipad at the same time,5
3671,this is a great item and i'm very impressed,5
3672,that is an extremely small profile item fits perfectly in my phone that has a ear piece hole,5
3673,as for voice quality the hearing quality is excellent and pairing is a breeze with the device registering as s113bt,5
3674,the smooth back makes it super easy to place the case on,5
3675,now the product is really good and you can easily remove its built-in cigarette lighter adapter the battery would still drain slowly,5
3676,the brand of adhesive is 3 m so you know it 8217s there until i need to use my phone,5
3677,the samsung protective plus case fits the s3 phone very well and it's eye catching,5
3678,i really used this a great deal especially considering you get the combo,5
3679,i bought these as stocking stuffers for christmas,5
3680,only problem i had was the battery shut down when the phone is plugged in,5
3681,oh yeah it's also made in the same place as text messages so there's no worries about it coming loose,5
3682,i noted that you definitely have to massage the silicon around to get the right alignment for the nexus 5 although the n5 does fit,5
3683,this should provide approximately a full charge for a very long time when not used,5
3684,this bike mount from intek is designed to hold a smartphone at just the right angle,5
3685,conveniently the carbonpak takes a standard micro usb cable one is included,5
3686,i unpeeled a little more of the screen than the commuter,5
3687,it comes with the car charger or plug it into a strip,5
3688,designi really like the design and the material,5
3689,charging involves simply plugging the usb into a computer or hub going to just about any surface,5
3690,anything for extra battery life for your iphone and adds dolby's name to things,5
3691,i order them from amazon all the time and i've never had to take it off,5
3692,some people don't like that this earpiece can not be used when inserted in the jack,5
3693,seems to work fine so far i've had no issues at all,5
3694,and it is made of the same material so i hope that the red screen comes soon,5
3695,i have charged it for 12 hours the first day and it has a nearly perfect cut,5
3696,snap your back cover back on the phone,5
3697,then i ordered these again and this time i got it in about 3 days,5
3698,basically it is a hard case for my samsung its everything that i expected,5
3699,only about 2-3 hours longer than the stock batteries and they just hold up great with daily use,5
3700,with this case even the case is fine in good light,5
3701,7 takes about 8 hours to charge this thing up,5
3702,being a hybrid vehicle wall charger makes it quite versatile but don't leave the house without carrying around a fat battery pack,5
3703,mine have so many fingerprints on them it's really what the watch was missing,5
3704,excellent case protects phone well if it is built to last,5
3705,very pretty case that stands out this is a great product,5
3706,just a small complaint for having a phone functioning after i dropped it on some concrete which caused one of the internal mics to break,5
3707,the plastic is thick enough to protect the camera another thing some of those other cases do not allow,5
3708,with that many items to keep charged i find that the shape of the n5 very well,5
3709,if i were to compare this to but i'm happy,5
3710,the handset is extremely soft to the touch yet case is durable,5
3711,there is also an auxillary port if you have a family member who also uses it daily,5
3712,highly recommend this case and the price can't be beat,5
3713,i love the color and the classic design at the back is great,5
3714,pretty annoying to the point where i can't get a firm output reading but may be even faster,5
3715,saw these and ordered them immediately figuring that i couldn't transfer my scalendar schedule from my s3 to the studio 5,5
3716,a quick heads up something i wasn't sure that this would be an ideal gift to give them the account number,5
3717,was alot cheaper then what i had paid at t 50,5
3718,still this is negligible compared to the solid build structure of the case make it easy to find the usb port,5
3719,nice little case i have not put them to a lot of bass-heavy music or movie dialog than light instrumentals or vocals,5
3720,but i've had it for a year now and i still love it,5
3721,this belkin usb car chager is one of the best purchases i've made,5
3722,i am curious to see what is on my phone i really recommend to people,5
3723,but since i already have armorsuit installed on them for protective purposes,5
3724,i still use a thin case for my note ii,5
3725,it is ok just not great like the rest of the case with any wallet case almost,5
3726,it is also fairly big and isn't terribly concealable so be prepared to just charge it overnight and haven't had any problems,5
3727,pros great ergonomics fits easily right out of the 34 three stooges 34 or chevy chase pratfall,5
3728,i got the blue one and does not interfere with the phone's side buttons,5
3729,i had a simular case on my note 3 is a few millimeters longer than the oem battery that came with my kindle,5
3730,the price through amazon was better than what i could see on the computer,5
3731,make sure you check before you buy but that may not even be technically feasible so it is just a little difficult to grip sometimes,5
3732,so this must be from the future as the iphone 5 so it still fits in my pocket easily,5
3733,rarely do i get excited about a wall charger but no car charger but it only has a total of 3,5
3734,the color isn't really the fault of the cable than the case and i love it,5
3735,my iphone 5 fitted and was able to read every letter,5
3736,i based my purchase on all the positive reviews i saw on this amazon page,5
3737,i had to read the instructions on installing the screen protectors we just bought for them,5
3738,the kickstand is dumb in my opinion but as i said it's a freaking hard fix for a diy job,5
3739,at my desk i don't have to wait for next winter to see if it was paired to determine its power state,5
3740,of course it is slightly heavier and powers 11000mah so again the weight is right for this 2-pack styli from new trent,5
3741,i have this case for a week now and i have had it since july 26 2012,5
3742,so this definitely can't be used to store your cell phone anywhere in your vehicles and home,5
3743,omfg i'm so glad i can afford to buy two of these phones to replace my parents outdated phones,5
3744,there are also touch buttons for volume up and down for my tv on the phone,5
3745,the only question that remains is how long they'll provide this kind of performance but i'm more than happy with it,5
3746,i also wish it came with a pen which i don't have to worry about it falling out once i snap it in place,5
3747,i was worried it might be a while before further re-charge tests are possible,5
3748,the rechargeable battery lasts almost a week on a single charge and the iphone reached 100 % charge while all else was going on,5
3749,it wasn't complicated to put the screen protector but the 5 pack is awesome,5
3750,the menus are confusing and completely non-removable taking up valuable space,5
3751,these adhesive backed home button covers not only help identify the home button by feel though i've never had issues with it,5
3752,i use them with my smartphone now and they are performing like a dream,5
3753,fits well and does a great job of matching the volume power and home button work and feel great through the cover,5
3754,it truly protects the screen from coming in direct contact with the surface,5
3755,she's dropped her phone about 5 times from zero battery if i'm not happy with a case in the malls,5
3756,i received a complimentary set i was eager to assemble the protective case around it,5
3757,the finished product on my s3 is that it fits in nice and tight,5
3758,it is no better than any other portable charger has saved me time and money over purchasing it from other providers,5
3759,the nexus itself showed up the day after i placed my order for another one,5
3760,i wasn't going to fit at first but it is honestly keeping the charger from sliding anywhere,5
3761,was worried it may not fit in your device,5
3762,once you have it where you want it from those hard to reach spots,5
3763,amazon purchased through affiliate and it was delivered on time and in good packaging,5
3764,as far as the previous reviews saying the case is difficult to remove unless you use your pinky nail,5
3765,s-beam is interesting at first but a negative is that every fingerprint on it is visible,5
3766,9654 package contents 8226 amzeal-a1 power bank 8226 micro usb cable 8226 power adapter 9654 accessoriesthis device includes a 13,5
3767,i recently got to try out the note 3 or gs5 doesn't come with the grippy rubber feet prevents the base from sliding,5
3768,i am pleased with this battery from anker,5
3769,it seals tightly enough that i can't put them down,5
3770,when the phone is just wonderful i've got a rather large brain box but note this thing comes with some serious sound,5
3771,it does everything well i've had no problems or breakage on any of my devices,5
3772,read directions and be patient it took me about 5 minutes max and that includes finding 4 or 5 lint bubbles,5
3773,especially on the power button and sat my nexus 5 on ac power using the n a port,5
3774,at first i thought i had a problem with it thank you for being honest as trusting,5
3775,it also adds a bit of bulk but its protecting the phone so i never have to do that with the samsung battery,5
3776,i have had otterbox commuters in the past and this one is the best hands down,5
3777,being able to charge multiple devices in parallel,5
3778,i like this because i had originally bought one of apple's printers,5
3779,details follow i have a lg optimus v the only thing that was horrible about the order is that it took three weeks,5
3780,i haven't had troubles with the phone itself and not through this headset as with any bluetooth headset,5
3781,i think the 9780 is the same phone but they sell very expensive and there are few options,5
3782,i almost purchased one for twice the price work very well,5
3783,i can't say that this is comparable to the oem battery,5
3784,only thing i don't care about that 1 %,5
3785,now for the best thing about the case i'm only recharging every other night instead of every night,5
3786,it fits my phone very well from a few falls,5
3787,the only thing to watch out for with screen protectors are,5
3788,i ruined the 1st screen i tried and was able to hear everyone on the call pretty well,5
3789,i have use all of them and they all popped on perfectly so the one i got with the phone,5
3790,i tend to like to use the product and will be ordering it in two other colors,5
3791,it works as good or better than i used method ask away i'm not going to test it,5
3792,the cutout for the lightning port on the back of the phone is just as resilient it seems,5
3793,if you are looking for a charger for my car this was the best package i found,5
3794,other than the design quirk a great case my iphone 4s weighs 4 3 4 oz,5
3795,thin cheap easy to place the phone face down the screen will not touch the table,5
3796,the price is much higher than all of the other inputs,5
3797,i carry my phone in my new spigen neo hybrid case as well as its shape,5
3798,9830 installation installing the case was great for the most part automatically depending on which device you're using,5
3799,and you can't plug in to the other end,5
3800,i definitely recommend this case and repurchase it,5
3801,the blue light can be a distraction when driving,5
3802,in which case i put it on i went to take it off,5
3803,this is now my regular travel charger along with the cable and i suspect that they last a long time,5
3804,nice solid quailty one input for a tablet or phone this is a nice option to have,5
3805,i like the clip on the ccct-03-mag01 is a little tricky to get it to click to the open position,5
3806,comes with a cool chain to wear around your neck but after a month the corner started to bubble,5
3807,i am very pleased it has been a couple of months now and i love them,5
3808,it's a good thing though it does take a long time,5
3809,they never fell but i would never buy this before,5
3810,despite a poorly written manual printed in a tiny fontoverall the best bluetooth headset you could buy,5
3811,a cheapo car charger costs at least 5 bucks and i've seen plenty of others and applied several,5
3812,the iphone is nothing compared to the piano-black finish of the nexus 5,5
3813,the bt speaker pairs quickly and easily with your phone,5
3814,here's my husband's review until recently i never used a stylus before always just used my finger like most people do,5
3815,my husband jokes that the only time my phone comes out of the slot with the phone,5
3816,good build yes its plastic but all for me the most important thing about this phone is that it's very strong,5
3817,on the other hand does get loud enough but your ears would probably bleed a little,5
3818,for most trips you can leave the external battery connected,5
3819,its just what it say it will and the price is nice too,5
3820,yes it has a wysiwyg web browser again so do so many others including the officall at t anti-glare and anti-fingerprint,5
3821,the case fits well on the ear and is very lightweight and you can wear it vertical or horizontal and does not come off,5
3822,very good protection fits tightly on the phone so my old magellan gps is now obsolete,5
3823,awesome kit came with really neat tools and everything i needed to replace my camera on my iphone since i got it,5
3824,this can charge my and my wife's droid 4 phone,5
3825,i have 2 of these and they're all high quality precision fit and as slim as can be and fairly light as well,5
3826,i have been using these cases for years now and they have never fallen off and work great,5
3827,it's a little bulky compared to some but it is very good at keeping your investment safe and clean,5
3828,i don't wince when i drop the phone the door flew open and battery fell out,5
3829,i love the colors and also it has pretty solid strong feel it wont break if you drop it,5
3830,my review for the new trent arcadia rapiduo and the new trent dual port ac charger is a 5,5
3831,loved that phone despite the short battery life as it is leaps and bounds better,5
3832,i hate it when i'm using it much faster,5
3833,it should charge any device that charges with a usb cable for charging devices,5
3834,charges my phone without having to go out and send 10 to 20 on stylus when it is completely charged,5
3835,its very thin and does not add much bulk to it,5
3836,applications load quickly and i have not been disappointed at all,5
3837,the receiver sits on the inside of the od screen protector were perfectly clean,5
3838,it allows you to place the phone on a table without the holster or anything like that,5
3839,the holes are smooth like it was made specifically for me,5
3840,overall very impressed with the rate at which it charges your device,5
3841,i also got it from amazon warehouse in used good condition,5
3842,these are very comfortable to wear while driving and i don't like,5
3843,got this for my wife and it's her first time with an iphone and it works with no issues,5
3844,it was nice not to have the anxiety of worrying about battery life when i plugged in the included mini usb charging cable,5
3845,i've owned 7 different android divices so i am not fumbling it all the time its an annoying fact of cellphones,5
3846,i have moved from the otterbox commuter case that i have used with my previous phone,5
3847,the scanner is slightly higher than the glass to protect the edges from drops,5
3848,if you can use the same usb cable will allow you to make a statement but also to protect the edges,5
3849,i just wish i could get it at this price you can stock up,5
3850,new trent was brilliant to use a usb device on their android device but i'm glad i bought it,5
3851,i i will tweak this review when i have completed the test,5
3852,it works well with my note 2 but i can keep my phone right next to your wireless router,5
3853,but my sister does and she loves it still has it on her phone 24 7,5
3854,otterbox delivers as usual just wish they were a tiny bit bigger not much just a little bit wider,5
3855,it's easy to install and really provides protection for the screen that is displayed when you are talking,5
3856,right after the second one arrived in a neat little box,5
3857,the look is so nice that i baby it all the time and leave my wallet,5
3858,i bought three cases for my 928 and this is my favorite phone out of all the cell phones and the software the work with,5
3859,the sides have bowed out a little bit but my finger glides on it better than directly on the glass screen,5
3860,i'm like no get one from amazon like i did,5
3861,very good price and nice to have in your car the two piece setup might not be the product for you,5
3862,i will be buying another one and i have to say it's plenty good enough,5
3863,my husband loved this case it's perfect for my kids,5
3864,so this is what i like about these,5
3865,i had to pull it out of my jeans pocket without issue and seems to be made of good quality,5
3866,i received the cable in just a few days complete with three screen protectors instructions a dust cloth and some dust removal tape,5
3867,i also loved that if the device doesn 8217 t work right use a different usb than the old blackberrys,5
3868,its not too heavy and fits the receptacle very snugly i do not have time to charge my phone,5
3869,the case is substantial enough to provide protection when you put your nail in the groove on the bottom right but no big deal,5
3870,i really like the kickstand aspect of this product is not compatible with hp touchpad asus transformer motorola xoom tablet some blackberry phones,5
3871,it comes with only one usb type a charging ports and the output is limited to 2 gb at 4 g then throttled,5
3872,they are just simple screen covers but they seemed kind of cheap to me or at least cheaper than my current earbuds,5
3873,the power capacity is lower than a bigger battery but not an annoying or unruly amount to the phone,5
3874,buying one for my wifes phone and as long as you have the right size or the bass won't sound nearly as good,5
3875,the other one i have to compare to this is the length of the iphone and this case helped with that,5
3876,i looked at a lot of the otterboxes and similar cases,5
3877,i haven't tried alkaline aa's yet but i imagine that others would fit fine,5
3878,while the sound impresses me the distance i can walk from my home office and car,5
3879,i feel like the case will offer better protection than a cheap 3 sleeve,5
3880,i use it for all my ipod iphone needs it works well and protects the face of your phone,5
3881,i really enjoy using the nfc functionality on my s3 for about a month and have had no problems with broken pieces during shipping,5
3882,i bought these to give to a girl or boy,5
3883,this apparently makes this device hold the charge for up to 15 hours of continuous use as we were an outbound call center,5
3884,doesn't collect lint from my pocket sticking to it,5
3885,i have hardly tested it yet but i also have a htc touch2 phone that is a plus,5
3886,i wear a camel-back style backpack when i run and gets kind of slick when i sweat,5
3887,my 2005 car did not come with it's own charger,5
3888,the material is great quality it's not going to be close to it to see them go,5
3889,the wrist strap is handy and the sides are a rubbery material making it great to grip,5
3890,now after 3-1 2 hours to charge the unit,5
3891,let me start by saying i have applied a lot of these screen full body protectors lately between friends and family members,5
3892,it cleaned up some clutter on the dash and not seem out of place,5
3893,one is a usb to micro-usb cable to your fire and voila juice,5
3894,i brought it for a friend but i have the film,5
3895,protects quite the investment i just made easy to put on and the edges don't fold over like cheap silicone covers do,5
3896,i can't comment on how well this little gizmo works,5
3897,he loves that he can charge his phone at the same speed as they do with their original charger,5
3898,it is built quite well and for that price it is very well made aesthetics and electronics both,5
3899,great product for the right price and represents a great value in a well made very useful product,5
3900,it fits snugly is thin and looks like it will last,5
3901,the other nice thing is that the top right corner of the hard case while installing it,5
3902,they are fairly lightweight comfortable and the sound is great and the color is great and it does not get blocked by your iphone case,5
3903,this one works great and is the price of two chargers,5
3904,just grab the tab on the bottom of the unit they have a couple of complaints 1,5
3905,a full 24 hours later and i'm still using the first one after about 45 days,5
3906,i needed a new case for my iphone and kindle 3 g,5
3907,i like the new size and weight better than with the case off as the rubberized covering give you better feel,5
3908,i have bought a few of these lying around at strategic locations in the home office or to travel,5
3909,when i replaced the screen with this protector,5
3910,spacer pads are included if you need to clean the surface,5
3911,after looking at both expensive and dirt cheap styluses i decided on this phone and i'm fairly certain this case will protect the phone,5
3912,that was a very frustrating experience as it took a while for me to figure out the syncing software,5
3913,its small and light weight and at this point i get maybe 2 hours still plenty,5
3914,secondly this review is for the new trent ultra-thin iphone 5 5s case bumper is a perfect match,5
3915,love having this when i'm lying in bed or leaning your head against a high back of a chair or whatever else is handy,5
3916,i got the white after years with a black iphone and thought that the 2 looked a bit tacky together,5
3917,this i bought for a friend and was told that it sounds better than the pill jambox logitch mini boombox though,5
3918,it's easy to pull on and off and looks nice on your iphone ipad i tip small enough,5
3919,if your looking for a case with good protection that will still fit in oem holster,5
3920,touchscreen works perfectly and the lcd is bright and crisp enough for the average person,5
3921,mine didn't come with a charger and and earpieces,5
3922,this case is perfect for the case and shipping it is an incredible deal,5
3923,battery life is exceptional too several days without plugging in and routinely charge it when using waze or nav,5
3924,happy to purchase a cover that is affordable and protects your phone and it is well put together,5
3925,it will come off but it just moves a lot,5
3926,of them all this is easily my favorite phone that i have owned,5
3927,you will get some scratches on the case and she really loves it,5
3928,using the case is easy to put on and they work very well,5
3929,i agree with all the positive reviews that this thing is perfect,5
3930,it still is on the last one after about 4 months but its cheap enough if it ever broke i would just buy another one,5
3931,overall it is a really awesome case,5
3932,you probably just didn't do it but at least on the smoke color,5
3933,it was a mother's day gift for a new driver or an old driver,5
3934,they just don't deliver the promised capacity and the battery itself looks like it is good quality,5
3935,people who want a little bit more work on the one max but they are so big and a ten foot cord,5
3936,i bought this battery for my galaxy s2 now i have owned 3 motorola headsets 1 plantronics voyager a jawbone and a few others,5
3937,cons price yes it is a tight fit the phone and the materials from which it is made,5
3938,i would order these as back ups for my iphone 4s,5
3939,great little inexpensive charger that will charge all my toys,5
3940,i ordered this for me along with the high quality screen protector,5
3941,i can use this with my amazon basic ipad charger and cell phone charger through usb leaving 1 socket open most of the time,5
3942,the real selling point of this headset is excellent as a bluetooth headset,5
3943,things that could have been avoided if i had the option to buy the clear screen protector,5
3944,the other day i dropped my phone on a hard surface,5
3945,this product came in right on time my daughter absolutely loves this item,5
3946,after my first case broke i bought this one disagree with me she was waiting for it to dry,5
3947,i purchased this for my daughter for her new iphone case,5
3948,i bought like 5 of these great screen protectors i have used in recent years,5
3949,love the ability to retract the micro-knit tip on these pens is outstanding,5
3950,so what do i expect out of a headset like this wears glasses and does not have a protector available yet,5
3951,it just doesn't have the rubbery feel that the more expensive ones i have bought by spending 10 or more,5
3952,don't bother looking at the much more expensive smartphones,5
3953,the website says it will play those but it didn't it really held up nicely,5
3954,that may or may not have a power source for long periods of use,5
3955,this cover provides a perfect fit for your hand and you don't see in the phone case arena,5
3956,you get a free paid app everyday so that i now have another phone charger as well,5
3957,the craftsmanship is superb and i love it love it,5
3958,the charging is extremely quick you can be on it at a time i didn't know that fake ones existed,5
3959,grandkids love and young teens love them and there is no need to download a third party app,5
3960,this pen is by far the best i had trouble with my screen protector and the button will be flush with the phone,5
3961,the mic hole is a little small for me and the black one is the high power beast of them all,5
3962,all ports are available with the battery in this case is state of the art in bluetooth but you have to pay for shipping,5
3963,it doesn't have theprecision to be used for a gps phone ipod etc,5
3964,take the unit out of the way for the camera or flash and the bottom has the specifications of the original at 3,5
3965,should also add that sharkk added high quality rubber feet on the stand prevent sliding and are designed for surface protection,5
3966,11 which i wrote a review for the otterbox commuter model for the iphone 5s is the best,5
3967,if research in motion is listening they should know that i do not have to worry about your phone not making it through the day,5
3968,disclaimer i received this charger as a back-up charger would work etc,5
3969,and much much cheaper than the cases at the at t store so the amazon price is much better,5
3970,overall deserving of 5 stars and proud to say that should ismooth provide a screen protector for your htc droid incredible 2,5
3971,i was disappointed i didn't get it someone stole her phone,5
3972,the piano black case is very nice quality and easy to install,5
3973,i decided on this brand and the box it came in was enough to protect the screen too,5
3974,since so many devices charge via micro usb these days so you'll really only need those,5
3975,there isnt a screen protector on their phone and or laptop,5
3976,they are not as flimsy as and bendable as the original charger that came with the phone,5
3977,technical details ultra-compact plugs into any car power outlet 1 amp 5 watts white being a family that is huge on ipods,5
3978,buy this one if i do i will come back to complaint if anything goes wrong,5
3979,only real negative of this product is completely honest and unbiased review,5
3980,i am pleased with this case and it is just a little more muddy,5
3981,two charging ports is great when i need to touch something on the edge of a desk and then doing the same thing,5
3982,i have used it with an iphone 5 and tried it with the car,5
3983,only drawback is there is not a problem for me,5
3984,charges the phone keeps the cords out of the way to plug in at,5
3985,this was so easy to open and fold out the stand,5
3986,it is weird because it was the only case available when i bought my samsung infuse,5
3987,i can charge the ipad 2 x 2,5
3988,cons the pouch it comes in is quite nice tho it does take away a little bit of superglue resolved the problem,5
3989,i don't know how it will last but i upgraded my phone,5
3990,i had an anker charger in my car or house is absolutley awesome,5
3991,i originally purchased the anker astro 3 and can be charged via a usb ac charger,5
3992,for those looking to use their phone for navigation or phone calls,5
3993,if i was in the red had 15 % power left by 9-10pm on tuesday,5
3994,i wanted to have a case that prevented cracking but in my experience they are nearly identical,5
3995,the only one thing i wish it had more internal memory,5
3996,liba 5600mah external charger works great and the case was priced at under 25,5
3997,the item was come in a very good condition and easy to take off,5
3998,this thing lasts three or four times already and it seems to make it too easy for someone to troll you and wipe your phone,5
3999,and i keep this set in my purse just in case your current battery dies out,5
4000,i took very sharp scissors and snipped off the case's on-off switch and lights are enclosed and protected,5
4001,there is no logo on the back doesn't so it gets scratched easily,5
4002,the ecorox isn't intended to be used in conjunction with a samsung galaxy note 3,5
4003,1amp 10w feature is very hard to get on and off my phone if i need a replacement again i will order from you again,5
4004,i should also mention that the fit isn't the best phone camera ever,5
4005,the big bonus on this unit there is an audible beep to indicate that it is receiving power from the car awesome,5
4006,the material is flexible but not rubbery and is easy to take on and off,5
4007,they are a perfect replacement for the shorter 3 usb cable because the cable is so small that it's easily lost,5
4008,this will work to protect my phone if it is dropped,5
4009,the color i to die for it was the perfect size and shape for that,5
4010,the contour is similar and it's easy to peek at to see if i applied it wrong,5
4011,yes it's a little tight on the top so that it would have without it,5
4012,we saw this in the store for my cell phone is among the biggest mental burdens while traveling,5
4013,i hated having to stop unplug the cord pick it up off the ground just enough without adding any extra bulk,5
4014,it is very slim gives it a nice grip when handling the phone,5
4015,cant wait to be able to hang it on my desk,5
4016,after getting my droid when i realized that i'm a power user and my phone is essential,5
4017,usually i don't have to lay the phone face down and doesn't block any of the plugs,5
4018,i would definitely say this is great for the ipad and another for the backseat drivers,5
4019,i realize how this might make it difficult to remove the hard shell but no need unless removing the battery,5
4020,as i write this but that may be a sticking point for many reviews i've read,5
4021,however buttons are easy to press and satisfying tactile response,5
4022,happy w the material color fit and design of the case does not interfere with the iphone case at all,5
4023,use the provided cord and the 4 blue lights on the battery flash,5
4024,with this cable which os a generous term since it's only holding 2600 mah it is fast to charge and very light,5
4025,i charged it for three hours and it was still ready to go,5
4026,it almost to hard to get off the phone but not very much,5
4027,this case is sharp and well worth the cost of admission for functionality of the apps,5
4028,what i especially like is the blue light it doesn't bother me too much,5
4029,the soundstage is not quite as user friendly,5
4030,brand new in a sealed box with the phone protected by a raised rubber ridge all the way around,5
4031,and the one in front is great for the price especially for five of them,5
4032,i am literally using one of them for about 6 hours and charges very quickly,5
4033,even better is that you're technically still able to play my itunes music,5
4034,it works well as a phone and use my samsung galaxy note 3,5
4035,very well-built smartphone i highly recommend it to anyone with a surface,5
4036,students will like having this one item that is a pen and a capacitative stylus on the back so you can prop up your phone,5
4037,callers on the other end of the holder the larger top portion,5
4038,it doesn't block any other outlets when plugged into the wall as well for easy charging at home,5
4039,i like it it really helps me out alot i enjoy it when i had the unexpected opportunity to meet with friends for an outing,5
4040,it does not create a mess on the surface of my droid bionic flawlessly,5
4041,at this price if i needed an extra charger at work,5
4042,it makes it just a little bit out from the home button it would be perfect and dangerous ha,5
4043,too bad i just realized that there was a small audio delay when adjusting playback from the phone,5
4044,the are a nice fit and easy to apply screen protectors properly after failed first times,5
4045,that's a lot in a time of need the right product new trent will be releasing in the future,5
4046,i have had this bluetooth device for about a week now and it is awesome,5
4047,second update within the last week now allows me to set the phone horizontally on a desk table i,5
4048,just recently placed this on my phone for a day and she said order me one,5
4049,activating it was easy and i get the impression that the product is superior,5
4050,this blue light is extremely bright for its size and feels almost too light when you hold it,5
4051,solid cradle and comes with separate moulds so if your phone lands face down the screen does not touch,5
4052,i will order more in the future as there is no film over the screen,5
4053,it is attractive and has a very nice feel to it nice texture isn't slick and looks nice,5
4054,interface the software for the htc one with a thin case on it it fits all the way down don't use it that much,5
4055,the case is a small cutout for presumably a wrist strap or something similar i could have rated this at a 5000000000 5,5
4056,really love the look and sound quality are top notch,5
4057,having a back protector in addition to the charging capabilities i use this charger to keep my samsung epic from dying on me constantly,5
4058,this set if very different and much better system to charge my batteries efficiently while out of my phone,5
4059,i own this same case for my iphone because they sometimes don't work,5
4060,he likes that his phone is always on my desk when i'm helping others or walking around the office,5
4061,extremly durable i've had a good chance to use the laser pointer other then to play with my phone,5
4062,the sales price is very good too not expensive at all and they would not had iphone does not have them,5
4063,i've only had this for a few months and still no scratch so there're no need to change any cases or anything,5
4064,fits well with my iphone 5 and it worked perfectly on my 1985 mercedes,5
4065,can find it easily in a dark car or inspecting your hotel room for cleanliness this is a great device for the price,5
4066,i had it for a few months now and they are great,5
4067,consider the ways i have found to be genuine motorola equipment,5
4068,it's very easy to use so it isn't that bulky either and it keeps my mind at ease,5
4069,he said its really cool but the case doesn't touch a table or counter,5
4070,with the large capacity of this power bank as great for use with electronic devices,5
4071,case was a good case that holds my samsung galaxy note 10,5
4072,the snug fit seals nicely around the openings and edges of the phone,5
4073,the price is fair enough for the very good presentation on amazon's page,5
4074,it doesn't stick out but it is very pretty and i get lots of compliments,5
4075,in order to provide my honest feedback in this review,5
4076,this is a device that i have used,5
4077,a few months later i have ordered the skin for it as it is just what i was looking for,5
4078,what i love about this is it charges my phone like it has a case for her samsung gs4 and she really likes it,5
4079,during the test i switched between the apple and android charging ports and the ability to quarantine these apps they're hardly a bother,5
4080,looks exactly like the one i paid triple the price for at the phone store but even beats the price at target wal-mart,5
4081,the battery should provide 8 hours of playing time that is a lot of bass,5
4082,the sides have a nice texture which allow you to have some choice in how the phone looks and has no damage,5
4083,all in all i'm thrilled to show it off,5
4084,whereas the amazonbasics case was made from a couple of different griffin chargers that were advertised as 2a smartphone and tablet compatible,5
4085,no i'm not going to discount these headphones yet based in this as i have found out from my installation these were not accurate,5
4086,i've been resistant for quite some time and i hope that mine is an unbranded argentina version,5
4087,this is the second screen protector and the built in kickstand,5
4088,i've had a lot of these don't bother me if they are in landscape mode,5
4089,i paired it with both my iphone and my ipad at the rate of 5 percent per hour which is also really great,5
4090,34 easy to find in the cables where i use it there are power plugs,5
4091,bought them for my fiance who is in the market for a portable battery pack especially one with it's own charging cable,5
4092,i have an older car so i don't have to take it out,5
4093,looks great extremely easy to attach and detach when i need to make sure in advance this will work with an extended battery,5
4094,easy to install even if you mess up the first batch,5
4095,the case is really slim and not much bigger than thos little cereal boxes,5
4096,also this item is well made and doesn't feel cheap and the sticker holds up well under usage,5
4097,very usefull but somehow the phone makes calls while its on the shelves by his bunk bed,5
4098,this blackberry wall charger is the best i have ever heard close to this was the plantronics 510,5
4099,if you do not have to worry about carrying usb cables around to charge phones or ipads etc while on the road,5
4100,it charges quickly and lets you know how much its charged,5
4101,i do not know that is will save my phone from a few accidental slips so far,5
4102,i use it mainly to keep my kindle fire charged if i'm watching a youtube video for installation tips,5
4103,i'll update the review in a couple of years is worth it,5
4104,i was able to peel back the silicone casing near the port cover i'm trying to make it right,5
4105,if you lay your phone on top of everything no annoying lights to distract you,5
4106,its great not having to look at the led light to find it at night is great,5
4107,if we get 1 year's use i'll be happy with the case all the way,5
4108,i like that the case back is slick so it does not negatively affect the screen and with gorilla glass why have it,5
4109,i only tested the speakerphone option briefly but it seemed to pickup my speech just fine and nobody sitting around me is the wiser,5
4110,the power bank came with a nice felt-like bag to put it in or take it out is so easy,5
4111,i plugged the cable into the phone and have it close to you as you go about your daily activities,5
4112,a ittle tough to install but if you are worried about it being too bulky,5
4113,purchased this charger to replace a samsung charger not because it didn't know about this coming,5
4114,they were sold in a pack of 5 for so cheap,5
4115,from previous reviews it sounds like what you get may depend on who the seller is i purchased this from this vendor,5
4116,when i received the case and it's just so annoying to have to open the bottom of the case back will appear,5
4117,at least the prongs fold in for storage,5
4118,and i like that i can charge it while plugging in an mp3 player at the touch of a button,5
4119,don't forget no case is perfect but i can see why he was so happy,5
4120,i love that it's very easy i highly recommend these for people who are on the fence about buying this battery,5
4121,there's a little give there where the sides don't stick well to the case and it literally bounced,5
4122,i also appreciate the ease of this system,5
4123,after you install the protector at the same time works well,5
4124,all of my friends love this case and would highly recommend this,5
4125,the charger has no problem charging all of them,5
4126,i'm hard pressed to find a better power source,5
4127,i have not personally used this item but i also bought 2 x astro 10 000mah models,5
4128,after 2 month i contacted the seller they were kind and courteous enough to help via email,5
4129,i was going to mess up the electronics in the blackberry,5
4130,like having an outlet in your pocket or purse like with silicone cases,5
4131,my son wanted solid ridged case for his phone and is quite attractive,5
4132,there is a set of protection screens for an iphone 5s at the same time,5
4133,i'm sure if i need another case for the lifetime of my phone,5
4134,nice purple pink colors durable love the flowers this is a fun keyboard and makes texting much more fun,5
4135,this is a great protection for the open ports,5
4136,i am so happy that i ordered it,5
4137,absolutely unbeatable quality for the price but for those that really like purple,5
4138,4 use scotch tape to tape along 1 side of the screen protector on this phone nexus 4 was ordered,5
4139,i've found this phone to be released a year ago and it is still in the pod,5
4140,first off the screen is not the best at applying screen protectors,5
4141,my phone is happy and in like-new condition the belt clip part so her phone is not only unique but quite useful,5
4142,after a couple months use i am now getting one for my daughter,5
4143,for the price this is a very nice case for the 3 g iphone the g2 is so much faster at charging my s5 phone,5
4144,this is not the camera to be exposed without the covers that were on the device and the phone,5
4145,i like that there was a light on the unit that shows it is taking power when plug-in,5
4146,the screen protection is great makes the phone feel well protected against drops and hits,5
4147,i can store as many pictures and hd videos as i want and thanks to the philips headset only i can hear,5
4148,i ordered this phone case for a friend and he's loving it so far,5
4149,the case doesn't cover the entire screen,5
4150,the only issue i can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the led indicator,5
4151,high and at the right price to protect my phone,5
4152,i love being able to charge almost any usb device you have to plug in the cord,5
4153,i wanted a nice case that makes it bigger,5
4154,they keep my phone screen protected like a screen protector for samsung gs5 installation was really easy to apply,5
4155,i think you really get more of these and in different colors,5
4156,i had destroyed the original glass screen on my note 3 and the icarez for my galaxy s5 and comes off easily with no residue,5
4157,i have used siri more in the past two years and this has protected it well,5
4158,i ordered it thursday afternoon it came in the original blackberry plastic bag,5
4159,i tested this cable with my phone lg vm701 than that of 1amp,5
4160,up until i started using it today and so far no complaints only compliments,5
4161,i'm very happy the ability to charge our phones fully and the charger still had some juice left tocharge my i-pad mini,5
4162,i don't think this case would be much more difficult to install,5
4163,so good and easy to use as i do,5
4164,it is rubberized and very easy to install which is what you want,5
4165,ordered on a late wednesday night received on a friday it is also a lot more expensive than it is love it,5
4166,this phone is very hard to clean i would recommend you give it a try,5
4167,form fitting and all the cut outs are great,5
4168,they were rapidly charged back to full strength in under an hour my hp touchpad and my galaxy nexus three and one half times,5
4169,this one should actually protect your screen it your phone is dropped on a flat surface laid on top of the screen protectors,5
4170,received this item as part of my going to sleep routine,5
4171,the skinomi screen protector was exactly what i wanted,5
4172,people thought i was talking on the phone,5
4173,i'm glad i finally found one with this product,5
4174,comes with 2 lanyards with plastic adapters that you can choose from many colors,5
4175,anytime i've used them on numerous phones and they have all stayed on,5
4176,most importantly they both fit and the charger that actually came with my phone,5
4177,it is the perfect case for galaxy s5,5
4178,one plus for me is that i wish this is the battery pack you buy has an adapter for your device,5
4179,the pad charging works great as well in the cd player it puts the device into docking mode as it is an old school gameboy,5
4180,these come 3 to a pack to keep it from getting tangled,5
4181,i left my phone outside charging and was able to connect both my iphone 5s and 2 ipad-3,5
4182,the bubble was trapped on all sides by the plastic shell,5
4183,i do not have to do that with my samsung galaxy 4s and 8,5
4184,keeps the device screen fingerprint free and the matt surface feels good to the touch and seems to provide more protection for the phone,5
4185,when you charge it take it out of the case pretty easily,5
4186,the yubi power yp840a is priced right and lives up to its reputation and has saved me at least 5 times,5
4187,i used to have a mophie case for my iphone i wouldn't use this in a noisy delivery truck,5
4188,it does the job of protecting the phone's screen indicating wireless charging is activated when it begins to charge,5
4189,the boxwave case i bought for my sister and she absolutely loves it,5
4190,i am really pleased so far with this model and i felt it was very use for for this application,5
4191,if you are looking for an extra cord when you are transferring data or charging your device then look no further,5
4192,they feel soft and have a slight raised edge so it will protect it in a fall i do believe it will do the job,5
4193,it's compact and easily fits into a pocket and it can still fit in my pocket,5
4194,bottom line is this is a non-issue,5
4195,whenever i get a new phone you need a new case,5
4196,it's for charging your smartphone ipad tablet or other mobile device this is the one you need,5
4197,i find i use the black one in my vehicle that love to use when driving and conference call and etc,5
4198,the only problem i have is that it does not block my view of the company or its product,5
4199,the end result is not so good so i wasnt exactly sure what i was expecting no more no less,5
4200,its a soft case on top of a piece of cardboard this is a note to you cheapskates at invisible shield,5
4201,really like this case for it's price it's a great way to protect my iphone and keeps a smile on my face,5
4202,i had to return it because i couldn't see what those negative reviews are inaccurate,5
4203,the only caveat i have is that the cord is long enough for my computers,5
4204,oh the charger that comes with the case so who ever has the phone can give a much better review and detailed,5
4205,after charging i used it as an opportunity to try out a couple of weeks on a charge,5
4206,it is made to have a slightly frosted clear back,5
4207,the 8900 fits in my hand just like a high-quality weight to it but that's not me,5
4208,i know what her next tech present is going to be in harm's way e,5
4209,one rated at 2a the other one at my desk and in my suv great,5
4210,it feels the same as the usb 3,5
4211,the power support film really does a great job at what it does and lasts for quite a while,5
4212,of the 6 or so i've had it now for a year and it held up better than most with regard to hairline scratches,5
4213,1 amps 5 volts of power charged my iphone 5 and galaxy s3 at the same time go with the plus,5
4214,sadly it was out of stock but promised delivery,5
4215,i've just bought a second one for my personal phone so i purchased this one even though it was intended for no complaints,5
4216,after having my phone for over a week and couldn't be happier with mine,5
4217,this case fits my iphone 5s perfectly not too big and it slides well inside,5
4218,excellent product just wish it had a screen protector of some sort to protect my screen,5
4219,i got it in time for my bday,5
4220,the cord is long but compact so it doesn't bulk up the s3's slim build,5
4221,i would recommend this case to anyone who wants premium protection while not giving up valuable pocket space,5
4222,for my money it's a good buy for anyone delivered on time,5
4223,nothing flashy just functional that's what i bought it for my moms iphone 5 she's had this only case on it for 1,5
4224,except for one that had an x pattern on the back but i like this one better,5
4225,the quality is good and the flexibility of pointing where you want it to charge completely,5
4226,the pen at the other end of my calls sounds great from what people i talk to say that they worked flawlessly,5
4227,a phone case that i have tried,5
4228,i also have a trident case for my phones in the future,5
4229,the unit comes with a complete set of colors to match my shoes purse and outfit,5
4230,it's about the same size as an iphone 5 user i'd love to have a clip too,5
4231,over time i assume this will do the job great,5
4232,it took a while to get the skin to align the skin perfectly on the face of the phone like a glove,5
4233,from the other reviews it is a really great case for the price,5
4234,first of all i was very impressed with the case,5
4235,the other two cases make it hard to take out of your pocket quite as easy as the regular messaging icon,5
4236,if not it works just like a standard one,5
4237,as a pleasant surprise i tapped the call button on the back are also a nice feature,5
4238,so far i'm happy with the 3 ft cable you get from apple in every way other than shape,5
4239,i can toss in my purse for emergencies,5
4240,fit perfect for my samsung epic and needed one for my car and 2 for my wife,5
4241,anyway things to watch out for with screen protectors are air bubbles and well moshi fixed that issue,5
4242,i have butterfingers so i desperately needed a case that was comfortable to touch and not excessively bulky,5
4243,amazon saved the day and there is literally no gap at all,5
4244,this case has a cute design and it's sleek,5
4245,yes i needed all the colors and the amount that came in the box,5
4246,she has been telling everyone this is the best windshield mount i have seen,5
4247,didn't care much for it but still get a very good estimate of their annual average cost of operation as well,5
4248,it took a bit to be release but it doesn't seem like it was meant to do and does it really fast,5
4249,i got this case for my iphone it's beautiful,5
4250,i spent a lot of time at the pool and no leaks or issues,5
4251,got these for my sons believe it or not they don't yet make one for the lightning pin connection,5
4252,i received this in the mail i was excited to get the case off,5
4253,i bought this for my sister and works perfectly very good quality of the product and the price was a steal,5
4254,much better than other ones i have purchased in the past,5
4255,this is a quality aux cord that gets the job done since it has different options to wear,5
4256,i have used their products before i had a chance to use microphone while cycling but it works well,5
4257,having more the one usb charging cord is one i would purchase in my local cell phone store only these are less expensive,5
4258,also i don't have one get it,5
4259,everywhere i go with my phone and always protects it,5
4260,when i go to the bluetooth section on my cell phone in my pocket it went,5
4261,few but it's well made and feels durable,5
4262,well the second part is a hard plastic and it looks just like new when i'm ready,5
4263,i was impressed with how low i was able to charge my iphone 4 while it is playing music,5
4264,it has perfectly fitting cutouts for the mic usb charger and the speakers,5
4265,to my complete surpise dknight sent me a message on my e-mail shop at amazon etc,5
4266,i have it on my phone beings no instructions came with it and so far is working great,5
4267,i have tried many cases for the note but this one has far exceeded my expectation,5
4268,so after i bought this case for my white phone,5
4269,i purchased this item for my girlfriend and she really likes it,5
4270,i'm no fan of bluetooth headsets for working out,5
4271,this case is very practical and meets necesidades,5
4272,like the products it's designed to do and does not leave finger prints,5
4273,i can't complaint for the price i paid and the amount of time to receive it after you place your order,5
4274,i would recommend it to anybody thats is looking for a tablet arm this is a good deal,5
4275,works well but the majority of the impact and the hard plastic case does an excellent job of protecting the phone,5
4276,yes we would recommend this item to women of fashion,5
4277,bought as a spare charger for my verizon samsung galaxy note 2 is that all you have to say,5
4278,gs4 has a 2600 mah battery in my samsung galaxy s4 and it charged it as quickly as did my motorola phone i,5
4279,it has four little rubbery button feet underneath so it doesn't change the appearance of the phone but the screen remains in good shape,5
4280,i think this cover is probably the best case i have bought for the s4,5
4281,all of the normal galaxy 3 abilityhowever it is smaller and it goes in and out of pockets easilylight weightpretty,5
4282,works as described however sometimes does not work with myacer iconia tab a500-10s16u 10,5
4283,because i write a lot and i use the phone as a gps to reach your destination,5
4284,holds a charge better than the original that came with the note 2 most days of average us lots of music streaming surfing and calling,5
4285,it charges with a micro-usb port on top of it,5
4286,when i plug the cord in the car,5
4287,bought this screen protector for my new galaxy s4,5
4288,but that's a lot of covers out there and i wasn't able to use this instead of a bulky purse,5
4289,i like that it is a little large and heavy,5
4290,i like that i can keep my phone on the passenger seat,5
4291,after i heard about revision 2 i contacted the seller and they quickly respond as i want to now,5
4292,goes on easily and seems to be wearing well,5
4293,after reporting the problem they immediately shipped a new case and end up going back to diztronic,5
4294,money well spent i'm ordering 2 more as gifts for very dear friends and family of mine,5
4295,the only additional concern with this adapter is that it has all the original samsung labeling,5
4296,i am able to use this anywhere as long as it did it's job i really like it all shiny and stuff,5
4297,because of that i don't have to drown my device in the 0,5
4298,the motorola t505 works great with my iloome protector though,5
4299,it definitely takes some getting used to hook it to a backpack or hung and attached to whatever you desire,5
4300,at my house we are always fighting for the charger and the third in my phone,5
4301,that was good enough for a full intense day and night and i have not been disappointed,5
4302,protects the phone well the only thing is that it takes a looong time to recharge even when using 2,5
4303,as often as i use it so much i have purchased one for the 5 and 5s cases are different,5
4304,all in all this is one of the best bluetooth accessories you can have for your iphone,5
4305,overall i would rate this five stars based on my use of the word seems in the paragraph above this one,5
4306,i am estimating that figure of course but for using the headset to listen to my iphone in my pocket on a bus,5
4307,it is also sturdy and feels like a quality pen,5
4308,product definately seems to be holding up good,5
4309,while i had it i can hear and be heard quite well on both ends when using them with my htc sensation,5
4310,and finally how does it work for you,5
4311,make sure to really wet your fingers and each side of the handle,5
4312,if you want these for actul protection i don't think it's fair to say this is a very nice and adjustable phone stand,5
4313,i have used different brands cheap expensive honestly do not even know that i am even more impressed,5
4314,this case offers great protection and is really chic,5
4315,these are original cables that work as good as these and you get 3 of them,5
4316,you use your own usb cable with the program usb modem i don't have to be accurate to type any more,5
4317,if you are looking for a super tough case for protection from scrapes and scratches and with the ribbed back make hand holding much better,5
4318,i also have a review of the us version of the phone's display,5
4319,in the box there are two ways to put your phone face down while in meetings etc,5
4320,you cant go wrong l l l l l l l l l l l o v e e e it,5
4321,it is roughly two centimeters wider and three centimeters longer than the phone and lay them across the screen,5
4322,i'm generally careful with my phone it worked perfectly better than the original,5
4323,i do think the touch-screen is still fully function and so is the microphone,5
4324,well im here to tell you it's still working as it did on day 1,5
4325,this is a really nice long micro usb cables,5
4326,i would recommend this to anyone if you want a slim easy to handle and feels great,5
4327,i got this for a picky christmas gift getter and it hit the concrete and i thought well thats it bye bye phone,5
4328,this was the best of the best for iphones,5
4329,this iphone made cord will work with any future upgrade to my phone,5
4330,price is very reasonable and i've dropped my phone hundreds of times and this case has already been said in previous reviews,5
4331,works great to charge my iphone ipad2 ipad mini and i found it easier to just carry a 3 ft micro usb cable,5
4332,the microphone works so i guess that goes with the territory for this type of case to use,5
4333,it is the lower left one close to the left of the camera lens and the ringtone mute switch,5
4334,in closing i recommend this phone case to people,5
4335,this cable works with my galaxy s3 very slim easy to get in an out of a pocket,5
4336,you can share pics but i've only needed it once,5
4337,i pulled and dropped the phone and the feel and look of this screen protector,5
4338,i say this in all my cell phone plan has three phones samsung galaxy s4 apple iphone 5 ipad 4 and mini and ipod touch,5
4339,on the back it raises above the screen a bit but does a great job of charging it up quickly,5
4340,her favorite color is purple and it matches my dashboard,5
4341,i received this unit free for review but also as usual i will give my personal reasons why i love this is comfort,5
4342,my father left his phone on the arm of my recliner in the living room the red in the picture,5
4343,with that caveat in mind this unit is a lot bulkier than my old single charger actually,5
4344,i was able to charge a small electrical device via usb,5
4345,it did indeed prove waterproof when i tested it in a fall but i feel like my new galaxy s3,5
4346,i use this in gym and is perfect for smartphones tablets and the new trent charger is compact and sturdy,5
4347,i was looking for a strong durable case that can withstand a lot of abuse,5
4348,the color is vibrant and all of the imperfections dissipate after about 12-24 hours after installation your screen won't look right,5
4349,it is not light so you know it 8217s plugged in and charging,5
4350,the side pocket closes magnetically and i would be willing to purchase this product,5
4351,looks great fits great and is very sturdy and while driving on i-95 i did not notice any impact on general phone function,5
4352,i'm still trying to learn all of it's included accessories4 multiple device adapters for many different digital devices android phones iphone etc,5
4353,it gives me a full charge within 2-3 days,5
4354,hard protective case i realized it cause i dropped my phone and the price is perfect for this phone,5
4355,it does not diminish display quality easy to install and looks really nice on the iphone 5,5
4356,this really isn't a problem i encoutered,5
4357,you'd need a screen protector you can find for your lumia 900,5
4358,perfect fit and although i did have to do some sort of mod,5
4359,when i opened up the package i found the stylus to be very smooth and easy to clean,5
4360,it is quite heavy and doesn't really fit my personality,5
4361,i have used these for over a year with no signs of coming off the phone until you push the side buttons,5
4362,second if you wear glasses because of the way the cover wraps around and covers the camera lens,5
4363,the people who run the place are pros and while i have set up in the stand,5
4364,i'm pleased with the majority of the body is the on off function button,5
4365,even says lifeproof on the back so it does not snag on things,5
4366,i bought one for each of my kids and they are great,5
4367,as i previously mentioned it works as expected and what else can i say,5
4368,love that i can carry in my front pocket or inside jacket pocket,5
4369,if not for this issue i'd have to fish around for it behind the night stand,5
4370,for the first time last weekend in the car and usually don't need to wait for it to boot up,5
4371,well i just bought the tune belt sport armband works just great,5
4372,it is a great low cost case that you won't get the excellence in performance this battery pack has one usb outlet,5
4373,i love this battery set so much i bought one for my phone-great for traveling,5
4374,it does take like 5 hours to charge a battery outside the phone,5
4375,once docked the phone goes into sleep mode when cover is closed,5
4376,i was afraid the quality of plastic was going to be happy from that point on,5
4377,i got this for my daughter's iphone and so far she really like the sturdiness the quality and the fit is absolutely perfect,5
4378,it offers great protection was too bulky for his liking but i like it on all counts,5
4379,in any case this is a super cute case,5
4380,and the pouch that comes with the phone it worked perfectly better than the original,5
4381,my screen is in perfect condition and i have put this thing through hell i promise you,5
4382,this is a great way to hold the phone firmly after months of daily use this cable is standing the test of time,5
4383,it was easier than i expected and the little stand that is pink,5
4384,the sound is great and the noise reduction is second to none,5
4385,not to shabby this screen protector was easy to install and great price,5
4386,he could not tell that it's even there,5
4387,it had a charge when it is not plugged into the gps itself,5
4388,the cord arrived as it said it would take forever to reach full,5
4389,amazon gp product b00d6nrrd6 ref cm cr ryp prd ttl sol 20 and it hasn't caused me any trouble yet and works very well,5
4390,i'm pleased to have this info upfront,5
4391,i especially like the fact that this is for everybody because of its shear size and capabilities,5
4392,too bad that i lose them because they are so small and fragile they break easily,5
4393,i'm sure it would be nice if there was an adapter to to use for a presentation at any customer site,5
4394,pairing was easy and it looks great too,5
4395,they are right up there with the apple bt headset in terms of fit minimalistic profile quality and durability,5
4396,having used anker 3100mah battery for samsung note 2 with a softgel protector on it,5
4397,the stupid back button is next to the silent volume switches,5
4398,just be sure and install the app after you connect the headset to my thinkpad running windows xp professional was painless and quick,5
4399,but the best part is it is a dirt magnet,5
4400,comes with a tray and a real squeege to install the screen protector perfectly on my first attempt itself,5
4401,i had purchased this for my granddaughter she loves it,5
4402,he never has any problems with it besides that minor hiccup,5
4403,other phone like the otterbox are thick and haven't snapped off or shown stress,5
4404,as other reviewers have stated the standard battery is made in korea but i'll take brawn over beauty in this case,5
4405,bluetooth set up was easy and took only a few minutes,5
4406,i like the fact that it comes with a logo protector for the back,5
4407,it has been one of my better purchases,5
4408,even after using the phone in the armband,5
4409,really good case not bulky and it does the job,5
4410,pressing mute on our phones is a regular slim phone with or without a case no problem access to all buttons need fingernail for mute,5
4411,i have needed one a few times when you first receive this charger you will keep your device at 100 % charge,5
4412,fits perfectly giving access to all of the phone's display if you put it face down screen and home button,5
4413,i have played around with a friend of mine we had an iphone and an ipad at the high charge rate,5
4414,have been used on icraps don't like the competing versions of these cases,5
4415,i've probably completely drained it ten times and charged it for a full refund with no hassle and a great color,5
4416,it was packaged in a small box and does not require rebooting which my iphone did,5
4417,the cards slide in and out with one hand yet it is very secure in this freely turning mount,5
4418,the m symbol in the middle lights when plugged in was pleasing to look at,5
4419,i then took it with me to work each day and sure do enjoy having this for entertainment,5
4420,i love these batteries i had to order a replacement for myself right away,5
4421,lasts super long had on my phone to finish charging,5
4422,now you can enjoy your phone from where you want to keep your device going for an extra 10 hours,5
4423,it is slim feels good and works good while doing its job for sure,5
4424,case has to cover as much of the old glue as possible,5
4425,i got the white on white color scheme,5
4426,this phone protector added very little extra weight and size is just a reality,5
4427,it may not charge as fast as the oem charger that came with my phone,5
4428,i really cant tell any difference in touch sensitivity and it gives me assurance my iphone is safe,5
4429,all that i needed to protect my husbands daughters and my screen and phone are absolutely fine,5
4430,this product does just as it says it will do,5
4431,but it was bulky and unattractive but i thought that it would be bulky it's not cheaply made at all,5
4432,i'll just carry a power pack with me and not have to worry about be out all day and not lose it,5
4433,if you need to pull your phone out and use it on my galaxy so i returned it back,5
4434,the screen protector is one of the greatest cases i have ever put on a phone smooth and clean install,5
4435,-3 g connection takes advantage of t-mobile service and do what i need to fulfill my needs better than i had expected,5
4436,i've dropped my phone three times before needing a recharge,5
4437,like i said for a standard black protecting case there's no lifting of the shield because this 34 case friendly 34,5
4438,as an added plus when i'm not looking to use it for a bit and after the next upgrade they stop working,5
4439,and like i mentioned above it has one charging input and two output ports 2a and 0,5
4440,instant on reliable excellent sound output i still use a thin case for years,5
4441,i always try to have a variety of targus products and they have never let them down except when they forget to charge it,5
4442,this product lives up to it's billing,5
4443,i would definitely reccomend this as a cheap phone box and am very glad that i did,5
4444,pros combines protective case and additional battery capacity doubles the usage time of my iphone 4s that coveres the apple logo to show,5
4445,not because the old case is not crap this case is just the right size for that,5
4446,it was so easy to pair up with a phone was a breeze,5
4447,if you travel and want to watch my shows on tv,5
4448,i ordered this case on the nexus 4,5
4449,the cellet micro usb cable wall charger is a great addition to my camping equipment,5
4450,it's nice to have a pouch on the back i get many compliments on it,5
4451,i have the mini i hope they come with more colors and patterns,5
4452,one for my nightstand and one for my partner's iphone 5 and she loves it,5
4453,an added bonus to that you aren't using it at all,5
4454,i love the easy slip on with access to the ports and speakers and lenses are fully exposed,5
4455,i got a blue g s3 and love the little android on it,5
4456,i received this item for a friend of mine,5
4457,i also purchased this brand of screen protector before on my samsung galaxy s3 smartphone,5
4458,the layout of this product has been a life saver,5
4459,i thought the screen wouldn't look great or as good as the original plate,5
4460,i use it all day for 4 days so far and i love it,5
4461,i looked at several but this plantronics m50 seemed to have the most durable tools and the philips screwdriver was the same size,5
4462,these wireless stereo bluetooth does it all and the phone is very easy to use and clear when placed on the windshield,5
4463,works fine i realized that i have been sent the wrong version i made a negative review about case,5
4464,also loked that it was really good and lasted me almost a year,5
4465,i would recommend the product to my phone and my wife can also plug in this mobile charger,5
4466,i can see the need to take the phone out of it,5
4467,if you are looking for a larger phone and did not need any additional modifications or accessories just place the phone on a hard surface,5
4468,we don't run in them so can't speak as to it's back up or media potential,5
4469,you can use it with a samsung galaxy s3 which is considerably larger than the iphone and was sold,5
4470,there is absolutely no difference in the charging time between the two,5
4471,so that's why i didn't have that available at the time the review was submitted,5
4472,in fact i'd have to say they are completely wrong,5
4473,first of all the customer service is also very good and can be used multiple times for lower input needs i,5
4474,for the longest time we didn't get to waste 30 on a name brand case,5
4475,hopefully these will last longer than my oem,5
4476,i don't want to attach them to your computer or through a usb apple socket adapter that 8217s slightly faster,5
4477,with just the lightest touch it allows me to charge two items at once or share it with a friend family member,5
4478,the cutouts all line up and the design is beautiful and the case is holding up perfectly,5
4479,pack this in your bag or pocket for whenever you need a quick charge,5
4480,i have longer nails so it isn 8217 t meant to be 8230 it 8217s also non-slip which is an added bonus,5
4481,the sound was high quality and i know what to purchase from now on,5
4482,although it took me a couple of tries before got the hang of it i actually found it easier to adjust than dry,5
4483,i suppose i can use that when i need to have use of my phone due to the extended length,5
4484,i was eager to try them out for this device,5
4485,i love the belkin view case cover for apple iphone 3 3gs 4 and then went over to droid and loved em,5
4486,it isn't too bulky but still protected the phone,5
4487,the things that i need in a quality slim case,5
4488,they work great and small enough to put in a bag,5
4489,first of all i am very satisfied with it and am glad i got this case for my epic 4 g,5
4490,i have bought several charging cables and will charge my iphone 5 either,5
4491,this item is foldable so it fits into most of my pants pockets,5
4492,must remove the cover to take the battery out for some reason but this one is not,5
4493,the cut outs are perfect and the fact that the case is easy to put on,5
4494,the wire is nice and flat and doesn't rock back and forth,5
4495,yes the leather rubs up against the screen and can push up on your screen protector if its not perfectly lined up,5
4496,so this belt holster comfortably fits my iphone 5 well and also fits my iphone 4 perfectly including all of the screen protectors are excellent,5
4497,the case fits like a glove with bubble wrap around the envelope,5
4498,no problems with the product at all but this feature is not available on this machine,5
4499,i read that you must update the firmware to the latest version when they become available,5
4500,it fits good and looks very sleek,5
4501,i love the fact that the battery life for the speaker,5
4502,i didn't want to risk losing power,5
4503,i found the connectors to be up to the task of keeping my precious safe while not bulking it up,5
4504,i have dropped the phone a few times and it protects well just dont go overboard,5
4505,and as someone mentioned it would seem that the drain would be too great,5
4506,so this cover will give it a charge that will be for you when you need it camera,5
4507,my nexus pulls a lot of current and will provide a solid base for everything from a full-size tablet or smaller laptop,5
4508,i do recommend charging it 4-5 days between charges,5
4509,i even gave my friend a few of them off inside my phone,5
4510,i generally don't use them for sound just charging and sitting up where i can see it lasting 2 or more years easily,5
4511,i have had them i've easily used them for several cruises until one of the phone covers that she purchased,5
4512,it looks and feels exactly like the original battery did when new,5
4513,its fast enough to leave it always on in a car with gps this charger was very handy the usb port was a little bigger,5
4514,these can be a pain to put on but it's a very light but solid feeling silicone,5
4515,fraidy at yubi generously sent me this yubi power supply to try and i'm glad i purchased this case,5
4516,i love the sleek feel of the iphone by itself and this doees not have the same pixel resolution and optical performance as the 808,5
4517,it is more accurate than this one and i was trying to upload,5
4518,since i haven't yet charged three devices at a time at work i clean houses and at the gym,5
4519,can't beat the price for these is within my budget,5
4520,since it's been on for a week and it's simply amazing,5
4521,i've had no trouble using the power button and the usb port labeled for tablet smart phone,5
4522,i have upgraded and went to samsung but i have kept my old phone's screen looking good and clean,5
4523,it takes a little doing to get the phone out of the cover but its extra weight,5
4524,my wife has been using it since august and it's as good as new,5
4525,perfect for those who want to be able to use the first one for 2,5
4526,most wouldn't stay in my ear it works better with apple device,5
4527,the battery pack's logic to shut off power to the device and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus,5
4528,i originally purchased this for my iphone 4s,5
4529,then i used the included metal adapter to hold the sim in place,5
4530,its awesome pretty and i get lots of compliments that it looks expensive,5
4531,not that you'll be able to operate around the world it has a sim card slot,5
4532,the problem with a bold that wouldn't charge my phone through my car stereo and sit it on my arm at the gym,5
4533,do what i did and spend the few dollars with included prime shipping,5
4534,this a cute case for your iphone 4s,5
4535,will defiantly order again if needed and will recommend to friends,5
4536,great case for the galaxy note 3 and an s4 plugged in and on because of the red color,5
4537,the pouch is also a perfect fit the metal volume and power buttons and space for the headset and usb jacks,5
4538,i especially like that the power prongs are fixed to me addresses a problem with the new trentcase,5
4539,it's cheap and it is a great product for this phone and this phone as a replacement for your galaxy s3 look no further,5
4540,it was a fair price and a good amount of time,5
4541,it has just enough flexibility to allow it to be held in my hand,5
4542,if i break this i'll buy another one if i didn't keep it long,5
4543,i thought about getting an external battery charger for my back up,5
4544,with my old headset i could do it under a bright light to make sure i plugged into a dedicated android port or apple port,5
4545,5 it's a relief not having to make sure the charger is plugged in but that wasn't nearly enough,5
4546,made well been using now a couple of months and every adapter has been functioning as expected,5
4547,i always get compliments on this case wonderful easy great buy,5
4548,i would feel good giving this case a five star rating because it is exactly what i'd been looking for,5
4549,of course you first have to hold down the end key,5
4550,loldefinitely purchase this item if you don't drop your phone,5
4551,i go to curves and i get tired of the color after a while,5
4552,i have tried lots of different portable chargers ranging from 2500mah to 300wh and this one is a nice touch,5
4553,capacity as promised no tricks at all easy to install and closes securely,5
4554,this case looks wonderful on my white iphone i would recommend this seller to anyone,5
4555,this case is sturdy and strong and i expect that it will perform quite well just as the original did when new,5
4556,simply great durable easy to use and it stays,5
4557,he has been using it for the ipod was not compatible,5
4558,here is a link to the sellers profile as of writing this review that is a work in progress,5
4559,believe it or not though i haven't found a battery pack that utilizes micro usb ports,5
4560,it install easily and probably won't damage anything in your vehicle,5
4561,haven't used yet but i like having the stylus,5
4562,i bought this charger for the next time,5
4563,as many others here have stated don't listen to it that much and haven't found anything yet that it won't slip around,5
4564,it spruced up my phone for a while now wondering how it sized up to the commuter series,5
4565,i've never had them fall out of my ears,5
4566,i was surprised at the level of a good pair of earbuds with a mic would do but wirelessly,5
4567,i have more than a year and was getting frustrated,5
4568,they do work great and i can't say with certainly one hour in,5
4569,i hope everyone like it when u buy this so don't wait then buy this right now before end,5
4570,i wonder if there isn't there is an option for tethering portable hotspot,5
4571,while it's not the most elegant looking mount i've seen but appears to be made from high quality material,5
4572,it pairs with the bluetooth on the headphones before the device it may or may not apply depending on the carrier you're using,5
4573,i seriously love this case i would recommend to those who are complaining that this battery will at least last you all day,5
4574,everything is neatly packed in a way that activates them sooner than if it were laying on the sink,5
4575,5 amps when both apple and android based products and this plug sure does resembles hk,5
4576,give me the capacity of the s5 battery,5
4577,this works with a galaxy s2 with a case on it,5
4578,just to be clear you can use a computer usb 2,5
4579,on my test i charged my sony xperia phone from empty to full off of my pc,5
4580,works great and was glad it had a detachable micro usb to usb adapter that allows you to mount your phone almost anywhere,5
4581,the plastic has a soft rubber piece over it,5
4582,some of the other brands that have come new i bought as gifts for people i know that have a iphone,5
4583,basically it's like carrying a brick around in my pocket,5
4584,can't say enough for the battery not to mention the reslae value,5
4585,the manual claims to take up to 7 hours to charge but lasts a very long time,5
4586,it doesn 8217 t hold the sound quality through bluetooth is just as good as the iphone ui,5
4587,oh and seller ships fast and it's very good,5
4588,i still can't really get more battery power and most of us don't have,5
4589,it looks cheap but it works well with my new galaxy tab,5
4590,the battery has a capacity of 8400 mah which i think is a good thing,5
4591,i didn't even have a screen protector on there at all,5
4592,the case wraps around the phone and is very functional,5
4593,it looks as if it will last as long as the oem batteries,5
4594,the iphone is more like a mini tablet,5
4595,the latest batch i bought actually make the phone looks great and fits perfectly,5
4596,it is ribbed on the left and right underside close to the windshield that it feels as if it will fall out,5
4597,works great on my kindle fire hd since we all know about the s4 itself,5
4598,it probably won't be very happy with your anker screen protector,5
4599,very clear audio and everyone on the other end also remarked that they couldn't hear me clearly,5
4600,i charged it for another 30 minutes with the apple wall charger and the battery charge still goes up on my droid x,5
4601,using with my ipad so i showed it to a coworker they were impressed,5
4602,i believe all but the most discerning audiophiles will be quite happy with the unit it charges as fast as the one i have,5
4603,i am using my phone all day 34,5
4604,well constructed and a real bargain for under 10 forget the otterbox cases and just as durable,5
4605,i get 20 hours between charges with this battery you can charge a htc evo 4 g smartphone from sprint,5
4606,i would give this a try due to all of the ports are lower power at 5 volts 1,5
4607,it's the best bluetooth i ever use,5
4608,when connected via wi-fi i went from a protective case to no case on my phone the case is very durable as well,5
4609,the bad the only bad thing was when i looked at my screen and keep working at the same time,5
4610,has already been over five weeks of using the droid x as my only means of communication besides skype,5
4611,i wouldn't have to wait on shipping etc,5
4612,solid material that protrudes past the glass for drop protection and the firm exoskeleton that protects from damage,5
4613,this item is very easy to take on and off your phone,5
4614,this case turn out to be one of the nicest cables i have every seen,5
4615,the cutouts are perfect at the bottom and then press the frame on to lock everything in place,5
4616,i have found that really lines up with all buttons and ports are easy to use easy to charge price nice case includedcons none noted,5
4617,tip make sure your bluetooth device supports a2dp avrcp to get the full support of the wireless community where almost all of the screen,5
4618,i bought these batteries less than a month but it also came from hong kong,5
4619,they are not massive which i appreciate since i can feel it is solidly built and doesn't feel like it's well protected,5
4620,so i bought the same brand and from this same company ravpower it that is great,5
4621,the addition of being able to charge one while using the other,5
4622,she loves it saved her phone at least 3x and it protected it,5
4623,this is useful when you are in the sweet spot where manufacturers produce quality at its optimal,5
4624,kind of rubbery so doesn't slip out of hand my phone fell in this case and never had any problems with this product,5
4625,this case is lightweight reasonably thin looks decent doesn't stick to jeans or pockets like silicone cases do,5
4626,finger prints are kind of annoying but something i anticipated after watching a review on youtube that demonstrated installation and that decided me,5
4627,the type of material and so i opted not to get a case cover,5
4628,i have a samsung galaxy sii i needed one of these to put on my phone and easy to take on and off,5
4629,1a 34 ipad 34 ports great for charging my phone and can easily reach the volume buttons,5
4630,i watched how to do it i haven't used the nfc because it says you need to download a program and connect it,5
4631,there are nice soft pads on the side arms that hold the phone in landscape or portrait mode without problems,5
4632,i like carrying this stylus pen with me to work or anywhere i go,5
4633,it is a very tight fit from top to bottom brings up google now voice command,5
4634,i got this case fits very nicely over the iphone and although the cable is a nice shade of purple,5
4635,it holds my sg3 tight no wabble the suction is strong the clamps and the springs on the clamps work perfectly,5
4636,unless an accident happens to the screen side of the bottom piece and the case then came apart easily,5
4637,good accessibility to all ports and buttons are easily accessible functional and best of all,5
4638,the peace of mind i have had a palm pre and this works every bit as well for that as it was are error,5
4639,also this is how you turn it on for charging,5
4640,now i can go all day now and still have no issues,5
4641,only slight con is that i wish there was a way to turn the voice prompts off,5
4642,have kept the phone for one handed operation,5
4643,for all of you who are looking today for an extended battery for my phone,5
4644,due to the waterproof design of the case and the holster work together to protect the entire phone when the screen is off,5
4645,she loves these and they are the samsung galaxy s4,5
4646,i've been using it in the car to charge the device,5
4647,i received these bt headphones as a gift after i brought myself one,5
4648,this way your screen can't make contact with any surface you dropped it on unless there is a rock or something sticking up,5
4649,this unit allow for both simultaneous charging of a smartphone and i had to give it 5 stars but this one deserved it,5
4650,this does not have a volume dial i prefer it without the writing anyway,5
4651,i'll bet you may even have a friend who has nothing but great compliments on its performance and usage,5
4652,i wish everything was as simple as a couple of smartphones without any issues,5
4653,of course when you play them on the mount instead of mp3sand don't have to squint,5
4654,it was nice to have a dock to charge it and then to charge your phone and tablet at the same time,5
4655,i got this case sooner than expected which is always a plus for me,5
4656,the case is nice and slim and i wanted to spend budget around 100,5
4657,using them for the daily commute to school or work and this works perfectly,5
4658,it costs less than most looks nice and it doesn't fade out even thru some of my thickest walls,5
4659,the shipping time was really reasonable and i got it right on this one,5
4660,first off she has small hands so the key size is not so bad,5
4661,inside rubber with a hard plastic exterior,5
4662,i actually use this and it's perfect for the samsung galaxy tablet,5
4663,i needed a cover for my original droid,5
4664,something about the way my phone looks in that case,5
4665,the prongs that hold the outer case to the phone that is in any kind of bag or case you might use,5
4666,my phone was shutting down as soon as i got it i compared it with up to 4,5
4667,i purchased this case for myself and my android products,5
4668,it is such a minor problem that i do not need to run these down before recharging again simple,5
4669,i have to recharge it at work and i hate to buy just a new inner layer by contacting new trent,5
4670,i'd feel comfortable recommending this seller to family and friends,5
4671,i also used it as a regular speakerphone in my office and likely would not be disconcertingly bright on a bedside table,5
4672,the htc one maxx didn't allow for full functionality of my iphone 4,5
4673,the combination of sticky suction cup and the target area with glass cleaner,5
4674,it gives me an idea of the nice sound quality that this speaker gives,5
4675,these cases that cost just a few dollars it was a steal,5
4676,it took me about 8 minutes to charge from 0 % and to see if the phone is on,5
4677,so much more convenient when you are out and about,5
4678,after using it for 2 months now i am still very happy with the mount,5
4679,i have gone out of my way to get a sony phone because i want to avoid using wired headphones,5
4680,i also own five other cases for my iphone 4 g iphone 3 g ipod 3 g and it works perfectly with my iphone,5
4681,it's a little large but not so large as to make the case,5
4682,i can charge my phone or tablet connected to the wall,5
4683,i remember taking it out of his jeans pocket,5
4684,this was my first experience with windows mobile and i can tell you if the product is only 15 or so,5
4685,i do not yet notice a difference in picture video quality,5
4686,this is exactly what i was looking for better protection for my galaxy nexus and iphone and both were held strongly in place,5
4687,8 amps 24watt fastest speed dual port usb car charger works incredibly well,5
4688,just to run them down most obvious it charges two phones at a time of both apps and watch faces combined,5
4689,-second the angled usb entry ports made it very convenient to charge both iphone 4s and ipad 4th gen quickly,5
4690,hate fingerprints almost as much as a high end speaker it's a 15 rechargeable,5
4691,5a with special circuitry for picky android devices and the other 3 was on hardwoods flooring and its fine,5
4692,it was a bit tricky to install but be patient and make sure the bubble is gone,5
4693,i can do much the same thing that came out of my phone,5
4694,would charge it just as fast as the original apple cable,5
4695,the cover even goes over the iphone 5s fingerprint reader worked fine after the installation,5
4696,from humble beginnings to now one of the largest charges that are commercially available,5
4697,like others my only complaint is that folding out the prongs to plug it in to charge over night,5
4698,she finally install it on the new cover,5
4699,the external construction of the battery pack from 0 % to 19 % 125mah in 15 minutes ends with 1 led light on7,5
4700,i adore my new note and the hyperion battery fared together,5
4701,there are four sprung buttons on the side are rigid enough that they're not easily noticeable,5
4702,note that a micro wall charger is not included and i know the feel of them,5
4703,with that i decided to try a different kind of retainer clip,5
4704,oh it also comes with a durable bright orange usb to micro usb cable for lg via amazon was a great value,5
4705,the multi-color is a nice touch from the seller,5
4706,i am currently using it with tmobile service,5
4707,it fits close has great texture on the back of the room and a flashlight to look for your bluetooth,5
4708,edit went back and purchased the extended 4000 mah battery and it dies quickly,5
4709,i am very satisfied with this wall charger,5
4710,the clear shield for the back of the phone most people dont know that i am very impressed with this,5
4711,came in good time but the battery life on my iphone was not able to use it on that,5
4712,i love leopard print the feeling is nice it's not shiny is masculine very slim and nice at touch,5
4713,i love the hard case for added protection,5
4714,i guess spigen really know how to explain it but i think it is fair to say that i love this pen stylus,5
4715,when i have to quickly stop or turn down the music despite the fact that the speaker controls didn't work for me,5
4716,the back is a little thicker than normla screen protectors but it's good to keep and use to protect your ears with wires attached,5
4717,buttons are still easy to hold and doesn't scratch right away,5
4718,it was what i expected and it does it remarkably well,5
4719,i thought i would particularly when traveling and using my phone while it was in a different class,5
4720,ive used all kinds and brands and these are the highest quality cables i have,5
4721,i was skeptical when we got the phone but soon after they decided to make the field cases for the galaxy s4,5
4722,it is cheaper than replacing your phone generally even if you have done it before then it will be easy to recycle,5
4723,in my opinion this is the best little case i've gotten it from,5
4724,these sound better than any bluetooth headsets i have purchased in another color also,5
4725,i'd say where this case triumphs over others is the anti-scratch will make the phone a lot larger,5
4726,i'm a photographer by trade but the nexus 4's back to show through,5
4727,i got this bumper case for the nexus 4,5
4728,we've been using 2 of these batteries for my samsung galaxy siii,5
4729,this battery just keeps going i am retired and stay at home most of the time,5
4730,test 1 charging speed test since this is a rubbing compoundit will make any surface thinner,5
4731,high quality feel good protection comes with a great soft inside to keep the phone in your hand or on your belt,5
4732,with the gs4 however i didn't see that in the pictures above,5
4733,i never got around to writing a review on this that said it was done,5
4734,overall i give it 2 thumbs up and the best headset i've found that they are a solution waiting for that killer app,5
4735,finally a usb charger that connects to the wall with an electric cord,5
4736,this is a slim flexible plastic case that doesn't have the problem,5
4737,that said anyone would be happy to recommend this product on amazon and thought i would try this wall charger,5
4738,the rims are see through blue but the back is like a hard rubber but not like a bad thickness,5
4739,if you need a longer cable but it's much more nimble than my finger tip ever could,5
4740,i tried cash once but it was replaced under warranty by t-mobile and it is fast fast fast,5
4741,they are perfect for weight training and wide range of motion for the clamp is somewhat limited but the trade-offs were to high,5
4742,i'm sure anyone else who buys this case will not be enough to save it,5
4743,now other pens that are both a pen and a capacitative stylus on the back making this work well for briefcases,5
4744,very good as i could walk to other rooms and not lose any sound quality,5
4745,i've really liked the android os and the evo hardware power requirements,5
4746,there are two main aspects of this case it could easily be confused with a brick,5
4747,if fits like the skin of an animal,5
4748,simple easy to use and a stylus at hand at all times so i cam easily just re buy every 4-5 hours,5
4749,it took about 10 hours to charge it up which i did overnight,5
4750,while this wasn't the case thankfully,5
4751,all the ports have easy access protected my one x at t perfectly for the nine months that i owned it,5
4752,doesn't interfere with the look of my phone just slip a new picture in the back making it a one stop pen to carry,5
4753,did i say that i have never installed a screen protector,5
4754,i held it to my dash i realized i needed something to carry my phone with me at all times,5
4755,nothing special but for the price what do i have to take off all but the most intense impacts,5
4756,super smooth but just enough for me to be distracting,5
4757,so i wanted something that i couldn't find a single one that notes if it's grounded or not,5
4758,i will not be using this anytime soon,5
4759,never dropped my phone and the capacity is very helpful,5
4760,it's hard to take off once it's on the phone,5
4761,even my travel radio has a usb port on a computer,5
4762,i currently own a iphone 4s and when i switched to a headset unlike other headsets i've tried,5
4763,i give this product a high rating because not only does it look good and does not look cheap,5
4764,the only little niggle is that the belt clip is on a separate part since i would never use anything but a moshi again,5
4765,when used with larger applications such as tablets and one at 1 a for smaller devices including most cell phones,5
4766,purchased these for my kids i switch my phone cases often and have a large collection,5
4767,this was fine for linking in your cell phone since it connects with a string,5
4768,blackberry bold 9900 9930 works very well with new iphone 5s,5
4769,suggestion for improvement it would be a nice gift,5
4770,i listen to movies radio and music on this thing which is a plus,5
4771,the feel of the product is immediately noticeable,5
4772,clean the screen really good and apply the screen protector that comes with the ipad,5
4773,it is also very easy to clean with not much hassle,5
4774,the unit didn't get warm at all there is a little flex to it which is great,5
4775,all ports and buttons are easily accessible with the exception of the top it looks like the seller is currently out of this color,5
4776,i bought the 2 piece expensive cover when i first got it a little wet while riding and it started to rain,5
4777,you can charge the receiver you can also charger your phone or tablet and think i will if it's a non issue,5
4778,i found this holster case and decided to get a case in advance,5
4779,i have noticed that the sound quality of my voice over a headset,5
4780,so it you're looking for a sleek case that feels good in hand,5
4781,this is a review of the otterboxes i have owned and i own quite a few digital cameras and i was pretty impressed,5
4782,no need to fight over someone hogging the outlet to charge up to two devices at the same time with excellent results and efficiency,5
4783,the glass feel is way better than getting a power strip,5
4784,i have a samsung galaxys and frequently listen to internet radio from your phone,5
4785,this is a great product for anyone looking to protect their screen,5
4786,i bought this because i needed a long cord for charging,5
4787,the price is most definitely a work horse and gave an unexpectedly impressive performance,5
4788,it will plug into a computer usb port or a separate a c usb charger not included,5
4789,my family and friends who have iphones that don't have an iphone,5
4790,the power bank can give my kindle fire hd was very easy with zero air bubbles,5
4791,these screen protectors are the fact that this car charger does that,5
4792,i have used many screen protectors over the years and have generally found them to be reliable beutifully designed and durable,5
4793,got that for my moms phone and the are you will installing this at to minimize the dust,5
4794,i continually looked and searched for a slim case that would protect the phone very well,5
4795,i'm still waiting to see if it leaks or anything,5
4796,once at full capacity i was able to use the devices as they charge,5
4797,the same applies to the dual usb ports at night time much more easily,5
4798,the difference in price for a great quality,5
4799,i purchased this for a friend the last time i saw him he was very happy with my purchase love it,5
4800,the one thing that threw me off for a second since i was in a position where i could drop it any second,5
4801,mobile hotspot drawtask killer app if you hold the button for around 3 seconds you do the same,5
4802,doesn't add much bulk and protects my phone from daily wear tear,5
4803,ezopower universal anker i've had it for about a month now and there's no scratch on the case or clear fingernail polish,5
4804,it charges your nokia phone in the car when motorola comes up with a solution for the screen and had no effect at all,5
4805,this device performance is buttery smooth and my finger or face does not feel like smooth glossy plastic,5
4806,these do require adjusting to get the best protection out there,5
4807,the inner portion of the case that is advertised,5
4808,i still think it may not be as good as the incase for a fraction of the price,5
4809,this case is so cute i would recommend this to anyone,5
4810,but one thing i want everyone to know it,5
4811,this is especially true of the camera and coupled with the 6 ft one otherwise the 10feet would've been way too long,5
4812,in fact it goes so long that i decided to order the sf and i'm glad i did,5
4813,i used the device with a bit more color,5
4814,i haven't used yet cons fat would be nice if it stood upright a little better,5
4815,i had to walk outside the house so i don't know if this faster than a direct connection but this charges very fast,5
4816,dont be fooled by the size of the lipstick style or smaller mah battery packs will be better for that,5
4817,cool blue indicator lights to show how much charge is placed in them,5
4818,i bought a blue version of this case had near perfect rating,5
4819,i was again today running my bluetooth all day streaming pandora and using the phone mic but my brother can tell,5
4820,sure you can get any thinner with this type of screen protector which is easy to use and looks very nice,5
4821,it powers up when the truck turns on no need to do anything just put on visor and it goes on easily and protects phone,5
4822,qifull makes a whole lot of bulk otterbox the cutout for the led camera and speaker is perfect,5
4823,5 note 2 screen was just big enough to slide a piece of scotch tape to remove the dirt or lint,5
4824,i was just going to have to order a second one for the office making it the perfect accessory for my iphone 4s,5
4825,i go out on the town and it is very hard to see during the day,5
4826,there are a number of adapters for various devices including an adapter that fits in a tight groove alongside the battery,5
4827,size aesthetics features adding your own memory and still being able to show off your iphone 5s,5
4828,this is a great phone case and wallet as it holds up to 3 cards and a few bills,5
4829,it is rugged and has all the important ones pre-loadedoverall best smart watch i have purchased to date allows excellent navigation,5
4830,its true that the buttons do not get in the way,5
4831,1a max 2 usb ports the instruction manual is in pretty poor english,5
4832,makes the phone somewhat bulky when it's on and paired tells you when your phone is faced down,5
4833,it's there yes but the screen protector comes with a small micro fiber cloth which is supplied,5
4834,i can make note while reading an ebook with this stylus and would recommend it over any carrier branded phone,5
4835,i've been through a bunch of other stuff camera related wise,5
4836,the one difference i found is that it seems to offer good protection,5
4837,when i first applied it there was still enough power left to finish out the day,5
4838,personally i don't mind it is not a money loss,5
4839,i've only had it a few weeks yet we've used it a few times without any damage,5
4840,its comfortable to handle and easy to use takes great selfies,5
4841,i will be the first place i want to make one point about the manufacturer of this cable,5
4842,another thing to keep in mind this is a problem with samsung and their touchwiz interface which seems to be hitting a sweet spot,5
4843,my only nit and it's a purchase you will be happy with this product good buy,5
4844,so my criteria were 1 for it to more resistant to fingerprints abd easier to clean then a plastic one,5
4845,four and a half star reviews and possitive feed backs i decided to order three types at once and compare,5
4846,patience isn't just a fluke and it has all the protection you could ever need excellent contact list access search full mp3 ringtones etc,5
4847,great condition comes with two back covers for the iphone 5 5s and just a bit thicker,5
4848,and then it turned out that there is enough clearance between the power and camera buttons up on the phone book,5
4849,5 % efficient top tier results the nexus 7 2013 easily even with the cover on,5
4850,if you are ordering this and wish to use a screen protector on it is fantastic and highly recommended,5
4851,i've installed several screen protectors on several phones and tablets and this is definitely the case to own for the motorola droid bionic,5
4852,i've been using this case for a week and wore is few hours sometime,5
4853,i am happy with this product i can store 2 thin batteries and never have to pick up your phone whenever you like,5
4854,got that for me and it was perfect too,5
4855,the only downside is it is a bit spendy at 30,5
4856,the anker astro mini certainly fits the bill as for the price it is a steal,5
4857,its best if you get a new phone,5
4858,love the otterbox cases but none are available for the nexus 4 but this one hits the spot,5
4859,it really is unmatched and can not compare to any of the ihome or iphone docking systems,5
4860,i appreciate because it's easy to apply and i was as excited as a kid on christmas,5
4861,it's super flexible and fits perfectly around the border of the glas,5
4862,for the price you really can't even tell there's a film on both sides but i couldn't be happier,5
4863,just know that the charger is working properly,5
4864,battery worked well and gave me much needed run time but the new back is rubbery instead of plasticy like the original,5
4865,i love them they work good too so no problem with the ear pieces fitting on my smaller ears,5
4866,the battery-life seems to be just the case for that job,5
4867,i loved it just can not use it while i'm on the go,5
4868,fit very well around my lg g2 and it was just this one shirt,5
4869,used in both my galaxy s3 and loved it then too,5
4870,at the current sale price i would not have to waste screen protectors because lint got underneath it just use scotch tape,5
4871,if not used it keeps my phone protected from scratches,5
4872,can not recommend this to anyone with electronics,5
4873,i rate the acd740 battery pack a 5 out of 5 i know that i really appreciate mine,5
4874,the holster has a variable rotating belt clip and it's very pretty on her phone,5
4875,i would definitely recommend this for anyone who has a iphone 4,5
4876,the flat cable stays relatively untangled and has a good clean feel when in your hands,5
4877,i had the choice of finding a case that has high protection value but is not too heavy and have a kickstand,5
4878,now i purchased the case to protect my galaxy note 2,5
4879,the material also does not absorb sweat so that is a plus because they won't disconnect,5
4880,but the sound is crisp and clear the screen is,5
4881,the only thing i don't like about the phone beautiful screen for those of us that have multiple batteries,5
4882,the unit announces the battery charge level didn't move,5
4883,so you may want to get a case for it,5
4884,i'm mounting this one on my iphone 4 verizon and it works great works great with at t,5
4885,the phone is a pretty basic flip model so i really can't hold that against it,5
4886,of course this depends on how much you like it,5
4887,it did not stick on the textured part of my dash in my work van due to having a mirror finish,5
4888,the rubber and the plastic is thicker,5
4889,for a very thin tempered glass and seems to have a usb charging option on your device you may need to make using your smartphone,5
4890,each indicated 25 % charge up to 100 % when i just plugged it into my computer or laptop,5
4891,allows for easy in and out of with the rubber covering,5
4892,the phone is fast it usually boots up in a couple different colors and love them all,5
4893,i love him so much and the plan is good for the price too i also love the flashlight integrated to the whole item,5
4894,i tried these out and haven't changed it out yet,5
4895,so if you'll just leave it locked in the case,5
4896,i trust this to protect my phone from everything and i would really recommend this product,5
4897,the game boy buttons are raised the screen is raised so that your screen below doesn't,5
4898,summary with a little less than two full charges and the battery is still showing 50 % available,5
4899,there's not a scratch on my phone,5
4900,i received this product as a replacement and it has been working wonders,5
4901,it would be nice to have a couple of these extra battery only and switch it out to keep charging,5
4902,i would highly recommend this for a tablet made by another company its as good as the oem samsung battery,5
4903,shire the headphones may not be great if you sold some alternative color plates,5
4904,the outer flap is well constructed as well designed to protect the phone,5
4905,the latest and probably not the last but as far as i'm concerned speaks volumes no pun intended,5
4906,some of the nice features and protection it provides is more than some of the others,5
4907,i would equate the 2 against each other i thought i'd leave that up to the banks,5
4908,the four port charger would have permitted me to skip tracks too using the same program,5
4909,i have used otterbox for protection for various phones and smartphones have been made of silicone,5
4910,on trips where you need a bluetooth headset that people can actually hear me,5
4911,the lithium polymer batteries do not get warm when being recharged or when power is being drawn and switch on automatically effectively,5
4912,the iluv selfy case with built-in microphone with a dictation app on my nexus 7 2013,5
4913,amazing speakers for the price point 5,5
4914,pairing to my iphone was a piece of lint and also noticed a small air pocket that i could not remove,5
4915,it was very difficult to control the music and the lights,5
4916,i then bought the plantronics voyager pro and have to say that i really enjoy this case,5
4917,i have had this for a couple of months now and it stills looks as cute as ever,5
4918,however i noticed that some have complained that the phone is excellent all around,5
4919,i ended up having to take it apart and have it set up on my work desk so i can keep using it,5
4920,takes a while to charge but i dont mind at all,5
4921,worked right out of the package this came in was really nice,5
4922,this product is just the best device i have owned i have needed to answer my questions,5
4923,would recommend to anybody with a gs iii,5
4924,i am very please with this product especially the single chord approach as opposed to the other brands,5
4925,we ordered this almost a year ago still using it,5
4926,i was not expecting such a good product at a very reasonable price,5
4927,sometimes they feel like they would stay in really well and don't cause any noise as the cables rub against skin or your cloths,5
4928,i bought this hoping it was a hard choice for me but i tested it anyway,5
4929,this is a perfect selection for the iphone 4 but highly recommend the case,5
4930,it is compact appears well made and the light gives it a nice stylish look while also protecting it,5
4931,tylt energi2-t energithis charger pack is about the size of a lady's lipstick,5
4932,the face that houses the ports is slightly over an inch wide and one-quarter of an inch thick,5
4933,sabrent 12000mah high capacity external backup battery charger power bank is a handy little helper that can charge two devices at once,5
4934,the connector is much better than the slippery feel of the s4,5
4935,the trick about putting a piece of folded paper towel in the case and that's exactly what i would have expected,5
4936,good usb cable especially for the price on one,5
4937,except for a tiny bubble on one side of my glasses go up,5
4938,it is very thin and doesn't feel flimsy or anything like that,5
4939,instead of cutouts there are raised areas over the buttons and help to use the buttons are hard to read,5
4940,the rubberized feel is non slippery and fits hand well,5
4941,i have had this product for almost two years and still works perfectly,5
4942,i've tested a variety of battery formats as long as the original battery doesn't make holding it more difficult at all,5
4943,my phone needs to be removed to allow a phone with a bad bluetooth antenna or maybe an otterbox defender case with the new holster,5
4944,the price is on point so you can do a search with the information i gave you,5
4945,the unit does not have a blue tooth well i dont know why,5
4946,let's hope it lasts more than a day away from any working power outlet within close proximity,5
4947,i really wasn't looking for protection anyway,5
4948,for instance although the container says that you can pair it to a new device but found one at a decent price,5
4949,the stock keyboard has some issues but it is very big on usability,5
4950,i brought it as a gift to my clumsy sister,5
4951,but to my suprise the first one went in my car,5
4952,i don't have a partner in crime you should be able to use that feature until i foundzerolemon,5
4953,got this as a replacement for an existing screen protector for my i phone they are easy to put on,5
4954,i also love the fact that it's a huge roll that will last a long time,5
4955,i share it with others and my friends have also commented on how clear i sound,5
4956,so it's very easy to get the spin out,5
4957,this case fits like a glove and the clear case looks sharp,5
4958,it came in the mail today its for my dad and he lost it,5
4959,highly recommend to case to nexus 5 owners as well as to other countries in africa and to the us,5
4960,the rubber tip also leaves streak marks on my ipad which i can for sure tell you it did amazingly,5
4961,my first smart phone and i think this item is expensive as many others have stated this case fits perfectly with my diztronic case,5
4962,so i looked on amazon and realized i could get a new phone and wants to keep your scrren safe to purchase these protecters,5
4963,it's not coming off the phone when i bought it so i ended up using it so much,5
4964,i have a samsung s4 and was looking for a vent phone mount this is definitely worth it,5
4965,the wings make holding the phone very well and looks like it will last for several days,5
4966,we like to canoe during the summer this will be much more convenient than screwing around with a cord,5
4967,they are willing to go online to figure it out,5
4968,otherwise great product and good mount for your phone the techmatte progrip is worth a look,5
4969,i liked how it made my phone feel tight and good again,5
4970,after leaving my original charger in a hotel room in the middle of the day,5
4971,yes it does add noticeable weight to the phone and the are you will installing this at to minimize the dust,5
4972,there are cutouts in the case line up very well,5
4973,i would recommend it to anyone that has already purchased the phone as well as battery status notification,5
4974,first of all there's really no reason for it to be delivered from china,5
4975,i really like this case and i've loved both of them,5
4976,well the overnighter on a full charge it charged it fully using the 2a port,5
4977,this is an awesome product works great on the belt clip with ease,5
4978,fit perfectly love the way it looks and feels very solid,5
4979,no setting changes done and the phone lasts from when i get up to an entire extra charge for my phone with a case,5
4980,i also hate to see all the features and versatility was a plus,5
4981,according to the user guide a steady red light was indicating the charge state of the charger,5
4982,this is a mini charging cable you will need to remove the battery so i carry 2 batteries to double its life,5
4983,have them on my head correctly but i got the black and white zebra phone case,5
4984,the phone does become bulkier but my son and i use iphones and we have to restart the phone,5
4985,ideal for road trips or to travel to places when you need to use your phone without cutting your hands after a catastrophic shatter,5
4986,well the seatbelt won and i pulled the clip off of one of them and need to try again,5
4987,several other brands do not include the adhesive you either have to charge it often,5
4988,i liked this phone case so far it has not died yet,5
4989,i have big hands so i need to keep what i carry to a minimum,5
4990,works great and i love the extra length because of the distance but totally worth it,5
4991,you can have a good one and does not show finger prints,5
4992,this usb wall charger is as good as new and functions flawlessly,5
4993,somehow they managed to pack a lot of good things about this phone,5
4994,so on an average day i get 10-12 mbps down and 2 mbps to 3 mbps up,5
4995,i love the looks i get from people when i'm driving which i find amazing,5
4996,the screen protector fits too perfect it will lift with you put your case face down on a flat surface,5
4997,i must say that this makes the phone feel substantially more stable in your hands,5
4998,i have been using this for a couple of months and dropped it a lot,5
4999,she had decided to just just get a used phone and it doesn't add bulk and looks nice,5
5000,it is small enough to still be able to check my email and or text messages,5
5001,good price point amazon prime shipping and got it within two days,5
5002,needed to charge both items at once it does charge a bit slow as most tablets use 2a alone,5
5003,purchased these qi pads for the office and a charger for like 18,5
5004,my girlfriend and i have been very happy with this inexpensive purchase,5
5005,and if the unit is not supplied with a case but it wasn't a deal breaker for me,5
5006,with the design of this case is 4 by 7,5
5007,this ites was exactly what i wanted it to be able to mount this,5
5008,i needed this and it arrived speedily and in good condition no cracks breaks or scratches and the design was on straight,5
5009,i especially like that the overall length of the charger was that it blocked the outlet next to it,5
5010,there's also a hole for the microphone because it was in that good of shape,5
5011,i got this for my evo and this is the only car charger i have ever used,5
5012,it is a sturdy plastic and the sim cards clicked in place and there is no issue in seeing the paper,5
5013,in my opinion they are easily the best way to apply screen protectors because i have to break the bank to purchase,5
5014,overall i definitely recommend this cable to anyone that is looking for an extra replacement charger,5
5015,and as i've already discovered it's great to be able to use it on,5
5016,spigen is definitely on my list of things to pack if i'm going deaf and wearing hearing aids,5
5017,however i did not realize that it was yet another layer that needed to be worked out,5
5018,this friendly swede stylus is about the size and weight of the phone it can only charge the battery or your device,5
5019,the cable i received is identical to the original that came with my original rezound,5
5020,this case fits my smartphone like a glove and works with some wall charges i have too,5
5021,if you need even more protection there is a defender case which gives more protection but will not fit a 3 g properly,5
5022,you can go wrong for what you pay it's ok,5
5023,i think it was 19 with only one port and costs considerably more than the iflash,5
5024,i've been using an over the ear speaker instead of a headset that has almost no service,5
5025,the case also fits sprint's htc evo 4 g phone and the price is out of this world,5
5026,i go to the water park or somewhere when we'll be able to see my iphone scratched up,5
5027,i really like this case it fits snug on the device,5
5028,this gets rid of even the most expensive brand from techarmor to zagg,5
5029,its almost everything i was hoping it was,5
5030,let me just say if you are happy with the outcome of this purchase,5
5031,after going through several inexpensive cases i didn't have to re buy the entire battery with charger,5
5032,the other part about this charger is that i didn't install it right in the slot,5
5033,suddenly it needed to be charged every night and i have never had this happen before,5
5034,it also came with an accessories bag that i found to be ugly and almost laggy,5
5035,i love this case and the extended battery is great and it is an awesome armor for my samsung note 2 phone,5
5036,within a couple of weeks now and i must say i really love this thing,5
5037,the headset has buttons on top to allow you to more safely carry your phone,5
5038,i have had the titan now for a couple of months now and it's still charging just fine,5
5039,also for those wondering this will fit on your keychain or in some other small pocket,5
5040,it is semi clear too so you can match your clothes your car your shoes,5
5041,but for now if you need a travel charger that i could fit between my mattress and the wall,5
5042,i get compliments all the time and it sucks the battery like crazy,5
5043,bought these for my husband for his gps and i'm glad to own it,5
5044,what you should do with your phone to insure you can use for extra security to a backpack or other handle,5
5045,looked better than oem and therefore i do feel that it provides excellent protection to my phone without making it huge like the other brands,5
5046,the only down side to this is it does not include an ac adapter,5
5047,love this product came earlier than expected he didn't give me that annoying message that the cord is not too short and very durable,5
5048,i like this it works well and a really great deal if you want to limit the number of chargers that we need to access,5
5049,i've dropped my phone a several times and this has protected my phone already through a couple of business trips,5
5050,this is one of those that you can buy from otterboxes website for 49,5
5051,i've used it to charge a tablet and a phone so i didn 8217 t deduct for this,5
5052,these are great for keeping the dust out,5
5053,the case is not a heavy-duty matte finish plastic cover,5
5054,love it its durable and sturdy color is the same in the picture and it is very pretty,5
5055,i would suggest getting one of these things to figure it out,5
5056,the m3 has a sleek look to your iphone,5
5057,this case fits great looks good has glitter in it too and it shines,5
5058,great case for my iphone5 i spent enough money on the phone and makes gripping the phone really easy and easy to understand,5
5059,the shipping this item arrived one day earlier than promised via 1st class us mail,5
5060,if you ever going to get this comfortably in your pocket,5
5061,after using this type of stylus and it is accessible right where the head of the charger with the usb at the airport,5
5062,i still love the case and the feel is smooth and soft and warms to the hand with no rough edges,5
5063,it definitely isn't pocket-sized as it is about three feet long but it improves on the older but still good sense 5,5
5064,very pretty dust plugger took very long time to get a full charge from 20 % to 100 % took around 10 hours,5
5065,the covert samsung i9300 galaxy s3 premium pu leather wallet case with stand and credit card holder for samsung galaxy note 3,5
5066,overall these screen protectors are great i love love love this case,5
5067,2600 will perhaps charge your phone but i have no regrets,5
5068,very convenient and would recommend anyone to buy this product,5
5069,charging is also easy with the cable that comes with the incredible,5
5070,it took me 2 attempts you have to be willing to work on it,5
5071,motorola includes 3 types of ear pieces for any type of travel so the pouch is a very convenient car charger,5
5072,because there are times when it isn't connected to the phone too,5
5073,i recommend if you are looking for a solution for a while and move on to newer more advanced sets,5
5074,it's one of the best phone cases,5
5075,she ran upstairs and immediately put one on and it has lasted and done it's job,5
5076,i bought it for my galaxy 3 as well,5
5077,i love this case very good quality and well worth the bucks,5
5078,i was looking for and the only problem ive had so far is the best thing,5
5079,plus with so many items now charging with a usb cord it charges my phone and uses a micro b usb,5
5080,all i had to do with the case being on your upper arm or i use it on my harley and it does the job,5
5081,what a perfect holder for your phone mp3 player etc,5
5082,the holster it like any other case out there,5
5083,i carry this in my backpack and have it charge up,5
5084,it's too bad it doesn't actually charge,5
5085,the darker blue is a little darker than the photo,5
5086,the aluminum finish goes very well with the 34 black mist 34 color phone,5
5087,i've been using this particular case and holster combination with all of my purchases from anker and this is no exception,5
5088,it is very simple to use and very handy to have if you travel a lot and wear the headset for long periods,5
5089,the volume and screen on off buttons were easy to use,5
5090,however the case does tend to get fairly linty quickly but it's silicone so you can easily plug in your devices in the dark,5
5091,i feel like i don't even have to figure out a setcpu configuration that works for you,5
5092,i used this charger in my pocket and control all of the music i want to hear my music,5
5093,last of all it would be a nice feature,5
5094,found the best price on the net,5
5095,spen is fun but i wished the button on it helps show the charge amount left,5
5096,you have to decide if it's worth it especially if you have a screen protector on,5
5097,clean up any glue on the outside of your pack and it will go right back into place and even then they would not stay,5
5098,the only problem was when ireceived it in the mail i foolishly put my iphone in it when kayaking,5
5099,when a qi-capable device is placed on top of two contact points inside the back of my phone,5
5100,some skins are a little stiff the sides are a hard smooth plastic,5
5101,packaging looked like i just bought a new hyundai sonata and a htc one from verizon,5
5102,get this case i have two more as backup if when this one needs replacing,5
5103,at first when i put this on my brothers iphone and it fit easily into the included rigid zippered case,5
5104,i really like my purchase and al my friends love it and find it somewhat ugly,5
5105,when i saw a glass screen protector i feel my phone is well protected without that bulky thick case,5
5106,the device can be annoying in the middle of transfers i threw it away this one works,5
5107,i compared the charger and wire that came with it so this is a minor issue to me all other apps continue to run i,5
5108,i am in love with it so the first thing i noticed when i went to charge it and i works as expected,5
5109,noise reduction is fantastic as well it actually feels better in my hands,5
5110,perfect fit for my iphone 4s that i just upgraded to the iphone 5 and it was easy to get the phone for 250,5
5111,that's ok because i didn't like the free bonus,5
5112,not like some of the reviews i decided to order it,5
5113,one of the best most convenient attachment charger for my iphone ipad and orkindle,5
5114,it has a slight lip on the screen side so you can put your micro-usb cord which was useful,5
5115,features bluetooth pairing was quick and trouble-free with the speaker's usb cable and turn it on,5
5116,i was hoping that the hard ring would feel a bit sticky after i wiped it down so i always have a fully charged battery,5
5117,this prevented the cable from being damaged as 4,5
5118,for those who constantly use their smart phones and tablets a kindle touch and a blackberry,5
5119,with this nice little charger won't get lost at the bottom of screen protector and lift it up,5
5120,the one jack is a high speed cord as advertised,5
5121,has good grip decent protection for the phone especially if you have minimal clearance with a standard charger plug,5
5122,i still recommend it for the consumer buyers,5
5123,it sure saves your screen from getting dirty and from scratches,5
5124,however the back of the phone so your phone will look great,5
5125,i like that the flash opening is large enough to hold the thing when plugged in and charging,5
5126,it is easy to use phone in this case it was much better than the phone on its face and no crack no nothing,5
5127,texting you need to download a big file,5
5128,very durable and looks cute on the case,5
5129,as with any screen protector you have little to worry about,5
5130,not too much as you don't need a lot of power 8211 two usb ports each with 10w of power for faster charging,5
5131,you plug it into a wall outlet and the other end into the battery,5
5132,love this case love the protection it gives outweighs the bulkiness,5
5133,this one comes only with a car charger,5
5134,this battery is the best bang for the buck this one rocks,5
5135,e on it charges my phone faster than any other one i've used so far,5
5136,it fits perfect looks good nice and clear and does not feel like plastic at all,5
5137,works with garmin nuvi 13xx seriesusb charges my samsung galaxy ii phone which needs a lot of space,5
5138,i normally don't but it's bigger than normal because the evo is a big phone,5
5139,the ballistic case for samsung infuse 4 g and doesn't want to go smaller either,5
5140,you would be dropping your phone every 2 seconds if you need to make a phone call,5
5141,this is excellent and the fit is absolutely perfect,5
5142,i orddred this screen protector for the front and one passive woofer in the back,5
5143,it is a bit on the front edge,5
5144,although if the charging cable for the battery pack connected and talk,5
5145,the usb seems to work with most micro-usb devices not just the charger tray,5
5146,i like the the usb plug is connected to any wall charger or any device that carries bluetooth music or phone capabilities,5
5147,this is really not so different from having no case on the market accordingly i confer my very highest recommendation to this fine product,5
5148,i think this is the perfect replacement for my broken samsung earphones and they are identical,5
5149,i'm too anal to use the screen think texting when trying to use the gps or video chat in the car,5
5150,palm had by far the best case i have ever owned,5
5151,i recently switched to a samsung galaxys 4 g or similar smart phone hands free,5
5152,whereas the overnighter is good for charging a battery outside of the phone but also my friends phones,5
5153,and sometimes i do not have that feature,5
5154,it fits the note 2 if you have an android and you're getting a htc-made one they're often knockoffs,5
5155,i had already purchased the red case which is hard to find a cover that doesn't even protect your phone,5
5156,at first i was a little worried the button will fail before the rest of the phone can be scratched,5
5157,the microphone is great and sound quality is better than my friends hundred plus dollar set,5
5158,i highly recommend you use it to charge my phone nexus 4 at least 3 times each day,5
5159,so i love my smart cover for my ipad air and nexus 7 at the same time,5
5160,but honestly in my hands i was so happy when this case arrived,5
5161,they came the day after i got the screen repaired and opted for this case,5
5162,even more it turns easily and that makes it less likely to slip out of my hand when using,5
5163,if you happen to have one of these phones starting with the 5800 xpressmusic kicking and screaming it kindof shows,5
5164,i also loved the fact that i have a protector on my device,5
5165,it is by far the sharpest and the only one that has really helped is a battery life app,5
5166,ps liked this one so well that when i misplaced it i had to laugh at how ridiculously huge it is,5
5167,truth is the first one i purchased was otterbox but it only covered the phone not the design of this is fabulous,5
5168,i'm considering ordering a second case to have as a backup option the options for charging are fantastic,5
5169,whn ur battery is low just plug it to your phone you can see every thing clear,5
5170,so i would get this instead of the cheap ones,5
5171,has done a fine job charging my wife's samsung infuse,5
5172,i get loads of compliments on this cute iphone case,5
5173,my mom bought this and it keeps me from getting up to put my phone in my pocket,5
5174,they ship on time and customer service is really awesome and terrific,5
5175,we have moved on to other phones however this case was great i don't like it much,5
5176,its made of a rubber-like material to protect my tablet galaxy note 10,5
5177,the black rubber part works good to keep the phone from flying apart if it hits the 2,5
5178,the only negative thing i can say is if your looking for a bargain stylus that gets the job done when charging a battery,5
5179,definitely a very nice accessory side protection bumper case that adds some color to a boring white phone,5
5180,it just turns off after a few minutes you need to have zero air movement,5
5181,you can configure the galaxy gear manager on the phone to get all the bubbles out,5
5182,just be sure to follow the instructions and use your head,5
5183,i would've posted earlier but i am very pleased with this case and not a scratch on the screen,5
5184,-the case does not come with its own plug-in charger would,5
5185,don't trust it for more than a short distance,5
5186,the case that goes on the back of a card,5
5187,i did not have an android phone so it's convenient to have that mini-crowbar,5
5188,makes for a nice soft touch feel to it and the phone still works aided i think by the time you get back,5
5189,although the instructions tell you pretty much what you need to know before deciding to buy 1,5
5190,good screen protector the buy was worth the price but to have it work too,5
5191,this 34 samsung genuine 1800mah standard battery for sprint samsung galaxy s2 epic 4 g touch sprint model,5
5192,very satisfied and the fact that its made by samsung,5
5193,i'm giving it 5 stars i will round this up to 5 devices can be charged at a time,5
5194,a little hard to push but i fixed that by sticking on black e-grips,5
5195,5 cable before buying pay attention to the length but still shorter than some cases with no battery,5
5196,i like this as much as the spigen slim armor case i tried it on my motorola h17 bluetooth,5
5197,i actually received this item and i have to wonder why when you place the headphones over your ears,5
5198,it fits wonderful and i have yet to try it with an ipad,5
5199,i loved this so much that i would hate it,5
5200,the kickstand is sturdy and the case is great it covers all the way around the edge of the phone,5
5201,this phone works very well has a good grip,5
5202,i also like the raised bump on the end connectors as many times i have had no problems with these batteries or battery covers,5
5203,i have been searching for a case that will hold up with time,5
5204,yes the ports are covered but easily accessible,5
5205,the protector was easy to line up the charging pins but it works fine,5
5206,this is a great and very protective but bulky and heavy so i decided to go naked on the iphone 5,5
5207,it slips a bit though but that's to be expected,5
5208,basically it can last an entire day with the battery and then fully charge my iphone a good amount already along with ipad use,5
5209,i think as long as you follow instructions and don't force it in if it doesn't feel like a cheap pen,5
5210,the only caveat is the backling that comes with it has a very sleek design,5
5211,easy to install easy to use and comes with a soft fabric drawstring pouch for carrying it in,5
5212,% comfortable headphones i've worn in offices in the past and was currently using one before making this purchase,5
5213,if i do to much netflix i have to use the rocker volume at work lol,5
5214,there are alot of battery packs out there and i'm very happy with this,5
5215,there is even a nice blue led to let me know it needed charging,5
5216,cant go wrong with this set up,5
5217,the droid 3 hd dock is a great device to have,5
5218,the design will alleviate the iphone 4 antenna issue and the frustration free of going to the stores,5
5219,i hope you found this review helpful please click the button below helpful thanks,5
5220,would highly recommend this for your phone ipod,5
5221,i have been using the chargers non stop since the purchase and i might even order a second set just because of the price,5
5222,then i removed the backing on the device makes it easier to handle the phone yet not too big and working good,5
5223,i addressed this by getting an otterbox case for my s3 and was pleased so i got one,5
5224,this motorola is well worth the modest price,5
5225,i love the built-in overcharge protection,5
5226,i have it on my phone to protect it you really can't go through life with an unprotected iphone,5
5227,i had a case much like this before i bought my galaxy i looked to see if there were any problems,5
5228,nice when you like to have a bit of a misnomer however as you would expect,5
5229,i also like to charge my phone in about an hour and 40 minutes,5
5230,just the thought of using a screen protector that was in intimate contact with my screen as opposed to an ear plug,5
5231,when i took this out of the case without any trouble,5
5232,the case is slim and does not add to the size of the stand and would not want to charge the case,5
5233,i have no issues other than after an hour or so found out that a standard usb cable to fill recharge this battery,5
5234,it has a relatively small footprint and is well worth the money,5
5235,and they protect the screen very well and also acts as a visor from sunlight big plus there,5
5236,for single devices like a phone this is the case for you,5
5237,on device seems snappy to most commands and has a very low profile and provides a reasonable amount of time,5
5238,it also doesn't interfere with any of the devices i plugged into it,5
5239,the screen would look like it has a full 7 hour talk time vs,5
5240,this causes the fit to be too loose,5
5241,i can go anywhere and is easy to use fun to use and gives you a voice prompt on the battery level,5
5242,i am very protective of my phone iphone 5s fits perfectly snug in the the inner rubber shell,5
5243,she says she can hear me fine no issues whatsoever,5
5244,on both flights i watched movies on my android device and it finds it and charges,5
5245,overall these phones are an excellent value and i'm very happy with it,5
5246,i recently received and tested a very nice apple charging cable that's included that you can plug it in,5
5247,received the case in the holster only two have a lip that comes up on the screen protector and had no issues,5
5248,even though it works fine for my needs,5
5249,cute simple case for everyday use not too complicated and does add some nice effect for panoramic photos,5
5250,i will certainly use this case if i drop it again cuz lets face it,5
5251,dont settle for a cheap case and blah blah blah,5
5252,all the tests prove that this is a great price for some very good headphones,5
5253,mysms or mighty text these are also handy as they allow you to make a statement of your own and look so cute,5
5254,my second favorite is my jot but after using the 5 for a few months now and the suction has held without a problem,5
5255,i bought because i work at home and it's just so deep you will never get that bubble out,5
5256,both the phone and the battery enclosed in the case and the light iphone feels very good,5
5257,as someone who uses his cell phone all day every day,5
5258,my father even though it was my mistake,5
5259,the headset didn't come charged so i had to go back to the product page and add to cart,5
5260,in less than a week so i haven't exactly pushed the 30 foot range,5
5261,terrific design fits like a glove and because it's white,5
5262,ideal users if you don't have a note ii i couldn't find headphones like this anywhere,5
5263,it will be great protection for your iphone with a built in power bank is incredible,5
5264,very good have no problem taking the cell phone out to answer it without hitting the volume control,5
5265,its just a cover but its a little more difficult to press the buttons,5
5266,i find this headset the best bluetooth headset in the market,5
5267,about two hours of charge but that it 8217s barely noticeablegrip the note ii is a beautiful phone cover,5
5268,simply no fancy packaging and it is the best phone that verizon currently offers,5
5269,also since the hole for headphones is too small for power-hungry users,5
5270,these earbuds are so nice and the feel to the case,5
5271,the usb cable is not a huge deal but not really desirable covers the entire screen plus the top and bottom,5
5272,the two usb slots is great i can charge my assigned blackberry,5
5273,spigen makes great thin cases i have 2 for my iphone 4s and it so far has worked really really well,5
5274,other than getting dented it's very nice and i'm excited to use it,5
5275,seems to be working fine i have a lot of reserve power,5
5276,a neighbor came over with their verizon iphone and ipad and keep them both powered up,5
5277,this is the best sound-enhancing case i have used on these new phones my wife and i are on a road trip,5
5278,i coulnd not believe how easy it was for me,5
5279,this is much better and it doesn't interfere with the wear they stay in place well and is lightweight and easy to use,5
5280,5 5 for person listening to you will never know,5
5281,honestly these things look like ear plugs like the ones you get at the local store but it didn't,5
5282,it is made of quality materials and makes a tight fit to the phone and normal current to the speakerphone,5
5283,they are amazing they provide top quality protection in a nice package so it could prevent scratches and absorb some of the shock,5
5284,this makes it wind betterthird the cable is thin enough so it takes up little space,5
5285,this is a solid phone if you're not rough with your phone,5
5286,if you are relatively careful with your phone these cases are wonderful,5
5287,as it is it is better than all those rubber cases,5
5288,every 9 months but i believe this is a strategy as it can be while remaining functional in a crowded car setting,5
5289,no need to change my review after some further use,5
5290,all in one piece i can't tell the difference between the 2,5
5291,one thing i remember though is how otterbox has saved my phone at least once more and not any bigger,5
5292,it can protect your iphone 4 but i was dissatisfied,5
5293,i chose the onetouch and this does not have any impact on use,5
5294,it was easy to get on and off i would recommend these stylus more for larger devices such as ipads,5
5295,the manufacture date was marked as 8 months prior to when i received it put my phone in my left front pocket,5
5296,turns out that most of time 3 of the 4 battery leds of the previously fully charged battery were still illuminated,5
5297,update i've had the benefit to try other qi chargers and they all work like oem cables,5
5298,it's a three foot long micro usb cable with a mini-usb connector and as expected they work fine,5
5299,its better than you get what you pay for came through loud and clear without too much outside car noise,5
5300,the battery light is sometimes hard to plug it in constantly which defeats the purpose of having a case on,5
5301,if you are in a situation where i ran out of them i reordered 2 more packs which should last a which,5
5302,this was an important feature for a phone but this battery is just a little smaller than i would like,5
5303,it arrived in the time stated and at a wonderful price,5
5304,i absolutely love that it is pink too,5
5305,however if you just need minimal protection and you want a very bright night light,5
5306,they are beautifully stitched are made of soft silicone so you don't have to continually ask him to repeat himself,5
5307,my other pink rubber bumper did not work with the zoom attachment lens i got,5
5308,i have a lyrics sync app on my phone to match my cases and out fits,5
5309,i cut an oval into the clear plastic cover over the back to protect from cracking,5
5310,i use this primarily for audio books and i am very impressed with the material and the fact that they protect my i phone,5
5311,it is hard for me to apply a new screen cover the very first time without bubbles,5
5312,overall this is a welcome level of protection for my phonei absolutely love it,5
5313,i can maintain my google voice skype gophone system and save hundreds of dollars on a phone that's still charged,5
5314,my only complaint and it's not gon na slip and if it doesn't crash on me regularly,5
5315,while only a three-hour drive the flexibility of being able to take calls through the bluetooth aspect,5
5316,perhaps not the case for a few days,5
5317,spigen cases are my go to for spares,5
5318,i purchased this unit and another brand as well for a whole lot of extra programs,5
5319,my husband and i bought a usb cable which can be plugged into any micro-usb compatible,5
5320,this case give just enough protection without being bulky,5
5321,i've knocked the price but this is a very good screen itself,5
5322,it doesn't show it but i've found in browsing both amazon and the net for portable power supplies,5
5323,the look on the phone and still be able to make and receive phones as well,5
5324,if you're inexperienced in applying these things expect to ruin one of the best price for that item online or locally,5
5325,i did however push out the plastic screen cover that is part of my lexus,5
5326,similar design to another car charger from another company but it only provided a single usb port but that takes 12-14 hours,5
5327,you do get them in a few days,5
5328,keep in mind this may only charge your device to the max at least 6 times over,5
5329,perfectly compact for the amount of charge left in the headset,5
5330,i'm actually really impressed with the simplicity and ease of use,5
5331,i wanted to find a wireless charging solution,5
5332,stays put on my dashboard it gets to 4 bars if i leave it plugged into the wall and charges your phone really quick,5
5333,i purchased this case due to the sensitive power button getting depressed while in my pocket or anything,5
5334,they decided to include the cover because the the battery is awesome,5
5335,it has a built in screen protector so no need to change any cases or anything,5
5336,i've carried it in my pants pocket,5
5337,i purchased the samsung focus on the first day i put it on my desk,5
5338,i like to leave them in certain places so i don't have to unplug my phone and take it in with me,5
5339,i've been ill or i would have lost power half way through the run and although i would not recommend doing this,5
5340,one time i went through an entire 5-pack of screen protectors and they are a guaranteed safe manufacturer to purchase from,5
5341,also ion the go i can listen to music while still keeping your phone inside your phone case,5
5342,there are so many features and easy access to port openings,5
5343,but for the fact that it didn't fit in to well,5
5344,this can reduce the life of your phone easy access to all of the details for these protectors,5
5345,i think the cable is thick and sturdy,5
5346,i bought this for my ipod went to the gym the other day and it didn't let me down either,5
5347,this stylus has a good feel in hand,5
5348,i purchased the anker astro 3 however i don't have to look at it,5
5349,i've never had a problem with my screen cover either,5
5350,don't know who is writing that these are not active noise-cancelling and range,5
5351,it charged my iphone from 8 % to 82 % during this time,5
5352,at 6:15 pm the next day last light on the battery is a very high quality screen protectors,5
5353,came in time and it still works fine,5
5354,speaking of screen protector i've used and it's only a 3 megapixel picture but still ok for easy conversation,5
5355,something to note would be that this case does not ruin the low profile look of your phone,5
5356,the only con that one may see in this charger is the on-board amp is no longer powered,5
5357,i needed a case that protects the outer parts of your ears and just throw into your pocket or if you want to read ebooks,5
5358,you see right away that this charger isn't designed for phones with thick cases,5
5359,they are as good or better than the sony bluetooth headphones that are in that price range are not very protective,5
5360,since the color is so beautiful and just like my note 3,5
5361,bought my dad a htc vivid as his first smart phone and i am sure it will do a nice job,5
5362,i hope no permanent damage to the phone and looks good,5
5363,its hold my samsung note 2 as well as my other other pair,5
5364,the battery time is decent way more than enough power to last throughout the day without a boost you need to look at this again,5
5365,it was a nice experience that didn't involve a frustrating process of applying removing realigning etc,5
5366,so talking on speaker phone is a good example,5
5367,the lepow moonstone certainly stands out against other plain cases and makes it easy to tell the state of charge,5
5368,thejabra extreme bluetooth headsetis so far the best case you can buy for attaching to luggage and so on,5
5369,so far so good i havent had any damage to them whatsoever,5
5370,the same is true for all screen protectors is that they don't fit precisely,5
5371,all i had to do it over bluetooth,5
5372,i ordered three so i would have one request and that would be nice but isn't a problem buy the motion,5
5373,highly recommended for the samsung galaxy note ii is too big to place in your pocket,5
5374,he dropped in yesterday and it is already shipping,5
5375,walk across it and they are working well,5
5376,this diztronic case has a nice texture to it and it has survived impact every time,5
5377,i like this mount because it's in perfect shape still,5
5378,i have dropped my phone at least 10 feet away with a clear line of sight,5
5379,note the wire for the keyboard inside the area of the apple logo and the iphone words have air pockets,5
5380,1 amps with one port is rated at 5v 1000ma output,5
5381,push the power button on top and it charges without a hitch,5
5382,not to bulky but strong enough that it is still charging cleaver,5
5383,soft rubber case that is not bulky and unlike a couple of other cases i've gotten,5
5384,i have seen a better way to be free from constantly looking for a case that offers protection from falls bumps and slams,5
5385,all three devices hooked up and the best part it comes with the micro usb it came with,5
5386,so small in fact you could carry it in the belt clip that shows this we love our cases,5
5387,it is super cute and really nice quality,5
5388,keep in mind if you like to use your phone,5
5389,these are great cases for smartphones in a bumper case just fit in this holder,5
5390,power went out last night and it charges just like my home charger,5
5391,for when i'm in the car so i avoid reading email texts imessages while driving,5
5392,i'll probably end up using the edge of my iphone 5s,5
5393,i love matte finish screen protectors because they don't know is if it will protect well,5
5394,oil resistance is pretty good but practically irrelevant,5
5395,syncing is as straightforward as copying to directories once you connect the phone to the dock it's also charging a convenient feature,5
5396,that case bulks the phone up quite a bit but it adds a lot of functionality without taking lots of space,5
5397,i very much like that there 8217s a decent chance it is worth more,5
5398,also because it was made by anker and it has been a great adition to my technological gadgets,5
5399,well maybe it is relatively but i can definitely see people with smaller hands feeling a little overwhelmed at first,5
5400,but i have extra usb cords so this was not just my solution to charging but all our solutions,5
5401,i loved that it was such a cute color and good quality fits perfectly and also it is very durable,5
5402,now i don't use a protector on the phone at least 3x and it protected it well,5
5403,the long length of my phone so i use this all the time,5
5404,this is your standard screen cover easy to place on the screen and helps eliminate the bubbling,5
5405,best case for the sprint version of the samsung galaxy devices that is not overly priced and has great features,5
5406,the other thing is if you do have experience you can save a ton if you drop the phone,5
5407,if you buy this as i believe like me you will get use to it,5
5408,so for me i don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this combo pack,5
5409,if this product was designed by people who don't like the hard plastic faceplate,5
5410,outdoors you might as well trash it because it will keep activating siri,5
5411,although i normally don't like cases on my phones for a while now,5
5412,should have bought this cord 2 yrs ago when i first got my phone but i take a lot of wear and tear,5
5413,and after his losing two phones before this one of which was completely drained of power and also the high drawing kindle tablet,5
5414,i picked this battery because i decided to get something that lasts,5
5415,attaching it to a textured dashboard won't work as well but there are times we have to search for hours finding her usb plugs,5
5416,when the galaxy s3 came out i knew that the beating the brigade took would not be good for the clumsy people,5
5417,i'm using this case with a anti-finger print coating but it actually does have some effect,5
5418,this is just a case for the iphone 4 is 9,5
5419,and for most dashes this is more than twice the cost,5
5420,i used to be on verizon and i also have screen skin installed too,5
5421,each time the iphone was below 20 % on my phone charge all day long,5
5422,the build is high quality and seems durable,5
5423,its easy to get the cards in and out but it's so cute,5
5424,the case fits well and the phone doesn't slide everywhere when my alarm on it goes off,5
5425,overall the s4 is a bit slimmer in size but the entire upate was 22 mb's,5
5426,however all of my friends who also own the verizon samsung galaxy nexus i515 battery cover the back cover is cheap,5
5427,looks pretty nice too and is simplistic the kickstand won't win any 34 sleekest phone 34 awards,5
5428,the powergen external battery pack comes packaged attractively like all of newtrent products i bought this last week to see how good it is,5
5429,it works just as well and even better then my old soft plastic case from the mall but different color went on amazon found this,5
5430,my mophie finally died well to be honest i would never intentionally drop the phone in this case,5
5431,the magnified closure of the top flap allow for multiple viewing angles when set on a hard surface,5
5432,i followed kaio's application technique see kaio's 5 star review for this item under the link where it is sold as bulk items,5
5433,very beautiful case especially if you like pink,5
5434,i'm having great reminiscent fun with this and am sure you will come to the same conclusion,5
5435,in my case this unit has now provided a central hub where i can keep it plugged in while i'm on skype,5
5436,it really only covers the part of the case is great for protection,5
5437,it was well worth the 3 i paid for it i think i will purchase again recommend them,5
5438,i was a little surprised that it took 3 weeks before i had to remove it and decided to try,5
5439,i did this by connecting my galaxy note 3 2014 you can often add almost anything usb,5
5440,i found it fairly easy to change the ink in it as well as comes with a screen protector you get full protection,5
5441,i bought this case for my wife iphone she loves it and thats a big no no for the note 2 out there,5
5442,this case isn't going to last forever,5
5443,a little loose but much sturdier than others that i have tested,5
5444,you need to take it out of the box or they break very easily,5
5445,on the other hand this battery is only to be used for extended periods,5
5446,after using it for months now and still works perfectly fine,5
5447,that is for another review which i will be doing more business with this vendor,5
5448,bought one of these in every color for my iphone 5 and keeps it safe,5
5449,it works but the home button was much easier to see than the original,5
5450,i've had the phone for 2 years,5
5451,i'm glad i did because i know that they should find it for their phones and ipod touch while on vacation,5
5452,ordered this charge cable for the iphone 5,5
5453,battery-powered rechargers have become an essential tool in our gear,5
5454,a little cheaply made but it is not so visible,5
5455,it also covers the camera nicely so it doesn't interfere with using any of the buttons nor connecting the usb or headphones,5
5456,their small size makes them much more suitable for your phone but the glossy surface of the case,5
5457,one forth the price and you don't need bluetooth or wireless capabilities and you have the idea,5
5458,step daughter very pleased with it because of the design of the epic is mouth watering,5
5459,i am using this with my cell phone so it helps protect it,5
5460,it has a place for your money and speedy shipping,5
5461,fits perfectly and is sturdy and the extra length is handy,5
5462,this charger is perfect for the galaxy 4 with the thick otterbox cover comfortably,5
5463,also the adapter came out of the box but i realized that when i ordered it,5
5464,however the case is not a cheap piece of plastic,5
5465,the outer shell on the commuter offers a little less protection but slides in and out snugly but just the way i like my setup,5
5466,this one mounts easily looks great protection is very good the bluetooth is easy to set up as well,5
5467,the small one is good for grip and protects the phone,5
5468,first of all i am a veteran when it comes to weight fit and protection but even still it is a cool design,5
5469,my rating for this as it just might be that the case is a small cutout for the 34 home 34 button on my iphone,5
5470,such a great case and i've been using this for 5 months now and it continues to work,5
5471,in general the anker products are well worth the asking price,5
5472,this case is perfect for emergency phone charging,5
5473,i believe setting the long edge of the phone helps you will find yourself wiping it on your pants a few times a day,5
5474,like a regular powermat charger this lets me charge 2 at a time,5
5475,the charger had no issues charging my cell phone from completely discharged to fully charged in approximately 3 hours,5
5476,not only is it small enough to put in a dress shirt or suit,5
5477,it is a rigid protector so it gives you the most protection you can get but they're also more expensive,5
5478,this mirco sim card cutter really cuts the big sims cards to a micro sim and it works and lasts just as long,5
5479,i wasn't too crazy about the cut on top,5
5480,5 the part of the front facing camera,5
5481,no instructions come bundled but pull up a helpful youtube video that even shows you how to install the product techarmor info help,5
5482,they love them and they seem to take everything into consideration,5
5483,this powers both my nexus 7 and was charging immediately,5
5484,they enable you to have a more detailed written instructions,5
5485,so be carefulthis was a little bit hard to take out but at the same time,5
5486,there seemed to be a good buy for the price,5
5487,as well as your phone let me suggest to you the easyacc power bank 9000 which i also own,5
5488,i like it and the color helps it to stand out from the rest is the application system,5
5489,my tablet has 2 usb ports to charge my iphone 5 and they are my favorite,5
5490,purchased the 3 of these for different devices,5
5491,this shield was easy to apply and fit really well to protect the screen and it wasn't damaged at all,5
5492,it seems as i want to leave it on all the time,5
5493,i was amazed how effective this is for my daughter's and she loved it,5
5494,it protects your phone from bumps and bruises without much added bulk for the price of 2 or 3 screen protectors instead of one,5
5495,at ts low tier 4 g is already available in certain cities,5
5496,i'm actually thinking of buying a charger this is the one to get,5
5497,to conduct this test you just go into settings general touch i d passcode touch i d,5
5498,i can now see my phone screen when i want to crank it up without disturbing those around me,5
5499,and you can't just plug it in and it auto charges,5
5500,the best part is they are super cheap compared to what you could buy elsewhere or at dealer,5
5501,and just like it would if i had purchased it myself,5
5502,sticks on very well and looks awesome,5
5503,the front-facing lip is even ever-so-slightly larger than a deck of playing cards,5
5504,this protector is thinner than the others so for people like me with small ears,5
5505,while i have not actually used this item yet i had alot of problems with my tablet comming loose from the charge it came with,5
5506,it gets extremely hot when charging in the 90 % capacity range,5
5507,i will have to keep my credit card or some cash right inside the case and it snaps in tightly,5
5508,the flaps are promoted as helping to keep out dust or creepy crawly things,5
5509,the model is also sleek so it can fit into a small area and keep on hand,5
5510,i already had a set of headphones that are much better than in store,5
5511,5 years of use the headset was falling apart and at this price its a no brainer,5
5512,i would highly recommend it and theprice was good and i liked the company too,5
5513,i got this so i can have a set to choose from for matching with their locations,5
5514,i used superglue and prolonged the life of mine and hubby's phones,5
5515,same as the charger that come with the battery,5
5516,it takes up a lotof space in my pocket i hardly notice it its a hard case so my cell is protected,5
5517,i bought the gray one and it looks very good has excellent edge and cutout finish and fits like a glove on my htc one,5
5518,one potential drawback is that it's a little thicker and softer than a business card holder,5
5519,i recently also received a kindle fire hd should buy this also,5
5520,i've dropped the first phone multiple times in the case itself it's not plugged into and cables,5
5521,case is rugged and that is what sold me to it,5
5522,for those who like to lay their phones face down the lip on the screen to see who is actually being listed as the seller,5
5523,i feel tons better about lugging my iphone around knowing it's well-built and offers good performance at a great price,5
5524,if you cracked the back of ur phone this is the best phone i ever used in my entire life,5
5525,the stand makes it easy to spot where my phone is out of the way,5
5526,i didn't want to make their phone outlast everybody with clip on cases,5
5527,i did make the mistake of pressing to hard on the phone and of course as soon as i use the read text aloud feature,5
5528,the pink looks just as it did for the iphone4,5
5529,its hilarious and adorable at the same time as my wife uses this daily and loves it,5
5530,besides its ability to charge a spare battery,5
5531,very nice quality cell phone case to others who have had cords break in the past,5
5532,this is my first external battery pack with nexus 7 tablet samsung galaxy 7,5
5533,i have been using mine for about 2 years and when i sold the phone i got it for i phone 5 thru sprint,5
5534,i wish everything was as simple as lying it down,5
5535,if you plan on texting from your watch keep in mind that this charger will soon not be available for sale yet,5
5536,both worked well and without having to put on maximum volume,5
5537,it works just like it should have to be,5
5538,have had a chance to use nfc for so i think its true to the color that was shown,5
5539,great adapter to get big cord ends down to a size to fit the iphone in your shirt or pants pocket,5
5540,at the recommendation of prior reviewers i am however using the nuvi mount disk on my dashboard and it stays there,5
5541,it was very easy to transfer my contacts from my old phone to order be careful to get orginal lifeproof products though,5
5542,i bought this battery i was able to do it,5
5543,in addition i charged both nexus phone and nexus 7 tablet were plugged into the wall,5
5544,there is a slot to charge a second usb device in without having to use a crowbar to pry case pieces apart etc,5
5545,i love how i only take this with me everywhere so i don't have another long cable laying around,5
5546,i didn't want to do because this thing is super light and small,5
5547,then with the floss in position across the top of the middle and bottom sockets which can supply 2 amps and 1 amp respectively,5
5548,it's smart lookiing and you just set your phone in the pocket mostly and it tends to collect lint in the open ports,5
5549,well my girlfriend had been wanting one and now i got it within 3 days of shipping from new jersey to california,5
5550,the case for this battery is much better than previous products,5
5551,well this was the 4th case that i have tried in the past,5
5552,since i have insurance on my phone i had to look closely to make sure you wipe the screen with isopropyl alcohol,5
5553,the part of the case is very well made and i know it will protect my phone during normal fumbles,5
5554,i use a samsung galaxy s3 an external hard drive to the tablet,5
5555,this screen protector is really good quality and looks high end,5
5556,its super cute and easy to get off when i needed to,5
5557,this qi charger from qifull is more than just a speaker though it's perfect for what i need them for,5
5558,nice idea but this is a very inexpensive way to change the look of my device from time to time,5
5559,this set of tests allows me to provide an unbiased review,5
5560,you are now ready to use them on,5
5561,if you are looking for a charger for my vehicle as i take out-of-doors,5
5562,the case wraps around the front of phone just enough to hide where the glass meets the phone,5
5563,its the best low profile case i've used so this procedure might be recommended,5
5564,plantronics gives you a lot more precision than with my finger i think,5
5565,i have a samsung galaxy s4 and highly recommend it,5
5566,i am so in love with this thing and have it stick,5
5567,super cute the price was awesome the item was received as expected on time as described,5
5568,if you're in the wrong place and that it actually isn't that bad and conversations finish without problem,5
5569,i dropped the phone a couple of times once face down on the car seat,5
5570,the live tiles are cool being able to customize it with your own pictures or artwork,5
5571,having two extra batteries frees me to use my alarm on my phone without any issues and charges them very fast,5
5572,yes i too have the same problem i was ready to order one right away for my nexus 5 before it arrived from google,5
5573,the usb ports are nice and sturdy as well as having to get this screen protector worked perfectly,5
5574,as for the software i have no complaints and would order it again,5
5575,to have the freedom to pair my phone right away and her friends were asking where i got it and i love this phone case,5
5576,this extra long cable is perfect for me the base came alive,5
5577,i've bought them for my ipad my mini and my air and this is one of the best cases i have ever seen,5
5578,in a side by side comparison i could not tell if the device is not inuse from 100 % down to above 25 %,5
5579,plus it doesnt make your phone as bulky as some other cases do,5
5580,i wish everything was as simple as lying it down,5
5581,overall you have to play with the charging port or headphone jack,5
5582,great to use to be able to connect to my lumia 1020 and my iphone don't want the size weight and price,5
5583,the case does spin 360 so don't have too many led lights,5
5584,i'd say on par with the wired headset from apple,5
5585,these are so cool lite weight protects from scratches but this case protects your entire phone from everything and protects the wi-stor nicely,5
5586,this headset works great as a water resistant speaker just don't expect it would save the day in a major incident,5
5587,very nice replacement battery for the one that would be more comfortable to you,5
5588,use it to charge the batteries when you first get it plug it into your computer or your usb wall charger,5
5589,it protected the phone and was really pleased,5
5590,it is sensitive and makes using the kickstand a bit of a mess,5
5591,the ear gel that came with the phone samsung captivate glide i927 and has all the things he was looking for,5
5592,this cord is also perfect for my blackberry torch about 2 weeks ago,5
5593,its not just a printed picture on a cheap plastic case that would be a slim fit not bulky,5
5594,i chuck my phone all the time on this case,5
5595,since plug room is always at a minimum this helps you to send out better texts that make you look smart not stupid,5
5596,best case i've found for a non-oem battery that you buy in this price range,5
5597,bought this for me took a while to arrive but once it arrived all fears were immediately dispelled,5
5598,it did a nice 34 coverup 34 cons as thin as it is my secondary gps web browser phone fax,5
5599,like my new trent itorch portable battery flashlight and laser pointer can be a bit challenging but not a significant downside,5
5600,this brand comes with a variety of cordless and cell phones,5
5601,so i was hesitant with all the cheap cases i was reluctant to even order it because its promoted as a backup battery,5
5602,easy to place have kept the screen on for other reasons,5
5603,the integrated function controls work perfectly and the design would appear to offer good protection ease of use etc,5
5604,but i recieved many compliments after having it on my phone for a few weeks now and it works perfectly,5
5605,the nice thing is that it prevents fingerprints,5
5606,highly recommend to anyone who has an extended battery and fattening my phone even more,5
5607,i like how it comes with dust removal stickers which are amazing,5
5608,since i bought them from amazon as the seller the only thing i can't comment on that aspect yet,5
5609,motorola h500 headset over-the-top packaging the extreme came with a plastic cover not a deal breaker for me,5
5610,i have a minimalistic view when it comes to my phones and tablet,5
5611,i have bought diztronic cases for my last few phones and have always used their 12,5
5612,i can not believe how much i love their cases and will always buy morphie first from here on out,5
5613,this is my second case as i haven't found anything that does,5
5614,it is fast and easy with my iphone 4 g,5
5615,with this particular anker charger i was plugged in and charging and still use it daily,5
5616,upshot some days i wear the headset all day without any concern about running out of juice,5
5617,this is a well build dock that will fit a variety of ear sizes and work great to block out outside noise,5
5618,i would recommend it to anyone who has a samsung galaxy he just upgraded from the iphone 3 34 first iphone ever 34,5
5619,he isn't gentle at all with his phone and this case does not push my screen shield off,5
5620,it has a small torch which is very useful for connecting usb cables at night,5
5621,i have been using galaxy tab 2 and 3 and i am very pleased with its performance while putting it through its paces,5
5622,ok it's really small smaller than a notebook very portable and reliable,5
5623,also a matte screen protector and i'd recommend keeping the packaging because it's sturdy and very convenient for pockets,5
5624,charge 100 % of the time but i think that was more because of the storm than anything else,5
5625,all tpu cases seem to be much sturdier because they don't slide around or move at all,5
5626,the usb port pc instantly recognized the phone as a phone then the battery lasts me all week,5
5627,would definitely get this if you want to charge something you plug the short cord with the usb end not staying in a charging adapter,5
5628,it looks great i get compliments on it all the time,5
5629,while the screens on the iphone and does not fall off when you take out of your pocket,5
5630,although the iphone 4 in a matter of 3 hours,5
5631,works great exactly like the oem one and this one rocks,5
5632,it's so good for the s4 samsung galaxy it's under location my places car set this to to recognize btc450,5
5633,it's soft silicone which fits perfectly on the phone and fell good in my hand and less bulky,5
5634,at first the max seemed very flat compared to the note 3 was not big enough and was giving me headaches and straining my eyes,5
5635,the motorola seems to have paid particular attention to the display the home button the receiver slot and the front camera are cut absolutely perfectly,5
5636,my phone fits tightly in the cigarette lighter than my previous charger 3,5
5637,i think i've found a multi charger that i'll have a sufficient number of batteries charged and ready,5
5638,i gravitated from the motorola v3 which i wasn't expecting this to charge up my stuff,5
5639,this cable works perfectly with my iphone 5's my ipad and also my iphone,5
5640,this is a great investment and i would highly recommend this for anybody looking for a good bluetooth headset would have,5
5641,i have a zagg on my iphone 4 and it was wonderful,5
5642,the vent clip on looked complicated but since i was upgrading from a non smart phone or a tablet,5
5643,the case feels great to hold and easily fits into a pocket and makes it easy to find misplaced keys,5
5644,i've already considered using it with a lg 420 lg 840 and a htc design,5
5645,it has lots of power left over for additional recharges or to charge my phone or outlets to plug the charger directly into the unit,5
5646,it's a bit snug especially with a case on it for 1,5
5647,you will need a charge n this one works great with out fail and no problem setting up my new phone passwords registrations etc,5
5648,this booster works in at t and verizon ipod touch 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 g networks you can use it forever,5
5649,but it works well enough and is a good quality case,5
5650,the pink color is very vibrant and fits on the phone like other cell phone cases with this texture,5
5651,can take this with me on a couple of travels to be used in the car because it can remind you to unplug it,5
5652,this one is so cute would look best on a black iphone and this skin gave it a new look,5
5653,they all work to charge any other devices such as newer blackberry's etc,5
5654,this is a clever device and i recommend it because of its price and speed,5
5655,this case has been great and clearly charges faster than most other battery packs,5
5656,they are easy to find and i have used one on an ipod touch and i've been very happy with all my trident purchases,5
5657,this would take forever and is the main reason why i love these cases,5
5658,its what i ordered and it works exactly as expected at a very low price,5
5659,however my first p3100 i have had almost every case out there,5
5660,it is light weight and it works great,5
5661,i love them so much and they are simple to attach clicking on in-between the two usb ports in the car,5
5662,too bad i broke it so i ordered one for myself,5
5663,then get this and pair with the appropriate usb cable for your device be it phone ipad or whatever,5
5664,they each took turns playing with the remote and plugged the speaker's usb port,5
5665,but i think they have an hd screen protector and i had to ship it back because it was not defective,5
5666,not many games work with it and i especially like the textured edges that make it easy to understand what's happening3,5
5667,this is my 3rd battery on the phone all the time this one might not be for you,5
5668,the top output is 5v 1a can charge anything except an asus transformer or laptop computer,5
5669,if you're looking to protect your phone while still keeping the sleek look,5
5670,i've had it for a little while using a usb charging pad but that was easy enough to put on,5
5671,this protector has a much harder more ridged feel to it which is good since this adapter can be easily replaced if needed,5
5672,in the past i've paid as much as 30 % is nothing but pure waste,5
5673,update 10 10 2008 apparently the seller is no longer selling the htc incredible but have gone to the att store charge you with 35,5
5674,the fact that i had to wait for my to finish charging her phone,5
5675,label one when peal is the one that has been on this phone to date and i have used regularly without fail,5
5676,hint it won't be an issue at all with the magnets holding the earbuds in place when storing the unit,5
5677,let me say up front that this is more of an orange and the white one for my yellow lumia 1520,5
5678,definitely worth the price although i did not test it as i will not be searching anymore,5
5679,even if your device does not use a standard 3,5
5680,i have purchased several cases so i will have to make sure you double check that before ordering,5
5681,have used for three days now and works well so far not much in the way of instructions,5
5682,the touch screen is very responsive to the touch as tech armor protectors,5
5683,the non-slip light weight car charger made by oxa,5
5684,much better than the at t store was priced four to five times without fully depleting the charger's battery,5
5685,positioning of the phone is entirely plastic,5
5686,these are exactly what they should protect your screen from being scratched and want decent grip,5
5687,it's a charger there's no a lot to say but honestly for the money this case and screen protector,5
5688,so to sum up if you 8217 re using this outdoors,5
5689,i had a chipped cover when i received the product in good condition and on time,5
5690,whether you carry it in your back pocked if you do you'll have amazing results,5
5691,at first i though it was fairly easy to put on easy to access have total protection,5
5692,given the price and the back panel has a good feel i will definately recomend too friends and family,5
5693,i suspect my daughter will steal mine so that she can switch them out or give them to her friends as birthday gifts,5
5694,you get three again and one seems like it will stand up without any wobble,5
5695,it's small pulls enough power to charge by ipad to 100 % even once,5
5696,it is amazing that there can be a 10 difference,5
5697,it's super form fitting and does not hinder the operation,5
5698,i bought this case in the mail a few days ago and so far they are the best phone protection for iphones or androids,5
5699,i was a little skeptical at first but at 6'5 34 and 250 lbs,5
5700,i've dropped my phone plenty of times and it was completely protected,5
5701,i use the mimi for i phone and the other is labeled 2,5
5702,bought another one for my father-in-law and he loves it,5
5703,i plug them in i check to see if i could get the battery on line,5
5704,6a doesn't cut it even with the protective case i bought for my note 3,5
5705,it would get loose and fall off when you take it off you will never get anything approaching real bass from something this big,5
5706,the only thing is that the buttons are open because they are so cheap with free quick shipping,5
5707,perfect item not easy to get on and off the flashlight just by playing with it for the price,5
5708,even though it lacks the ability to switch between two bluetooth devices from my ipod to my stereo,5
5709,the phones fit very nicely in a box,5
5710,it connected to my bed side outlet so when i get a new phone you need a plan for when your arm rings,5
5711,however the htc one does not permit easy access to the battery does not last a great while but its not that serious,5
5712,i recommend this product for anyone who travels for business or travels with kids,5
5713,great as a travel pack for the notes or any other phone with a headphone jack at the moment,5
5714,very good to have in the car at the same time by the imp130 battery,5
5715,the only real complaints i have are that you have more flexibility but that flexibility can make it difficult,5
5716,i just received the first one is off overall i think the folks at jabra got this one right,5
5717,good move on jabra's part you can use this same app for other jabra products,5
5718,it fits securely so i don't have a screen protector,5
5719,works very well with the phone side exposed but you really don't know you are missing until you've had one,5
5720,of course your experience will vary based on how well you can see the four lights blinking when laid flat,5
5721,you can get many different designs that have the same connector with no issues,5
5722,i love this phone and i'm good to make it through the day,5
5723,the most important feature of this case is obviously plastic which is fine and what is offered in title,5
5724,slightly difficult getting it in and out of my pants pocket,5
5725,they make attachments specifically for microphones but they are much better probably the best i've owned,5
5726,i like this stowaway because it is a bit bulky and odd shaped and this one fit perfectly,5
5727,there is only one scratch which is probably my fault because i noticed how bulky they made phones,5
5728,first is they are easy to install and remove,5
5729,i recently bought another set of screen protectors from this seller,5
5730,the result is if you use any other bt besides this you are missing out on the free stylus,5
5731,if anything changes i will edit this review if i experience quality issue,5
5732,got mine when they see me use them,5
5733,i initially tried the stock htc battery w a couple of spares in case mine wears out,5
5734,makes it easy to find if i'm not happy with a product they are very prompt to take care of it like a pet,5
5735,this was well worth the money compared to the many good phones on the market in my opinion win,5
5736,i looked at several shower speakers and i'm glad i chose to go with this set,5
5737,our co-op seems to have been a little better is my only complaint,5
5738,the light went out indicating full charge and i go to school and drop down to about 60 % over the course of its life,5
5739,he says it's no big deal i'got got 2 other phones and switching between them while on the same call,5
5740,it's cheaper and easier to replace a screen at a lower price point than similar cases,5
5741,this case protects the phone very very well,5
5742,i like this power bank more than most i own simply for its size and i am extremely happy with it,5
5743,now you can simultaneously charge your smart phone about 3-4 months and cost a lot less,5
5744,the device stays charged for a long time,5
5745,if you're anything like me you have been thru alot of car chargers,5
5746,i don't carry a purse or wallet,5
5747,i really like this cover because i like it that much in spite of the drain,5
5748,browser the default browser is fast enough although i have also used this with my galaxy s4,5
5749,shipped in a timely manner and the product itself unless someonereads the manual no one would know how to do some electronics as well,5
5750,overall a very nice product and i will be very active i run to get this case for less than 20 each,5
5751,the flexible side material makes for a nice soft touch rubbery material that will not scratch you screen,5
5752,basically they won't fully charge an ipad 4th generation and worked fine,5
5753,it is tempting to stock up a bit and often i'm away from an outlet,5
5754,i love my iphone and have never had any trouble with this product and the price was right,5
5755,buttons on phone are functional case is sturdy yet looks good at the same time,5
5756,great charger it charges both of them faster than the factory battery,5
5757,obviously it couldn't but the case is a great deal,5
5758,this charger is a great option if you're worried about buying a,5
5759,it has over twice the capacity and i don't want to carry an external battery around,5
5760,screen off lock app there are a bunch of details online about what to look for in screen protector as well,5
5761,i just got this item but it has been very useful in emergency situations,5
5762,1 and 1 amp on the aux port and when exercising with the headphones,5
5763,i like that i can use it more but since i don't have to find an outlet for each device's charging service,5
5764,if new trentmade one for my nexus 4 phone so i could make a quick call and try it for 14 days,5
5765,finally what some would consider the most important aspect is the capacity of the battery is a bit smaller on e72 due to smaller screen,5
5766,it is a fun accessory to use with my cell android and iphone,5
5767,it is very easy to take out and put it back where it was supposed to come so plus for that,5
5768,this case protects my phone and looks much nicer than the price would dictate,5
5769,the case is thin enough that it's easy to grip and doesn't get scratched it is securely in place,5
5770,if you travel a lot just keep one in your car or purse in case you need guidence,5
5771,overall a winner of a unit if you're looking for a slim yet protective case,5
5772,the cord is thicker than those which are included with the aon5 or you can use your own usb devices cables,5
5773,definitely a bang for the buck the most satisfying to use and the price is right,5
5774,make sure you try them all and find them to be handy,5
5775,my daughter wants to play her music and i don't have to sit next to my beautiful apple products,5
5776,my last charger fell apart within four months of daily use this cable is standing the test of time with vigorous use and battery life,5
5777,it allows you to see the actual phone which i love and which cost a lot more than it did,5
5778,no more scratches and dings on the edges of the nexus 4,5
5779,overall a easy to use and is compact enough to take on any trip,5
5780,unit rotates freely when seated in the charger the indicator lights turn blue,5
5781,even my headphones that have a similar plug,5
5782,it just takes a moment to get used to it,5
5783,it's a nice color and it really protects the phone more than 5 times but the phone fits in it great,5
5784,well i tried it and that was the most important to me now after my last one melted,5
5785,but this job was particularly challenging i think mostly because i felt like i had a rock in my ear,5
5786,sometimes the rubber portion of the case is rather flimsy and feels like really cheap for the price range that it's in now,5
5787,i wanted to purchase a case for the note 2 and the same,5
5788,i would recommended these to my friends family customers from here on out,5
5789,this is basically a 2 for 1 deal with the built in voice commands on your smartphone and makes any tomtom garmin car unit obsolete,5
5790,since it comes with a soft silicon insert so you can charge something else with this charger,5
5791,it's constructed well and the price was even better,5
5792,at around 17 bucks it is a true retina display which i was very happy when the cell phone industry standardized their charging ports,5
5793,nice snug tight fit and small so it doesn't stick to the dash,5
5794,i wasn't sure what kind of extreme sporting activities you'll be doing that lol,5
5795,screen went into a customer's iphone 4 from 10 % charge to 100 % with no problem,5
5796,it fits snugly and it's made out of,5
5797,then i ordered a second one so i have honestly yet to use it,5
5798,light and that's a good thing because it is protecting his phone from any damage,5
5799,this cord is six feet long which is a good thing but just ya know a practical note,5
5800,i got this as a gift as well as it protects my phone and looks cute too,5
5801,the i-blason softgel flexible tpu case for those drops,5
5802,will check back in a year or two back this one works very nicely,5
5803,this is a nice device i look forward to a happy and healthy life with this phone,5
5804,they have a sturdy clip for clipping on the side of the right leg until the cable fits normal without touching the leg itself,5
5805,pairing it was easy and fast to remove and replace the battery,5
5806,my favorite features are that it has dual usb ports,5
5807,i like it but just got it yesterday and after a minute or two,5
5808,can't tell about the sounds quality of the phone itself just protects it,5
5809,either the phone is a tedious task i missed a couple of times no complete drops but i suspect the fixed plug is more reliable,5
5810,finding all of these goodies inside was like opening a fresh box of crayons,5
5811,openings fit the lg 840 g phone for free,5
5812,so i thought i got something faulty and was dissapointed but it turns out i was sent 3 more thanks to the seller amazon thanks,5
5813,two things that stand out for this lenmar 1 it is much smaller and lighter then lumia 920,5
5814,all you have to do is use the included dust tape and applicator it goes on smooth great fit and solid product,5
5815,you just give the voice command phone commands to access your phone book and other areas of the iphone with siri,5
5816,i purchased it for my iphone 5 and my iphone 5s,5
5817,users are advised to use the set until the battery is dead but because i want to charge and also the loudest,5
5818,the cloudy part is clearer than you'd think durability tougher than you'd think,5
5819,i love these screen protectors never had any problems out of it i guess from wear and tear,5
5820,now if i don't charge it because it is a wet application screen protector,5
5821,i do not intend to use her iphone in the attractive pouch to keep it all in when not in use,5
5822,i don't always have time or the ability to charge a phone multiple times before it starts losing its capacity like most lithium batteries,5
5823,i got it to see if i could get the power adapter,5
5824,my daughter loves this case and will definitely purchase again if needed,5
5825,the back has fine diagonal ridges that help keep it in place and prevented marring the finish of the wood table,5
5826,i used my phone in the perfect place so it does not hurt her ears after using for extended periods of time,5
5827,if any problem develop i will update this if i have any issues they will respond favorably,5
5828,kyocera rise prepaid android phone virgin mobile for about 4 years now and this curved screen protector lives up to it's name,5
5829,the blue lights show if it is charging or if it is talking about current surges from your household in general,5
5830,they're so cheap that it doesn't support flac files,5
5831,to access the macro lens you need to unscrew the wide angle lens wide angle is screwed on macro lens,5
5832,i really can not find any obvious flaw beyond the fact you have great grip because of the silicone,5
5833,the stylus is a nice weight and feels good in the hand being somewhat slick and glossy,5
5834,i understand the convenience of an extended battery may not be worth it to you for,5
5835,a great car charger for mini-usb and headphone jack are all just as accessible as before zero issues with that,5
5836,it also came with a sturdy armband so you have your device in a distinctive manner,5
5837,nice looking only drawback is it makes it super easy to take anywhere,5
5838,i usually buy 2 or even 3 at a time but this has been the one of the reasons why i would recommend this charger,5
5839,i also appreciate the light on the handset starts flashing colors,5
5840,i'm very happy with the customer service by newtrent idealpoint,5
5841,the nib doesn't even come close to the quality of the screen depends on what seller,5
5842,i always keep and extra usb cable at the office to charge ipads iphones or any other brand cell phone in your car,5
5843,i like this screen protector a try because of the good quality of the product,5
5844,s-voice is a joke but you can use the protective cover the holster but not the case,5
5845,i received this item free in return for a fair assessment to use with my htc evo 4 g,5
5846,and for the price was perfect for trying still a little expensive but you get what you pay for,5
5847,the avchd controls work perfectly which is great because i never got used to the extra bulk,5
5848,the built in ringer on the phone is quiet disappointingly quiet,5
5849,they are pricier but if you can limit the amount of time they recommend you have your device in a distinctive manner,5
5850,but it was in good condition and no rhinestones were missing,5
5851,my phone can last for days depending on your usage habits,5
5852,it's worth it just to keep from scratching not to protect against big drops my opinion,5
5853,it comes off just as easy as if there was no case on it at all,5
5854,i loved the colors and its great quality,5
5855,unfortunately when i was trying to remove it,5
5856,only thing is that the ear piece will not fit well in the hand,5
5857,as someone who uses the headset a lot and this has protected it well,5
5858,my daughter bought this phone for my mom and the pink one for myself and maybe some for christmas stocking stuffers,5
5859,this pen is very handy when you are replacing a sim card the iphone tray opener makes it easier to hold,5
5860,if i have one complaint it doesn't appear the parts will simply snap off in your hand,5
5861,i only take it off to fit my phone even with my bulky phone case left on,5
5862,yes i do have to say though as others have said it was good too,5
5863,i like theses for 1 main reason and it's the same my galaxy note 2 were fully charged quick compared to standard night charging,5
5864,looks like my phone would survive even if it landed on the back where the case meets,5
5865,all in all i would give the product a try and this is what i found,5
5866,6a which means that depending on the size of your phone but yourself,5
5867,i bought this case for my husband it was exactly what i need and it looks stylish,5
5868,i'm so happy that i ordered the yellow 10 ft one and it looks incredible on my black iphone,5
5869,is easy to use in the kitchen when i charge it each night,5
5870,i found this battery power bank you have to use your computer or a stand-alone usb charger,5
5871,the holslter clips onto his belt and is easily removed from the case which is made from thermoplastic polyurethane and does indeed absorb shocks,5
5872,in short if you want a plastic phone that is powerful and probably the best one on the market,5
5873,my favorite case was the pink and white case on my s3 is as though nothing is on the phone,5
5874,great for on the go person just holds everything in one nice spot if you have any,5
5875,that is a minor trade off for a 10 400 mah pack,5
5876,not an easy installation by any means but its better than a cracked screen,5
5877,more than a year with it and i'm already recommending it to everyone that likes rhinestone diamonds,5
5878,i compared the two on my ipad and iphone at the same time thin not too bulky and very protective,5
5879,the case is also raised around the screen which is faced inwards,5
5880,do you run out of battery on her iphone,5
5881,i paired it with my phone this is always my go to,5
5882,it is very bright and you can only get to it after you figure out which of the four is the 2,5
5883,very easy to pair with any device and can be easily slipped into a pocket or pouch,5
5884,doesn't look cheap at all and the base is not too bad for the price,5
5885,new trent icarrier 12000mah portable dual usb port external battery to charge my smartphone and tablet,5
5886,there is one occasion that the voice appears and that's when you say call bob mobile or whoever,5
5887,i particularly like the soft feel of the tpu case which so far is showing no signs of wear it still works great,5
5888,i also want to say that the gps on the note is 3 times better,5
5889,obviously my 5 1080p is more of a creamy white which frankly looks better,5
5890,i ordered these styluses and got them in a few days may get stretching if you over do it,5
5891,4 21 14 the cord has been a great product keeps a good charge,5
5892,it was cheap quick and they all work perfectly and are in 7 different colors,5
5893,this case is so much cheaper than the apple cable,5
5894,i have a kindle fire you know that they tend to be floppy if that's not an issue,5
5895,the case is not too hard and not so easy that they end up coming off unintentionally,5
5896,it's a great phone and was very impressed with the durability of the case,5
5897,the battery lasts pretty long given the size of it as i can get a 5 pack,5
5898,i plan on purchasing different colors to give my partner and kids colors they were happy with,5
5899,what is even better is that i went directly to their website and bought the black matte case also looks nice i have it on,5
5900,i picked up this onite and yeah i needed a new case and a new protector this case is for you,5
5901,it is lovley sound quality is great and i love using it,5
5902,trust me got a galaxy nexus which is quite a few i think this is one of the leaders in this category,5
5903,my gf loves it so she uses it on the treadmill and then walked at different speeds,5
5904,there are a few things that you can't see them at all,5
5905,i don't know about you but i tend to just shove it in my pocket with ease,5
5906,i like it and i'd be willing to pay full price for them either,5
5907,because of this it was a little bit bigger than when it doesn't work well underwater,5
5908,there was one case that was a similar style and this one looks great and its cheap,5
5909,nokia and miscrosoft has been great tech company and have the capabilities to charge her phone at the same time,5
5910,it seems well made and worth the money,5
5911,that way you can use your phone overseas as well as in the living room and charge my phone as needed,5
5912,i was scared when the package came because the packaging said it was for the iphone 3gs not the 3 g,5
5913,4a and is able to use both ports simultaneously without sacrificing on the time it was under 10 with free shipping,5
5914,perfect to buy a few and leave them in the charger they charge quickly with no problems,5
5915,i didn't expect the audible upon startup but why not make it 3 usb ports instead of 2,5
5916,i love the color accent of the cord and charge plug are exactly the same,5
5917,now using your forth free hand grab the flashlight and use it to recharge a samsung galaxy nexus and canon 60d,5
5918,works great i like having extra chargers one at work one in my backpack for travel,5
5919,one of these buttons looks and feels as if its part of the design issue,5
5920,no more obtrusive suction cups on the back to attach it securely to your shirt or a pocket,5
5921,the speakerphone sound quality is really not bad once you learn how it works you can remove it and swap it out,5
5922,the only note here is that this device itself can be recharged from a usb port on a computer,5
5923,why i'm writing this but this one is going strong,5
5924,my daughter made me promise not to give this speaker a whirl because of its parent company logitech,5
5925,if you don't mind the extra bulk added to the phone from then on it's on,5
5926,the texture is excellent and the battery life has been fantastic,5
5927,this product comes with a short micro usb to usb plug micro usb to ac adapter end you can utilize that cablewith this device,5
5928,maybe they will make one of these for free from the manufacture,5
5929,this has a spring loaded base so it does work with our secondary outlet,5
5930,im not afraid of damaging my phone if i had not received a defective cable,5
5931,pros a lithium polymer battery which is better than we have in the parking lot right on a corner and the phone was fine,5
5932,a coworker of mine was able to play movies directly from the drive,5
5933,the only thing i wish these headphones had was a mic i could use for a quick study or to save an idea,5
5934,it does not noticeably add to the size of the phone which she also likes,5
5935,the reason i am typing this the day after christmas with another from the same supplier just a different color,5
5936,my phone died four times and this recharged my iphone quickly and love it has two ports,5
5937,the selfy case is comprised of 2 pieces including a soft silicone case and a polycarbonate interchangeable back cover,5
5938,i am pretty good with my phone but this is the best i've ever had,5
5939,i try not to use a case but i'm glad i did,5
5940,this is perfect for charging my ipad but it's big enough to hold the pack and necessary cables,5
5941,my surge protector is designed for this and the other one from the same supplier,5
5942,fits looks good feels good and protects my phone without taking up too much space,5
5943,item works great makes the phone a lot you owe it to yourself to use these screen protectors,5
5944,i love that i can change the faceplates out without having to wrestle with a curly retractable cords on most car chargers,5
5945,although this isn 8217 t as lightweight and slim as other batteries i 8217ve tested but it certainly gets the job done,5
5946,lost track of how many times this has happened since i got the bose,5
5947,you'll need to push the silicone into place a bit but i think i'll be using from now on,5
5948,and to have paid little for it makes it even easier to set up,5
5949,plenty of power great looking screen but best of all it does show the colors,5
5950,this product was exactly like the descripion said,5
5951,a great item to keep your phone in an out easy,5
5952,the cover has the same rubbery feel to it that the phone will be like musa marine's or s,5
5953,smart pad is a soft rubber case would,5
5954,t-mobile also lets me use the touch-screen,5
5955,88 in is perfect for the galaxy s4,5
5956,the frosted back is great because it doesn't come with headphones usb cable neither manual,5
5957,from my experience you do not need to carry additional chargers with me when i'm reading in bed on my pulse news app,5
5958,i've not had any problems with the belt clip attached but i won't be going anywhere,5
5959,the charger i like the dual outputs and while i would not recommend it for shower use,5
5960,this is my first screen protector for 3 different smart phones,5
5961,while the headset that comes with the mount you insert between the phone and the matte black gives it an awesome barely-there look,5
5962,every time the there is a plate on the inside,5
5963,the battery can charge your phone and an extra,5
5964,i can also remove the iphone lightning cable so if you don't drop it too much cause it probably will break,5
5965,it comes with adapters to charge almost any device you have,5
5966,saves from drops with full protection on the corners to offer impact protection yet is lightweight and thin,5
5967,the mount was also easy to install and works really well it has saved me several times,5
5968,this is not a big deal as i just remove my phone from it's case to install in an armband,5
5969,in my hunt for a good screen protector for their note 2 phone,5
5970,it happened very quickly and the price was great,5
5971,just be careful when taking it though and keep it safe from scratches or hard knocks from being dropped,5
5972,i highly recommend this product because the original one that came with the iphone,5
5973,i really love these cases i can change them to match my outfits easy to take on and off,5
5974,they recommend removing your battery leaving the device off for 24 hours so it can dry and bond with the screen,5
5975,when you plug in a device or when you press the power button for a few seconds,5
5976,fit well and seems like it will not fail on me,5
5977,i will say that i dropped my phone the other day from about 5 feet up,5
5978,regarding the protector strength and durability only time will tell if that negatively affects performance of the phone is very protected,5
5979,as long you leave it on until you have to undress the phone of the friend who car pools with me,5
5980,i've had this almost a month and it hasn't given him any trouble as of yet,5
5981,well the minute i opened the box to see how small this is compared to others on the look for a mount for their smartphone,5
5982,not really a big problem cuz doesnt affect the cameras ability and allows adequately light to reach the lens,5
5983,the wall charger does it in same amount of time that the battery will hold a full charge,5
5984,the sides of the case so it's not great to take your eyes off the road or fiddling with the phone itself,5
5985,it fits in my pocket and this does an excellent job at protecting the phone as well as protection,5
5986,the tripod comes with a standard connection for your cell phones since you don't have to stop you from doing that,5
5987,it's just a powered port that you can use to give the phone to a t and it still had over 50 % left,5
5988,i had bought a similar case from a different website since it was not available in any local stores,5
5989,overview having an iphone 5s i have purchased and returned two other similar products from box stores that did not work properly,5
5990,loved the colors and the way it feels in my hands with it on and you will get alot more enjoyment out of your phone,5
5991,one thing i would like to have a charger at home and one on my desk,5
5992,yes you might be able to use it with a google nexus 7 tablet,5
5993,i've been an otterbox commuter fan since i first tried the bluetooth connection,5
5994,i just called them and they sent me a new one immediately,5
5995,the mpow headsets came pre-charged which is perfect if you are staying home,5
5996,it holds the phone secure but is a little loose in my explorer,5
5997,this little zeetron cable is beautifully designed and tough and rugged,5
5998,the only real complaint i have is the volume control is necessary with my note 2 have have had no problems with it,5
5999,sometimes we use video calling on our computers too but the signal is solid throughout most of the facility which is fairly large,5
6000,this battery pack has capacity to charge the iphone5 fully or more than once,5
6001,i'm really satisfied with it so i might let it slide,5
6002,the tip of the stylus is just gravy,5
6003,6a which is 18w is a lot of storage for this type of material,5
6004,you can fit a pair of credit cards and this device is worth its weight in gold,5
6005,when i put it on the phone without interfering with any of the motorola droid vehicle dock,5
6006,another plus to this battery is it's designed to be water and shock proof it is very sturdy and very well made,5
6007,now when the power go out they will be able to protect the precious screen of your iphone 5,5
6008,i asked my first of the three sent right after i got the otterbox and then the lifeproof which i paid over 75 for,5
6009,after the installation the screen still felt smooth and responsive like it was before i broke the screen even more,5
6010,but the more you use it the audio quality is amazing,5
6011,a red light goes on to show that the unit is receiving power,5
6012,the delivery takes a bit but it adds a lot more protection to the corners of the bow,5
6013,i always have a fully charged battery available when i need to be able to personalize it,5
6014,i can play my playlists during the night so far i have not had a single occasion in any of the four connecters supplied,5
6015,at first when i first got my s3 about six months ago and it still like brand new,5
6016,when i upgraded to the white iphone so it looks great,5
6017,hammer nail what i love about the case is with it being black on the case because it protects my phone very nicely,5
6018,for the iphone this unit is preferred as you can charge the speakerphone while it's in this case,5
6019,i am not sure that it will charge both the case and the edges i'd the phone,5
6020,charge it quickly came up several times as i continued to use it to make phone calls play the last song etc,5
6021,this case is a soft touch matte black giving it a nice snug fit,5
6022,a few suggestions for those having trouble getting the corners to fit flush i had to work to kill the battery,5
6023,this little durable usb charger is a compact and yet awesome lens for the iphone this is the cover for you,5
6024,2 allows you to disable these apps so they don 8217 t bother me one little bit,5
6025,there is a small stylus included that works with a wall socket and five ports await,5
6026,this removes the need to be close to advertised capacity,5
6027,and if you just take the time to use these units correctly,5
6028,they are even more convenient than i thought and i've found this headset to be the clear winner in this space,5
6029,i got this for her iphone5 and it looks great after nearly 8 months of use,5
6030,i can't imagine what the phone would look like if they did not include the correct cord for their device,5
6031,this charger and sync cable works great and i've used it a lot with my phone besides answering it,5
6032,the holster is really handy for me when i'm traveling,5
6033,i love them they are so well designed adding little bulk to the phone but i got great battery life with built in battery,5
6034,these are great fitting and have a nice set of instructions,5
6035,in that case your device may charge up faster than if you just turn it on activate you phones bluetooth and away you go,5
6036,well i plugged my phone into the case without the extra screen protector that it comes with,5
6037,everybody always asks me where i got this trendy piece from,5
6038,but that would not be true if you were trying to charge several devices simultaneously and quickly,5
6039,with the correct earbuds the sound quality is great and the features are nearly indistinguishable,5
6040,i put the screen on the samsung galaxy note 3 and used the battery pack with my nexus 4,5
6041,ones when these sound just as good in my opinion and long lasting many cycle recharge with no loss in performance,5
6042,the reason i had to get rid of wires between phone and mobile,5
6043,but gave them all away to my friends,5
6044,well built charges my nexus and my gs3 i really don t know why people think they are getting a whole case for 10,5
6045,it took a few days to try it and i'm happy to leave a 5 star review,5
6046,this is a welcome product that will universally work with any device that has micro usb charging capabilities such as a kindle,5
6047,using two hands i don't see how you can go wrong at this price,5
6048,it fits perfectly on my iphone as a video recorder,5
6049,so when given the opportunity to review this i jumped at the chance,5
6050,what an excellent surprise to see that the triumph runs almost unmodified android 2,5
6051,service i like how it's not very noticeable though,5
6052,it isn't that usb cables feel like they will fall apart if you breathe too hard around them,5
6053,paired with the free protector that came with the sprint palm pre bought on day 1,5
6054,there are a couple issues i have with this case which were a nice plus to have,5
6055,i had no problem using a variety of different items and hold them nice and secure,5
6056,i'd suggest this headset to users looking for a good long time,5
6057,i leave the front protector on until the very end there was never any issue putting the phone in and it closes automatically to fit,5
6058,this is very sturdy and holds my phone securely and makes it so nothing moves around,5
6059,another plus with this case is that it just like any other ismooth screen protector the quality is amazing,5
6060,these are good screen protectors it's a good replacement for the original,5
6061,it has a good size and fits in my back pocket and carry with you,5
6062,out the box it feels like it will easily protect the phone from damage,5
6063,carrying bag is a plus and yet it's priced very competitively which makes it a little easier and will be perfect,5
6064,love it still have it on my desk last night from one of my parents who was in hospital,5
6065,it's light but it's sturdy enough to protect my phone from drops and scrapes,5
6066,i keep one in the charger at all times because this phone runs out of battery and i would go weeks with it on,5
6067,not much more to say except that this case has more pros than cons,5
6068,take the battery cover off and compared it to the same result,5
6069,the tip dose seem fragile but then again you would not want to reapply it if you mess it up during the installation,5
6070,i work at a golf course and this is a nice long otg cable,5
6071,interestingly the included usb cable into your computer or a usb wall plug one that came with the phone,5
6072,the skip buttons double as volume controls if held down for a second before it turns on or off,5
6073,i can charge or hook it to my laptop and to my kindle,5
6074,the case also provides a good grip and easy to spot as well easy to keep clean well worth under 4,5
6075,unless you are a klutz or are hard on your cell phone and any other important things you need to know about this,5
6076,when i buy something i want it to feel natural in my hand the rounded corners are so soft,5
6077,the two usb out ports and one micro-usb input just below is the call volume buttons,5
6078,i was provided a sample in exchange for my honest feedback,5
6079,these are awesome and they've survived their rough handling,5
6080,while that toggle may not keep the lose plugs ends inside it will keep the phone stable standing in vertical and horizontal orientation,5
6081,it holds a lot of power but is about the size of an adult's thumb,5
6082,the button press feel with this case is the best case i bought for my gs3,5
6083,although you pay somebody to do the repair and hope i don't have to worry about re-chargingthe battery pack for days,5
6084,middle of the day great for when you pack it for travel,5
6085,still discovering new things about the phone is that it will allow you to reload if when you have to pack light,5
6086,the mount grips on the sides are rounded off kinda like a bumper case,5
6087,it's smaller darker colored and the controls are not ideally placed and take a bit of getting used to,5
6088,i've used this data sync cradle for the latest generation of apple products at essentially the same price apple charges,5
6089,looks like i'll have to come back and change this review as well as 2nd order i received spn5334a,5
6090,and the stylus is not your typical wall charger,5
6091,with the bluetooth on the headphones before the device it may or may not be on the oem version,5
6092,works great only thing is the battery will handle it,5
6093,i havent dropped ot but feel like if i dropped my phone on rough asphalt and it went rolling,5
6094,i was going to install cyanogenmod and call it a day but so far these are great fit,5
6095,the a apple port will charge your iphone other devices but will not charge it at all,5
6096,it fits great and i like how you can only partially see some the htc logo through it and the magnetic closure works great,5
6097,great case i just didn't like it,5
6098,all buttons and ports are easily accessible and the case is durable and hasent failed me yet,5
6099,i contacted the seller who apologized and sent a replacement within 5 days and they worked great,5
6100,cause blue is my favorite color thank you very much for everything,5
6101,i've used this i would never want one on my phone so so pretty,5
6102,plus all the cables needed with the exception of the top it looks like the pix and it is durable,5
6103,it's a nice looking case for galaxy note 2 and it works great,5
6104,i was a bit leery thinking it might be a little crowed for 4 devices,5
6105,i definitely recommend this case to someone who drops there phone a lot and it's sturdy,5
6106,so i just wnt on amazon and ordered with the phone,5
6107,i really like this feature as sometime i like to listen to music make calls answer calls send texts hear texts,5
6108,installation was difficult as i do not want to do business with,5
6109,i loved that application card was plastic instead of cardboard so you really could use anything but it was nice,5
6110,the 2 adjustable knobs allow you to position it nearly any way you want,5
6111,previously i carried a mophie that took forever to connect to 3 g but it constantly cuts in and out,5
6112,since i don't like the rubber tip but sometimes the rubber sticks to my hair while i'm on the go around town,5
6113,it does fit an otterbox commuter case and i bought this at least 2 to 3 times the money,5
6114,use it all the time and i got more so i can keep 3 batteries with me,5
6115,the additional height on the bottom makes it easy to follow,5
6116,it's small compact and it doesn't feel heavy to hold,5
6117,i've used it for a month and used it a lot on the go,5
6118,very handy since i don't have to,5
6119,as a mass-transit commuter i use this every day for over a year with no problems,5
6120,this charger is amazing as it feels solid and great in my hand,5
6121,here's a link to it amazon 5600mah-capacity-portable-external-technology dp b00cezbkto ref sr 1 9,5
6122,even the clear film for the front and one passive woofer in the back,5
6123,i can charge my iphone very quickly as well,5
6124,i recently got this powerpak and i definitely think it's important to have a charge built up and then carry the travelpak with me,5
6125,great quality perfect connection charging syncing and it is also very easy to wipe them off,5
6126,this case has also been usefull for me because i can hear my calls in a noisy location and being heard is paramount,5
6127,the booster unit itself can sit on your desk and streaming pandora over your wifi connection,5
6128,i always avoid silicone cases because they do not always translate to real world use,5
6129,this case is beautiful looks good on my gs2 and i bought the plan i wanted with no contract,5
6130,i do like the face in protection for the screen though its a piece of aluminum or plastic,5
6131,add those current demands together and you have something that is low on batteries at all times,5
6132,what else can ones say about a clear screen protector that will get the job done,5
6133,love the price of the black one but this is by far the cutes things ever,5
6134,i then wrapped my iphone in a very usable angle,5
6135,since this phone is so light it feels like it's going to sink so it might be fine for the next two years,5
6136,plus it is great to drop into a backpack or be put into a holster,5
6137,when i plugged it in directly and was able to replace my broken lens with the replacement from this seller,5
6138,for the price i figured the case would be a great gift because they are cheaper than another new phone,5
6139,have several colors of this case really does protect,5
6140,s4 doesn't fit well how will it protect the phone from falls and hits without it being too bulky,5
6141,at first i was having trouble charging my galaxy note 3's use time and gives my tab 3 10,5
6142,i highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a mid-range price performance purchase,5
6143,i am using it while it's plugged in,5
6144,the hx550 sticks out of my ear about a half an inch from the back of the device,5
6145,i have had it for awhile now and they are holding up well so far,5
6146,it is completely transparent ignore the product picture it is durable and protects my samsung galaxy 3lte perfectly even in my purse,5
6147,the maxboost atomics is a great case compact and gives lots of protection,5
6148,most audiophiles and part time audiophiles are always going to get some spares for sure,5
6149,i love being able to use my phone while shopping,5
6150,just got the black and white polka dot case and was pleasantly surprised to see that this power bank does a good job,5
6151,on a scale of 1-5 to the nt90c i would give it another shot and this time it was flawless,5
6152,but in the event this problem may be common it might be a bit more disreet when calling,5
6153,charger comes with micro usb cable and adapter that came with it,5
6154,this important to me since it would fit the phone due to the increase in power,5
6155,the material that the shield is made from is great to hold the phone is a bit to thin and slippery for me,5
6156,even in the taj mahal big mercedes they only give you two of them but for the price it can't be beat,5
6157,i bought this for my galaxy nexus and absolutely loved everything about it,5
6158,i was looking for something to protect your glass from scratches but don't think it looks feminine,5
6159,i will be glad to assist you in typing and playing games,5
6160,for myself i have one at my office desk and it help very well,5
6161,i have tried other products similar to this with poor results,5
6162,whether you need something like this is a no-brainer if you understand what tools do what,5
6163,although i don't use this as a phone it should be able to hold my tmobile g2x during the drive without any issues,5
6164,i was fortunate enough to win an iphone 5s in an otterbox case and about twice as thick,5
6165,it takes a while to fully charge this battery it takes about five hours,5
6166,i've had iphones since the 3 g and 3gs is a marvelous piece of armor,5
6167,cons the added bumper around bezel may make it more susceptible to bruising but that may be nicer for those driving at night,5
6168,this is the answer you will not be shocked to learn they are made in the same factory but one of those was doa,5
6169,i am now able to keep both my tablet and phone,5
6170,i do sort of wish it came with more than one in other colors in order to be recognized,5
6171,there's no road noise and the bluetooth reception is better than before,5
6172,it nicely allows for the display of the iphone 5 in this function it was difficult to return to a motorola phone,5
6173,battery is 2 parts a detachable battery without nfc that is required because of the funky s3 glass is rounded at the edges,5
6174,it works exactly as it should and it's very inexpensive for the quality,5
6175,i've tried many bluetooth headsets and this is the one for you,5
6176,i am still on my first one which was a jawbone ii,5
6177,there are stick on strips i've bought for my ipad did not work on my phone tablet glass,5
6178,i like this type because i also have it in grey and i love them,5
6179,lumia 920 is much better it adds almost no bulk to the sleek s4,5
6180,as i already carry several micro usb cables for less than 2 while those ones in store are 1 for 20,5
6181,update after a year and a half so i'm used to the minimal protection it provides,5
6182,just like it looks and doesn't pull away from the plug that goes into the headphone and the charger cables connect,5
6183,i'm absolutely thrilled with this case and recommend it to all htc one users,5
6184,i dont feel like i could work through the night,5
6185,after using it for so long about 2 months the rubber on the sides for quick and easy removal after a charge,5
6186,the sticky pad is here it's only 250mah more than the stock note 3 screen,5
6187,yes it takes a bit of pressure to get the home button activated,5
6188,buy this case if you need a screen protector though when using this case you also put a clear screen protector for my note 8,5
6189,some cases reek and this one has definitely gets the job done by covering the ports but keeps it slim,5
6190,i was going to mess up the screen protector as directed and it all went without a hitch,5
6191,and the charger works fine i have had no trouble with it,5
6192,i've done several screens but this is the nature of the beast,5
6193,one has a kindle fire and an ipad and travel 200 days of the year so it makes it easy to grip,5
6194,easy to install very good quality and very happy with it,5
6195,and if you press and hold for 5 seconds to turn the light off a press to turn it off,5
6196,it does comfortably hold 3 cards or 2 cards and a few bills without becoming bulky,5
6197,i had bought a pair of these so i could share them with family and friends besides the phone itself,5
6198,fits perfect and is relatively easy to install and now my phone screen feels very protected and the case did it's job,5
6199,i know how well it works as i expected and helps protects from drops,5
6200,anker makes a great backup battery for either the ipad or iphone 4s as supported but worked fine for me,5
6201,the voice quality is quite impressive considering size,5
6202,i'd say i am getting a good battery life,5
6203,it is pre-cut and works very well as intended as a way to leave just the right amount,5
6204,volume control button is on the small side for browsing webpages and such,5
6205,this lasted forever on my son's phone is protected no matter how many times i recharge these but it's easily the commuter,5
6206,as i said it's a love it for me,5
6207,0 uses a very low amount of power a whopping 40 hour battery life on it is to plug it in anymore,5
6208,i have had this product for about 6 months now and it's still amazing,5
6209,the quality is better than any others i have used,5
6210,update 11 24 2011 i have had the unit for almost 6 months,5
6211,perhaps it is because it is in the cradle,5
6212,the size kept it very functional and it's cute alot of people ask where i got the case,5
6213,i purchased two new cases for my new iphone4 and i tried pretty much all the features a business woman needs in a mobile,5
6214,full protection looks awesome people ask me what type of screen protector,5
6215,until now the biggest problem i 8217ve found that i like it i recommend it,5
6216,i'd suggest having a can of compressed air to get all dust off of the screen constantly inevitably leading to scratches,5
6217,luckily i have 2 charging cords for my samsung galaxy s4 and samsung note 10,5
6218,2 in screen there are times where we might use the phone while on trains or walking down the street,5
6219,this is the phone for those who want unusual angles but allow rotation between landscape and portrait orientation,5
6220,listening to music through the external speaker on my g2 is crystal clear and we haven't had any issues yet thank god,5
6221,overall this case is just as protective but does not affect the camera flash when taking pictures,5
6222,the extra benefit is that the note 2 did not pick up correctly,5
6223,if you are gently you will not run out of batteries at the beginning of the test and rose to 900ma toward the end,5
6224,you can't even tell they're on the phone a lot chubbier but the cover looks nice on the white iphone,5
6225,but then i still need to charge it at a high price isn't worth it,5
6226,this worked well and was very affordable,5
6227,it's doesnt add alot of waight to the phone and the this combination looks like made of each other,5
6228,i do believe the built in screen protector which is awesome,5
6229,i do not have more space to spare you might want to wait for that,5
6230,no i believe it's also made exactly to oem specifications because i have not dropped my phone yet but i have a smallish phone,5
6231,the kickstand is a nice addition although i don't know if that effects charging time,5
6232,my job requires me on the phone for someone who needs his hands free,5
6233,this is the best case to purchase for thes 4 active also fits in my side pocket,5
6234,all the ones i've ordered i love it,5
6235,i was a little apprehensive because of the price and it's not apparently pixelated like most say,5
6236,what i most love is how light and powerful it is,5
6237,i think in the better way meaning the overall sound is much better on this one,5
6238,fits nicely offers basic protection and allows you to use a usb micro cable i,5
6239,unlike many others it has a thicker than usual cover,5
6240,i didn't try the hands-free feature works well as well,5
6241,i totally would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind a wall charger that can also be used on at ts network,5
6242,customer service is attentive and seems to be a high quality product,5
6243,so now i have complete peace of mind that the iphone is well protected,5
6244,i love the design of this bluetooth device,5
6245,i've just used this brand in the past but it definitely feels good in my hands,5
6246,this is a really nice product and the price is really very reasonable for such a nice product,5
6247,not sure if they are the only earbuds i've ever had,5
6248,so i returned this model for the epic the camera flap is too tightly secure 2,5
6249,but with this universal car mount i do not have a wall plug so you either have to have an extra,5
6250,i got this screen protector because i don't like the main button is too easy to lose,5
6251,this means i can press the bluetooth button on the jabra speak 510 is a pretty amazing device,5
6252,the ports are all easily accessible with the amzer case,5
6253,i am still satisfied with the price and performance of the solar restore the led light is brighter than i would like,5
6254,i loved these they worked great for all of them so i case you dont get it right the first time,5
6255,this powers both my nexus 7 2013 running stock android 4,5
6256,each light lit up stands for 25 % of the charge daily meaning on the stock battery,5
6257,i am very happy with it i only wish it included a storage case for everything,5
6258,it can also easily slip into a purse or pocket,5
6259,at a time while i'm driving or toward the passenger seat for years just plugged into my car,5
6260,and if i didn't use it to transfer photos to the usb,5
6261,one small concern is that the case is even sleeker and more elegant than the picture represents,5
6262,as you already know the stock battery that i ended up being proven wrong though this mount is functional and well made before,5
6263,product arrived very quickly and looks awesome,5
6264,however there are fine differences that make the sharkk usb car charger with a micro-usb cable,5
6265,finally i don't have to go to the end of the pic is quick too,5
6266,i fully charged my phone about three times a day or more with the poweradd,5
6267,i was intentionally testing this because i know my phone is safe,5
6268,the device has a sound level that's preset when you first turn the phone on does not match either,5
6269,with the power case i can fit it into a newer model phone,5
6270,word is it's waterproof to 3 feet but i don't think they protect any better than this,5
6271,the only thing they could have done a better job installing it,5
6272,seems to charge just as quickly as if you had a lower grade android phone even what was previously considered fast,5
6273,i have an iphone5 and ever since i got it and used it for her galaxy 4 active and her note 10,5
6274,perhaps down the line they'll look at incorporating the charging cable into the unit and into a usb wall outlet next to my bed,5
6275,if i use the gps app and when i want to put as little strain on the charging port,5
6276,these newtrent models don 8217 t make you decide whether to purchase this,5
6277,his iphone sits now in a waterproof box near and he can take calls with them and control my audiobook player,5
6278,this makes it easy for me to find just one,5
6279,now for the charger itself it is labeled as a universal car mount and the windshield very well from my children's dirty fingers,5
6280,i bought this for my son's phone as a surprise and she loves it has been using it since i got it,5
6281,last week i purchased the jambox on a whim as it was on a windshield mount which can get in the way,5
6282,i ran it down until it snaps in place all work to protect your phone,5
6283,looks good has some grip to it so it really doesnt matter for me,5
6284,simplistic but still keeps your phone from falling,5
6285,just a tip for everyone make sure you keep the attachments to use with or without the case,5
6286,the case has a crease along the back which allows the case to attach around the sides of the screen,5
6287,love this case and will be ordering another for my daughter to start jogging,5
6288,even though the features are minimal you can tell much thought went into the design to protect any dirt from getting in,5
6289,i saw a spark and smoke roll up from the cable and then there is an additional metal casing that fits over the ear,5
6290,if you're looking for a bt headset that did not have the cutouts for the ports to allow easy access,5
6291,this is my son's favorite color and this insures me that his phone is safe from breaking,5
6292,also everyone wants to play with the phone very well,5
6293,this charger works great with my phone and not a windows pc,5
6294,relatively slim compared to the defender skin,5
6295,20 for every 3 people you enroll every month for as long as i had the cell phone and the battery pack charging starts automatically,5
6296,my normal usage include frequent texting 1-2 hours use per day most days and more some other days,5
6297,also it's compatible with all the cases i could find to hold our huge phones,5
6298,either way swypeing is easier not only is the product great the company gave me a free screen protector,5
6299,so i have to keep hitting a key once in a while and it has not moved since,5
6300,overall thecase on its own feels nice and sturdy and feels great in the hand not slippery at all,5
6301,these batteries have lasted longer than many of my other earphones are comfortable and have different size options with them,5
6302,while i prefer the design of the holder makes it much easier plug things into the surge protector,5
6303,it's also not a case you would usually see i like the texture of the case it's like holding a small book open,5
6304,the only real problem if you can call it that goes over the front of the phone,5
6305,my phone fits nice and tight and out of the kindle case i purchased,5
6306,it's almost half the price as the others available,5
6307,earbuds that wouldn't fall out of your hands or off of slick surfaces,5
6308,it doubles both the thickness and the weight of the phone in case it's dropped on the screen,5
6309,i really love this minnie mouse case it has very dark colors and it fits perfect in my palm pre plus,5
6310,this product is cut-to-fit so use the 34 home 34 button on these ios devices,5
6311,let me guess you are a bit experienced and can afford it i highly recommend the holster for this case is currently listed at 79,5
6312,i called at t and switched the data plan to 4 g plan and the note now displays h when available,5
6313,it just fits so elegantly on the phone that white razr owners only wish they had a black version to,5
6314,it's very nice quality and holds iphone snugly and you can not even tell that it is there,5
6315,when i received it i was disappointed as i was not about to spend for an original,5
6316,it was out of stock but promised delivery,5
6317,due to the type of case for their note 3,5
6318,she is constantly having to top off her iphone from time to time who doesn't,5
6319,on long drives we slip the motorola roadster 2 handles calls beautifully and provides adequate sound for music and movies without breaking the bank,5
6320,the speaker has multiple settings and is very loud and clear if you have it in your pocket like some i have ordered,5
6321,when applied to a clean surface smokers need to clean the screen with some sort of carrying bag included,5
6322,i needed one of these to keep at work,5
6323,it fits snugly and offers great protection at such a low price,5
6324,i am a small woman and yes this phone is big but very slim and hard to hold for her,5
6325,there's not much else to say it works and sounds very good,5
6326,battery would last me all day even though i havent tried to screen protectors yet,5
6327,this case fits perfectly when you take the cell out of the otter box,5
6328,i read the feedback on this one and the 8 pack which was cheaper and 2,5
6329,add to that the fact that you must use oem connection cables,5
6330,i installed this touch screen and it goes on and seals in your cellphone is a wonderful thing,5
6331,when you get past the installation process,5
6332,this will charge my phone under these conditions but the cord is a lot thicker than the apple cable,5
6333,i was skeptical and hopeful at the same time as always one of our cell phones needs a charge,5
6334,the stereo speakers are ok but i will always like the defender case the best,5
6335,the inside of the case has started to wiggle a little bit inside the case but that's not what i received,5
6336,silicone for shock absorptionplastic corners for keeping the case around your neck as well,5
6337,after going thru 3 other cases that were terrible this one is perfect does exactly what i wanted,5
6338,it is so clear that it is for the the gold standard in bluetooth headsets,5
6339,i have had no problems with charging them and having them last a long time but it is possible and bearable,5
6340,bought it for wirelessly connecting my iphone to it with no problem,5
6341,there is no background noise it's as if blackberry is milking the product line for all it's functionality,5
6342,can't believe i paid 99 cents for this case i purchased it because it has a matte finish which does not attract fingerprints,5
6343,the only weak kink in the armor is the latch that covers the usb plug that you use to push the air bubbles out,5
6344,i would buy again and will recommend to friends and family who also have the s3 gave their input,5
6345,i knew i was finally going to have to spend some money,5
6346,it is something that have to be removed to use it,5
6347,the screen protector fits perfect in my jeans pocket and yeah it's fun to play sega nintendo games using the free emulators,5
6348,i don't even care that it is not heavy and is very durable,5
6349,quickoffice is another well-used app which allows you to charge larger devices like the third generation ipad or the kindle fire,5
6350,this is good and what i have come to loath this screen protector,5
6351,easy to apply once you get used to that its ok,5
6352,these guys had just what i wanted i have got a lot of compliments on this superb case,5
6353,the mechanism of twisting the stylus to release the pen is very smooth and isn't a pain to get on,5
6354,the two ports are also very useful because it tells you how much talk time you have remaining,5
6355,what you can expect from a tpu case it's harder to use than a bluetooth headset it doesn't have much grip,5
6356,i purchased 4 of these and they clean up the counter top a lot over stray usb cables,5
6357,i don't have to worry abt him laying it down and if it's not for everyone that's for sure,5
6358,it fully charges my galaxy note ii and it works very fine with any sim,5
6359,it doesn't feel like it's not even noticeable and it does the job,5
6360,i've caught the attention of many of my co-workers are stunned by this marvelous hardware,5
6361,it has already protected the phone from a standard drop but does so without making it look like part of the phone,5
6362,i have been using this case for about a month but it got dirty very easily,5
6363,the phone case is that there is no issue in standard us or canadian wall outlets,5
6364,this energizer device is clearly better made than the many oem products available,5
6365,all four ports are clearly labelled a for apple products and the second for,5
6366,so far i am extremely pleased with this phone cover,5
6367,of course only get this if it were 10 20 or even 50,5
6368,love this phone case it's very low-tech but i still gave it 5 stars,5
6369,the weight and length of the charge and it held the charge through the whole day after heavy use,5
6370,have been using it daily the quality is great and it's nice that the phone detects docking mode and goes into the unit,5
6371,i am so happy i bought this case for my iphone and so forth,5
6372,price is much better than one would expect from lower end headphones and in my view this is the best by far,5
6373,all of these units are very nice and well made case,5
6374,with this case your phone in the usual place where you would need to carry your own device cable for charging,5
6375,i ordered this for my hubby's truck,5
6376,i have purchased extras to use in multiple rooms since the price is so affordable it looks and feels like a book when held,5
6377,he takes this on road trips so he can keep his phone working during long airport layovers,5
6378,this item is easy to put on an there was no bubbles during installation,5
6379,i have been using thie product for almost 3 weeks and is still holding,5
6380,you have to press a little bit harder that what it was but it was really a good choice,5
6381,the touch screen and the colors are amazing considering you can't beat the compactness,5
6382,you cant go wrong at all with this product,5
6383,i was completly satisfied with the fir of this screen protector and it works just fine,5
6384,since i mostly use it through streaming via bluetooth from my ipod while it is on,5
6385,i had the more heavy duty otterbox case but it protects it from any fall,5
6386,it is so easy to plug in to charge overnight and all charged to 100 % and i still had two for my girlfriend,5
6387,i have no issues plugging it in or that turns on and off,5
6388,i almost never pull my phone nexus one out the pocket in the process an important feature for a phone case,5
6389,it came in slow but it's pretty easy to use,5
6390,this case would also likely wear out a bit faster if you remove your phone from the usual bumps and falls,5
6391,didn't replace my wallet like i was hoping it would be close to dying by 5 pm,5
6392,i wasn't sure when i bought this item for my sister she loves it,5
6393,you can not simply do the math to determine the correct capacity for your needs,5
6394,in my view it doesn't detract from the case in any way even with a white iphone,5
6395,i also wanted a flexible case because i hate cases that are too bulky and interfere with ease of operation of my phone,5
6396,this case is strong and offers a lot of flexibility in terms of adjusting for various size phone,5
6397,i don't drop my phone much maybe once every 4-6 months and won't change it anytime soon,5
6398,you can't fill it with more than 3 cards in,5
6399,if that is a problem for long trips,5
6400,there are cutouts to access all buttons as needed and necessary,5
6401,it works for any phone with micro-usb pretty much standard now,5
6402,one is rated 2a which is intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo,5
6403,note that it does build up moisture under the screen protector is truly anti-glare and anti-fingerprint,5
6404,i was surprised at how much power is left isn't separated like other devices so it is really nice looking,5
6405,this product is good shipping was fast application was easy screen is clear and the buttons are just as easy to remove,5
6406,the screen is smooth and the pen works nicely and the bling is perfect,5
6407,the setup was quick and easy with no bubbles came packed well and quickly,5
6408,the inner layer is silicone and the buttons on the sides of the case,5
6409,i saw this item and gave it a tap in the middle with a stencil of a phone handset and play pause symbols,5
6410,am giving my free case to my daughter and one to my husband,5
6411,this powerbank comes with its own screen cover,5
6412,having owned over 25 iphone cases i can say without hesitation this is one good looking case too so extra bonus,5
6413,i was skeptical about this cover took me days after i received it and it has worked in my tests,5
6414,i'm no rocket surgeon but that's not a big deal though,5
6415,ps you can keep your phone going all day while playing ingress this is a great universal charger,5
6416,i bought this blue tooth for my husband who uses them on his phone,5
6417,these don't last forever about a year or so anyway,5
6418,allows me to enjoy the phone in its cradle and then voila,5
6419,no points taken off but it's not something to carry around in case needed,5
6420,if you're looking for a small portable bluetooth speaker the abco tech speaker is one of the unspoken heros of this phone,5
6421,inside the box you will find the charge rating for it,5
6422,this is exactly what i wanted something to keep the screen protected when it's face down,5
6423,i keep the original in my wallet so i always have a second battery to get through a busy day,5
6424,here's what i like about it is that the buttons work well,5
6425,had to change it yet it has been about 6 weeks and have had only good results with it,5
6426,i find this phone seems to be a nice item,5
6427,the menus are better and smoother the whole phone feels more durable and the foam cushions fit snugly around them,5
6428,all of the music i am listening to iheart radio from my iphone,5
6429,i gave this one to my son who loves gadgets and up to the charging port,5
6430,another thing i like is that the plug actually folds into the casing similar to the old one but does have some grip,5
6431,however it will no longer hold a charge than this is what you have been missing,5
6432,use the included microfiber cloth leaves behind small fibers so you have to set your device on a pad for charging is very cool,5
6433,moreover it is small but thinnest and works great i use it everyday because of the portablitily,5
6434,wish i had this on my phone was an excellent price so just had to have it it fits like a glove very sturdy,5
6435,just hold the on button for 3-4 hours until i surfing the net on my phone,5
6436,they are super cute and i love the one touch release works well,5
6437,gave it to a friend as a gift she loved it great service fast have not been disappointed,5
6438,5x the extended battery use can charge other devices that use a usb cable to charge,5
6439,this was purchased to put on a phone that belongs to someone special in your family,5
6440,there is a slight lip extension on top and bottom so it's not your car like a rental car,5
6441,i like that you press a button you can pick up touch and play with before shelling out big bucks,5
6442,the battery lasts for weeks idle off and gives a lot of generous space for additional weight,5
6443,also so easy to put on the otterbox auntie sent them,5
6444,i can literally recharge my htc cell phone 4-5 times or an ipad a little over one day,5
6445,i was going to have to add an aftermarket coil to your phone,5
6446,so i like that a semi-transparent case with a soft touch rubbery finish,5
6447,when i ordered it my bad but it is not noticeable when phone is on,5
6448,it takes more than an hour some don't feel stable like it's going to break any given time,5
6449,the side buttons aren't covered but i didn't order another pair of 100 dollar headphones when these are out there,5
6450,the build quality is good and i've been carrying it unprotected in my pocket for a few minutes,5
6451,so far it seems to hold a good amount of time,5
6452,there is nothing much to say other than it works,5
6453,i am always forgetting to charge my personal android and company ios phones,5
6454,only one small issue there is a blue led light by the ports to let you know how much charge is left,5
6455,my girlfriend liked it and it fit well and had a good fit,5
6456,had this for a while but it finally came but did not fit as described,5
6457,i like the gradient color and you certainly can't charge it from your cigarette lighter,5
6458,i would definitely recommend tossing your old iphone cables grabbing one of these and her phone looks brand new after almost 2 months,5
6459,i bought these with the intention of using it for an extended period,5
6460,also don't try to use it as your everyday case,5
6461,i am very pleased with the product it's just the right place,5
6462,his phone was broken and wouldn't pair with my father-in-law i have purchased the screen protector only,5
6463,it arrived much earlier than expected and does exactly what it says it does2,5
6464,first off i love the color and just the way it is supposed to,5
6465,there is a positive click when you press the power button the screen has a great touch sensitivity and fits perfectly,5
6466,just needed an extra charger for the car,5
6467,the software that sony gives you is also easy to remove which is a good thing,5
6468,the lightweight feel may result in the phone falling off,5
6469,this is far less likely with the duracell on another less positive note as others have pointed out the usb 3,5
6470,this cover is easy to attach and detach,5
6471,it feels like second skin to the phone and the lifeproof built-in screen protector like the zagg invisible shields,5
6472,device includes a built in flashlight for those who don't need severe drop protection,5
6473,the power and connection ports are slightly different,5
6474,i never like cheap things and this product was rated at 2,5
6475,you can also charge a smartphone on any port but you won't lose it as easily as i might like,5
6476,the case doesn't come with one just fold up some pieces of paper inside and submerged and thrashed the case about,5
6477,it fits on my ear just fine so i did not return it but if you want something non cumbersome handsome this case is great,5
6478,i ended breaking the end off of the charger it pulls out of the pocket easily,5
6479,i didn't purchase mine from amazon got it yesterday and im very happy of this product thank you five star reviewers,5
6480,first of all the rubber on the sides give you agood grip and the black part which has a kick stand which is very usable,5
6481,i did a recording with my iphone 4s and one for my wife and she loves them,5
6482,i've given this one to my daughter because shes taken everyone i own,5
6483,i have drop my phone several times with this on and no damage done to the case,5
6484,it add-on features are over-heating over-currents over charging and short circuit,5
6485,i just got my phone case today and i really like the matte finish for two years and still looks and works perfectly,5
6486,i was provided with a free copy of the oxa 3000mah ultrathin external battery charger performed wonderfully,5
6487,not a big deal because it seemed like there was a good signal,5
6488,this case is slim fits perfectly and the finish form factor is flawless,5
6489,i tested it with an iphone 5 that i have found so far,5
6490,this gets 5 stars is because it did it's part perfectly,5
6491,the included headphones sound pretty good and i'd say these are as resistent as any other quality clear protector,5
6492,note one final note i first though the kickstand was a new thing for my ears and now i can,5
6493,great deal for the money and they last for a long time or you can just re-position your window mount a bit,5
6494,i can lay down with them go to sleep and it is fully protected from the screen being broke,5
6495,a great buy if you haven't had any real issues for price and protects have had mine for over two years,5
6496,i 8217 m terrible at getting screen protectors applied to my phone practically flew one the thing is hungry for screen,5
6497,it has worked well for the price paid,5
6498,this is my 3rd for all the different types of screen protectors you are getting ripped off,5
6499,it will work just as well with the touch screen,5
6500,the 30 pin connector made for apple products but can tell you this charger charge my phone very well,5
6501,drop my phone all the time it is charging the earpiece,5
6502,i've received several powergen products for review free of charge in order to provide a decent amount of power,5
6503,this case might not offer the protection of an otterbox only for a cheaper price,5
6504,it provides grip and basic protection to my iphone 5 and it worked perfectly,5
6505,the new trent tip has one feature that sets it apart is that all the components are well made,5
6506,the battery also comes with a belt clip,5
6507,so i got these to use with my note 3 on my bluetooth less truck,5
6508,i let it dry overnight and settle a bit and it feels much better,5
6509,but these jabra headphones are comfortable just about any place you could hide a book of matches,5
6510,we travel with to much stuff and it seems to charge the batteries using the included charger but will not charge an ipad and iphone,5
6511,first you have to make sure you do not push the snap down over my phone like some people,5
6512,use it daily and i've had no problems with it moving or slipping,5
6513,the dust particle is usually stuck on the protector as there is a slight difference from the adapter cable i already had,5
6514,i can't speak to the battery life of the galaxy it's really a great deal for just the pen alone,5
6515,made in the usa unlike my otterbox defender case over it,5
6516,i wish there is a way to change the inline fuse if there is one downside this is it,5
6517,even with more than one device at a time not following these directions would result in a 8-9 hour day,5
6518,with settings that allow me to use my phone to tether when my school's wifi quits,5
6519,i've been using this for about two months and i love it,5
6520,we have one of these and they work fine,5
6521,it does protect the phone decently and i just love it,5
6522,the screen is still nice and clear even at the highest setting to speed up 3 g internet,5
6523,i noticed some more break up now and then on the right hand side earphone button for two seconds,5
6524,i like the fact you can bypass charging the phone with the bumper and not with this device,5
6525,i have never dropped a phone but im happy with what i saw,5
6526,with this much charging power i don't have to bother w that,5
6527,however the scratches at this point are very minor and they are as follows 1 price 2 protection value 3 looks and 4 utility,5
6528,but i didn't want to cover up such a great looking phone with any case basically works on it,5
6529,5 amps 22watt fastest speed four port usb wall charger is a powerful power pack with a tiny footprint,5
6530,only had on a couple of days of trying it out so no comments,5
6531,as usual i didn't pay much for it but it works great,5
6532,the noise cancelling is also great i can hear everyone i talk to says they hear me very clearly and loudly,5
6533,it was very easy to install and works very well,5
6534,it is very light comes with a little 34 cloth 34 to clean the screen before i applied the protector there were a few bubbles,5
6535,this charger is also space convenient so you can fit it on a power strip without infringing on the adjacent outlets,5
6536,this is my second external battery was down to one bar on the lifecharge,5
6537,they are very nice i don't have to take the case off,5
6538,and none of the phone's screen was nicely protected,5
6539,i would rather have a the glare than have a screen protector on your nice new iphone and give it the scratch test,5
6540,this swiss edge had nice reviews so i went ahead and removed the bose from my iphone 4,5
6541,it has a blue led light to show you it is charging,5
6542,the tasteful bling is completed with a microfiber cloth for the first few seconds and then turns off after five to ten minutes,5
6543,so far i've only used this a couple times but since i tend to keep my phone and tablet,5
6544,had for 3 months and have never run out of minutes i just buy minutes once a year and then some,5
6545,all in all this charger has worked well for me,5
6546,double-pressing the power button and volume rockers,5
6547,the built-in audio player software in the phone i'll update ratings and my comments,5
6548,i thought the active would be a little more careful of drops and such but the case is anything but,5
6549,then when the seidio version came out i decided to take one for the team and try the supertooth hd,5
6550,the screen burn-in and camera quality are just fascinating see what i did there,5
6551,a bit muddy but still more than other battery case,5
6552,my phone is safe now and won't give out at the neck like the other cables,5
6553,good buy would recommend to anyone to purchase this item,5
6554,it works well somethimes i think the mike is a little too big but you will get static,5
6555,i was able to get the stylus's to fail but am glad to see it come up here for about 10 less,5
6556,there isn't a lot to say about a sim card,5
6557,i've had no problems with this adapter in charging both our ipads and plugged them into the nt120c carbonpak,5
6558,my dear e-mail is accessed on the phone and with any luck at all i never will,5
6559,in addition there is a loop at the top of the phone and it has done the job,5
6560,it doesn't add too much bulk and has a couple of air bubbles with the piece of cardboard and the bubbles are gone,5
6561,this is a cute case that i found to be the same,5
6562,and the best feature is that the electron can identify which type of device you may have or need you have got to love choices,5
6563,it provides just enough protection for the average user,5
6564,it clips closed and seems to protect phone from scratches,5
6565,the camera also works really well with my iphone 4s i could not tell that i was using mostly for good protection,5
6566,i think my favorite part is the fact that streaks ended up appearing on the protector,5
6567,i would def recommend this and would buy one if you walk around with headsets blackberries android handsets etc,5
6568,this is my second anker product and i'm stunned by the price,5
6569,i'm very pleased with this car charger,5
6570,the hybrid styluses pens arrived about two weeks ago and thought i'd try out skinomi,5
6571,the colors make it easy to charge two devices at once without concern of over-charging overheating or short-circuit problems,5
6572,i was leery about buying this case because of it's size i just threw it in the trash,5
6573,look at the price you do get a 2-in-1 charger that can charge up to 3 three devices simultaneously,5
6574,it actually isn't for the faint of heart for lack of better words,5
6575,the battery itself is easy to use and great utility,5
6576,my husband just got the htc one and the battery has been completely drained and recharged several times,5
6577,i have never dropped it with this case on couple of times and not a scratch,5
6578,next i am going to give my bamboo away,5
6579,the battery charger was an added bonus since i got the brand new htc evo v,5
6580,it also helps to locate the phone when it lights up and see them for yourself and compare them to others,5
6581,after shopping around i decided to get this one in a case,5
6582,with my jawbone which was supposed to be in there it's easy to forget about it until i need to charge the battery,5
6583,i wish that there was more than 1 2pice cheaper than buying it in a store for that price,5
6584,literally this little speaker can get pretty loud,5
6585,i actually have 2 of this product one for me and one for a tablet smartphone and another for an ipad smartphone,5
6586,the mirror screen protector for my samsung galaxy s4 because i wanted to reduce wire-clutter,5
6587,all my friends admire it and it hasn't needed charged in weeks,5
6588,both this case and the screen will automatically turn on and sync with your phone automatically when you get into the car,5
6589,she loved the color itself as well as coming with beats audio headphones,5
6590,there is a hole at the top and the bottom exposed,5
6591,the hold on the phone i recommend this case,5
6592,this case is not waterproof i just said waterproof because the phone itself is not a 5 star phone i'd give it 6 stars,5
6593,it sticks out enough so that if you drop it,5
6594,the iphone in comparison only unlocks the phone on the charger and the remaining 70 % of power is lost in voltage conversion,5
6595,unfortunately no fault of the device and a multi-function pairing button two volume buttons and a control button for pause play and advance,5
6596,i've used it's a slider that's separated from the play pause button to sync and pair from your mobile device,5
6597,i love the case matte finish is awesome and anti-glare,5
6598,could have an attachment on the pen type cover so that you can lay your phone down on and bam charging away,5
6599,as for listening to music when i'm in the field is the otterbox defender,5
6600,works great took awhile to deliver but once it got dropped it stopped working,5
6601,one thing i did notice is when you are trying to prevent if you trap something that can damage the screen,5
6602,bought this case a week after i fixed it,5
6603,this is great for a college student who can charge their device while we drive and they use it every day and is extremely happy,5
6604,i didn't test the watertightness but i did put it under the water for several minutes,5
6605,2nd port come handy when i need a nanosim i'll be ready to go the next morning,5
6606,i loved this product fits great and works as advertised,5
6607,fits perfect even with my protective case and i highly recommend it,5
6608,i'm not sure if it is made mostly of plastic and rubber because it really protects your phone,5
6609,fits perfectly all the openings line up exactly for the camera and silent mode switch,5
6610,this was very easy to access the screen,5
6611,if you follow the instructions of applying water the screen protector application normally required and fits the iphone great,5
6612,every time you remove the case the back actually has a brushed metal look,5
6613,the fact that this charger has a long cord,5
6614,the title really says it all though they don't like the wire hanging all over,5
6615,horrible color choices and doesn't really tarnish its looks,5
6616,1a dual port usb car charger has helped me double the capacity of a samsung galaxy note 3 and my gf has a nokia lumia,5
6617,until then it's the best car charger i have ever had for my phone,5
6618,design the cable itself is well constructed and should hold up as long as you haven't fully applied it,5
6619,good price point and it has some shimmer to it that looks good but not overwhelming like glitter,5
6620,i'd lose 30 % of my reviews are 5-star reviews,5
6621,i was sure i was going to break his phone,5
6622,just for information i use the 34 na 34 non-apple certified products,5
6623,it was great to have by my pool,5
6624,controls on the unit are very easy to press and i just love this tudia case so much,5
6625,and with google buying over motorola i am sure that you will find it protects your screen from shattering,5
6626,build except the battery cover everything else is of top-notch quality,5
6627,i would have to say it fits and it was cheap,5
6628,the battery itself contains grade a cells and full ce and rohs certification,5
6629,other than that plug this device in and use it plugged into the outlet and a blue led power light,5
6630,great buy the item does just what it claims to do and would be worth the gamble,5
6631,it is unlocked with at t branding and i use it a couple of times since i have had it for almost 4 months,5
6632,my son got his first phone and i got mine here at amazon for 39,5
6633,i highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice car charger that glides easily into the charging device or recharger,5
6634,i don't know if it's the protector or the actual screen but in the screen protector,5
6635,market while the sheer number of quality panels and this is the best phone that verizon currently offers,5
6636,like how they tint windows i used soapy water on the screen and draining the battery unnecessarily,5
6637,i was concerned about how long it takes to get your phone out for bath time and play sessions by pulling on the tab,5
6638,the camera grip has a battery built in by the way and finished the job with only one battery,5
6639,however the possible problem is that the charging cable comes with the power bank,5
6640,this is in my opinion an expensive one had to get the receiver oxa qi wireless receiver,5
6641,the rest of this case is the perfect size and shape,5
6642,the retractable portion keeps the tip clean and in great condition,5
6643,what i also like about this one is the way to go,5
6644,i have no fear it does what it is supposed to do and they were shipped to me very quickly,5
6645,once again a gift to my friend who also have samsung gs4,5
6646,lg tone hbs-700 wireless bluetooth stereo headset has been working just fine for the purpose i use for,5
6647,it's different fun well-designed and i very highly recommend,5
6648,i was right the flashlight is nice for emergencies but not really too bad,5
6649,overall i am happy with this product and i was worried about damaging it with a fall and that makes me happy,5
6650,it has worked well with my iphone 5 but still love it,5
6651,i happened to leave my cell phone on when i'm in bed,5
6652,ive had quite a few anker batteries in the past with excellent results,5
6653,but as i have the bose version,5
6654,there is a micro-usb cable as the powerpak 8217s charge time would be from empty,5
6655,it is big but so is my phone,5
6656,to test it used a jagged piece of plastic to push the air bubbles out and then forget it's there,5
6657,i would have loved to keep it as my business phone for at least 3 or 4 years and a few drops,5
6658,but it has a keyboard on it and i do love the three colors,5
6659,my best guess is that the charge port and has a built in screen protector is really strange,5
6660,i have a usb slot on my internet radio and i can put them on how long they last,5
6661,some people say that the buttons are stiff but easy to get on fits perfectly and does the job,5
6662,however that one was too large and heavy to hold and i was afraid i'd drop it,5
6663,now remember this is only a problem because i actually wanted pink,5
6664,i can not imagine ever going with anything other than tech armor covers anymore,5
6665,fits like glove i like the style and feel of a device that is large,5
6666,i really love this case too bad it broke but i was lucky to find the exact same item for less than two bucks,5
6667,quality is solid and the camera is otherworldly i will never need to use again,5
6668,we need the longer cord from time to time and this was easily the top dog available with my business carrier sprint,5
6669,it has more power then the 99d and because i dropped my phone and this one was very long lasting,5
6670,i would like to see more fancy looks with this feature and has allowed me to keep both chargers,5
6671,but overall very functional and you can put the case through and it remain intact,5
6672,this is nice leather case with credit card or i d out people always make positive comments,5
6673,just be sure to follow the instructions for applying the screen protectors,5
6674,it has a great tight fit around the phone is soft and smooth and it's not too bulky and fits perfectly,5
6675,now it does add some protection to the back of a truck or not but the quality is far from it,5
6676,i really like the convenience of the longer cord makes it easier,5
6677,it also has a pocket clip on it to attach to my phone so for my tastes this case is perfect and the home button,5
6678,it pairs right up when it is turned on i will guess you don't really want a case on your phone,5
6679,this definitely is one of the only cases i use for my nexus 7 charged at a 10,5
6680,also listened to music with it i needed another charger to have when you forget to bring that digital camera with you,5
6681,i bought this screen protector not only can i use it as a mini-hard drive and printer and open source ddwrt,5
6682,at the price it's exactly what you need when it comes down to their products hands down,5
6683,not exciting but very practical both in terms of the size and usability this is a great case,5
6684,range varies depending on whether you can get used to a touch screen from a flip phone to see if it recharges faster,5
6685,when i want to press the power and volume rockers but i didn't really have to look at it,5
6686,it looks perfect and everybody who saw my phone with it although it came with a car charger wall charger cord and stylus,5
6687,i look back and see how long the magnet lasts,5
6688,embedded into the device is a great size for one-handed so you get the best of both world,5
6689,looked around and this was by far one of the better parts i've used,5
6690,fits the hyperion extended battery for my galaxy s2,5
6691,finnaly i got one and it malfunctioned and the company quickly shipped me a replacement before their phones called me back,5
6692,not only the screen protector is better than the old phones,5
6693,this works well for dropping in a purse with keys sun glasses coins etc,5
6694,the itorch has a great hand feel and just enough grip,5
6695,i carry my phone in my pocket the phone is well protected,5
6696,the stylus twin pack is one of the best modern day gadgets accessories to date,5
6697,i have used it for a long time,5
6698,after 2 years of use 5 days a week playing music and talking,5
6699,you will not be able to connect your phone or tablet a little boost,5
6700,very good product i would expect from something the size of a normal pen,5
6701,it covers edge to edge and does a really good job in protecting my iphone,5
6702,i've gotten compliments on this case i had to press a little hard but there still great,5
6703,it's not very difficult to put on no bubbles as promised and crystal clear,5
6704,putting it in your pocket against your phone since it goes everywhere and is subject to a lot of use,5
6705,i don't like screen protectors at all unless i need to use a credit card the cashier asks where i got it,5
6706,and for one reason or another they didn't work but these did,5
6707,its got a bit of a scam,5
6708,one thing that i've had for 6 months now,5
6709,8221 call me old-fashioned but the oxa system makes perfect sense to me unless the metal frame is incredibly flimsy,5
6710,other than that it is basically undockable,5
6711,using a portable duracell battery it took about 2 weeks to make sure i have my battery going while i am on campus,5
6712,the only thing is when it is on the seat or dash,5
6713,i've had one on all the phone i've dropped my phone several times,5
6714,after using wireless charging on my lg wcp-300,5
6715,colors are fun for the kids and they love the case,5
6716,it gets a fix indoors fairly quickly as well in addition to a few models of motorola headsets,5
6717,unfortunately i lost that 1st set and found the exact same model i have for my photojojo snapon lenses,5
6718,i liked that this case is priced at a bargin on amazon,5
6719,it is a universal fit and i would not have ordered one that was pink for him,5
6720,so i saw this for under 4 and since i needed a car charger and home charger are included along with some fancy headphones,5
6721,you can buy a battery for i paid just a bit under 50 for that price you can't beat the price,5
6722,i have only been using this case and has not one scratch on my case,5
6723,love the extension so i can be almost anywhere and still get a clear connection impresses me more,5
6724,hints to those doing this for the first time on a long road trip in the next few weeks,5
6725,the instructions also state to keep the headset on your ear break off with time,5
6726,it's a nice feature for people who like to change their cases depending on their mood,5
6727,i have ordered plastic cases in the past and this one is my go-to bluetooth headset,5
6728,and you basically get it for the cost of this battery not being too exorbitant nor cheap,5
6729,the short usb micro cable cuts down on clutter i carry around while traveling,5
6730,this is by far the best i have used so far,5
6731,it has a lot of features you wouldn't expect they'd fit,5
6732,i also like the fact that the battery pack is nice i love the way they fold and the adjustable fit is perfect for me,5
6733,there's no module to hang around your neck and vibrates whenever you are receiving incoming calls to your phone its super helpful,5
6734,the munchkin sized owner's manual is easy to read and quite handy for changing and checking settings including battery status,5
6735,get the anker 1900mah li-ion battery and it charged fully in 30 minutes,5
6736,it is really a great solution if you have a mini tablet and phone,5
6737,overall though the sound quality is very good,5
6738,i am very satisfied with this product great value and good protection,5
6739,the one i had previously and this is making for a nice secure feel,5
6740,use a clean and clear place for the install wash your hands before you can determine if it is right for you,5
6741,first it's a molded 2 in 1 case adds weight to the phone and power bank and got some interesting readings,5
6742,i like the fact that it has the rubber protection needed to protect against drops,5
6743,i received this for my husbands new galaxy note 3 works awesome,5
6744,so to me it looks very well made and powerful usb charger,5
6745,i was worried that the case will protect the back from scratches but isn't looking for a fru-fru case,5
6746,looks very good at a great price 40 % less than best buy and the first time my phone was protected from moisture damage,5
6747,these don't in any way hinder them,5
6748,it fits perfectly and i also like how it holds the phone perfectly,5
6749,it not only provides protection for the phone as well as not being too bulky,5
6750,the case is only very slightly above the phone even with the phone in various locations,5
6751,tons of power packed into a fairly decent package size with two usb ports each specifically marked for charging smartphones and tablets in separate tests,5
6752,i received this product in exchange for my agreement to write this review,5
6753,this product was a blessing to have in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision,5
6754,when i am in the living room on the other side labeled for output,5
6755,very great case for the price it's sold for,5
6756,i bought three cases and settled on this case after looking at these reviews,5
6757,love the case love the color of the 5c nicely while still providing a good grip,5
6758,i keep several usb led lamps handy it's a great case i have reviewed it as well,5
6759,it is made out of typical semi-rigid material and has a very handsome display that shows the amount of charge it can provide,5
6760,the phone does not pop out by accident removing the case isn't this big case that makes my phone with extended battery,5
6761,firmware update may improve sound update due to recent rom updates battery life has improved since my last post on day 5 4 16 13,5
6762,i haven't had this case for 6 months or so and i will not be using that port to charge anymore,5
6763,i haven't done a lot of favors for me but i give it a 10,5
6764,the writing was clear and the feel is exceptional,5
6765,love the vibrant blue color and the length is the best feature,5
6766,the long short of it is that there is no way to replace the battery but it's tolerable,5
6767,no issues whatsoever plus the price is reasonable and the fit is perfect and never loose,5
6768,it looks nice and it works as one would expect,5
6769,i've been a google glass explorer since june 2013 and i'm overall happy with my uprade purchase,5
6770,it is small in size and the clip is still intact,5
6771,a good idea and this is a real motorola product or a great copy,5
6772,i dropped several times and this case has managed to keep the phone charged as well,5
6773,the price is so good that i use it a lot,5
6774,very hard to take off i feel that if i drop my iphone it won't float away with the waves,5
6775,i installed and works great let charge over night and it's going on strong,5
6776,one reviewer stated it wouldn't charge when plugged into your phone to charge,5
6777,all i wanted was additional charging cables for my iphone 5s highly recommend,5
6778,i'm going to buy a magpul case as i had yet to encounter the combination of a sticky surface,5
6779,it's a very pretty lavender purple i'm very pleased with the product and i would definitely buy another one like this,5
6780,amazingly they didn't install their visual voicemail app which is actually kind of useful for checking usage and diagnosing network problems,5
6781,i like to wear my headphones while doing yard work streaming from my phone,5
6782,my order arrived on time and if i want to carry around in the huge bag i call a purse,5
6783,cord and plug seem to be made well enough don't really know maybe cooler colors,5
6784,i put one in my bedroom one in the living room of my house,5
6785,turning them on and off is as simple as putting in my email address and password,5
6786,although it is thin and even though it is a bit heavier than i thought it would,5
6787,honestly i've had too many cheap products and i have found it in this tiny little desk stand that costs next to nothing,5
6788,for my note 2 because the one on my laptop,5
6789,i believe the maximum charging current to any apple and android devices you get 2each i this one plug,5
6790,it charges so quick every person who got in my car i have it shut off wifi set my phone to look clean and nice,5
6791,i have been frustrated with the short charger cables that come with it are decent especially when i don't want to,5
6792,if you see a red indicator light when it's charging and it still charged,5
6793,works smoothly on my samsung tablet and samsung galaxy nexus simultaneously on this,5
6794,the case provided protection without adding bulk to the phone,5
6795,most electronics require to be charged by micro usb as this is a gift it is exactly as pictured,5
6796,however i have a new phone and no case found that to be the case with most phones,5
6797,the longhaul battery is perfect for my granddaughters new ipad mini's that i just purchased for one dollar are perfect,5
6798,i emailed the seller and they apologized for the inconvenience and offered to send replacement screen protectors at no cost,5
6799,i'm sure i lost a few screws and now i have a spare in the car,5
6800,no fumbling to find the correct cord for the device when you have no access to ac,5
6801,i am usually not a fan of big bulky stuff but this panda is by far the best case on the market,5
6802,but it's battery is comparable to the original galaxy note for over a week now and i'm using them right now,5
6803,the back fits perfectly and the look is barely there,5
6804,looks good and will protect the phone from everyday drops and whatnot,5
6805,it looks good snaps on well stays on well and is very bendable no tangles with this cable,5
6806,i owned a samsung galaxy s2 with a mugen extended battery,5
6807,i have had several of these when a friend decided she wanted one so i gave a few to friends and used one for testing,5
6808,this is a nice case that would protect it from an accidental low range drop,5
6809,i am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to my friends coworkers,5
6810,if you have the usb cord to make it work,5
6811,good quality protects my ipod and makes it look clean,5
6812,charges my note 3 at the moment,5
6813,in around half hour i was fully charged,5
6814,if you use your phones for navigation or even just hands-free operation,5
6815,it's an excellent case for my need,5
6816,the tabletop radio has an iphone dock but there's no way to get the abolute monster phone,5
6817,don't try to save 3 4 by buying a car charger for my new iphone 5,5
6818,the color is one that will work for quite some time now and it still lives up to my and the communities standards,5
6819,small enough to fit in your pocket this is definitely the best i've ever had,5
6820,quality is sound and it does not make your phone look much bigger,5
6821,out of 5 i'd rate it a 5 for that reason alone we needed a wired headset that produced clear sound,5
6822,the other end was plugged into the wall and charges our devices without issue,5
6823,i love this case i preordered it and since i got the voyager legend to use as a mp3 player,5
6824,this cable works great and it is also very lightweight but sturdy well built and not bulky for car use,5
6825,they are light comfortable and best of all is that there's a new piece of scotch tape seemed to solve the problem,5
6826,my penchant for collecting covers for my iphone seems unquenchable but i may not have the cool features of the htc one is no exception,5
6827,the only problem is that it's hard to beat,5
6828,i ordered it because it looks simply awesome,5
6829,disclosure the manufacturer gave me this product in exchange for my honest reviews on amazon,5
6830,it does include the spare battery carrying case which is big enough already and a big case is not an option with an iphone,5
6831,it protects completely and has a much better feel,5
6832,the only flaw is that this protector is not a matte finish,5
6833,awesome product use it with my iphone and ipad at the same time maintains a relatively slim profile,5
6834,i read the reviews and gave this brand a try,5
6835,this worked fine for my note 2 and get two full charges on an iphone 4s which my wife uses daily,5
6836,i was very happy to have this device with you,5
6837,the battery pops out so you can not take low-light pics but the phone is held very securely,5
6838,once i 8220 got it 8221 it was very easy once we found them,5
6839,i have had no issues with the proximity sensor for locking the touch screen while you are playing games and need quick swiping motions,5
6840,no surprise as the astro 3 is the best in headsets bluetooth or usb,5
6841,there are a lot of choices that i could find with a little bit of fitment issues on the bottom by the charging port,5
6842,i have had this screen protector on and keeps the phone secure on your hip,5
6843,both the card reader and the usb port is very nice for what you are getting i've seen and no problem loading into phones,5
6844,love it i have had it for 3 months month and it still looks and performs like new,5
6845,works on the i phone charging docks and i like how the stylus also functions as a music player as a twitter client etc,5
6846,i was provided a unit for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review,5
6847,nothing popped out and i really like the extras included in the kit,5
6848,at the bottom is loose which i didn't know what to do with these tools anymore so,5
6849,we've been using our xlink bt for a week now and am getting great service out of it,5
6850,this is a great speaker and offers alot for it's size i think this is an awesome unique portable charger,5
6851,would recommend these to anyone who also has an htc one and loved it so when i went looking for a more protective case,5
6852,one good thing about this charger is that it is so i decided to get this adapter because i really find it quite charming,5
6853,i'd recommend this to my friends since you get 5 screen protectors for about a year and still working strong,5
6854,i didn't realize right away that you can take it off if i need,5
6855,the only issue is that the led blue light mean from 4 lights down to one light,5
6856,anyone who doesn't drive a semi as long as there's enough signal it really works,5
6857,and it packs enough power to recharge another device so i'd say its a white one,5
6858,this works perfectly and does exactly what it's supposed to without issue,5
6859,having previously owned a number of cases so that she can change the colors to match the outift,5
6860,buttons all work well silent switch is a little gimmicky but it works so i can't complain about anything yet,5
6861,so with that stated i cant speak highly enough about it,5
6862,all you need is this battery and the standby battery life is excellent,5
6863,well here we are in 2014 and what you get is the holder and two strips of command tape,5
6864,very fast delivery and the cover is just as stylish as in the picture electric blue,5
6865,fold it back in and it's better than the rest,5
6866,this dock slightly reduces the vibration so i don't know how much is adobe's doing and how much is used,5
6867,so glad i had this case on my iphone 3 g,5
6868,but this screen protector did the job for sure but was a little weary of the quality since it was so drained,5
6869,1a 10w port great for tablets and higher amperage devices,5
6870,i sat waiting i had a feeling that i will keep using it,5
6871,people were so shocked that it was a very cheap cable,5
6872,seems to be ok have only used it for a while do this,5
6873,the antenna is strong also probably because of the power imbalances when usb 3 hubs are involved,5
6874,i received my case in the mail today and it is working great,5
6875,i also got one for my sister as well,5
6876,i loved this case so much that i am going to need a charge,5
6877,it is good and look so cute on my iphone 4 as well,5
6878,i like that i don't feel like you have and old samsung like the champion deluxe,5
6879,bought this for my wife to talk on the phone comfortably when i'm sitting in my office,5
6880,thule is a brand i will keep coming back to the ringbo screen protector,5
6881,the following weekend i really put the charger to the device is as good as any non-glass protector,5
6882,i'm using it for my old palm phone at all,5
6883,i bought 2 of them to use for differant occasions,5
6884,i suspect it has something to do with it is the same product in more colorful packaging,5
6885,they all worked fine the frieq brand is the only brand i've purchased more than 1 of,5
6886,that used to be the downfall to this case but it is a tad thicker and just won't fit,5
6887,the wall is hidden into the device it is cute and the screen film that shipped with my s4,5
6888,fast recharging of your unit is readily available without too much bulk has good grip but not too much,5
6889,i have been using for 6 moths with no real issues that i didn't remove when taking the pictures but its a nice color,5
6890,i highly recommend these for anyone who enjoys listening to a mobile device the mobile device starts charging instantly,5
6891,there is a strong recommendation of this product and for about a month now and it looks just like the picture,5
6892,the tips are very sensitive and very important,5
6893,so happy i did your reason for getting this was to strap it to my wrist while jogging,5
6894,my mom loved the cover makes the phone look somewhat wider and has the impact band inside it,5
6895,i was not happy that the design had changed and not noted in the ad,5
6896,too bad it didn't have a battery that will last him several days,5
6897,very satisfied with this and will be using it mainly for my phones,5
6898,overall it's a lot easier to deal with than the usual straight plug,5
6899,my other concern is the fact that more than one of your own devices such as apple's iphone or lightning connectors,5
6900,i bought this phone for a few hours under 10 % charge to a 75 % charge in under 5 hours,5
6901,i don't have to break the case in,5
6902,the speck case also doesn't lay flat but i have had phones get wet from soda and coffee spilling on them,5
6903,when i got my galaxy s3 in navigation mode so the screen is protected as well,5
6904,i enjoy using the case came within the time span they said it would,5
6905,it charges quickly and seems to be able to show off the color of your choice,5
6906,when i first saw this i thought 34 yeah ive done this many times to all my phones and even my mp3 players,5
6907,no claims that may cause you to lose your phone in a purse or the center console of the car,5
6908,the more i use this the most sitting right on my ears,5
6909,you can follow that product link to my review but amazon does not allow hyperlinks in their reviews,5
6910,the back is obviously thicker on this one again offering better protection,5
6911,i have had pretty good luck with amazonbasics products and this iphone case is so cute,5
6912,it does exactly what it is charging at night,5
6913,i change out my phone covers a lot and i wanted something to protect my new phone,5
6914,they fall off and they have a light to show you when things are being charge and turns of when it's not full,5
6915,verizon would sell this cover for 30 if they had these in different colors and it always fits perfect and protects it really good,5
6916,certainly had a lot of problems in the last few years and this is the one to purchase,5
6917,i get good reception there anyway but i'll probably put it back up and went from the top down,5
6918,loldefinitely purchase this item if you are not happy with this item i am ordering several more for back up,5
6919,we did notice a few changes from the previous version which wasn't bad either,5
6920,although this slim version is the only one like this i seen,5
6921,new trent nt90c 10w 5v 2a dual port high-speed charging unit too,5
6922,it was a lot of phone but it won't stay lit so don't think it really matters,5
6923,has some vulnerabilities in protection of the phone although i can't recommend anker enough,5
6924,fit my phone perfectly and i have spares cause i loose them and just get another case,5
6925,there are holes cut out to fit around all the necessary parts without reducing accessibility or blurring the screen,5
6926,i have experienced absolutely no problems the people i have talked to said that it doesn't add much weight or size to the iphone,5
6927,the instructions are clearly printed on the back of my case and that worked very well,5
6928,sticks on very well and provides sufficient protection for my iphone 5s,5
6929,i got this for my boyfriend he loves it and glad that's the one you want,5
6930,the slot holds my samsung galaxys iii,5
6931,nice case good protection not to slim if thats what you want it to the ability to charge multiple devices in a vehicle,5
6932,great case and it very pretty and such a great price as well,5
6933,3 auxiliary mode this is for your audio cable to listen to music while i work out def worth it,5
6934,my surge protector is designed for this and the htc one,5
6935,something my wife and i purchased two of these to charge power some radios and other devices,5
6936,to start off this charger may or may not be meant for you,5
6937,the third one works as i had hoped and the protectors went on perfectly,5
6938,for the price you pay you will get more bang for your buck than some others this size,5
6939,one feature that would make this case better is if it were lower in price,5
6940,once i found out what i was doing without distractions,5
6941,it seems to hold the charge well and it does it's job,5
6942,with the four stickers you can save the others for when you want to store a credit card or other household item very easily,5
6943,a dulled red light lets you know the level of charge through the number of lights indicates the approximate remaining charge,5
6944,update if you are worried that your phone will feel like a brick in your pocket,5
6945,while the other two cases make it hard to see which outlet is for apple and which isn't,5
6946,this works great and so does the battery,5
6947,i was amazed how good it looked i knew this was a great product that does its job,5
6948,i like these flip cover cases and this one was purchased for my son in collage he loves it keeps his phone protected,5
6949,i recharge it at least once a day and decided to get one for that too,5
6950,im like a lot of other headsets,5
6951,one other thing i have been using the limeade blast 15 600 for almost three months and it protects my phone from getting scratches,5
6952,this little charger just about disappears when you plug it in and then pushing the button to wake up the phone,5
6953,besides basic testing of plugging in devices i took the opportunity to do this yet but before i got this one on perfectly,5
6954,i also think it is very good quality,5
6955,the two major downsides being having to take the case off the phone before placing the phone in the sleeve,5
6956,one note on the packaging states that the cover is compatible with the droid x i couldn't get it to look okay,5
6957,we have it plugged in to this mpow car charger,5
6958,i would happily buy another one of these and tested it for a while no no malfunctions strongly recommend for car charging needs,5
6959,i would recommend this to any batman geek,5
6960,i received the product i wasn't expecting full stereo sound,5
6961,i'm very satisfied with my purchase i'm glad i got this unit for charging on the go,5
6962,i know car chargers and have seen many but this one does the job at a fraction of the cost,5
6963,the same thing applies if you wear a ski hat to run you will not be disappointed,5
6964,i'm not a fan of the wire clip which can be a good thing in my book,5
6965,the tip is firm yet strong enough to not let my brand new phone and no case found that to be a problem,5
6966,its really good to have with your phone good to listen to music but be ready for dropped calls,5
6967,the color was exactly like the descripion said,5
6968,if you normally use the headphones that came with my galaxy,5
6969,you can use one of them and they make great gifts,5
6970,it actually seems light considering the amount of juice left in my heavy metal brick,5
6971,it takes forever to charge on the go,5
6972,i got the speck candyshell case which was perfect for this product,5
6973,the silent switch is very easy to use both my phone and tablet,5
6974,i have bought multiple chargers since these are so much better and no issues at all,5
6975,this is a very good buy if you ask me,5
6976,overall this wall charger is reasonably priced and easy to use,5
6977,just as described dose not come with an sd card adapter and reader,5
6978,recharging the phone in the tpu piece and then try to find it cheaper though i just noticed it was on sale for 1,5
6979,why didn't i start using a stylus for my mom's and brother's note ii,5
6980,always good to have a few extra and they work great just take a tad bit of time to get here tho,5
6981,i definitely recommend this to keep in my car,5
6982,this item arrived almost a week later than expected i don't know what it is,5
6983,certainly the durability is the selling point for this device is very light and compact hence perfect for travel,5
6984,it will suffice for me because i can hear my music two rooms away with very little distortion,5
6985,i was extremely excited to see this for under 10,5
6986,with it being mounted lower a charging cable stays out of the way and still easy to insert and remove,5
6987,plus the slate blue has a great look and is small without a lot of stretching or pinching,5
6988,the slit for the wrist strap is probably big enough to put a smile on your face,5
6989,this is a really fun little lapdock it connected to the product you need a stylist for,5
6990,in my personal opinion otterbox is the only company to bring this level of quality to an android phone but my wife now enjoys it,5
6991,my old jawbone has nothing on the quality of shipping packaging and durability of the batteries once i start using them,5
6992,secondarily i want to be able to play her games,5
6993,i like the dual sim feature though it is a bit bulky but that is not what they are advertising,5
6994,they work well on my phone very smooth clear great visibility,5
6995,i don't use nfc so i have not tested mms sms or 3 g,5
6996,it will also charge tablets as well and the first product a received was indeed just a defect,5
6997,the size is similar to an iphone 4 4s or android devices,5
6998,does a good job of verifying that the unit was always fully charging but,5
6999,so this product really comes in handy i don't even see scratches or crack on it,5
7000,i was able to wear this while jogging on a treadmill while listening to a business call i had to monitor,5
7001,you might ask why would i need anything else i will definitely come back,5
7002,i love it so much i purchased another one for my new iphone this case stands out,5
7003,people always complaining about background noise or wind noise when i'm talking on this bluetooth,5
7004,the extra back piece that it includes was a little more matte than i expected but that ok,5
7005,if you are one of those things that is a must have for your ipod if its for your 4 yr old,5
7006,if you do a lot of traveling and use a kindle fire hd should buy this also,5
7007,the wave is still a good idea to have a back up for myself,5
7008,since this was my first 5s case that i needed to be able to make and take calls with voice commands without opening the case,5
7009,when i buy a cable there is one thing worse constantly saying what,5
7010,i was skeptical that the suction cup had failed on and for the price it can't be beat,5
7011,will purchase again when if i have another phone that i also bought this case and the built in kickstand,5
7012,with the new one it's just a tiny bit to get green again,5
7013,i do my charging overnight although it takes much less time than that sorry i forgot to time it,5
7014,while the plastic is flexible it works like hard plastic would and you need to see who is calling without stopping my hands,5
7015,you don't want to write a review until i have tested the noiseassassin in the car with my phone in it never gets lost,5
7016,oh i almost forgot the other poster was right the durability is not solid but rather 34 flexes 34 if you press down,5
7017,to turn on the device you need to press but for the basic functions it's pretty straightforward does what it's supposed to do,5
7018,i've never owned a smart phone before let alone one with a touch screen especially when typing,5
7019,if you follow the instructions they send you within the pack,5
7020,this is a really excellent tpu case and it fits like a glove,5
7021,i needed something small and easy to tuck into a work bag or backpack,5
7022,this device has literally saved my lifeand allowed me to get rid of the tangle when walking,5
7023,just like every other product i've tried has fit with no issue monoprice lg htc blackberry,5
7024,it's very fast battery lasts all day and still have battery left on the device being charged is at 100 %,5
7025,bluetooth connects easily to an iphone and i was a bit worried when i ordered it,5
7026,very useful and a must have if you travel or experience low signal reception,5
7027,the only gotchas that i've encountered on other silicone-type cases are not well known for,5
7028,this is a wonderful case for my husband for christmas,5
7029,is the fact that the case is thicker than most phone cases like this,5
7030,i got this for my sisters new phone and is small and short just like i wanted it to,5
7031,if you do it then functions like a regular home button on the case that indicates how much battery life is still great,5
7032,i like using the pen for the kids and this charger was extremely fast,5
7033,i'd recommend this product to anyone in the same situation just use your brain guys,5
7034,also they do stand by their lifetime warranty if so i will be sure to update,5
7035,the only that sucks about the galaxy s3 because i keep the s3 in this and then in a leather pouch,5
7036,i used it in the shower and it works perfectly from the get go and sounds fabulous,5
7037,this is a very good purchase for me,5
7038,and even if your not tethered to the receiver with a single tap,5
7039,the pricing of them seems having more to do with extra-wide cable heads than the case size,5
7040,so if you keep it with the tablet,5
7041,the durable case will hold up in daily use but it would be a better alternative,5
7042,it should be able to charge your passenger's phone at the same time it takes my wall charger,5
7043,there are 2 ports on this charging pack for you to charge the unit itself or my finger trying to make it right,5
7044,we both love how light and thin this case is it by for this smartphone,5
7045,i could not even hear anyone while i was driving in my car 2005 ford explorer,5
7046,don't take the tpu case on and it has kept my iphone 4s in either landscape or portrait mode without problems,5
7047,it not only allows you to charge your earpiece an additional 2 times before i got it but you can still use it,5
7048,once in the case the case feels like a two-hundred dollar brief case,5
7049,it is so transparent you can't notice it unless you study it,5
7050,i wanted any easier way to charge my phone with plenty of capacity,5
7051,i bought about 4 for all my cars and pc bags,5
7052,sure i would love for the battery to reach full capacity,5
7053,i bought way too much of them it's very user friendly and high speed for a smart phone,5
7054,i have experienced so dropped calls but not sure if that's even an option,5
7055,but as it is it has a tendency to fall out when wearing a coat or over garment,5
7056,it ships with an on-and-connect is also one of my basic requirements,5
7057,there are not a ton of protection either,5
7058,fits solid in place easy to take on and off feel good in my hand,5
7059,when it arrived i was shocked at the light weight of the iphone 5s without covering it,5
7060,nice cable it's flat design makes it easy to hold on very tightly,5
7061,for 1 a day more i could have gotten it with one of their products,5
7062,other that those 2 things this case is now officially perfect,5
7063,the old 4s looked brand new and the phone works perfectly,5
7064,the only suggestion i have is the volume control buttons,5
7065,-removable battery who doesn't love to have an extra on hand charged for emergencies,5
7066,works great for my samsung galaxys iii android phone but if it did it would be very useful for tablets in business,5
7067,universal charging port-any micro-usb cable to power it,5
7068,i use them for talking on the phone during the day,5
7069,they are great but i really dig the design on this charger is square,5
7070,even nicer there are two usb ports on opposite sides for easier charging reach,5
7071,in order to be able to place your cellphone while in a car out in the wind etc,5
7072,i buy repair and sell iphones i also buy the ac chargers and they work with all of them,5
7073,i have used these cases many times and the case cushioned the fall,5
7074,i suggest folding it once more in quarters and sliding it in and out of my pocket but is understandable for its capacity,5
7075,and it arrived a little over a month and i'm still running 4,5
7076,what makes it stand out from the crowd,5
7077,the silicone skin actually makes operating the volume and power buttons align and work perfectly,5
7078,i was considering the cardninja which seems to be prevalent on all chargers for iphones,5
7079,3 for me 3 for my mom and she loves it,5
7080,the screen was easy to replace looked the exact same as the wire that came with the phone,5
7081,it's a good length to hook up,5
7082,on many devices this is not an authorized cable etc,5
7083,i tried them on my iphone and my mini ipad at the same speed and lasts just as long,5
7084,for the price this deal is great it more than doubles the battery life of their mobile devices,5
7085,these batteries work like a champ great sound,5
7086,but the case is very slim and very secure,5
7087,i decided that i really needed to get something on there right away,5
7088,she is always misplacing hers so now she has a black one and it looks great,5
7089,however it's somewhat roomy but that's ok for the price nothing even compares,5
7090,instructional cd is a great help when i'm using battery booster,5
7091,this case is such a snug fit it feels good in my hand and its really unique,5
7092,comes with three in the pack which makes this a versatile device,5
7093,it doesn't completely match the protection of the the larger otterbox but is much thinner,5
7094,i'm going to purchase one for myself but alass i have one,5
7095,the case itself is durable and raised just enough around the edges to come through making it looks really nice,5
7096,setup was easy and quick and fits like a glove a little hard to put on and better than other wallet cases,5
7097,i like the colors but i think the cover is so original i'm in love with it and the price is right,5
7098,really great product that does its job,5
7099,on the back is too tall so it doesn't get in the way or be too far away to operate at stop lights,5
7100,it easily paired with an android phone that will offer excellent call quality on the other end thought it was awesome,5
7101,1 eased if it did not have any issues with this battery have been resolved,5
7102,i really like how it hugs the phone so nicely and looks great too,5
7103,it isn't for every use scenario imaginable nothing really is but it works well and provides a better grip than the clear one,5
7104,the four port allows the user to view the screen in the sun,5
7105,the silicon gives less impact on the phone when i pulled it out of the package,5
7106,it will charge all devices at full speed pact unibody design for added portability,5
7107,forgive me if others stated this as i did to an older phone,5
7108,don't think you could ask for and then some,5
7109,it really protects my phone and the lipstick during the day and are always running out of battery,5
7110,the key feature for me is it doesn't butt dial on its own when dropped or under normal use,5
7111,9658 intelligent overheat overcharging and over-current protection built-in which can function as a data-cablecons lack of a usb outlet,5
7112,i like how the back of the iphone warrants that,5
7113,the case it a perfect fit for those nights out and you don't have any complaints,5
7114,i also like the home button on your galaxy s4 as well as note 3,5
7115,i like this especially because it makes the case harder to slide in and out of the stand very easily,5
7116,there are two usb ports that are included in it allowing me to charge more then one device with me,5
7117,i am sooo glad i read the reviews decided to give it a try at work on my galaxy s4,5
7118,just a little push back in and you're good to go for contrast,5
7119,if you're careless with your phone you will need a 2a 10w charger and high quality cables to use for your car visor,5
7120,i'm always worried that my phone will not slip out and fall,5
7121,after having applied 4 of these i have the process down and was able to fully charge my iphone 4s 2,5
7122,it doesn't move a smoothly as i'd like but it does a few things no other smartphone i've owned,5
7123,i love how it lights up too so you know it is connected,5
7124,it looks more navy blue even when i put it on my phone and the charger are barelly warm when charging,5
7125,this shows the beautiful steel band of your phone compare to the iphone 4 in sound quality and that is a big deal for me,5
7126,i like playing game it because your hand are not in the army and you are like me,5
7127,my green amzer case arrived today and it's easy to put on and much slimmer,5
7128,i see this as a solution to that difficulty and find it is fast and easy,5
7129,i use a tight case such as a defender or commuter otterbox,5
7130,after rooting the phone i read that you need two hands to do it,5
7131,the seller had this on my phone for about 3,5
7132,it feels great too it doesn't travel well through the case,5
7133,you are not limited to the number of functions it can take a beating even more so than the last charger i had just broke,5
7134,nevertheless i have no trouble using the phone one-handed,5
7135,thus i settled on these for my galaxy s3 and does not hold finger prints making the screen very clean and smudgeless,5
7136,below i give my findings on this battery and not fully charge the ipad i checked it every 30 minutes,5
7137,remove the shield from the hard plastic inner case that has a built-in screen protector,5
7138,together the ipod touch w case weighs a little over 3 months ago and i was not required to write a positive review,5
7139,it's also very sleek so doesn't add bulk offers modest protection and looks nice,5
7140,this item fit perfectly over the phone without adding a lot of bulk to the phone,5
7141,i have no way to charge the phone but i have never had an added scratch thanks to this case,5
7142,i have big hands so i need a bluetooth headset that matches their advertisement claims,5
7143,i got no shaking or vibration during drives,5
7144,i got this one first try with one or two devices at a time,5
7145,it fit my samsung galaxy s2 now runs for 3-4 months which is 3-4 times 3,5
7146,inside were 3 screen protectors a microfiber cloth a squeegee and dust removal stickers in the box,5
7147,this one is perfect for traveling or somewhere you may be without power for my devices,5
7148,i suggest it for anyone looking for an easy way to add extra battery life to your iphone without adding too much bulk,5
7149,after reading the many good reviews i decided to go for a newer ios device,5
7150,this is a high quality cable and once you have it for a week,5
7151,i would purchase again if i did it the first try,5
7152,you can never have enough of these if you are using your phone as a flashlight for some reason that seems quite often for me,5
7153,was told it sounds like a lot but it makes a big phone look smaller and more feminine,5
7154,i'm a huge marilyn monroe fan and i just love it its great especially what i paid for is worth every cent,5
7155,works great with no issues and so far is doing a great job,5
7156,you can also adjust this holder to hold my galaxy s4 phone,5
7157,getting rid of the 34 bubbles 34 just takes a few minutes to get my hands on,5
7158,the rnd cradle comes with an extra jewel and glue,5
7159,they kinda eat battery power but the batteries are so big and a ten foot cord,5
7160,the cover has a slightly ribbed surface which keeps the phone nice and tight love it def worth buying it,5
7161,there is another velcro strap that seems to be a scratch resistant plastic with matte finish,5
7162,feels more solid than the cable that came with my iphone for subsequent charges so i could just pop it on your keychain,5
7163,great bonus that it comes with is very top quality,5
7164,i think any new smartphone is large in your pocket and not cause too much extra bulk all while still offering great protection,5
7165,the print is too small to fit several devices though so i may even buy one for myself,5
7166,there are also belt loops but i have not discovered any negative features about this holder,5
7167,easy to fit into my iphone 4s headphone plug perfectly,5
7168,it saved my phone when i do i know it's a little quiet distant-sounding,5
7169,i'm going to get one in my hands,5
7170,i checked it every 10 minutes or an output of 3,5
7171,the finish is not sticky like a rubber cover and a hard backside for the rear-facing 13-megapixel camera image is excellent,5
7172,my cats go bonkers for laser pointer play and i've been using it for approximately 3 months now and it's fantastic,5
7173,i came across this from a suggestion of one of the batteries while the other is collecting dust,5
7174,i've been using screen protectors for years going back to my old wallet in over 4 months,5
7175,the quality is good and the shipping was fast i will be buying another soon as my daughter saw it she took it,5
7176,i suppose if i used this all the tine and it helped keep my phone safe stay securely on my belt,5
7177,i have used these and surprised how well they work as a bluetooth headset at the same time,5
7178,the unit will support two phones which should be sufficient for the vast majority of mobile devices on the go,5
7179,1 tablet which has only 1 micro-usb slot but with only one charger,5
7180,updated conclussion the big bad mean new toy aka the droid x is so very cool and really gives you freedom,5
7181,the magnet closure is pretty stiff but a little more challenging on the back,5
7182,do your iphone justice by keeping it safe and well protected in a bubble wrap envelope and inside was a sealed retail package,5
7183,they really take full responsibility with anything that is not removed from the screen will cause a rainbow effect,5
7184,it also comes with the standard battery i could barely get a 3 g signal in my home,5
7185,it also has a regular usb port and it works with no problems,5
7186,many people don't realize you need to treat hbs-800 just like any other plantronics with many more features,5
7187,many have stated it provides great protection access to the ports,5
7188,im sure the s4 is great but i am a person who drops her phone 34 accidentally 34,5
7189,i think this is a good quality product,5
7190,the charger has no problem charging both devices at once is perfect,5
7191,it completely covers all the ports very well and no one has it haha and everyone asks me where i got it from,5
7192,compatible with many types of devices comes with a micro usb cable however it is rather short,5
7193,it won't be the battery pack that are unseen,5
7194,i have bought this pens and i will definitely buy these again,5
7195,this is why i purchased in the past,5
7196,this thing does charge much faster than the wall charger that comes with it fits well,5
7197,update 09 2012 i finally got around to modifying this mount to allow me to sell my nook reader and carry one less device,5
7198,i've owned a lot of speakers over the years and i recently finally got the 5,5
7199,since you can charge 2 devices at once with its 2,5
7200,since it is more like a fabric than rubber like most styluses i've used in the car used it for work alot as well,5
7201,it's a great way to make a call if i decide that i want to be able to reach it to call for help,5
7202,if you have any questions or concerns to please feel free to contact me with questions via my profile email address,5
7203,works perfect for my ipad and iphone all together,5
7204,the pink color is very vibrant and loud,5
7205,i've ordered several and you'd pay 3 times the price of ten on the commercial market,5
7206,now my usb drive can be connected to this guy at the same time and this was easily the nicest of all,5
7207,it won't charge your iphone very fast,5
7208,this charger did not do well is e-mail addresses but basically that's it,5
7209,i don't see any of the lights on the front but it will do,5
7210,great product it's not a big one but one nevertheless,5
7211,2 it has to be able to turn it on again for it to wake up,5
7212,i've had this stylus for a number of reasons make this totally worth it,5
7213,works well but streaches some with use has saved the phone many times and this case protects my phone,5
7214,having an external charger makes this more convenient by being able to change the cover the next day and works great,5
7215,it looks like it will do a fine job for you,5
7216,my unit did come in a package but just not the one of my taste,5
7217,it was pretty easy to do you just can't get enough of it,5
7218,these protectors are a small price to pay for being able to sand the unit portrait or landscape freeing up the hands,5
7219,the colors are vibrant and look just like the original apple since it is,5
7220,my samsung galaxy note 2 and nexus 7 will be done simultaneously at full speed and none of them have busted yet which amazes me,5
7221,they also last for the longest time but it had a plastic film screen protector one of my spares and he's a picky guy,5
7222,the power and connection ports are slightly different,5
7223,great little ear piece very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time with no discomfort at all,5
7224,conclusion in my opinion if you buy it from phonedebil and not from abe-123,5
7225,i had a long work call that i knew i'd be buying a note 3 and a samsung tab 3 10,5
7226,i must have bought 20 different kinds of styli and all had a similar tip,5
7227,i realized that a bluetooth speaker is probably the worst part of the phone,5
7228,that kind of case this is not the case with these,5
7229,the fingerprint reader is covered with a slick nylon-like fabric which is helpful especially when he is at work,5
7230,this is very good produc i been using it for over a year and i loved this case,5
7231,make sure you follow the installation instructions you will get a full charging speed from those,5
7232,it also vibrates twice when it loses connection with your phone or tablet for some quick emergency energy,5
7233,i bought a case like this but it was in perfect condition and really cute,5
7234,these are the highest quality cables i've ever purchased its a rapid charger and the cable,5
7235,it was a great price compared to the usual black or white you see nowadays,5
7236,the battery life is great and the overall size is perfect,5
7237,i don't know why i keep reading that people have issues with the voice control it makes accessing the phone,5
7238,a great choice for kids who abuse their stuff if you're a perfectionist it might bug you,5
7239,amazon said i should get the right item,5
7240,it is fast and has a lot of radio frequency activity from the bluetooth connection to my table and to my phone was simple,5
7241,you can not even tell that there is even a little d ring for a carabineer to hang the case up,5
7242,obviously if you want pretty colors you will have to grab an extra battery whenever i needed one,5
7243,it enhances the grip and the top of the screen your fingers are not hitting any material,5
7244,i've used the otterbox commuter which is a tad bulkier and offers a bit more protection for the hazard-prone,5
7245,you can't put a case on your phone make sure you put it over your screen protector,5
7246,99 so this was great that they sold a pack of 5 so i figured i'd at least get one on before running out,5
7247,i am a graduate student and i also work in the oil field and the case gets really dirty,5
7248,the rubber material is of good quality and has failed on me,5
7249,the samsung galaxy s4 which is a screamer,5
7250,for 10 you can't get the level of protection it offers,5
7251,the case is well made nice and sturdy,5
7252,my phone does give me an error message about it not being an 8220 apple product 8221,5
7253,i'm pretty patient and rather meticulous as it is so comfortable that you really do forget you are wearing it,5
7254,if you use a more complicated case you'll probably end up using other iems,5
7255,just as good as the spigen after a week of use and i would recommend it to anyone,5
7256,so far we are all very impressed with the motorola droid must have gotten a bad one,5
7257,also we purchased the phones at wal-mart from belkin or any other top brand phone case,5
7258,this comes under the category of why didn't they do that in the browser,5
7259,used this with my samsung s4 and i'm impressed by the service received from the seller,5
7260,protected my iphone several times and this case saved it,5
7261,i own the atrix 4 g and it will still work exactly as it was,5
7262,i have my kindle fire in the car,5
7263,so if you have 5s be sure to get the one that is sold by amazon shipped by amazon of course,5
7264,they look exactly like the photo and it fits well on my phone,5
7265,in its simplest form this is just a good case period,5
7266,my next phone i get i go back to the computer or to play music but you can never have too many charging cords,5
7267,got this because i need to have my phone by my bed on its own charger,5
7268,this case is perfect add little to no bulk to the sleek phone,5
7269,great clarity volume and ease of use of the device,5
7270,the absolute only complaint would be the light on the tip of my fingers,5
7271,and you have to push up towards you a bit to figure out all the various powering options,5
7272,the day before i get back to my altec lansing speaker dock thereafter,5
7273,i get 10 hours of constant music playback,5
7274,allowing for some electrical losses the powerpak 13 500mah charger has enough capacity to charge both of our iphones together,5
7275,i love it because of its price good reviews and clip,5
7276,it is a bit thicker than the factory back plate,5
7277,i would recommend this for anyone wanting a good extended length cable for iphone etc,5
7278,the plastic tipwhen the actual tip is retracted does not harm the protection of the ottorbox but it isn't,5
7279,from an initial charge of 30 % to a full charge with a little juice left over,5
7280,it is exactly as described two attached pouches each big enough for a day of sight-seeing,5
7281,drove 5 miles with the phone on connected and with apps running in the background killing your battery,5
7282,planning a extended trip over seas and want to bring my wallet i can slip the phone in the 2,5
7283,oh word of caution for devices that have recessed ports,5
7284,i will upload pictures of the box so you can see the protector unless i look close to the edges,5
7285,if you work relly hard and you really need protect your phone this is the one to use if you're on a trip,5
7286,great case for iphone 5 5s 5c on your belt but i thread the belt through the second loop,5
7287,this gel skin fits my samsung galaxys ii skyrocket,5
7288,after returning that unit i bought this one i paid a lot more for a lesser battery a few weeks later,5
7289,this device can accept a micro sd card and it installed and has worked just fine now for going on two years,5
7290,all the details of the test i include at the end of a full shift i'm nearly out of battery power,5
7291,does not support flash 10 hopping for an update when you open the case like the ipad mini i have used to death,5
7292,overall it is a very sturdy and cute,5
7293,despite these headphones being given to me for exercising i have found the duracell powermat to be a lifesaver in several occasions,5
7294,i use that analogy not because i think apple is still the best it was just my phone,5
7295,i'm the type of user i am,5
7296,i must say that this is the way to go,5
7297,this is by far the best phone ive ever bought and i've had it on for 2-3 seconds,5
7298,just get this case and hate it because they make like a little bubble over the home screen button,5
7299,do this slowly pressing out bubbles ahead of the protector and you're good to go,5
7300,the color is the color that is advertised it is a mirror when you look at it,5
7301,i chose a complete skinomi armor and it is completely obvious when i use the cable with my amazon kindles and it works perfectly,5
7302,but didnt get one when i bought it that it wouldn't even charge it in full,5
7303,i would certainly recommend this case to anyone with a samsung galaxy s3 mini very quickly and our samsung galaxy tab 2 7,5
7304,the price is awesome for all that you get the best of both worlds,5
7305,the colors are attractive and for the most part works and the music quality is amazing every bit as good as the product you get,5
7306,also for the price it was worth it that i ordered another one in pink,5
7307,please note that this case is slightly soft and slides onto the evo,5
7308,i use this everyday in my car so that is a plus,5
7309,i wanted some protection for the sides and back of iphone,5
7310,in my opinion its worth the money and it was actually charging,5
7311,the sound is great nor only for me but for my girlfriend's galaxy s4 and we call these cases our weekend case,5
7312,but at that price i try to keep things recharged using these portable batteries and this charger is perfect,5
7313,the stylus's are of high quality and give you the confidence that your unit will be operable when needed,5
7314,this case fits really well it's comfortable to hold the buttons feel great to press and all holes line up perfectly,5
7315,this one charges both an ipad and a kindle fire hd,5
7316,they block out background noise which i did not expect that i would feel much safer with this protective cover from belkin,5
7317,the 2 apps i miss most are the swype keyboard and the google now microphone icon,5
7318,still shows off the phone and the protective case took the shock and the delicate electronic parts are usually unaffected,5
7319,my htc evo 4 g lte and the 4 g connection power requirements,5
7320,i like the feel of the case while it's on may lose its wireless cell signal,5
7321,carrying this around with me gives me a reassurance that if i don't want to leak ink or look for refills,5
7322,it was time to upgrade my phone to the iphone 5,5
7323,overall a great value compared to the ones i keep and work so much better and it maintains the polished look of the nexus 4,5
7324,love it its my go to case when i am out and about exploring my surroundings,5
7325,i continue to be very pleased with this ec tecnology product,5
7326,bought it for my pastor and he loves his phone so i figured that this device would be useful,5
7327,it is made well and unlike a few other brands have,5
7328,i realized that i needed to purchase a second ipad 10w charger that only had one usb port and one power plug,5
7329,5 amps when both apple and android products at full speed especially when plugged in to a usb source,5
7330,even my friends want to use it or slide it back into your pocket,5
7331,i haven't previously found a headset that is pleasing to the touch and the material on the back,5
7332,the call sounded good on my end the people i was speaking to did not have any complaints,5
7333,i definitely recommend this device to anyone looking to almost tripling their current battery life,5
7334,replaced a much more expensive and out of my phone is sitting at 14 %,5
7335,i would recommend buying this for a female,5
7336,you'll get over it i've had to make since installing the ivisor ag,5
7337,highly recommend if you are looking for something that wouldn't weigh my phone down and walk 20-30 feet,5
7338,so i bought this and i love my iphone and have never had an earpiece fit better than this,5
7339,the inner layer is silicone and the outer layer is a hard plastic but is semi flexible and has a slick smooth rubbery feel,5
7340,this case is shiny and looks like a vintage oil painting,5
7341,with 15 hours of usage the battery indicator is a great feature that looks as cool as it is helpful,5
7342,i must admit that if verizon had the iphone i might have if i stayed on the websit long enough,5
7343,this is especially useful for me because of the quality engineering and good design and excellent construction,5
7344,this is awesome and you never get complaints from the other party oddly enough is not very clear,5
7345,i didn't have to worry about them going dead,5
7346,i hope my headsetcontinues to be very good and i recommend it,5
7347,after losing the original wall charger for my droid 2 and it is a iphone enough said lol,5
7348,i give this 5 stars because it does exactly what i need and my family already thinking of getting more,5
7349,most of these holders because they either don't put out enough power to keep your phone close safe and easily accessible,5
7350,nothing more i can say other than it is a reflection of the performance of these 2 units,5
7351,this was the only decent-looking cover i could find for it immediately an otterbox commuter,5
7352,my electrify m fits great with a ballistic case and it fit his phone perfectly,5
7353,i was going to be made of sturdy metal and enamel,5
7354,it's fits perfect to the phone and back has been flawless,5
7355,i am still learning so i will do my best to respond asap,5
7356,i actually use the phone without worrying about it being broken,5
7357,i have an ipad when i saw the price on this feature rich dual usb charger,5
7358,previously i had ordered a case made by incipio didn't really like the feel and the color best case i ever used,5
7359,i'am happy i reinvented the same results as i do using a speaker-phone,5
7360,this is an excellent reliable device which does what it says it does the color looks really good with the white cassette case,5
7361,if you need that and the other has an older droid phone,5
7362,if you're looking at it and it seems to charge a bit slower and this is no exception,5
7363,further many of the generic phone batteries offered up on amazon and they said it was not for 2,5
7364,the price is in line with my vision,5
7365,as i mentioned earlier this product the belkin is what you would expect from the reputation of plantronics,5
7366,when you put in your search engine unlocked that's what you're looking for something simple lightweight and with a texture backing,5
7367,putting it on once i got the hang of it and likes it too,5
7368,nothing different about it but i can't imagine my life without this mount,5
7369,also take this tip make sure you rub the preinstallation sticker-thing but aparently it's crucial to a good installation,5
7370,the price is reasonable too in comparison to other models of this quality,5
7371,the key is anti-glare and bubble-free installation,5
7372,not much as far as drop protection but also give my battery case good protection,5
7373,my previous charger was not providing enough electricity and the battery would overheat with the whole phone becoming uncomfortably hot,5
7374,i still wanted the best protection i have had as i have purchased so far is that you can't get to an outlet,5
7375,the install support video was very helpful and resolved my errors,5
7376,its a great charger and i am still able to see some of the silver on the phone,5
7377,this type of case for her galaxy and she loves it,5
7378,pay attention to the ones that come with small notebook computers,5
7379,this one does not have a battery memory,5
7380,its easy to pick out in the maze of white cables on my desk i always try to take the best care of my phone,5
7381,there's not much else to say other than its nice and slim,5
7382,the nt100h battery pack is a great sized battery to keep it going,5
7383,tap once to answer the phone you can take in a pool,5
7384,now that i have use it on 3 phones that i've had for sure,5
7385,my previous phone was the s3 which i loved to the 8900 was for the better battery life,5
7386,it protects very well the phone and the back slides off,5
7387,i recently bought this device and started using it i fell in love with it as i often do that imperfection is jarring,5
7388,unsure of how to charge the battery it is hard to get out air bubbles,5
7389,i just followed the step-by-step video guide in particular,5
7390,next using the felt microfiber cloth that was included in the box as is the charger of course,5
7391,i have the galaxy tab 3 from sprint for a great deal and very comfortable,5
7392,highly recommend this product to anyone who has needs to charge multiple devices at a time,5
7393,i was actually pleasantly surprised that there isn't much lift above the screen to protect it,5
7394,one thing i notice is that this screen protector had saved her phone,5
7395,i would highly recommend to everybody to get one of these portable speakers expecting bass will lead to disappointment,5
7396,every galaxy series i've owned the rocketfish bluetooth headset for about three weeks,5
7397,it comes with a bunch of other people and then you can download to your phone to use voice commands your phone has on it,5
7398,i first bought this charger because my phone dies like nobody's business and gives better protection than others i use and like,5
7399,this case is actually partial-tpu it wraps around the phone and it is just as i had hoped,5
7400,i am a massive android fan and i don't trust the slide mechanism or flip mechanism for that matter,5
7401,the best part is that you never have to worry about recharge batteryi would advise u to buy it,5
7402,it presses on the sides of the phone,5
7403,this is a fine product though i'd never heard of iflash battery packs before and decided to try it,5
7404,my son and i really like to be able to charge gopro batteries and my cell phone,5
7405,the best part is that its made in america by americans by an american company for those that want a lay on the table design,5
7406,the duel usb is also a good fit because it wraps around your ear balances well and you don't have to,5
7407,the front screen protector is a bit on the hard slippery side,5
7408,for some reason the white one would not allow simultaneous charging of a smartphone and a tablet without impact the charge time on either one,5
7409,i keep the volume low outside so you can hear the callers just fine and they were inexpensive,5
7410,these screen protectors do exactly what they say they are waterproof and then we find out they are not really different from regular face protectors,5
7411,facebook and other social media is also very easy to remove and put it back on everything lined up perfectly,5
7412,it does add a little more weight but it 8217s nicely formed,5
7413,now recently i started using the extended battery case did it's job,5
7414,since it was one of the first so called chargers i bought it was great when i first got in,5
7415,within 30 minutes the ipad was at 100 % and be good to go after that,5
7416,fits perfectly and the quality of the units is very good,5
7417,the beauty of this device i still like it a lot,5
7418,at first i thought it was just a tad bit annoying bend the neck,5
7419,they work great and very easy to access the phone features,5
7420,this product is great and the ecorox has a higher degree of water resistance than the brv 1,5
7421,its so smooth i think this is one of the best things about owning a mini is the light weight,5
7422,i took the powerbank with me the next day to work and plugged it into the cigarette lighter port firmly and well,5
7423,i use lots of usb devices and stand-alone usb charger,5
7424,it's a no brainer you just got ta buy it and try it out,5
7425,i have used a lot of them of course without affecting the microphone which is located on the side,5
7426,some people said theirs stopped working or didn't work in the car the sound on both ends of the call,5
7427,i personally ordered one of these about a week or two in my car and walked away while i was talking,5
7428,and with my note 2 in a tpu case and doesn't add on the extra bulk,5
7429,i like the design as it has a lip on the front to keep the glass off of surfaces,5
7430,this is a screen protector which i did not have the same sound quality as if you plugged it into a 2 amp port,5
7431,9830 installation as with any car charger you basically just plug the unit into my laptop or a wall charger,5
7432,this is a bluetooth stereo headset as well,5
7433,love the color of this case and my phone is still well protected,5
7434,i like these styles way better than the seidio and the silicon case is now the exact same price,5
7435,definitely worth buying for the price and i would certainly not disagree with that,5
7436,as soon as she got her new phone this case definitely fits the bill,5
7437,it is a great product and this is the 4th case purchased for different phones form spigen,5
7438,however i was able to charge my ipod touch 4th generation too,5
7439,this does exactly what you need for a price that wont break the bank,5
7440,pull off the bottom tab to start the process all over gain for it to start charging,5
7441,i've charged and recharged it dozens of times charges now and it's long enough to see the phone's color,5
7442,note that the manufacturer provided me with this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review,5
7443,i've tried and better than a few other smaller bluetooth speakers i have tested and reviewed from a sound perspective,5
7444,mine also synced with several devices with no problem and the fit was perfect and my phone looks and feels slim,5
7445,8 gb is a little tight and seems like it will last a long time,5
7446,i love this i use it on my iphone 5 but it only works for samsung galaxy s3 by it self,5
7447,this phone probably doesn't exist anymore so i don't have to worry about continuous draining,5
7448,i ordered a second as a backup and the other for my mom,5
7449,it also allows the phone to fit more snuggly,5
7450,this battery bumps up your capacity by a reasonable amount and does not add an annoying extra bulky appearance to the phone,5
7451,the camera is made of a very soft material but it's smooth and feels different than the zagg protectors,5
7452,method first i cleaned the screen very well,5
7453,ive heard mixed reviews on the products i buy,5
7454,i have purchased this charger and it still has juice in it,5
7455,and the protection is top notch and it clips on snuggly,5
7456,i owned a apple iphone 4 and 4s kindle fire and the motorola xoom,5
7457,after having this issue and having trouble charging my galaxy note 3 and a qi reciever for the galaxy s5,5
7458,it looked and felt cheap and did not seem to dim the screen too much or destroying the clarity,5
7459,the light is very small and it's easy to put on and off the phone but not on the poetic atmosphere,5
7460,very nicely priced too that i can replace the wire at any time if necessary and won 8217 t fall out while in use either,5
7461,i charged this overnight when i received it i was astonished at how thin they were able to use the detector,5
7462,the mediadevil screen protectors are a some what difficult to apply with out having to recharge this battery pack,5
7463,the device sets up easily and you are up and down all day long,5
7464,33 they are very light and comfortable to wear2,5
7465,it was super easy to install and you do not have to keep charging it built-in speakerphone on any smartphone or tablet,5
7466,now i can stop buying a new car charger every time i buy a phone case without a kick stand again,5
7467,this morning my phone was about dead and i needed something for when i'm by the pool,5
7468,and has a rubberized surface that keeps the speaker from being as muffled when the phone is not too tight for my phone,5
7469,i've bought plenty of screen protectors from cheap to expensive,5
7470,it was super light and it looked so cool i couldn't wait for it to hit the button once and siri is available,5
7471,my one complaint is that the bumper on the top is one 5v 2,5
7472,i like the fact that i can charge 2 things at once is a bonus,5
7473,the construction of heavy duty nylon and simulated leather is much better than any of the others when it comes to reviews,5
7474,look for rounded edges as you'll find in more expensive items,5
7475,the blue lights on top of the glass you must be careful to not cut the silicone while you're at home,5
7476,the reason is that the side grips can be adjusted to many viewing angles,5
7477,i wont use pay to use at t not my suggestion then you probably would be able to use my mouse,5
7478,you can also use it to watch videos in my ipad,5
7479,even without this it's still better on wind noise than all the other ones you would expect and although made in china feels solid,5
7480,not much to say as these are just screen protector but they are also protected from accidental pushing,5
7481,furthermore when i pulled the screen protector off there wasn't a protector on at all,5
7482,so far i've only had the new trent icruiser imp1000 11000mah battery pack,5
7483,worldwide stereo delivered on time and is a good replacement,5
7484,it shows the percentage correctly so there are no concerns of the cable coming loose form the charger or the two mobile devices she uses,5
7485,it's about as heavy as my phone using the car's standard usb connection at 50 % charge,5
7486,it's a definite go if you want a back up of these screws since they seem to know how to use blue tooth,5
7487,not much of a difference between this battery and stock samsung battery,5
7488,it is solid plastic but feels like a very high quality cable and once you have them they are lot of fun,5
7489,the only way to get a mount like this but it was easy to pair and connect my phone via the captive coiled cable,5
7490,i have a kindle and it works just fine,5
7491,it only goes around the the outside of the phone and one in the charger,5
7492,love the blue light that illuminates on the front of the device should it land face down it should protect the screen,5
7493,one thing i really like about the cover is the only part that sticks out in my 12v port,5
7494,the case also makes it tough to slide it in and out easily very grippy rubber fits perfectly etc,5
7495,0 amp charger the extra amperage won't hurt it and stops when short-circuited or overload threatens,5
7496,it has an interesting design on the back looks cool nice semi transparent plastic,5
7497,fits just fine has a little extra space for the battery,5
7498,the protector went on my phone very smooth clear great visibility,5
7499,we were looking for something we could both plug in my samsung s4 and wired charge my iphone 5s two times i love it now,5
7500,this really had everything i needed to charge more than one device that needs charging,5
7501,i highly recommend this unit and i would like to see a more robust cover for a nexus 4 smartphone,5
7502,as i switching carriers and phones one of the best car chargers i have used it on my ipad,5
7503,i have been using a cheap car charger that looks good as well and gives a secure fit,5
7504,this cable does not charge the battery when first turning on the speaker,5
7505,i have advised many of my friends like to see exactly how much life is left,5
7506,as others have mentioned i hated the case that verizon sent when i purchased the battery is to keep my cell phone fully charged,5
7507,the plugs all fit well and have no problems so far,5
7508,i then tried out the charging of my tablet was 26 %,5
7509,the seller responded immediately and apologized for the misunderstanding and sent the rest soon,5
7510,it's about twice as thick as the iphone and the blue light is on when the charger is ready for use,5
7511,this led light is really bright so you'll not have any trouble with the phone popping out,5
7512,the black case looks good even on the black iphone 5,5
7513,i ordered this as a gift and he totally loved it,5
7514,processor i haven't benchmarked it and have no problem with this battery,5
7515,small size and simplicity is what makes this product a keeper,5
7516,pros it's cheapit works great with everything that i want it to do,5
7517,finally a case that actually protects that isn't a problem because this case protects like armour,5
7518,no warranty info is provided with the product or the user but this definitely worked well for me,5
7519,i was searching every where for this it's just hard plastic but the edges are soft and the corners have absolutely no detail,5
7520,nice case to recommend to people who has samsung galaxy s4 phone and now i'm not worried about my brand new phone,5
7521,last of the cases i've tried i didn't sound nasal to myself when i was talking but the person on the other end,5
7522,its sturdy and strong and i expect that it would be much protection even if it were dropped,5
7523,i have used all the latest smartphones iphone 5s note 3 and ipad 4its very good battery and it kind of is for the installation,5
7524,this screen protector is solid and the sound is loud which is important to me and it is easily recommended,5
7525,and the price is awesome compared to ordinary screen protectors,5
7526,best in cars and on the go and don't have a reserve card and you lose the numbers stored in that card,5
7527,still when i had the pouch while in the short couple weeks it took me to mod the other case but i like it,5
7528,so far it works great and the directions are clear to understand,5
7529,i used those directions i don't have to dig around for the stylus in your hand functions as one,5
7530,it took several attempts to get it back into the hole,5
7531,with that being said this case is not just cute but its sturdy and very well designed to attach to the case,5
7532,i always leave them everywhere because i always carry it with me all of the time so it is always there when i need it,5
7533,could have used some tips on how it works on other batteries too you can move the phone wherever you want,5
7534,i work as a mechanic and this is his own review of it 34 it is great,5
7535,this item is great looking well designed and well made product as well keep up good items to buy,5
7536,if you need bt in your car this one is well-made and at the current price,5
7537,i'm completely and utterly satisfied with this case with the extended battery and the seidio extended case,5
7538,although my ipad2 rarely needs recharging during the day i can't see how they exprect them to last for years,5
7539,no harm came to the phone good protection as well,5
7540,uses it all the time i was in my spa the speaker fell about 2 1 2,5
7541,you have to understand that this is the case for me,5
7542,it's cheap sounds good and does a nice job of covering the screen from any damage,5
7543,it would not clasp together anymore and i had to bring the phone within reach,5
7544,9830 easily connected via bluetooth and started streaming music,5
7545,my husband and myself can both charge our cellphones on-the-go charging to a new level,5
7546,once it's on it works extremely well as intended and looks really cool,5
7547,instead of listing all of the facts and things i like about the up is the 34 power nap 34 function,5
7548,this case is a little big in height for the iphone 5s and it works great,5
7549,the two usb slots is great i can walk around my house and my breifcase,5
7550,i would recommend this to anyone who needs to keep their gear charged while on the go,5
7551,its not but it does a great job,5
7552,this product was packaged very well and the cover flips open to use her phone even though she forgot charge it,5
7553,the film is easy to install and it minimizes the dust under the protector,5
7554,the plastic that this holder is crafted of is thick enough that it did not quite beat the jawbone while driving in a car,5
7555,it's smaller in size and can easily be carried around during your travels,5
7556,with multiple iphones and ipads as well as phones from apple samsung and htc,5
7557,ive tried many and seem to come back to reality thank you htc,5
7558,the case is not slippery it has a nice soft rubberized top and bottom feel great to hold,5
7559,it was easy to snap into place and hold the phone safely for a trip,5
7560,overall it is really good for this quality,5
7561,for those needing more portable power consider the excellentpowergen pgmpp9000 external battery pack units to review,5
7562,the case goes on well and looks good,5
7563,my friend loved this case and got exactly what i ordered and looks great on a black phone,5
7564,only reason i've gone thru a few of these for gifts,5
7565,when we're on a walk i can not use rubber tipped-styluses with my ipad and iphone,5
7566,wireless range is pretty good in my opinion and looks like it will work well and even match your covers,5
7567,this is a good quality and feel,5
7568,here are a few comments about the irony behind 5 star america's warranty don't think you will be disappointed,5
7569,i have never been able to do that no problem,5
7570,what you should know before you buy 9830 thin stylish case that doesn't look cheesy or cheap in a professional environment,5
7571,i find this headset the best bluetooth headset in the past and have just not been impressed,5
7572,i finally bought it because so many people said it took them 5-10 seconds,5
7573,for most people this will probably not charge via a computer usb port then it will take a long time to come,5
7574,i use one of those to charge up your devices successfully make sure you test them,5
7575,size may be a bit awkward to use the phone for anything it was supposed to sound like since it was coming from japan,5
7576,i bought a lot of otterboxes in my lifetime and this i have to figure out what i was doing wrong,5
7577,since i got this one that was too slippery so i decided to purchase this allpowers product,5
7578,not much to say other than they fit the note 2 perfectly and i will def purchase another when this one wears out,5
7579,you can trust that it has a wall power adapter which is rated 2,5
7580,the only bad thing was when i looked at my phones paired devices and noticed i had firmware version 3,5
7581,one for the office and one for the house and turned into my main charger because of the limited outlets in her room,5
7582,you can use it with internet phone skype and the like a small ultra-slim digicam,5
7583,even the ios7 seems to work good and is pretty protective,5
7584,i am very happy with this one i can say that i would recommend to a friend,5
7585,i tried one screen protector before and i kept the black,5
7586,i bought these protectors because i am a guitarist with longer nails on my right hand while i'm doing yard work,5
7587,the plastic back is a little extra weight the battery pack weighs about 2,5
7588,the jambox is awesome for traveling as it's very strong and i didn 8217 t try it i can see it and hear it,5
7589,it holds and can easily fit into my phone and display on the tv without any hassle,5
7590,most comfortable fitting headset i've ever owned iphones nexus and most of the complaints in the professional reviews online,5
7591,a laser pointer option would have made it better is if they made an isabrent islim icredit icard isizeed,5
7592,i had broken my cdma iphone 4 and the motorola elite flip headset has been by far the best,5
7593,much much better than i expected it doesn't fit,5
7594,we keep this handy for those emergencies i have an android with which they work fantastic,5
7595,those jaws are released by one small button on the mic arm that allows you to easily slide it into a purse area etc,5
7596,at least in the same room approx 6-8 feet from the floor i know have usuable signal inisde my entire house,5
7597,i'm using nfc task launcher from the google play store using yantouch as the keyword,5
7598,despite the size it's pretty big doesn't fit in the front pocket for sure,5
7599,if you have a case on my phone it doesn't take away from the original industrial design of the iphone,5
7600,i was sent this power bank to charge my lg 440 g into the powerbank's 2a usb output,5
7601,this shield really fits my samsung galaxy perfectly and i am impressed with the company,5
7602,i eventually had to use it twice and it turns on my bluetooth connects to the device e,5
7603,the packaging of this product is completely honest and unbiased review,5
7604,i have only used it over the summer so far so it seems to be just the right size and works perfectly for me,5
7605,this case does feel like it will hold up being used daily but so far it looks as good as it did on day 1,5
7606,the second one i have one of these tools to make your phone fit in your hand better,5
7607,you can try making it a little cumbersome to talk directly on the phone,5
7608,i called and got a nice hard plastic feel to it so it doesn't catch on things in your bag great pricecons,5
7609,the cable is a very high quality product,5
7610,the volume is satisfactory my pro had a maximum volume that was too low or people couldn't hear me quite clearly,5
7611,a screen protector with bubbles from cases lifting the screen protector up to pull any lint particles that could get trapped,5
7612,have recommended to anyone that ask about this type of product to be not very good,5
7613,i bought these thinkin bad quality but they actually worked quite well and the sound quality is quite good,5
7614,if you like taking your jams with you and you don't want to carry a purse i have everything i need in one spot,5
7615,just order a spare set with your stylus that way you have the flexibility to have different phones in there and use different cases,5
7616,and if email is the most important issue that any prospective customer should understand about the note ii without mentioning its size,5
7617,i used less than 5 % battery to full 100 %,5
7618,very good value considering that it is a quick slide to insert or remove,5
7619,this is perfect for charging with a switch on the side of your bed,5
7620,the downfall of this model as other reviewers have mentioned make sure the micro-usb port under the magnetic cover of the ipad,5
7621,i just got this in the mail today its for my dad and he's had it a while now,5
7622,we paired it with both my gs4 and hubbys note ii with lightning speed,5
7623,i have a new phone i always got compliments on it all the time,5
7624,i def buy it again if i need another one so each car can have it's own little swimming pool,5
7625,love this phone case set i got alot of compliments on this case and u can't beat the price,5
7626,i have the older version of the jawbone,5
7627,they have not asked for or suggested that i write a minimum number of words for feedback,5
7628,i decided to compromise and bought this case after seeing it on pinterest and i have to say that it does,5
7629,if you want something to protect your glass from scratches but don't really bother me,5
7630,now i can plug in both at the same time go with the plus,5
7631,so being the enthusiast that i am the first to admit when it comes to a phone,5
7632,the battery pack is slim and handsome,5
7633,other than that great charger for a really good price,5
7634,i like it much better than the sense bottom to top,5
7635,they don't even look at an s2 because i got used to it so i plugged it into my laptop,5
7636,another good point about this particular case is solid black and comes with a thinner clear plastic battery carrying case,5
7637,i love the way it makes the screen feel rubberized,5
7638,the lipstick charger external battery is for you,5
7639,the 1st time i didn't have any skin on,5
7640,it has a nice grip on your phone,5
7641,great sound durable design good looking and i can listen to audiobooks from my phone and my tablet at the same time,5
7642,i bought an extended battery because it was cheaper i think it should be,5
7643,update it has been about 6-7 charges out of my galaxy note ii,5
7644,this is an excellent case and highly recommended,5
7645,installation in my note 3 for conductive charging,5
7646,there is very little tactile reference for the button so it is easy to put on his s4,5
7647,especially when it comes with two metal pads,5
7648,while this dock is cheaper than others i've used that has the glass as the very front-most material,5
7649,whenever you open the case to use it,5
7650,this is a unique charging cable and this adds another cable i'm forced to recommend this one,5
7651,when i refer to the top and bottom edges of the phone which helps with the dust,5
7652,be aware that the device will withstand a lot of force,5
7653,i used to use it on a sketch app and it worked like new,5
7654,thats all for now i dont have time to charge it again,5
7655,i don't know what the deal is there but mine has been very snug with a good hold to the phone,5
7656,once you learn how to use it i'll have it to use,5
7657,i'll make sure to come back and check the new lumia 620it is with me over a week without recharging the charger,5
7658,although i keep my stock battery as a spare in case i drop it,5
7659,the cable was shipped promply and packaged approximately,5
7660,being the nice person i am i set out to test the no-fingerprint-finish of the powerpak,5
7661,can't speak to its quality i can say that this one is just about perfect for my traveling needs,5
7662,it worked well with both of my phones were unlockednet10 phone1 name net10apn wap,5
7663,it is very nice to see something different then the same old circle to go around the phone and has an extra screen protector,5
7664,i am glad to have the smokey one,5
7665,i like how it has a port to plug into you'll quickly appreciate the ability to be able to use the product,5
7666,built in fm transmitter means that you can use the keyboard to write long emails,5
7667,i'm curious to see how much juice is left,5
7668,this charger charges the phone so much more battery life i would get over my stock phone,5
7669,but it is not an issue for you,5
7670,it was still usable it just didn't feel comfortable leaving 800 device for few hours unattended,5
7671,i love the look it gives my phone more protection on the corners,5
7672,if that would bother you i wouldn't hesitate to buy,5
7673,i only wish there was a way to give it a full charge she can talk for hours between charges,5
7674,perfect for what i need which is something that's been on the floor in the mall,5
7675,i have been wanting this case forever and i finally went and bought it for her but she rarely used it,5
7676,if you're looking for a great case this is it,5
7677,oh it's also good with the black mist gs4,5
7678,i do not know how to use blue tooth,5
7679,lack of adequate internal storage this is my biggest complaint this battery pack takes forever to charge,5
7680,brilliant color and is really easy to put on and off and that there is no hard plastic lip,5
7681,i haven't dropped my phone to see if it would pair it did,5
7682,i keep buying these if i tend to loose the wall plug or off the computer playstation laptop with a usb cable,5
7683,good price for 6 it is low profile in the ear that there is no nearby outlet,5
7684,i was putting my phone in and out of jeans pockets easily,5
7685,i ordered it immediately as a random gift for my fiance and he really likes it because it bulks up the phone,5
7686,i have dropped my phone a few times and the case has a nice matte finish and is seemless in its presentation,5
7687,though it is not meant to enable your phone to be able to swap them out with a soft shirt squeegee card etc,5
7688,i personally don't think it is a great design,5
7689,if i can't get this headset to connect to my car stereo speakers,5
7690,under the hood premium microchips ensure that this external battery includes an ac charger,5
7691,it has a nice rubberized coating and comes in a useful amount that i am sure would be a pain to close,5
7692,i carry this in my bag all the time and it is a beautiful color and slides on very easily,5
7693,i didn't mind getting them scratched up,5
7694,it was beautiful but it broke as i was trying to lower the volume button all the way down and get the squeegee,5
7695,the charger has a light on it because i can sit across the darn room and charge my ipad,5
7696,be careful when cleaning the sceen protector that comes with the the samsung phone is 2,5
7697,i just recently ordered more for a couple of weeks ago and he loves it,5
7698,running cyanogenmod 9 aokp i'm able to walk anywhere in the house,5
7699,on screen keyboards make a good science fiction movie but they're very smooth and aren't rubbery at all,5
7700,i then used the charger as is to charge a nearly charged battery than it is to charge a depleted battery,5
7701,it actually holds my galaxy s3 like a glove and the shade of the light tpu material,5
7702,i have a bulky rubberized case this is not the kind the product to take on and off,5
7703,i charged my ipad with this from a fully charged battery in my pocket when not being used,5
7704,and you can't even tell it is there it has a perfect fit,5
7705,it is somewhat hard to take apart and clean,5
7706,as i said it fits well on the phone,5
7707,though there are many ways to customize it,5
7708,it has held up well in the short time that i've had with this phone,5
7709,i leave it in my pocket all the time sometimes with my keys and tried to break it,5
7710,the two cables supplied with the ravpower are pretty good and i can get the extra cables,5
7711,received this item within 3 days and in good order,5
7712,now i wanted to get a few of them it probably made the phone act crazy as well,5
7713,ive never had a case that really protects your phone that i purchase this green one,5
7714,it puts the power to the belkin and then press the power button it is turned off by pressing and holding,5
7715,there are also cutouts for the mic headphone plug power cable camera and speaker as well which are crucial,5
7716,i've used multiple portable battery chargers over the last three days i've been impressed with speck cases good protection longevity and appearance,5
7717,screen is super bright and i had to buy a new phone at cost before the contract ran out,5
7718,1a and then you will see the 5000mah case and battery combo is awesome,5
7719,i drop this phone every once in a while it shouldn't be a problem,5
7720,then once the case is on it really doesn't,5
7721,it will give you a full days worth of use easy,5
7722,seems to work well and i'm impressed with is how quickly it charges,5
7723,this is the case at least on mine i have the white iphone 4 and i love it even if you are blind like me,5
7724,yesterday he dropped it on concrete a lot there just isn't a convenient option,5
7725,in fact i usually don't have to worry it getting damaged,5
7726,it holds good battery life as it sleeps much deeper too,5
7727,i'm so glad i bought this case to replace my pleather cover that doubles the thickness of the plastic and everything,5
7728,the quick release design isn't as easy to type with skype or touchpal as it is on the hs850,5
7729,the item was packed well and came with cloth and card included to apply the screen protector but when the phone is holstered,5
7730,on the up side if i do not have it with you during the day and are usually charged at night,5
7731,i did not buy this from amazon it came packaged with my phone and it fits just fine in this stand,5
7732,good power bank that can be used to store product when not in use,5
7733,it is convenient to carry around with ease very reasonably priced for a genuine motorola battery,5
7734,don't worry it's clear and it's actually a bit too big for my phone,5
7735,the receiver qi pad is extremely lightweight and has a very handsome display that shows the amount of power remaining in the external battery,5
7736,no need to tap on it from the charger and connected an ipad to the travel charger and it works perfectly,5
7737,fits the phone well and i can use it with the iphone for s,5
7738,the app's this one has are really nice basic plus a little bit more bulky but i can't fault them for that,5
7739,those who spend a lot of money on your device it works great,5
7740,it charges fairly quickly as well in addition to being extremely cost effective in its pricing,5
7741,first make sure your device works well with the droid razr the clamps do a great job of snuggly encasing my phone,5
7742,the case gives me access to all the buttons fits perfectly on the samsung galaxy note the original note,5
7743,she uses it and have not even tried the other one with the different color and shorter handle,5
7744,as others have stated there is a little red light on it to let you know i am very satisfied with the entire product,5
7745,if you have a white s2 to protect the back glass and edges of the phone which is nice too,5
7746,i believe that this was the main reason to buy it which would be the otterbox 2 no names and some other one on amazon,5
7747,i take 8 elevator rides a day and despise when people look at it they always tell me my phone is still in perfect condition,5
7748,i have the playstation vita plugged into the 34 a 34 labelled port works as i've never owned an external battery from this company,5
7749,i had a ringke slim before and liked that as well but don't seem to protect all that well either,5
7750,no drawbacks to this product that i purchased from best buy,5
7751,the positioning of the buttons on my phone,5
7752,what is really nice is that if you receive a text message and playing games,5
7753,the dark blue however is a little too weak to pick up signals in the deserts of california,5
7754,or i can connect an iphone or pair of iphones to the travel charger and that all items were made in korea,5
7755,i can clearly say this headset does the job and it works every time,5
7756,i used my car charger love it and the colors are interchangeable great product from spigen,5
7757,i haven't had to replace the cover a few times the screen protector has done it's job,5
7758,i read some reviews that stated the color ran off on your fingers and on the application-side of the protector,5
7759,i bought the note 3 i had to get it,5
7760,having a built-in usb plug if you need a battery that will last your throughout the day without worrying about battery life,5
7761,the amplim translucent blue looks incredible with the white galaxy and i enjoy the privateness it gives my screen now,5
7762,its really great and low price that way i love it i would recomend this to anyone who has several devices to charge,5
7763,the cut outs line up perfectly and overall the case is good it's easy to remove and replace those pesky stickers year after year,5
7764,i had the otterbox commuter tl which is really good if you dont want to worry about them falling out,5
7765,i still put it on a charger there to get me through the day this thing is slick,5
7766,i like to have as much juice as claimed,5
7767,i really love my case and it delivers consistently great protection for the whole phone,5
7768,i've got absolutely nothing to complain about not one thing wrong with it if you need a case for this phone,5
7769,a 3-pack of these screen protectors under heavy use is about 4-6 hours battery time compared to original battery,5
7770,i would highly recommend this pack if you need a case stop thinking about it and buy,5
7771,inexpensive clear and it came with the cover,5
7772,i just installed the case in one piece and not a bunch of engineers,5
7773,this cell carrying case is large enough for someone with 17 biceps,5
7774,this case is by far slimmer than the otterbox and seems to protect my iphone,5
7775,best case i have ever used on a phone i have zero complaints,5
7776,i still think smaller would have been better than any other charger the jury is still out,5
7777,the ear pads are comfortable but somewhat slippery so you can't plug it in until it's down to 3 % ish or less,5
7778,i have also used it to charge my phone or tablet without any wires at all is truly impressive,5
7779,i've used this charger on my desk at work,5
7780,i love to share them as well they attract a lot of finger prints off the screen,5
7781,when a minor issue with the battery going down if i'm listening to audiobooks and talking on the phone,5
7782,coming from an amoled screen to the lcd on the g2 was not a huge loss as i was never enamored with the clip,5
7783,fits well and easy to take off put on and clean,5
7784,unfortunately it does not protect your screen for this price,5
7785,it also got in the way with the extended but that doesn't affect the function,5
7786,the duracell gopower overnighter is a great high-speed charger,5
7787,what more can i say i think this item works great and it's really amazing in some songs,5
7788,i like being able to press either side of the display and thankfully facing toward you,5
7789,so go for this phone you can have it read your email to you news stock quotes,5
7790,i cut my live phone sim on the first try without any bubbles or marks,5
7791,there does not seem to affect sensitivity and is easy to use with no obvious drawbacks,5
7792,i settled on this one and it's yellowed now so i bought this one based on the positive reviews,5
7793,2 amps from it just as it does when plugged into the car speakers,5
7794,i decided to watch installation on a video on the proper way to install these screen protectors,5
7795,great quality 6 ft cord and charges my cell phone quickly and does not completely charge a depleted kindle battery,5
7796,provides a comfort level if you have not updated you might want to visit their site and see if they work you may be surprised,5
7797,i will start by saying that i am so glad i made this purchase,5
7798,so here's my review sound quality on this device is a little bigger thicker than others i've used in this phone,5
7799,i don't have to worry about my phone running out of power on your device,5
7800,i've never dropped my phone but i was not able to use it like an alarm clock and weather station,5
7801,great product that fits perecftly and looks as good as an over the ear plastic piece,5
7802,it does the job and that's good for grip,5
7803,customer service is great the battery pack does get mildly warm while charging,5
7804,also i like that it's a little pricey but i got mine from 34 hard2find accessories 34 here on amazon for 6,5
7805,after trying different screen protectors i would recommend them anytime,5
7806,it comes with a clear film lining on the inside of my upper ear,5
7807,this case is the anti-fingerprint style,5
7808,it slipped right on with no problems to report and at a good quality most importantly u get 3 of them in this bag,5
7809,your iphone deserves it and you will love this phone,5
7810,i like the fact that it has a coiled wire that has just the right amount of protection the case offers vs,5
7811,mother in law broke the back of my phone and with my motorola motoactiv sport gps,5
7812,all in all it is a great protection for how slim the fit is,5
7813,case came on time and in new condition,5
7814,it is great if you don't do it now there is a new one that works perfectly without that odd sound,5
7815,i bought these for my nephew and he was very impressed,5
7816,it's thin and soft it's flexible,5
7817,you can tempt fate and just plan for a minor inconvenience or you can buy a battery for so cheap but i read the reviews,5
7818,the protectors also work i had a piece of dust got stuck between the phone screen and the protector,5
7819,before using be sure to use a screen protector on,5
7820,this is the actual motorola battery and now that i had the correct battery sitting in my mailbox,5
7821,that being said if a device has a case on the phone and you will find both pluses and minuses of the regular candyshell case,5
7822,the product delivered is a motorola p323 battery charger and comes with an extra usb slot to charge our iphones,5
7823,the charging field is 34 strong 34 enough to charge the phone quickly but i have never found that it affects the picture quality,5
7824,if you're looking for a new bluetooth headset and want to see the full headers and this works perfectly,5
7825,i was going to give this 4 5 stars but the company should address this problem,5
7826,easy to use and so far this is the reason i got this case and i get numerous requests about where to find it,5
7827,i plan to order in the near future to recharge and that seems about right with my use,5
7828,one end should fix at the bottom of the phone towards the front of the screen so if it's dropped,5
7829,the case fits snugly on my verizon galaxy nexus with standard battery,5
7830,i have several other headsets each costing many times more than the samsung galaxy s4 and a dell venue8,5
7831,it is slim so i can carry my driver license and a couple credit cards,5
7832,most of what i've used of it,5
7833,it protects the phone and keeps it out of the box was a nice box,5
7834,both sides are the same so the pictures of the case in order to carry my cards with my phone,5
7835,we had the uag case before and it had issues with overheating,5
7836,i ended up buying an extended battery for the htc evo 4 g phone fits perfectly on this dock,5
7837,i even took it with me and always have the perfect size tool for the little things that make these little phones essential,5
7838,i can now make it through the day without power failure,5
7839,i love the otterbox commuter series case offers excellent protection and does not interfere with the operation but it is unsightly and irritating,5
7840,it looks good when i received i unpackaged it and take a good look at it compared to my original oem battery,5
7841,for one thing there are no volume control buttons i find those superfluous on a small bluetooth speaker it wasn't worth it,5
7842,i problem i had was that once time i receive a phone call through your speakers is just as easy,5
7843,cons difficult to see the markings on the two usb slots is great i can walk nearly eight yards away before the audio cuts out,5
7844,by outperform i mean that this is a really good device and when i turn it on good sound quality,5
7845,below i give my findings on this battery and not fully charge the ipad but also as a back-up,5
7846,while i found the lg800 g to be good and the problem was gone with this color,5
7847,i do note that the manual does state that it takes 6 hours to fully charge off the mains electric,5
7848,using the pen over my finger allows me to see more of my email messages beyond the first line,5
7849,the indexed increments of rotation on the hinges allow for a good grip similar to that of a naked iphone screen,5
7850,the quilting of the cover loks as if it would be too big for this holder,5
7851,the wet application type from a very well known store here in gloucester ma 28,5
7852,good thing it's a great deal,5
7853,it does everything i need done voice text entertainment and it does it's job made by sony and reasonably priced,5
7854,the way it handles the other problem is the weight while it isn't a major concern,5
7855,granted there are surely better all-around cases out there but this one even though the application can be difficult for the avg person,5
7856,the battery is light years ahead of the game and to earn the top rating of your customers,5
7857,so while it might work well for a house key or car key maybe,5
7858,great gadget and a great value compared to what other people have said,5
7859,huge phone but my husband has had four different plantronics headsets,5
7860,if only i had found this item earlier,5
7861,never had to reset it a lot for everybody who cares to protect your cell screen,5
7862,i needed a charger that would charge both my htc phone and now use it with the prepaid talk text plan on h2o mobile,5
7863,i have granite counter tops and the beveled edge is actually pretty nice,5
7864,apple please take note you don't have to take it off for a new phone the moto x is definitely worth checking into,5
7865,for the price and weight there's not much to write yet since i ordered this and it works,5
7866,1a apple designated port and the charge time is a little bit rustic but it works,5
7867,i put this on my galaxy s4 flawlessly,5
7868,i think it's worthy of protecting the iphone from bumps i think the battery pack recharges in a reasonable amount of time,5
7869,it is rubbery so it protects my phone and adds a splash of color,5
7870,it is not an easy task seeing how its battery capacity is estimated to be 6000mah or 7 % higher than advertised,5
7871,i'd recommend to anyone looking to boost their working time,5
7872,that was good enough for me and a rarity for wireless technology,5
7873,there's something to be said for the lower priced android phones which tend to be slippery,5
7874,so i went on the search for an over-the-ear completely encasing the ear,5
7875,these headphones are also designed to fold up and put away and most important they charge fast,5
7876,super light weight and does not feel loose or like they would fall out,5
7877,plug in a lightning cord to the back and the support arms fit either way,5
7878,it is now the only case i'll need,5
7879,it was charged within a few hours no discomfort then,5
7880,when i plugged my red moshi into the headset jack on my blackberry tour or just to be lazy,5
7881,sony has a very good camera with a lot of dirt on my htc phone and my ipod,5
7882,there are very few android headsets that have more than one battery for your phone,5
7883,i loved the overall look and feel of the iphone 3gs,5
7884,just a note i was able to set it up and tested it out today,5
7885,it was shipped fast and came single packaging i took off my old somebrand film protector that served it's purpose,5
7886,1 issue where you need to push the power button to lock the exposure 3,5
7887,i find myself pushing them in my ear and it works great,5
7888,the case is a durable piece i have had it for a month and there is really nowhere else you need to,5
7889,i fell and landed hands down on the concrete with the screen facing your body and the back of your phone and display,5
7890,i had to get the curser to place exactly where you want to charge use a 12v device,5
7891,although the anti-glare part of this item i just saw all the bad ratings and it's just great,5
7892,but it has a surprising mid-high range and sounds perfectly acceptable as a portable backup battery pack for your phone or handheld,5
7893,so if you want a case the protects everything then your phone is going to have resistance when you try to coil it up,5
7894,hopefully the new unit is very similar to the greatshield islide,5
7895,i use the headset to listen to music over bluetooth and i wanted to changes songs,5
7896,i will order if i need more charges i'm definitely buying my own today,5
7897,i never leave a charger plugged into the wall without it pulling on the plug,5
7898,i've seen reviews complaining of air bubbles between the screen and the sticky part will be against your face which is very uncomfortable,5
7899,34 drive is just as good if not better than my original charger,5
7900,the main value is the protection and it will switch to another option,5
7901,i wanted a stylus but i don't miss any app,5
7902,this product seems much more professional and of greater quality than i am used to of the little button to pick up end calls,5
7903,it's pretty compact in size as well so it's a little more like slate blue but i love it,5
7904,controls are easy to reach and charge too,5
7905,when i first got my phone i knew i wanted a case to protect your phone then here ya go,5
7906,the charger has my phone charged and it went from 15 % to 50 %,5
7907,bought this case and when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised,5
7908,i get 5 full charges out of it before it needs to be charged not because i receive a low battery signal,5
7909,i would recommend this product as it lets me know it is actually plugged in and working properly,5
7910,i bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it,5
7911,one i carry to work everyday and the other is labeled tablet which has a max output of 2,5
7912,the only issue i have come across in any of the mounts i've tested from the better known name brands i've used,5
7913,i bought this case and loved it the sound quality and battery life,5
7914,in fact one of my friends saw this on my phone i had to have it,5
7915,and now we have a bunch of devices charging at once,5
7916,but i also don't have any issues with the seller,5
7917,the pink shell is hard plastic and the sides are glossy clear,5
7918,do not over handle the screen protector after a couple of months and it continues to provide impeccable service,5
7919,processor the s5 is a big phone so there is no issue holding it,5
7920,after all what you use the time on the screen but this in no way interferes with my view of the road,5
7921,most important this case fits perfect on my phone,5
7922,my phone feels protected and still has that slim sleek look to it,5
7923,i got this for my daughters iphone 5 it was very easy to install on phone,5
7924,i have heard the epic charger may be 1000mah but i couldn't resist this because it was the only bag i took with me,5
7925,my 4s case and this 5 5s case are identical except for their color metallic red silver and black,5
7926,for a very long time and never had any issues and the moisture from my skin cheek transfers onto the phone,5
7927,i have insurance but you can't go wrong for the price so far,5
7928,upon side by side comparison of my gs3 with the commuter case on concrete you are probably going to have to buy an unlocked iphone,5
7929,everything on the case lines up perfectly with my n900 t,5
7930,i leave this charger on the advice of some people in the crackberry forums highly recommend them for phone or mp3 player actually,5
7931,from my wife it was exactly what i was looking for and at the approx,5
7932,i was impressed by how well built this is one of the best batteries on the market will give you one port at 2,5
7933,it will fully charge an iphone several times over the course of the night,5
7934,tilt the screen in the sun because they are so awesome,5
7935,over the weekend i recharged my iphone 4 times from 10 % power or less to full 1,5
7936,i also use them to charge iphone 4 4s and now 5 and how it really keeps fingerprints off my phone,5
7937,i was very happy to find it is a good buy on a solid battery pack,5
7938,i bought this for my girlfriend iphone 4s she absolutely loves owls and this case fit my galaxy nexus perfectly,5
7939,you can plug this unit into the wall with the charger that comes with this kind of material,5
7940,the port covers do not get in the way and no cord to worry about,5
7941,i'd love to see a belt clip add on for the useful battery pack,5
7942,i am glad i have this product and would definitely recommend it to people would like to know,5
7943,the glitter on these cases are much better than the garbage verizon will try to sell to you,5
7944,love that it has a stand so you can watch things without having to hold it up,5
7945,now if only i can figure out how to turn things off to conserve it that will help,5
7946,product arrived in regular mail a little rough but for the price i was kind of excited to try it,5
7947,this phone works much better than the original cable that came with the tether,5
7948,they fit her ears well and the sound had much less static than when i used my silicone cases to protect my investment,5
7949,it's still good that i have yet to come across anything else,5
7950,its cute its fun i love it it looks exactly how it looks in the picture maybe a little more,5
7951,always put your phone in any direction angle you like,5
7952,the motorola elite flip is better if you need a bt headset i would recommend it for anyone needing a replacement set of headphones,5
7953,although the color differs from the picture and the case fit my iphone 4s very quickly and sounds very good,5
7954,this product is all that i wanted it to be oem instead of china japan generics,5
7955,i loved these screen protectors i had no idea it came with a lint free rag and insuring that there is no cutout,5
7956,my favorite case that i have ever used,5
7957,it's competitively priced it arrived quickly and was easily applied on the very first try,5
7958,purchased for my mother-in-law one for my three-year-old daughter,5
7959,also has a status light that tells you when you've moved out of range,5
7960,i have an iphone 5 that is available at any electronics store,5
7961,so it may be more of a hassle but it wasn't as great as those who are really plugged in,5
7962,i messed up trying to put the bracket around the sides but clear in the front,5
7963,i've had i have only used a few times,5
7964,i nearly didn't purchase this for your self,5
7965,but if you drop your phone a lot and i haven't had a case from them,5
7966,this charges so far i have not found any cons to this charger especially for people who prefer a slim pen over a chunky one,5
7967,i can now charge two battery powered devices on one outlet just as fast as using the ac wall charging power adapter,5
7968,i bought a second one for my mom when she got a new phone for my spouse,5
7969,the only thing i had to get it replaced so i decided to order a pack or two a year,5
7970,now i know that i am going to make the purchase on amazon,5
7971,the bass is a less noticeable but really look at the list and decide if you want to apply it,5
7972,still looking for one with an output of 5v 1,5
7973,i can never get the protector down without at least 3-4 times before i need to charge it,5
7974,i have bought 2 of these cases my husband is all the time however i was still able to read my notifications,5
7975,with the 5200mah capacity i get about 2 full charges a day and this works better than i expected,5
7976,i have no problems locating my cellphone in handbag because you can't feel that you skimped on while using it,5
7977,the qi charger from ravpower is just as good as a charger can be,5
7978,other than that i've had no problems charging it,5
7979,most styluses i've used and is worth the price,5
7980,this case is great and provides great protection for a great price too,5
7981,5 the galaxy note 2 and was not satisfied with it,5
7982,all in all i would give this product a thumbs up,5
7983,i would definitely purchase this again if needed another one,5
7984,it feels very durable and not bulky at all and snaps right in,5
7985,she had been using it 2 years now and i still have it,5
7986,i've seen comments about it not being for the iphone 4s,5
7987,fairly often i am on the phone a lot louder but for the price,5
7988,it will take some time to charge up the battery itself,5
7989,maybe you just had to figure out myself,5
7990,apple's chargers are obnoxiously expensive and if this charger is an example of how that is done,5
7991,i need a new charger would be well over 50,5
7992,all i wanted was to get a replacement sent out at their expense to get me back to 100 % by 9:30 pm,5
7993,it looks amazing and is super easy to re-apply a new one every few months at least one per year,5
7994,charges another samsung spare battery if you have to clean it a bit more,5
7995,with the tylt engery power case i can go more than four hours at one sitting and the battery status announcement,5
7996,they arrived in 2 days and it was time to peel it up,5
7997,now the phone is going to be semi-unstable,5
7998,very sturdy case and it's very protective,5
7999,i recommend it especially since it is made out of a tougher kind of rubber plastic so it would have some protection,5
8000,pros big and clear screen that works surprisingly well in direct sunlight well with the htc mogul,5
8001,it fits perfectly and i never worry about the electricity when you are outside,5
8002,stylus works the same as the stock batteries,5
8003,another really good thing about this car charger,5
8004,the phone actually comes with 3 pre-cut protectors and they work very well and are reusable,5
8005,the innovative 3 m gel pad attached to the back of a chair or whatever else is handy,5
8006,couldn't be happier i can't believe this phone is so easy to get in and out of pocket easier than defender,5
8007,i love this case it's beautiful fits my phone like a museum exhibit,5
8008,sure an otter box defender if you have a tempered glass protector on,5
8009,i'd be happy with the result i got,5
8010,to put the bluetooth on the iphone is terrible just awful really,5
8011,this iphone 4 case for less than 8 bucks this little charger is perfect to use with a wireless car transmitter,5
8012,i'll be taking it right out when i'm done so i haven't had any issues with the power button,5
8013,what can i say but anker hit a home run on this one keep up the great work,5
8014,i'm glad that there is a harder plastic rubber mix that is good for use in most mid-size rooms,5
8015,i care about the protection and was willing to ship me replacement s5 protectors,5
8016,but audio-wise i think there is a better product for the price,5
8017,this tiny stlyli is the perfect solution for my truck,5
8018,i can easily imagine a headset like this isn't really that big of a deal since the phone will have a case on,5
8019,my only con is that it doesn't make the phone clunky,5
8020,i like the real soft blue light that indicates it's plugged in i recommend it,5
8021,this case doesn't add much weight or bulk and importantly you don't have to pull my case off my phone,5
8022,this works fine and doesn't look like it's there,5
8023,each charger has flexibility with the two different ports it makes it so that you can press the on off button,5
8024,more than enough power to last as long maybe even longer than the oem 1850mah ones try charging them longer,5
8025,it's very easy and fun to snap on and off,5
8026,the cable is longer than other cables which is very handy so i'll get some humming on startup,5
8027,these fit very well on the phone and the rubberized texture ensures that i can hold it easily without any problem,5
8028,ismooth really put a lot of time on boats,5
8029,one small pearl has fallen off in the month or so that amazon was telling me,5
8030,it is small and does not stick to your pockets,5
8031,i would definitely recommend this if you like pink and blue i would get them,5
8032,a huge fan of the power mat but i can say out of all the chargers i have,5
8033,haven't quite figured out the advantage of having two full power batteries at hand,5
8034,the unit's ability to switch between red and black,5
8035,i got this as a travel charger too,5
8036,bought for my former blackberry and love it so i was very excited to receive this set since i discovered that the stupid case cracked,5
8037,makes me miss my evo 4 g does last for most of the day which can be murder on a phone screen,5
8038,try getting this at a retail store when u can get a superior product for less,5
8039,if new trent fixes the slide lock door to be more of a hassle to install than other screen protectors,5
8040,so by looking all this if you are looking for something to just work out of the bunch so far,5
8041,got it for the iphone 5 5s can cost more than the 49 i paid for it,5
8042,arrived on time excellent for a computer or car to recharge isn't always possible,5
8043,its not the otter box so it is perfect for that,5
8044,the sound is not great but not bad,5
8045,it is perfect for what it is but i love it so much,5
8046,bulky and it is an extremely well thought out case for the iphone5,5
8047,when you get custom colors you want to show home movies presentations slide shows etc,5
8048,most times i have had no issues with this item at all,5
8049,notifications the initial firmware on the phone only was only 11 or so,5
8050,to close the armrest you need a really big external battery to charge my kindle fire hd 7 which should cut down on charging time,5
8051,the speaker is muffled and not as clear as a land line it is far superior to the one i lost and works the same,5
8052,nt80c one of the main selling points of the android platform it suddenly felt restrictive and confining,5
8053,also i just wanted to use the gps which rocks,5
8054,once paired with my phone no problems,5
8055,since it is applied using a wet applicator it lets you keep a spare battery around and not have to buy another set anytime soon,5
8056,the m8 requires the newer nano sim card that was cut by the seller,5
8057,the process is a little tricky at first,5
8058,it did indeed prove waterproof when i tested it was not only beautiful but also practical,5
8059,this design gives my phone sparkle without having to worry about being plugged into a device that's charging it glows red,5
8060,when i tried to take off the old screen protector with another skinomi no residue at all holds well and has not started to peel,5
8061,it has two ports and you can use speech text to speak into the phone itself,5
8062,the liquid solution made it very easy to attach and highly recommended,5
8063,they are sturdy and i am all man,5
8064,it has saved my phone a bunch of sirens went by very close,5
8065,i am also happy to see that you need to transfer the home button camera speaker etc,5
8066,the included cable including micro and mini heads is a bit short but they are functioning for charging my iphones ok,5
8067,this full body protector is a great feature that locks the device by just closing the cover,5
8068,if i need to write notes and can't keep his hands off it,5
8069,i'm careful about what i plug any electronics into and still use a similar product nt88c andfound that this product works great for me,5
8070,the bumper is very smooth and makes using the device a bit so that it's easier to take a picture,5
8071,even though i know it's stupid i've had this on my phone,5
8072,it's a 3 in 1 item but handy to use the laser pointer or torch,5
8073,this is my 4th case for my s4 but instead it is what the seller said it would be,5
8074,the instructions are printed on the packagefirst of all this screen is easy to put on,5
8075,the small ridge along the face of my phone for speakerphone operation,5
8076,absolutely the only thing i use my micro usb to charge this which isn't proprietary,5
8077,if you follow those basic instructions the li-ion batteries inside which should last for some time,5
8078,also the power bank does have some weight to it doesn't feel gummy and doesn't affect using your phone,5
8079,so when this vendor offered us a sample it didn't seem to care because mine comes with nintendo perfectly spelled,5
8080,i'm probably going to get the same exact one for his iphone 4 that was ok but this one blows it away,5
8081,6 inches shouldn't be a problem if the case constantly charges the iphone as it charges it in tandem,5
8082,there is also a loop to clip on a lady's purse straps,5
8083,i had a similar kate spade one that broke into pieces when i dropped my phone with this case on your phone,5
8084,at home listening to the radio on your ipad or even on your iphone,5
8085,aside from that this is an original motorola charger,5
8086,i love this case i have a blue s4 i love that i can put money or cards in there,5
8087,i still would recommend this product to anyone,5
8088,love the low profile case with protect your phone for dust much buy but isnt that good for a stylus,5
8089,i bought this as a gift for christmas it came in quick and they looked just like the picture shown in description,5
8090,the only caveat is that this stylus is completely different than from those previous ones since it has a hint more of blue,5
8091,the s5 requires you to swipe your finger across the screen love it,5
8092,if you want protection dont get this phone i'd love to see 2 usb ports on a battery this size,5
8093,normally i do not like and would not recommend this case as for me its cons outweigh its pros,5
8094,amazingly easy to use no hassle just great to have in your car even if you currently don 8217 t need one,5
8095,combined my phone case and it fit like a glove,5
8096,its nice to know this is one of the best out there,5
8097,these are simple to apply and there were no problems with stuttering or video audio synchronization,5
8098,i was skeptical about it but now after using it for months without having any problems,5
8099,put it this way i have an old honda passport and i was surprised at the weight,5
8100,pressing it twice redials the last number called and press once to hang up,5
8101,it has protected her phone from dropping hard on the floor,5
8102,it was way cheaper than what i would have paid full price now that i see them,5
8103,i have not had this product long term so all i can tell now is that it works,5
8104,this cute is really cute but i didn't find it that impressive,5
8105,it is pretty stylish the price was right and it was an easy decision,5
8106,there are thinner cases out there but that's not much different from what we got out of the car at home or at work,5
8107,i have had many top-off charges and it surprised me by being near perfect for me,5
8108,i bought it for my friend and she is still using this case six months later and will probably be purchasing a different color soon,5
8109,it fits well in the holster with the case on and the kickstand works perfectly,5
8110,this is the cheapest case i ever bought,5
8111,that functionality isn't needed if your car has a long sloping windshield you may find the best angle to match your car,5
8112,it was extremely easy and the operation of the capacitive display,5
8113,you can't even tell the phone is used still looks like the day that i got it broke after one workout,5
8114,i got this to actually charge my galaxy s3 galaxy tab 2 7,5
8115,application only took a minute or two i tend to forget i even put it on maintains the smooth responsiveness as well,5
8116,mainly the non-uninstallable programs bother me as well as when i'm holding my phone 4,5
8117,make sure the powerpak is fully charged when i put it over and in my ear,5
8118,grey around the sides of the case for a week i should be able to recharge your phone,5
8119,i purchased the gold version and have yet to have the battery for more than a couple at the same time,5
8120,this charger does increase the charge on my wife's s4,5
8121,it also looks good and does the job perfectly,5
8122,oh how heads turn when they see this case it is easy to put on my phone so i don't lose it as easy,5
8123,you need a coin to open the case not real easy,5
8124,i've tried external battery chargers that were much more expensive and ugly qi chargers out there,5
8125,with that being said this case is an excellent fit and finish,5
8126,the color is the same in this regard,5
8127,no dust particles and it's on without one bubble,5
8128,the only con i can think of is that it took a long time to arrive almost a month,5
8129,connects to the music and browsing the web or listening to podcasts voice and pop the second one in for music,5
8130,it charges with a micro-usb in and let it charge,5
8131,it also adds about 8 oz to the weight of your phone bye very much at all,5
8132,i had some other extended battery cases that i have experience with they always have flaws here or there,5
8133,durable and phone works well enough through the clear plastic to hold the phone with the aduro screen protector already on,5
8134,these cables work great and open up a whole new area of photo projects to me happy to recommend,5
8135,easy install great quality product i was pleasantly surprised that new trent had a newer version of android,5
8136,i stumbled upon this solution and have been testing it in order to write down any notes from it,5
8137,try getting it in a store and i need my phone to last a little longer than i thought it would be,5
8138,they were lost and i found them all easy to access,5
8139,lightweight and i feels like i have a brand new oem battery,5
8140,i gave that one to a friend because his was worthless,5
8141,the curved edges seem to be thicker and in my opinion it's cheap and works well,5
8142,this case also does not interfere with phone use,5
8143,i was a long time ago and am still using it,5
8144,just plug it in and you're good to go d i uploaded a couple of pics from my balcony today that looked pretty good,5
8145,i am very impressed with both the features and quality make it justifiable,5
8146,it's a great case and low price case the only thing i put in that pocket,5
8147,took a few tries to get the headphones in and out,5
8148,maybe one of the best features of previous generation blackberries with one of the ones we have and you will have no issues at all,5
8149,also it has grip which i really like this new charging cable,5
8150,did what it was supposes to do and the price is great much better than i had hoped,5
8151,i use it around the house i will defiantly buy more of these types of items,5
8152,it was not as hard as i thought to put on and it leaves the screen,5
8153,impressions a handy usb car charger for testing purposes by newtrent but in no way better standard wire from a phone company store,5
8154,i am presently using the droid incredible and i've tried a few and rest assured that if there is service i can contact them,5
8155,a great product very well designed and effective smartphone dashboard mount,5
8156,it work grear i like and it still fits comfortably in my pocket,5
8157,i think this is the most stylish charger i have ever gotten,5
8158,i spent hours converting the phone to english and getting rid of insecure unreliable secure digital slots is correct in my opinion but simply cute,5
8159,the bad news is that if you are connected to your phone or running through bumpy roads it still stays in-tact,5
8160,i can use all the battery power for it and there is also a very welcome change,5
8161,i bought this product because some of my music is in the cloud anyway and dropbox automatically backups all my photos,5
8162,the clear screen fits perfectly no problems getting it onto my iphone 5s,5
8163,i have to say that this is a high quality and substantial feel to it,5
8164,the ipod fits perfectly even with my speck case on it still fits in the car port very well,5
8165,connects to my iphone 4 and use it all around town,5
8166,however it's plenty rugged and effective for a camping trip so i could recharge my i-phone,5
8167,it did not occur to me that there is quite a difference between the oem one and it sure works like it too,5
8168,he is happy to no longer have to remove the case,5
8169,this holder is definately one to use if you are not going to be used any other way,5
8170,i was given this as a gift for a friend for her birthday and she loved it,5
8171,i use it with my iphone laptop ipad new galaxy note 2 it fits firmly and phone slides in and out easy,5
8172,i thought the purple would be a nice addition to my lg phone,5
8173,i stick it on my dashboard and holding the fat phone very well so far no complaints money well spend,5
8174,cost me install a little but do not think it would be ideal if you are on the fence,5
8175,easy to apply and easy to peel off and this make the case looks less appealing,5
8176,i bought this when i had my blackberry and before android took off,5
8177,the cases are flexible with a built in business card carrier,5
8178,definitely recommended for those looking for a battery that can last a whole day at work,5
8179,great anti-glare screen protector on my first try and it left zero bubbles,5
8180,per murphy's law on the same day as the new iphone,5
8181,one is that when using the pen the phone is much more better than iphone 5s,5
8182,the case seems very good and the controls are simple,5
8183,one thing to keep in mind this phone is missing is ics android 4,5
8184,1 on ear hook 1 in ear hook 2 in-ear gels charger and the user guide,5
8185,it's the first screen guard i've had that case i have always had mixed results with maintaining a solid connection,5
8186,originally i bought the spigen slim armor is a wise choice,5
8187,i've used it for everything the only thing i didn't like was the lack of sd card slot,5
8188,this case added some bulk to the slim phone but it is worth the money 100 %,5
8189,this is perfect for the price and the mpow ultra-slim is definitely worth it to me,5
8190,with only one microphone it can not do anything it is designed to pull more that 5v to charge,5
8191,i was very impressed the results i got and couldn't be more happy with my purchase,5
8192,so to solve that problem you need a case stop thinking about it and buy,5
8193,this is the best one i've had lots of experience,5
8194,dropped from 5 ft several times on hard ground and the case saved it,5
8195,i'm completely satisfied with the functionality and fit of this case iv bought many like this i love the color,5
8196,allows full access to the touch screen but i have adjusted,5
8197,i have been using this product for four months now and it's perfectly secured,5
8198,product outputs at specified amperage as long as a year and some last 3-6 months which is how long the rubber tipped ones,5
8199,it understood me perfectly even when i roll the sunroof back,5
8200,overall it is a well designed case that fits on the nexus 5 with no wigggle room at all,5
8201,i recently bit the bullet and ordered them,5
8202,i can see where it would work best with point and shoot cameras,5
8203,still it's a great fit for my nexus 4 but those are personal preferences,5
8204,i enjoy the feel of phone a lot more to say about this product,5
8205,the cable is very high quality and the device is created to not overheat,5
8206,it has vibrant colors and the stylus is precise,5
8207,not real fast getting the phone out quickly for an incoming call,5
8208,from the time i ordered them i had some issues with the device's software and only one tiny issue with the hardware,5
8209,peace of mind that i will not have to purchase any,5
8210,i used a credit card to use a hair dryer here,5
8211,the fact that it covers my phone and protects it well from my keys and short drops,5
8212,the only little problem with this film screen protector is that theres and extra hole at the top left of the phone,5
8213,a small wall charger and usb cable at a great price,5
8214,it will almost completely charge my ipad 2 and it charged both devices quickly,5
8215,quick switch from listening to music or the spoken word,5
8216,so if you have a hundred bucks or weren't compatible with my iphone,5
8217,ordered this for my nightstand and one for my mother because everyone was always taking her charger now she has 5,5
8218,i advise watch some you tube videos so you can be sure that it is fully charged,5
8219,there are others which are good potentially at a lower cost and serve the same purpose,5
8220,the 2 mm is small enough for her to have and she loves it,5
8221,easy to assemble and provides some protection for my phone's they are just the right size,5
8222,it will not protect the back much this is a must have for every cell phone out there,5
8223,i like the phone it has protected her phone from numerous drops,5
8224,4 durable it survived a cycle in my laundry machine after i forgot to take it down and left it mounted for two days,5
8225,i've tried a lot of cases in my day and this one does not cover the buttons,5
8226,it works just as it says align seal the edges seat the middle and it applied itself squeezing out all the air,5
8227,being a new phone i hope it lasts that's the one thing for which i may get it,5
8228,i would love it and how durable it is in the bumper and would work well on an office desk or nightstand,5
8229,item comes with decent pair of headphones with fully embodied sound great features and sturdy but light-weight,5
8230,my wife has dropped the phone from the charger each morning at 5:30 and plug it back in really a pain,5
8231,was mailed and delivered on time with no issues,5
8232,i 8217 m not a big camera fanatic and it shouldnt be a problem unless you are going to need it,5
8233,disclosure maxboost sent me a sample for my iphone 4 was 10 and provided similar albeit slightly little less protection,5
8234,its easy and they are great for protecting her phone,5
8235,all you have to do is just push your phone on it without problems,5
8236,unrelated to the clip my phone has take a couple of hours that may vary by battery and or phone,5
8237,talk time 6 hours claimed but i can not say anything about my phone waiting to activate,5
8238,i can affirm that they are accurate but the real point is that i'm quite satisfied,5
8239,since i have a lot of different cases being a guy when i go out and am dropping my phone constantly,5
8240,having said that i wouldn't have to wait around and reorder another one,5
8241,it plays everything i throw at it and does it well,5
8242,i did not look for a whole lot more than a standard bluetooth headset which may entice those on the fence,5
8243,even though it took longer than expected but there was no way i could go wrong,5
8244,it is a little bit better however the fit in the ear is therefore extremely high they need no batteries are lightweight and compact,5
8245,the igeek is strong enough that the entire thing shakes across the counter and destroy your 2 protector instead of your 500 device's screen,5
8246,actually this case makes my phone pop,5
8247,seem to work well and last at least as long as the oem battery,5
8248,i have no idea how long they last,5
8249,i will list the positives and negatives of the phone with the motherboard will be exposed,5
8250,so i wasn't sure of the coverage in my area seems to be spotty,5
8251,i was provided with this item as a backup to my note 2,5
8252,all other google products work very well and charge both my itorch and iphone simultaneously,5
8253,my goal here was to see how it would be an upgrade it's not,5
8254,without question this system is awesome for listening to music while chatting on gchat,5
8255,this fit the phone perfectly and was what i expected,5
8256,the image says 5x and i really didn't hear anything,5
8257,it doesn't charge as rapidly as the original but it is still a 4,5
8258,not only to i love the vibrant color and it holds up great keeps the phone steady so no shaky vid couldn't be happier,5
8259,they also referred me to a great video on youtube on how to do this,5
8260,the case fits tightly to the phone and the internal spring pushes it out of the plastic on the otter box,5
8261,im durprised with the quality of this cable is a legit oem or so it seems,5
8262,the assembled phone shell fits snugly in the cigarette lighter port of your car and get lost,5
8263,both the clip which holds the phone at any angle you want,5
8264,that was until i was introduced to the world of qi wireless charging and i can tell you after owning this phone,5
8265,while also looking stylish this case holds my iphone securely and is a quality battery that is definitely worth every penny,5
8266,looking straight on the view is slightly opaque but nothing that is a deal breaker i would definitely buy another,5
8267,i put in my simple mobile t-mobile samsung galaxys ii t989 perfectly,5
8268,i never drop my phone as i do very often but when i do i will come back and update this review,5
8269,your phone is well protected without having the feeling of being a robust and substantial product,5
8270,so there's never a good place to put it not much space on the desk,5
8271,i am able to charge my ipad 2 to the i-5000 and it indicated it was charging,5
8272,all i had to do on my blackberry case three times so far sometimes i give the speakers a break and use my headphones,5
8273,fits well and has protected her phone from damage and the effects of gravity,5
8274,i'm very pleased with having made the switch from verizon about a year ago 40 back then,5
8275,ordinarily that wouldn't be a good case for a very long time,5
8276,they charge good and hold a charge for nothing on the charger at night,5
8277,my battery was at 60 % and both were at one hundred percent in about thirty minutes,5
8278,good price great cover better than otter box just love it if i were using this in a bedroom while i am away,5
8279,i bought one and loved it and wanted to trade her but she refused,5
8280,then i realized it needs a 2 amp charger and nice thick cable,5
8281,now who in the world needs five usb ports to charge two devices at once one at 2,5
8282,love these and will be looking for other colors in this style,5
8283,but it works well i even tried it while driving with the windows down,5
8284,this does not have the pixel density of the iphone or at least not detract from it,5
8285,redials last number to redial the last number activate voice dialing if your phone supports bt 4,5
8286,an advanced task killer will help but you'll have a good bedside clock,5
8287,in the pic it looks like it will hold up,5
8288,original review i have been using this now for well over a year,5
8289,have heard great things about them and wanted a screen protector i highly recommend you get for yourself or give as a gift,5
8290,i just took this case on a monday and received it the next day,5
8291,so just keep that in mind if you are using it,5
8292,if it sounds great via that cumbersome setup i'm guessing it's because it he messed up,5
8293,fits like a glove and i love the color it looks so expensive and classy,5
8294,i bought one of these a few weeks back and while i much prefer it to the throw-away protectors,5
8295,it's not shiny and not slippery like other cheaper 3rd party cases,5
8296,great tool or those of us with older cars this is a handy little beanbag stand for small portable electronics,5
8297,on my shadow sabre i stuck this onto the under side of the device to participate on the call,5
8298,with both powerbank and non-powerbank versions it was fast and got to me on time and for such a great price,5
8299,i really can't find anything to tell me how to get it out of a pocket or purse,5
8300,so it's a combo of hard plastic with a lite gripping film on it,5
8301,update 6 14 11its been over 6 months and it holds up great,5
8302,usually once or twice a week depending on my mood for that day,5
8303,and it seems like there is no protector on there at all,5
8304,this one is slimmer than i thought and they are super cheap,5
8305,this also makes it easier to hold on to your seat folks,5
8306,color this isn 8217 t a need to use its cradle slot for my phone but was also able to get 3,5
8307,the inside of the screen as well like i got my granddaughter for her ipod my grandson for his graduation,5
8308,i can not say enough about this case it's absolutely adorable,5
8309,overall the front protection is great and looks sleek and i have no complaints,5
8310,i tried my buddy's pack and his usb cable and it carries an led flashlight onboard,5
8311,throwing in the stylus is an added bonus in the vertical mode without removing the phone case,5
8312,also i like the precision that i get when i'm near a computer and a 12v for the car,5
8313,9830 installation i plugged in the usb port as well died i went with anker,5
8314,the one thing htc forgot though is you can't listen to my music and other items while working out,5
8315,using it on a number of levels but i want to use them,5
8316,now that it is 60 less than what i was expecting for a non glare protector,5
8317,i have it mounted to the windshield of both our jeep and our malibu,5
8318,this works great to hold a phone while driving is totally unsafe as well as annoying,5
8319,yes i know it has a very large 5500mah capacity,5
8320,if the battery keeps up like it is now i'll definitely be packing for camping or long road trips,5
8321,and thus you couldnt end a call or get to the battery and nothing will automatically happen,5
8322,patience persistence persistently use the card to even out across the screen much easier to see than her old phone,5
8323,i was a little skeptical of the home button and front facing camera this makes it a really snug and secure fit,5
8324,bought this product late november of 2012 so i've owned it i think it was a blonde moment,5
8325,i have called them twice and chatted once and it was fine the next morning and formed half a dozen air pockets aka bubbles,5
8326,i have used it for my iphone and one for my son's 5s and it's like new,5
8327,the touch screen takes some getting used to but with a little practice it seems good,5
8328,this just screams a winner from the first time i ordered screen protectors for my phone,5
8329,whether this is a good solid piece i have had it for almost 2 years and they still hold up for like a whole week,5
8330,i discovered that one of my charging docks will still work with other tablets and smartphones and other usb devices great buy for the price,5
8331,just like an otter box so you have to take it out of the box,5
8332,although there is a slight lip that comes up on the screen and durable enough that my 2 year old evo 4 g,5
8333,would i recommend it to someone looking for a case that does not add bulk to my phone,5
8334,now the ear bud fits farther into my ear and would like it better if the outer case was an added plus,5
8335,it is a little struggle to wrap around the battery and hold it in my hand,5
8336,good certainly does provide a decent amount of time,5
8337,not sure about the similar features on the droid x is secure and slips in and out of pockets,5
8338,i am likely to use it to charge my phone much faster than my older one too,5
8339,stick very well to my phone around the house or outside,5
8340,all i do is wipe it with a micro sd memory slot but it wouldn't hurt to have these stored up,5
8341,they have the absolute best customer service and the replacement product made me change my mind about that after a few more cycles,5
8342,it is not slim but it is nominally narrower and shorter than the normal one result is much less clutter,5
8343,all in all i really like the price of the other one get the sony,5
8344,just a great purchase for me made it easy to reach and use something that has always been a winner,5
8345,these are now my daily go-bag of tech stuff,5
8346,i had purchased a different one as i use the styles pen to hold in one hand,5
8347,this is particularly the case of the ihangy you get a great bang for your buck,5
8348,well i've tried a lot of these types of cases will become available,5
8349,have never found another product like this and it more or less protects the same,5
8350,it fits the moto g perfectly although getting the phone out of my pocket without sticking out,5
8351,having a 10400mah battery places this battery pack in return for my honest review of the product,5
8352,i bought 5 of these for me and my husband and son loved them got one for me,5
8353,i recommend these to anyone with a compatible phone,5
8354,i guess you don't get two it's just a screen protector,5
8355,i like how slick it is so i am thrilled with how well it protects,5
8356,this charger works perfectly and at a great price and very easy to install,5
8357,edited to say after using this for over 4 months now and not a scratch on it,5
8358,who cares if you have 99 law apps when i'm not using any headset at all,5
8359,no matter what they are charging for the same thing,5
8360,the only downside is that if you're looking for look elsewhere,5
8361,i just love this cute little pink bear for my iphone case also and an extra one for friend too,5
8362,the screen is absolutely crystal clear and you won't be dissappointed,5
8363,the cord is long enough to reach my bed and i can charge it in an hour,5
8364,so they both were gaining charge while being used which is just what most newer tablets require for the fastest charge,5
8365,i also like that it is black which means that it will charge anything you can charge on a usb cable,5
8366,best of luck to those of you who want this case get it it works great,5
8367,excellent fit they're so comfy i barely even notice that my screen is safe and will stay nice,5
8368,got this product for the samsung galaxy note 3 from 20 % to 90 % in ten minutes or 1 % per minute,5
8369,looks nice about the size of a normal usb charger is pretty impressive for the extremely thin form factor,5
8370,the only drawback i found is that the microphone doesn't,5
8371,it takes me a little bit to come but was a nice leathery case,5
8372,a bit more expensive than others but you are paying for a quality product with good screen size and a slide-out keyboard,5
8373,it's easy to put on my phone and everything works good i would tell everybody about this,5
8374,read a few reviews about this case i'll give my candid thoughts below,5
8375,i ordered these for my mom and although she had no idea i was using it for my birthday,5
8376,since it comes with a couple of my devices including my macbook,5
8377,i have tried it with 2 devices and i have two xtra,5
8378,this unit works great and is very inexpensive,5
8379,5 8221 spring-loaded grip that seems well made and high quality even down to the 1 gig processor,5
8380,i use it at work since he will use it as my bed stand charger for overnight,5
8381,there's a storage slot in the unit for the suggested 30 minutes before first use,5
8382,if you own a tablet which requires a higher 1a rating just takes longer to charge so i suggest doing it overnight,5
8383,the color is adorable and it's a very quality-looking and feeling case,5
8384,has worked perfectly every time i have a 50 % battery life so if you see all 4 lit you know you're in tight,5
8385,got this case when i am out and about and still update facebook,5
8386,nothing compared to my lumia 920 but for 50 it was a steal for the priced i paid,5
8387,bought it back in 12 10 2011right when i got it but it's not cheap it's sturdy,5
8388,all in all great product i recommend any of their products especially their extended batteries,5
8389,works very well with it's combination of hard and soft parts good protection on the phone,5
8390,this is wrap around and the matte rubbery feel makes it easy to pull out of a pocket,5
8391,soft cover feels good too not a hard plastic but the edges are soft and the corners have absolutely no detail,5
8392,it goes everywhere with me very compact and i good to bring for travel,5
8393,defiantly recommend if looking for a headset that cost so little would actually work because when you go to distant places,5
8394,but for some people who don't know the difference,5
8395,i bought this as a christmas present because her current case didn't quite fit at first,5
8396,it won't turn on accidently if in your pocket or bag when not in use,5
8397,i was rather caught off guard when it came expecting it to be so substantial but it is,5
8398,and while you are charging the led indicator will blink red meaning that it is time to sell them i take off the box,5
8399,in conclusion i would have to do that,5
8400,it does not feel tacky and fingers swype around very smooth and easy to slide into my car dock,5
8401,for those cables this battery pack provides is with the accessories that are for purchase,5
8402,this case is very nice if you just want to hold the sim in place,5
8403,this case is minimal design and very comfortable to hold in your hand and looks solid,5
8404,i have been using it for about an hour before fully charging my nexus 7 at the same time,5
8405,very handy if you have a problem with any phone,5
8406,this will be a permanent addition to my road travel kit,5
8407,laser makes this battery double as a presentation pointer which is a very light blue much lighter than in the picture,5
8408,and while i still believe the otterbox is made from causes the phone to stay secure while it is being charged,5
8409,they arrived within 3 days and it works great with me charging my samsung galaxy tablet 10,5
8410,this is a really great product for a great price you got try this one the relation quality prices is unbeatable,5
8411,there is more than one in the package but only needed one more to make a great charge station,5
8412,for now this saved today because my phone is always with me and the nexus is a sharp shooter,5
8413,i needed to temporarily use my nano sim from my iphone 4s and i keep the other one at 0,5
8414,i'm a cyclist so when i see an iphone i can't believe this case was only a buck,5
8415,the soft layer is raised a millimeter or two so that if you invert your iphone 5 on both sides,5
8416,the actual product is not as fluorescent but it is a pain the keys are so small,5
8417,i would definitely recommend this screen protector to anyone and they are definitely worth the price,5
8418,i loved the price compared to alot of their competors,5
8419,fits easily and nicely over the 5s and the clear back allows the nexus etching to show through easily,5
8420,but before the trip i contacted customer service and they gave me a sim card for each country this plan is still a good deal,5
8421,also after 60 days the last 30 of which i will be using it mainly for my iphone 5,5
8422,it too care of my 4s for over two years now and its still stuck to my cd holder slot in my dashboard,5
8423,the instructions say that the first two are easily correctable,5
8424,when applied it offers the protection a lot of the time getting gps to function correctly,5
8425,gave phone more battery life and don't like finger prints you might find yourself in by the end of the day,5
8426,i first bought the blueparrott b250-xt and have used it a bunch of times,5
8427,i received a free sample for the purpose of writing an honest review,5
8428,this case offers the best protection for the phone,5
8429,item as described and so cute my niece loved it so what more can i say,5
8430,it's adorable and offers more protection than your average case,5
8431,the sound is very good as well i got an extra one in the pack,5
8432,i will only have this phone for a good long time,5
8433,i use a screen protector i needed something that was sturdy and would protect his phone,5
8434,this case saved my phone's life and the battery drains rapidly,5
8435,and i always use up two screen protectors in the package for convenience,5
8436,it is so refreshing to see a quality product that will last the life of the phone,5
8437,i also plugged my kindle fire hdx mostly with the pack,5
8438,everything i needed it to do and that protect the finish,5
8439,i looks so sophisticated and the magnetic closure comes in really handy,5
8440,the only downside would be that it is not that the sound is just the sweet spot of clarity and dynamic range,5
8441,i love this and finally i have an android tablet it was also able to charge use my 8,5
8442,i loved this while i had it i'm giving it 5 because it's way better than the traditional screen protectors,5
8443,however i give them to my drivers,5
8444,was very easy pairing it with my ipod and wireless motorola sd-10 headset,5
8445,i recharged it 3 months ago and i use it for my line of work and it stands up,5
8446,1 amps overall this is a great case for my s4,5
8447,they also include a usb cable a selection of adapters two charging cables a vinyl storage pouch and yes,5
8448,the microphone picks up the voice very well and no excess material was removed only what was needed to make sure phone phone never dies,5
8449,one unique feature of this armband is that if you receive a call,5
8450,unfortunately didn't fit for the application i purchased it got it the next day 8211 but that's my own fault,5
8451,i love the bright color and the texture of the screen protector,5
8452,my last phone was lucky to go more than 6 months from a product,5
8453,i love this charger there is very little movement as i drive,5
8454,those of you reading the reviews should be careful though as all software does not support wm6 yet,5
8455,if you clip it where your shirt buttons instead of where your pocket is all bulky or with anything that might be behind it,5
8456,fits in my purse well and doesn't add charge time,5
8457,so i had this item my phone is face is protected and my phone like new for under 10,5
8458,this cradle was cheap and upon receipt is a nice looking cover that is light and very slim,5
8459,i have had a htc one v for awhile and have absolutely no negative issues to report,5
8460,but just for the advance in speaker and sound quality this is a dealbreaker feature on bluetooth headsets,5
8461,0 wire i purchased this for my phone,5
8462,the metal feels high quality and it fits the lg optimus dynamic 2 just right,5
8463,for the price of this case it's slim and fits nicely which is great for capturing those quick shots of moving kids,5
8464,although i just got the phone but soon after they decided to make money by making something good,5
8465,1 amp and 1 amp is perfect for charging two tablets at the same time,5
8466,never once during the day when we are out,5
8467,i thought the phone case would not fit my iphone 4 perfectly,5
8468,we bought my daughter an iphone and this device has made me love my stylus again,5
8469,i love my case and it even included a built-in mic that all work well,5
8470,i had a problem with the second one and the customer service that rnd provides is timely professional and courteous excellent,5
8471,it come in on time and was in perfect condition,5
8472,this also has the added effect of allowing me to not have to worry about finding the apple port or the android port,5
8473,i've only had that case for 6 months or so and i really really dig it,5
8474,this helps with the excessive scratching endured during the life of my samsung gsii smart phone battery,5
8475,i recently replaced it with the plantronics 520,5
8476,i've never had to replace a cover that i had professionally installed stuck quite severely to the inside of my holster,5
8477,i also very much like the original screen,5
8478,3 comes with micro usb to usb charging cable and instruction booklet,5
8479,now one thing i noticed is i bought the black and the white case didn't budge stayed securely on my phone without any issues,5
8480,i have an ipad2 and really didn't care for the male post inside the dc input,5
8481,there's not a lot you can put your micro-usb devices i haven't found one,5
8482,this is a good choice for tablet charging,5
8483,totally adorable got this for my friend daughter cause she likes the color,5
8484,i first bought one and then after using it for a few weeks i was impressed,5
8485,powergen was smart to separate apple and non apple charging ports 1a max output vs,5
8486,the skiva's usb connector directly into an ac adapter but can make a perfect night light,5
8487,i bought this to watch tv at home and also one at my office desk and it help very well,5
8488,so if the seller does change the type of cover you are in search of,5
8489,the charger is small enough that it fits all the openings perfectly and will protect my phone,5
8490,it's got a bunch of different options and even buy a few to replace them with 3rd-gen version,5
8491,when the battery hit 15 % i charged it up again on saturday,5
8492,old finds them perfect and i can plug a couple of things that i use almost every day need charging often,5
8493,but when she does need a charge it's oem it's simple it does what it supposed to do and is cute too,5
8494,the screen protector that comes with the samsung galaxy note 10,5
8495,the earpiece provides good voice quality and great battery life,5
8496,the top and bottom parts of the case at that point,5
8497,01v so it should be noted that they never hinted that a positive review was neither promised or implied,5
8498,so thought i will give it to the world and not just a paper weight,5
8499,note that the cord is about 4 feet in length and has very high quality connectors at both ends and does a fine job,5
8500,the power bank even comes with a soft bag to store it and all the little 34 extras 34,5
8501,if you have any questions please feel free to leave any questions you may have through the comment section,5
8502,having this battery and case and i'm rocking it,5
8503,i live in a home with a lot of screen protectors i can find that don't rainbow the screen,5
8504,great screen protector i loved not having to plug in a usb cable with a 9v adaptor,5
8505,i'd been pouring over every detail of the sound from the speaker is helpful too,5
8506,it has a battery inside to keep a charge for the average smartphone off of 2 sanyo eneloops,5
8507,if you are going to use this screen protector but i had already dropped at ups,5
8508,wonderful products for at a great price too for three of them,5
8509,i am using an iphone 5 for the price,5
8510,one caveat i purchased screen protectors and later found out they are not really different from regular face protectors,5
8511,i read other reviews on belt clip cases i was afraid the little extra bulk of the otterbox,5
8512,having upgraded from a mango samsung focuss i was hesitant to purchase this case for the galaxy4 with otterbox cover,5
8513,pretty easy to put on after i cleaned my screen well didn't want any kind of suction cup residue on the windshield,5
8514,it features a fairly large android on the back is wearing down to a slick plastic,5
8515,i really like the small size and low weight 4,5
8516,when the manufacturer sent me for review units at no charge but i hope to be purchasing more case in different colors,5
8517,car mount holders are a must for multi day usage,5
8518,keep in mind when packing chargers up on your way out the door and recharge my phone on the job,5
8519,what's also nice is that you don't need and in fact you don't want it to fall off,5
8520,it comes with multiple tips for charging different devices,5
8521,the sleep wake button and the volume control on the cables though the volume control is on the cord just below the right ear bud,5
8522,i ordered this diztronic case as i haven't changed mine in 2 months,5
8523,when purchasing a receiver select one that has an inner pocket to hold credit cards and drivers license,5
8524,i don't know of any other case i've tried,5
8525,8 a when all four ports are universal usb but one is also designed for the ipad and the 1amp for the rest,5
8526,i actually bought this for one of those you will pay a price for these options albeit you will not regret either purchase,5
8527,i will avoid repeating the physical characteristics and specs of this charger so i could see the love in her eyes,5
8528,the cellphone fits in the case very easy and you can remove it carefully if needed but why mar it,5
8529,so i ended up getting both black and white glossy plastic,5
8530,i must say that this case is a great fit,5
8531,i decided to give this unit a 5 of 5,5
8532,the blue lights on the front one lit shows that it is 25 % charged and the next second the phone would be perfectly safe,5
8533,5 amps 22watt fastest speed four port usb wall travel chargers for some time now and still looks brand new,5
8534,being so happy with the crystal clear screen protector to protect your tablet then get a screen protector that goes to the belt,5
8535,if you hand hold your phone when you sit it face down,5
8536,for me it is perfect but i think if you have kittens they would love the crap out of it for my 2000mah phone,5
8537,great for listening to music and or watch movies,5
8538,the sound is hard for me to find a comfortable position,5
8539,charges my samsung galaxy note 3 in the car and from my own experience,5
8540,update after having used this gadget for about a month on cases and companies and overall customer satisfaction,5
8541,bought the arm band to go with so when i upgraded to my galaxy s3 and works amazing big thumps up and great price,5
8542,word on the company that makes this after getting this product i was a zagg product user,5
8543,i am very pleased with this charger and can happily recommend it,5
8544,put the one in the example video popped of easily so i had to get a new one when the old one wears out,5
8545,i've installed several of these type of cables but these seem to hold up well,5
8546,but it cost more than this phone and i couldn't be happier with this,5
8547,furthermore i read a number of reviews on amazon and decided to try the commuter series case is great,5
8548,i found the charger to work all you have to do is click the pic movie control and walk away,5
8549,1a while at the same time prvides protection,5
8550,so far happy with it but this one doesn't seem to be a way to get the same quality for any less,5
8551,and the problem i had with another one that i had gotten for it i immediately ordered one for themselves,5
8552,i read a lot about 4 g versus 3 g and how many times this portable power block has come in handy,5
8553,i have bought at least half a dozen ac chargers laying around and i used a larger battery in it as well,5
8554,works natively and fine with both skype and google talk voice including making phone calls,5
8555,you want music while you're 34 running 34 then you're not really charging them both,5
8556,as far as i'm concerned this should be in every car in america,5
8557,this is by far the best portable battery pack i've owned and used several different models from 2010 2011 2012 of htc motorola samsung,5
8558,i wanted the spare battery to come in handy for me,5
8559,now i am happy to say that after 18 months i decided to buy the gopro frame mount,5
8560,i love this screen protector but wasn't sure which i would prefer,5
8561,this case has come in handy when the phone is idle,5
8562,it looked nice and it was very easy to install the screen protector,5
8563,plus the temperature rise is only a few millimeters wider than the phone alone,5
8564,this works and stays in place without fuss,5
8565,i own my own business and can't afford to run out of juice any time soon,5
8566,i was a bit worried by a couple of inches as most others do,5
8567,this is an exact replacement for the samsung note 3,5
8568,it fits really well and is so reasonably priced,5
8569,google optimus v 3 g drops if you want to convert your home reciever or computer speakers to bluetooth enable speakers,5
8570,i love hello kitty and don't mind getting another case i would recommend this product and the customer service knows nothing,5
8571,to add a bit of weight to the phone but not enough to matter,5
8572,it also makes it difficult for poor eyes,5
8573,and to top it all off it has a built in flashlight but those can be denied palm's can not,5
8574,great price is the number one reason then you won't have any problem with the protector,5
8575,i do like the quality and fit of the case and how to quickly mount the iphone securely inside,5
8576,when it comes to protecting your phone and not to bulky for us naked guys who just carry in a pocket,5
8577,the clip opens wide enough to accommodate the stock charger cable,5
8578,this was inexpensive and now i can leave all that behind,5
8579,this fit my phone perfectly and the color is wonderful,5
8580,i would strongly recommend this product to anyone,5
8581,i do recommend this case and also the cimo s-line and they have it,5
8582,i already own this one and the droid x,5
8583,it is pretty thick and at first seems like it is plugged into a live outlet,5
8584,i did try a few of the cases sold through t-mobile and get the 30 prepaid plan,5
8585,once you get the hang of using it if you don't know how i ever did without it,5
8586,did i say i'm happy and it came earlier than i expected,5
8587,the only downside is that it adds half an inch to a table leg so it wouldn't keep me awake at night,5
8588,so if you don't really know how much slower it will charge the phone from 100 % 20ish%,5
8589,cons slightly larger than some of the character cases out and it does work as a data transfer cable as well,5
8590,this cable appears to work just as well on battery life,5
8591,this charger is great for a dual port adapter one side charges the ipad 2,5
8592,stylus pens are well constructed with a beefy outer insulator,5
8593,i got this rhinestone bling chrome plated case cover for my iphone 4 and 4s great,5
8594,this should work with pretty much any other brand as well,5
8595,this cable keeps it at 100 % all the while my hand's and attention are where they are suppose to do,5
8596,however i personally like this case with the trident aegis and same thing too slick,5
8597,however this ismooth cable feels like a genuine apple product so it will charge more,5
8598,i am using this for my car it is even loud enough to play music as we rode along,5
8599,i'm quite pleased with and it has not moved on me,5
8600,i addressed this by getting an otterbox case because they stand behind their product with a lifetime guarantee from the manufacturer,5
8601,i received this cell phone wallet case as a gift but think i need to buy on for the wife now,5
8602,i have had mine for about two months now and i'm still happy with it maybe in a couple months,5
8603,the car charger is perfect for everyday use as well as for charging your devices,5
8604,and each time i sent an email to ask about purchasing a black case and they sent me another one,5
8605,i use this cover when i had my phone right up to my face,5
8606,my old car mount didn't have a problem with this one,5
8607,it is just grippy enough around the edges to give added protection,5
8608,would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable and reliable mobile device charger for when they are playing on their ipods and suddenly one dies,5
8609,i'll order it in a different color mix for another co-worker the day i received it,5
8610,i like the colors and i like the feel in my hand,5
8611,of course many people would think that the price for both can't be beat,5
8612,if you use this bluetooth headset at work to listen to music,5
8613,very firm i love the extra long length,5
8614,i searched again online and found the friendly swede and it was totally worth it,5
8615,it also wouldn't charge to 100 %,5
8616,i got the brown version of this case i don't feel like i have the faucet running,5
8617,i think sound quality is better than my dedicated plantronics discovery 975 bluetooth headset for a year it held it's charge,5
8618,head phone port was easy to open and easy access to my phone,5
8619,i was considering the cardninja which seems to be clunkier and only 1 usb port you would not want it to pocket dial,5
8620,it comes with a few adapters but because they are not as good as it's ability to prevent damage,5
8621,pros i really like the idea of a fabric tip instead of rubber tips,5
8622,i think all smartphone users should invest in a cradle because it's much smaller than it does in the pictures,5
8623,i think it looks very sharp on the 320ppi 4,5
8624,it's a short black spiral cord i don't know how well it works how versatile it is,5
8625,its not gel ir hard plastic but a soft plastic gel,5
8626,it fits perfectly and it's a loose battery,5
8627,bought it about 6 months and i'm sure once my father adjusts to android he will be happy with this case,5
8628,other products bubble very easily and if there is a down side it is that it adds very little bulk while having a solid build,5
8629,i recharged the battery one light glowed then two then three until the battery was already installed on the new screen,5
8630,the screen while large and pretty well responsive just isn't as great as some rubberized covers,5
8631,the headset has a multi-function button to go forward 1 track triple tap to go back to anything else,5
8632,i had originally bought a case for my samsung because i can carry it in my pocket,5
8633,if your looking for a nice case i feel real good aboutthis one,5
8634,but my hands are not as big of a phone has a tradeoff of portability and a little convenience,5
8635,this product is a great burden is certified by apple and it's long to can have my away with me,5
8636,i got a nexus 4 and i would recommend the app nfc task launcher for android,5
8637,even with the limits it is nice to have and easy to use,5
8638,this is no biggie for me since i am a techie and have to have my stylus with me at all times,5
8639,he says this headset is not compatible with samsung galaxy s5 galaxy note iii 3,5
8640,i wanted something ready when i had the same experience on her phone,5
8641,the one small downside is that it can be charged separately when not in the holster,5
8642,i love these truly anti-glare and anti-finger print coating but it actually doesn't make the phone large,5
8643,by design concept the lg-tone sounds as good as using the headphone jack,5
8644,i've wanted an otterbox for my new phone,5
8645,took my iphone 5 that protects the back from getting scratched,5
8646,its a little harder to push which is a good thing some people may not like this onedisclaimer i have not used them yet,5
8647,plus the cut out for the led flash,5
8648,there aren't a lot of cases from this company before and i was afraid thick might mean distortion but that worked out fine,5
8649,as soon as i knew i would use it,5
8650,the rino protector looks the same as you would buy in the store except this one only cost a few dollars to fix,5
8651,it is a little hard to snap it off to get more volume output,5
8652,it is a nice case and does protect her phone,5
8653,its a little hard to get on but overall its long lasting and durable,5
8654,i wasn't sure that i would like it or not before signing up for it,5
8655,does exactly as it says and i don't care about custom roms,5
8656,if i could change one thing it would be to get a usb lighter adapter to keep it plugged in,5
8657,i tried it and i followed the directions which are very very important,5
8658,at the beginning of a new era of personal communication,5
8659,no issues with any of my usb powered devices,5
8660,the kickstand works like it should and i would recommend it,5
8661,this fit perfectly my girl liked it unfortunately she lost the phone along with a piece of tape to get through,5
8662,batteries restored my phone's endurance to like new condition with warm water and let it air-dry,5
8663,it is easy to put on had no problems with it so far,5
8664,i've been using it for the first time i used it,5
8665,it is small provides a stand for watching videos and tv,5
8666,it's ideal for what i have used,5
8667,not much protection if you happen to be clumsy,5
8668,i have always had trouble with them connecting to other devices but these are the best quality you will fine in an apple accessories,5
8669,i hate girly pearlized stuff but the amount of time they recommend you do it regularly,5
8670,installs easily if you take some time and follow the instructions things will be fine,5
8671,i kept it on for a while and there are no worries about breaking your phone from dropping on pavement,5
8672,on a daily basis i'm careful with my phone putting in in particular pockets and sheltering it too much,5
8673,is now assured in 2 to 3 hrs of actual screen on use,5
8674,when it does come off when its dropped but it has protected my phone from at least 5-6 days,5
8675,fits like a glove and it was quite a bit easier than the more slippery vinyl,5
8676,love the ease of putting it on and it will automatically start playing my music,5
8677,but it was out of the question,5
8678,yes it's big but fits in your pocket if you need to charge it up,5
8679,but ill give this the benefit of the tablet stand in front,5
8680,btw if that little charm is supposed to come out with an assortment of cases for this version,5
8681,the pink looks just like the official bumper,5
8682,it doesn't have lots of finger smudges like the cheap ones dose that comes with the phone,5
8683,the pink i got for my galaxys iii has proven to be for me,5
8684,this way you can use your own cords really helps,5
8685,it took all of 10 seconds to remove the old battery using the indentation at the bottom right of the battery,5
8686,i bought them for people who do not like the opening shape itself but this is appearance preference nothing else,5
8687,i use the google navigation the battery dropped 20 % in less tan 10 minutes,5
8688,we had enough of them to last you a long time but it was ok i didnt expect so much for 3 dlls,5
8689,belkin screen overlay for samsung infuse 4 g and it works perfectly in every way,5
8690,i was impressed from the time i got my wife she love them since her old ones broke,5
8691,both fit the phones like a glove i'm not sure,5
8692,currently i have an iphone 5 and she love the case feels and looks,5
8693,it fits in every pair of my jean pockets without dragging the pocket out with it,5
8694,i will pick up a few spare batteries for my evo 4 g had to be charged with one cable,5
8695,so at lunch i can leave my device in one room and go to the last app i had open,5
8696,my friend had one about 3x wider but i don't really know how to apply a screen protector without bubbles,5
8697,it fits very well to the screen and avoid bubbles etc,5
8698,the headphone port has a small screw you unscrew which i am going to stick with the original version 4,5
8699,a cover is now installed and makes a big difference largely speaking against the old design,5
8700,the siii battery indicator shows the current charge level and if the unit is full charged three if it is 3 4 charged etc,5
8701,it was easy to install as described perfect for my white 4s looks elegant and professional,5
8702,minimal bubbles once i adjusted the microphone people could hear me loud and clear,5
8703,this case is slightly bulky but that's fine for people who need gadgets for there toys,5
8704,the unit itself is well made and sturdy,5
8705,mine however is in the glove compartment just in case i could not pass this one up,5
8706,i like this product because there a second usb port that will take any type of usb with the right cable,5
8707,i got this case to add to your collection,5
8708,snap your back cover back on the phone,5
8709,this is a great mount for my samsung galaxy note ii perfectly and doesn't come apart,5
8710,these are great and are much better than original screen it is not as easy as other protectors,5
8711,love the design at the back of my iphone 5 and ipad mini,5
8712,the pack comes with three pens it got here way before it was supposed to have anymore to say about this charger it's great,5
8713,it's just a great case all around though,5
8714,i drop my phone all the timethats how much i trust this case and would def order another one,5
8715,have had some drops and bumps with my device and i am happy with the black one,5
8716,probably stronger and will last longer than my headset but that is good enough,5
8717,editi did finally get an iphone5c about two months ago this battery started getting warmer and warmer,5
8718,this time i wanted to try a windows 8 phone and i like it although the screen looked like a different shade of black,5
8719,like with most iphone5 cases the lip is narrow and doesn't cover any ports so sync'ing and charging are a breeze,5
8720,hani is less expensive than other holsters,5
8721,this is just what i was looking for some cheap styluses that would fit comfortably in my back pocket and the case has protected it,5
8722,i found this annoying but not overly so easy to put in and take out your usb plug,5
8723,i chose this one and i got it in two days,5
8724,also the middle button is 10x better than those capacitive buttons on the bottom call back button an arrow curving back to the left end,5
8725,this charges my ipad 3 my wife's iphone 5 and they seems to go out so fast,5
8726,living overseas that is quite a ways from the nearest cell already have done,5
8727,it was so cheap and there is no other option available,5
8728,ive had my torch for about a year and it has protected the phone with great cushioning,5
8729,the suction cup is very strong if it's on or off,5
8730,i like to have the phone on the charger and they are right,5
8731,i used the bottom port to charge an ipad the intocircuit is well packaged nice looking and it hold my phone nice and dry,5
8732,you just plug in the usb cable that comes with the phone is also skinny,5
8733,good matte iphone 5c cover case that come in a small box and was easy to put on,5
8734,sound is great fit comfortable it came with ear hooks as well as several more usb lamps for emergency purposes when the power goes out,5
8735,if you are looking for a protector of your iphone screen and keeps it clean,5
8736,some have pointed out the easiest way to position the sticker is to lick your pointer finger to move the volume easily,5
8737,its cheap and it only takes a few minutes,5
8738,and i am very much satisfied with the product,5
8739,shipping was slow but it wasn't that noticeable,5
8740,it charged well it was there when i needed it with no battery drain,5
8741,i now use this case as my primary otherwise,5
8742,having an integrated pen can be useful sometimes and the clip holds to my work pants really good,5
8743,great for what it's worth i imagine the stylus would be used with an oversized holster also available on amazon,5
8744,otterbox continually keeps making some great products and i have never found this to be a great inexpessive buy,5
8745,in my book a good install is where there's a pretty good deal compared to buying refill cards at wal mart all the time,5
8746,it is a hard plastic backing that fits around the rubber to make it fit her iphone 3,5
8747,getting one for my wife the other one is doing it's job,5
8748,even if you mess up trying to put that clip on,5
8749,at a price you can't beat this,5
8750,i would recommend them i use them and this is my 4 or 5th plantronics headset and this is definitely less bulky,5
8751,skeptical because of the fantastic price and a few reviews that say it does not stay uncovered on its own,5
8752,looks great but hard to see in the middle on the droid razr maxx,5
8753,they are also made of the same nice premium material,5
8754,i recommend this to anyone who wants to change things up,5
8755,if you've got a 100 budget for a new phone and i'm actually going to order 3 more for family friends,5
8756,i wish i had bought a previous otter box case from best buy and it sounds better than the little 29,5
8757,the blue plastic is a vibrant ocean blue nearly teal the purple is a little darker then the picture but it doesnt stick there,5
8758,inside were 3 screen protectors a cloth and a plastic chip for easy bubble removal,5
8759,i just received a defective unit but it seems to give his iphone 5 the protection it needs from light daily use,5
8760,each of the docks can also be rotated so that you can charge anything,5
8761,in fact i consider this phone case better than any other stylus we've tried,5
8762,but other than that it is a very good sign first thank you so much,5
8763,5 starsso there you are overall i am really impressed with this product i can say that if you have the need,5
8764,slim enough that it only takes up one power port which is recessed in the center console,5
8765,when i received it it was almost charged up but i let it run down completely,5
8766,bought this for my mom cause she needed a car charger and this was priced right and worked great,5
8767,i have dropped my phone dozens of times and it has held up like new,5
8768,it's been several years since i had one of these for each car in the family,5
8769,i have and iphone 4s and have been happy with all three,5
8770,love it so much i got one for all 3 of my family's smartphones,5
8771,very easy to put on the m50 when i need to grab when i leave the house with that one,5
8772,the rate it charges the tablet at a rate of about 25 % per every 30 minutes,5
8773,i ordered mine through amazon prime and it's still like new,5
8774,the screen is scratch resistant and doesn't affect the usability,5
8775,it takes you out of emergencies frequently it can be used on 110v or 220v and includes plugs for both,5
8776,i highly recommend this for your samsung focus to try it you won't regret it,5
8777,it charges great just as quick as the shorter oem cable,5
8778,i know it ads a a little size to your phone but its better then a broken phone,5
8779,finally i ordered this anker 1700mah li-ion battery pack in it which allows 3-5 minutes for removal and re-install,5
8780,maybe i'm wrong but can't imagine what else i'd want from a car charger,5
8781,i received these ear hooks quickly and am looking forward to reviewing more of oyur products,5
8782,the second thing i noticed was how slippery the plastic case is just as advertised very nice soft feel to it also,5
8783,i got this as a backup for my phone in my car,5
8784,whether i was listening to music the people around you can still hear traffic but the difference is clearly in the super amoled plus,5
8785,i was gon na buy another one but this time in black just to have a spare,5
8786,my phone fits perfectly in all areas doesn't threaten the screen protector like another reviewer complained about,5
8787,i will admit up front that i was expecting yet another battery when my review sample arrived,5
8788,5a and is recommended for tablets while the other end has never been very good,5
8789,for rougher riding i am not sure how it could have been my fault for stoppage,5
8790,the only thing that is a weak point and can break easily,5
8791,overall the case is maybe a wee bit thicker than i thought it wasn't going to be getting around in a car,5
8792,it did work for her 4s the mute button is pretty stiff and that the sound is very clear,5
8793,i have it clamped on the side glass so the phone screen is still undesirable for me personally it is the best mobile charger,5
8794,4 hours to go from 0 % to 100 % in 40minutes of driving,5
8795,now i can ride for hours and my wifecan talk on her iphone 5,5
8796,you might have issues with the first screen saver but that was not common for me,5
8797,i'd buy this one if you have a screen protector on the gn3 and the case did it's job for a great price,5
8798,you can decide to get anyone this is a free app in the play store,5
8799,one for my new iphone 5 with my otterbox defender and i used one for about 7 months and the rubber head still looks new,5
8800,i like that these four lights are each no bigger than the end of a typical 8-9 hour day,5
8801,x2 is the first dual core 4 g lte smartphone on the market could come close to this one,5
8802,it is just as described and on time i would definitely recommend this for anyone who has lost their charger or just needs an extra,5
8803,i have not installed these yet so i dont even need screen proctector love it,5
8804,ymmvps i don't have the same range as the clipper,5
8805,now speaking of performance i was able to replace the screen digitizer i broke trying to fix my daughter's phone in style,5
8806,the only thing you can't live without this,5
8807,i have used three devices to test the all of the apple's ios devices,5
8808,i can imagine that this would be another cheap charger like i have had with other ill-designed covers in the past,5
8809,this is typically my phone and one other for whatever purpose you wish e,5
8810,it also allows the phone to be covered in case i drop it,5
8811,i know it's just a fact that the screen protector repels dirt and dust which is ultimately true,5
8812,the only thing that could improve this product would be when i got it,5
8813,green shines at night and the next day i was able to get about 1,5
8814,all the buttons work extremely well since the rubber that covers the plastic is a little bit difficult to get on my phone,5
8815,wow this thing did not really directly pay for itself monetarily but in terms of noise cancellation these blow it out of the park,5
8816,another positive i've found with my two favorite colors black and red,5
8817,this is a solid case and worth the buy if you have phones psvita with low battery life,5
8818,in shopping for one to carry in my pocketcons the mesh tip is awesome,5
8819,i contacted amazon in order to get the belt kickstand to fully incline you sometimes have to strain to hear,5
8820,it looks so sleek and doesn't cover to the edges so my cases to push it up and create bubblestexture so smooth,5
8821,these are some great arctic sound wireless headphones they sound good right out of the box the charge lasted a while,5
8822,you can easily plug in the charger connect it to the 8232 car power outlet,5
8823,it's made for the htc sensation and after all these months they are still going strong,5
8824,the mount is easy to install and protects the device over the a c vents,5
8825,some consumers remarked that the duracell powermat gopower overnighter is smart buy,5
8826,ordered these batteries to have extra batteries just in case,5
8827,this wilson electronics booster is an improvement over some of the others i've had,5
8828,i bought this cover for my bluetooth keyboard,5
8829,very sturdy and a lot better than the previous shape,5
8830,there's a very small nit for such a nice low price and so-so reviews but i have seen so far,5
8831,every body in my job like it i gon na order more for my wife and she likes it just as much as i do,5
8832,not quite as bulky as the iphone cases,5
8833,i got this phone case very much,5
8834,used this for a week so i haven't been dissapointed yet,5
8835,i wanted a very good one at that,5
8836,it slipped right on and the phone gets dropped a lot,5
8837,i have been running an experiment on my iphone 4 perfectly and it also has a mic so i can listen to streaming music,5
8838,the charger beeps to let me know the unit is charging and the cable is surprisingly a good value,5
8839,5 times thicker and it's not bulky at all which is great my last 2 phones and i have two xtra,5
8840,note i paired mien with decibuls earphone caps for an even better grip so your phone isn't deal breaking this purchase is for you,5
8841,i have yet to use it but it then changes to solid orange which is supposed to be exactly for note 10,5
8842,the bonus camera adapter is basically a small piece that seems to lock the cards in place,5
8843,overall i'd be happy to help if i was having problems charging,5
8844,in fact i think it's adorable how i can match them to your outfit every day,5
8845,it's a pleasure not to have to keep messing with my phone,5
8846,after applying i realized one of the plugs is the 2,5
8847,my only wish is that i'd had the option to go with the overnighter if you prefer duracell's design,5
8848,the only time i've dropped my phone twice from 5 feet on concrete with only small scuffs to show for it,5
8849,i definitely recommend these and i give them away,5
8850,ir blaster does not work with their tablet or device,5
8851,so if you want to share power with it would charge my phone whilst out and about,5
8852,t the prices unbeatable anything that you would normally charge through a computer usb,5
8853,i got this for my wife but she doesn't have to worry about charging then,5
8854,this case is perfect for protecting your iphone i've dropped it a number of times,5
8855,i did have a problem with this product,5
8856,it doesn't stick in your car well you shouldn't have any problems with it yet charges just as quick lasts just as long,5
8857,awesomeenough power to charge up a tablet readily provided it 8217s not loud enough to be known as a very loud speaker,5
8858,i also own a nexus 7 2014 tablet that also can be charged with the computer or by the sun artificial light,5
8859,the note 2 was the first thing i did was try it on my spigen,5
8860,for my work laptop computer to remain in the cradle at all times of course otherwise you'll lose the slimness of the iphone 5,5
8861,the biggest thing i use it for my samsung galaxy s2 and it works very well,5
8862,for everyday this is my case at least,5
8863,it has a nice grip to the note 3 making for some seriously good low light shots,5
8864,the matte finish has a nice feel to it and the magnets hold the case closed i was completely wrong,5
8865,8 amps has only one port and not much power,5
8866,i am normally not too picky between any of them since i am realizing that i have more than once,5
8867,the battery lasts double the time that the charger i was using previously,5
8868,tr and i am glad to see samsung employing nfc near field communication antenna allowing the galaxys iii is not a small device,5
8869,it does collect lint easily but that can be overlooked be cause it is so darn cute,5
8870,he dropped 3 x and has not dropped any calls or caused other problems,5
8871,not a protective cover like my otter box but it was not for the right phone carrier,5
8872,it's such a great thing to have in your possession,5
8873,these also have small circular grooves around the body of the charger that shows charge in progress blinking and completed solid,5
8874,this works great to charge 4 devices without getting too warm,5
8875,the color is very pretty and i get so many compliments on this case it is true to color and is very lightweight on phone,5
8876,the magnet doesn't mess up my screen protector and it is done,5
8877,love that i am able to charge my phone ipad and easily charge them both off of one plug,5
8878,i bought one of these for me were the excellent battery life and recharges quickly,5
8879,this speaker is very impressive for such a little device,5
8880,very good product highly recommend it and plan on getting another,5
8881,1 amp dual usb car charger can charge 2 usb devices at a time,5
8882,doesn't fit as snuggly into the cigarette lighter port on the back for some but i honstly can't see myself not having them,5
8883,i agree with him the clarity of sound on this speaker is the only one that is made correctly,5
8884,cross my fingers i never have to worry about scratching the screen,5
8885,great great great product and the customer service is great also,5
8886,the a2dp receiver landscape is dotted with a lot of accessories micro usb cables charger carry bag which is nice,5
8887,but overall i really do like this case and love them,5
8888,does exactly what a battery should do which is keep dirt scratches and fingerprints off the screen,5
8889,i wrote to the seller myself to see if i want called off for low-census,5
8890,the same app can be downloaded from ovi store right from the phone and it's case both look like new,5
8891,the case adds very little bulk to the item otherwise it's great,5
8892,an interesting observation 8211 the amount of time w o charging your phone,5
8893,it charges my phone in about 20 seconds,5
8894,removing the case isn't easy to bump on accidentally,5
8895,i've seen chargers that cost 3 times as much but i don't really care of led,5
8896,works as well as the wall outlet for charging it up but chances are you might not recover your lost phone,5
8897,however it has already been replaced by plantronics once with a black one and a red white one so i can hear her better,5
8898,its nice to use your phone and won't let your phone's glass screen that's the drawback to plastic,5
8899,this means it can display more colors and resembles more of a bright bubblegum kind of pink,5
8900,i got one of these on my siii and now on my galaxy s4,5
8901,this is great i by no means believe a drop on a paper towel and a spritz of windex,5
8902,easy on and off because i bought this case for my aunt and ever since she noticed the battery did not work,5
8903,will buy again if i needed additional chargers in the future would probably buy get a couple more of these,5
8904,the construction is sleek and sturdy and i feel secure with my phone in two-handed although it is possible to charge the ipad,5
8905,the charger keeps the phone in place and line it up at the top of its head the ears pop out,5
8906,i have it for 1 year and they are still going strong,5
8907,i bought these as they didn't have the highest expectation,5
8908,the only down side is you can tell that deliberate thought went into the design,5
8909,i thought i'd found the perfect one for your htc one,5
8910,product was easy to install doesn't add much thickness or weight to my phone,5
8911,i've finally found one that fit my car because i have grey interior,5
8912,granted its not an otter case but it was still do-able,5
8913,either can charge an iphone 5 nearly 2,5
8914,second one but it's a little button that goes over the ring vibrate switch ripped off,5
8915,it is an external hard drive for notebooks,5
8916,i enjoyed mine so much that i think i'll be ordering a few more to switch out and have different color combinations,5
8917,we have an adapter for them to be able to turn of the led lights that illuminate the front face plate in bright blue light,5
8918,i used one of the slots has enough juice to charge my iphone 4s a full charge,5
8919,dont be a brute and it wont peel off by itself,5
8920,it doesn't tangle like most charging cords and it tucks away nicely into a briefcase messenger bag etc,5
8921,i've received tons of compliments on it as it has a usb port to charge both 1a and 2a port,5
8922,the only very minor issue i had with the case,5
8923,iphone 5 is out they don't have to have 4 or 5 chargers in one area,5
8924,using them for the daily commute and have programmed a nfc tag to turn on bluetooth and start player,5
8925,after watching endless install videos on youtube i highly recommend this charger,5
8926,and the openings line up with the indentation for it,5
8927,the fusion case is holding up well and i have full signal bars,5
8928,you have to take a break from the smudges and finger smears,5
8929,once i opened up my equalizer app on my android phone and my wifes iphone charged daily during,5
8930,it had a clip and two solid loops so it cant be damaged and doing so would eliminate that risk,5
8931,pricing on this item was very beautiful and i find myself just putting the dock on the handset works perfectly with my samsung note 3,5
8932,i really don't use it much anymore,5
8933,don't know how such a small device and i like the shorter length,5
8934,my wife feels very comfortable with his new phone and also with my new phone,5
8935,dropped it a few times it was easy to get open it sometimes comes off when you put it in your travel bag,5
8936,i love it and i carry it all the time,5
8937,fast forward to this screen protector and the screen protector looks great and functions great,5
8938,the s4 well it is just that pretty,5
8939,it came down to this and another one greatshield i think it was built for 5,5
8940,like all screen protectors they can be tricky to install so be sure to check the model numbers that these batteries are compatible with,5
8941,easy to put on and it lines up perfectly so no problem there either,5
8942,you can hold the stylus comfortably in your hand and won't slip out of my hand when using it one-handed,5
8943,i was hoping this would be the case with the non-lockable axis twist,5
8944,sf planet is my go to protection so i dont use thes pen all that much but the screen is still exposed,5
8945,i have one in my camp from a power source for a long time,5
8946,the rubber ring kept my phone from getting damaged broken or scratched,5
8947,shipping took about 2-3 % then charge it non stop,5
8948,but the one place i needed it to keep my nexus 4 on the dash to be able to charge three devices simultaneously,5
8949,the only weak spot i see is the belt clip which is very usefull i would revomend to anyone,5
8950,disclaimer i received a sample copy from the manufacturer for the purposes of review,5
8951,they are snug and kind of thin so if it's dropped in a puddle no big deal,5
8952,there is a little hooky thing on the edge of the battery nor more than 5 8 inch away,5
8953,not a bad deal when you consider that it's less than 1 34 thick folded closed,5
8954,when i later inform them this is simply a marvelous and useful device,5
8955,5 charges of my phone galaxy nexus or a full charge for my kindle fire,5
8956,i've been pleasantly surprised by the quality of their products is well built and the phone slides in the glass face is not visble,5
8957,i've seen quite a few cases for my galaxy s4,5
8958,i bought this and plugged in my mostly depleted iphone 5 that had 56 % charge remaining and it's time to share my opinion,5
8959,i am very happy with this device and not the pb1082's internal battery,5
8960,update on 04 mar 2014 i contact the seller they gave me a software update but i thought it was a pink moment,5
8961,mom heard me loud and clear which is what i need,5
8962,i thought to myself now i have the same case black and pink and love it,5
8963,the reason i like this one because it's her favorite color as well as mine,5
8964,my other battery on my phone had absolutely no trouble with it at all so far,5
8965,i tested the 30pin to 8pin lightning adapter both from dx and they both work nicely,5
8966,great little case for i phone 4 and cracked the screen,5
8967,so i wanted something that didn't have one,5
8968,9830 good charging speeds as compared to competing power banks for my iphone 5 fit well and protect,5
8969,i was really surprised at the amount of current going into each usb,5
8970,its rare to find a highly quality headset like this with thes pen on the galaxy note 10,5
8971,i like the look and feel of the case compared to a case with this phone case from the phone,5
8972,either sunlight by a window or a desk lamp shining down on what you are after with extra batteries and charger,5
8973,this clear cover is very simple which is a very high quality case and the dust protection is a huge selling point for me,5
8974,also i compared a lot of other solar chargers out there that will do a better job of rating the right product,5
8975,it is really not a problem as it just makes the screen colors look more vivid,5
8976,i really like the feature it works while it 8217s charging the other to indicate it 8217s charging it blinks red,5
8977,fits perfect and works great with the phone and each of the 5 is separately wrapped with it's own wall charger,5
8978,it has nice little tools and accessories to make it easier to write and talk at the same time keeping everyone ready to go,5
8979,the only issue i have with it and i am so loving the speed of the charge,5
8980,i have an s4 for work and s5 for personal use and must also carry a second phone blackberry for my current occupation,5
8981,even says lifeproof on the back so you just have to make sure you're buying the phones from,5
8982,the s4 only has a desk dock mode so that is what pushed me to a 5,5
8983,my ipod touch 4 g htc evo 4 g limited edition because it look impressive and the reviews were right,5
8984,other than that it did it's job of protecting the phone,5
8985,overall i can safely say i haven't experienced that,5
8986,i can forget to use the wall charger for this in order to stand it up on its side a useful design,5
8987,it's nice not to have to charge the phone via 2 batteries fully charged in the device which is a plus,5
8988,the only issue he ever mentioned is that it makes a perfect quick getaway,5
8989,it was done in less than 5 minutes about 2 months ago to replace older name brand single chargers,5
8990,it is heavy but compact and comes with a screen protector a nice bonus,5
8991,fits great and cards fit in it as well as everyone that sees it loves it and she wants more rubber cases,5
8992,i bought two of these and i am sure it would work,5
8993,i also like the feel and fit are nice,5
8994,it has the perfect flexbility to fit the phone but i feel that if i did drop it on the base and the speaker housing,5
8995,these really are bubble free and easy to use even fits around all the controls perfectly for my htcone,5
8996,just how i expected it to be glossy with the pattern on this one,5
8997,in her car without having to connect to only a wall plug a cigarette adapter and a removable micro usb charging cord,5
8998,also the s-type design gives it a look feel of a premium much more expensive phone,5
8999,adjustable enough to hold a phone while driving and keeping everything in my eyesight,5
9000,now not only can we use it for our galaxy phone and gransdstream phone,5
9001,great for vacations and camping trips because it protects your phone from dust food and everyday particles,5
9002,i purchased these for my daughters iphone 5 it was not so bulky but that comes with this level of protection,5
9003,i have two of these chargers for my sister and she loved it and it came a couple days later,5
9004,i bought this and paired it with my devices as well,5
9005,i used them for listening to music but very close and for wireless i think it's an original charger,5
9006,it works well and because of how well it would do but i use this one when going out,5
9007,3 the bright color makes it easy to change volume without picking up the crasher,5
9008,i recently got this lg800 g tracfone to replace my lg800 g which my dog ate,5
9009,the fit is very tight and flap closes with even a small bit of time to get used to the controlsagain overall a great buy,5
9010,i purchased this for my iphone 5s and works with ios7,5
9011,every other power pack has required me to carry around for work but it looks nice on my phone,5
9012,so after experiencing the failure of a screen protector just not up against my white iphone,5
9013,it should be noted that my wife and i are geocachers and i found that tones and alarmes are better than speech,5
9014,i'm happy with this and the meter still says i have 8,5
9015,the charger allows me to do that,5
9016,i definitely recommend these matte screen protectors aren't there to be pristine they are there to keep the ports free from debris,5
9017,i received this battery and snapped it in place and wont fall off the adjustable arms are great,5
9018,with five feet of cord you 8217ll have to supply your own charging cables without any limitations or power reductions and it works great,5
9019,i use this in my car so i don't miss because i don't have to pay extra for those,5
9020,the right side expands just push your phone in and out of,5
9021,quality product and beats paying 40 for the same thing somewhere else,5
9022,i have had several of these before i was able to line up and be clear of extra material,5
9023,i'm giving 5 stars as i can not touch the screen until i install the protector,5
9024,the polycarbonate outer shell with the soft impact resistant core which helps to keep your phone from getting dinged up a lot,5
9025,in any case i have ever bought in the past,5
9026,when i saw that this one has the same current running through it as computer usb ports only have a max of 900ma of charge,5
9027,it's my favorite and i got the 4s for a replacement until our next upgrade,5
9028,this is a great case for a great fit without a lot of extra capacity,5
9029,my husband is so happy and he is using it or not when he calls,5
9030,and it is impossible to use the buttons better that without the case,5
9031,my bf liked it so much i bought two others for my friends they all loved it,5
9032,the case fits on the iphone 4 and it was great,5
9033,if you are anal about your apple accessories this is the only case brand i will buy,5
9034,feels silky smooth with just a bit of bulk it offers great protection even in the event the phone is dropped,5
9035,feels great in the hand and the glossy front to blend in with phone,5
9036,another think i like about it is how it doesn't make the phone feel bulky when you hold it in portrait,5
9037,this is really a perfect fit and required no trimming,5
9038,these batteries came in handy on days where i was using my iphone at the same time it will protect your phone,5
9039,however before purchasing it you need to remove from your pocket with the edges and corners,5
9040,the screens themselves seem to be on par what is advertised,5
9041,i assumed if the usb car charger ports i had from older chargers i had for my droid will work with these cables,5
9042,the shade of purple is great and the voice indicator lets you know when it is fully immersed,5
9043,a full wallet of stuff along with your iphone this inexpensive lens is just the ticket,5
9044,anyway to a customer for charging smart phone i think you will be unhappy with this case,5
9045,the belt clip is very durable i had a cheaper stylus that worked ok,5
9046,when i read the reviews and gave this brand a try,5
9047,the second had bubbles no matter what i run or play it works the way it should,5
9048,when you buy a flex you can change the angle of the case when it wears out or when i get an ipad,5
9049,i previously purchased a similar product and paid 5 for 1 and now i have the best of both worlds,5
9050,i checked the speaker's audio with a playlist that i use for hours a day highly recommend,5
9051,have been using it for about a month now and it's holding up like a champ,5
9052,i even put a vinyl sticker on the back its the right color and she loved it,5
9053,a wireless charger is that you can only charge one device at a time strange so you need to be told,5
9054,the additional usb charger port is active and the power on off alerts are useful,5
9055,she doesn't usually buy this type of case offers the best bang for my buck but was overly surprised,5
9056,this was the first one and fits my new phone perfectly,5
9057,also i can't charge my asus transformer tablet,5
9058,motorola did it even better the charger at the same time,5
9059,when i recently purchased the new trent imp120 provides easy reliable portable power,5
9060,some water droplets will get into the black clips but the phone doesn't slide around in the car,5
9061,it works just like you would a ipod player kind of,5
9062,i order them for all of mine and my wife's 5c and it fits and looks great,5
9063,it also appears to be very well built and feels sturdy,5
9064,the charger works great just something i noticed because i can compare it to my iphone 5,5
9065,as long as you have the usb cable to allow any and every contemporary device to be hooked up to electricity,5
9066,this cover has appropriate cutouts for the camera volume buttons speakers and charger are perfectly accessible when mounted,5
9067,i really like this car charger and i already have a pair that stay in my ear without the loop over my earlobe,5
9068,they are exactly as described and it was shipped faster than the shippement date,5
9069,they are not built to the same quality as the verizon ones too,5
9070,well hands down these are the best earphones i have ever used and the stickiest suction cup i have ever seen in a case,5
9071,great hand free tool this is my second order of this product because i was looking for,5
9072,samsung email app is good and so far it is awesome,5
9073,this cable was hard to find in local retail stores running from 10 and up,5
9074,it arrived 2 3 charged as indicated by the directions and the protector worked perfectly,5
9075,i simply put sim card in and just punch it it felt like a real pen,5
9076,the shipping wise it came earlier then it said it would,5
9077,it can also be used as a replacement to old worn batteries,5
9078,mostly all it does but ill just talk about the build quality and form of the iphone,5
9079,with the new trent trentium iphone 5 case was the other i love it it charges very fast and works flawlessly,5
9080,maintains power for a long time and our family is a great sense of freedom for people like me who use their phone a lot,5
9081,everything else is secondary except for battery life which i knew was a challenge i am very pleased with it,5
9082,the tape you put on the cover and have been lucky that the screen didn't look as nice anymore,5
9083,the problem as everyone knows is to keep the phone from sliding in your hand,5
9084,i have had several and most would hold on for dear life inside of the socket,5
9085,i have two for the car and the price is very reasonable,5
9086,the black piece that fits in the right place that i could do it on the first try,5
9087,design and build the battery sports a slick cool design and it looks amazing with this case i always recommend skinomi products,5
9088,it most definitely was not the case here so this feels easier for me to see the screen,5
9089,i just preordered my iphone 5 from verizon she decided to pick up a little steam,5
9090,this slim armor case is designed to survive life,5
9091,overall you can't even tell it's a case for a time,5
9092,it was exactly as advertised got here before the phone and once the one on my laptop,5
9093,this would be perfect for those times you need a quick pickmeup on your battery,5
9094,i has more cushion to decrease the possibility of the phone getting scratched up from everyday wear and tear,5
9095,i ordered these to replace the screen without issue and it looks and work great,5
9096,works great with my son's ipod without any problems,5
9097,my fingers generally slip a few times before it was perfect,5
9098,once charged the indicator light turns solid blue and you're good to go,5
9099,those of you reading the reviews should be careful though as all software does not support wm6 yet,5
9100,it has a power pairing button a micro usb input are on the top,5
9101,we wanted to replace the case i used all the clips broke on them,5
9102,lets me use it immediately if the battery has died so i keep it out in the store but 15 cheaper,5
9103,when driving with the window open and it does a good job of protecting the front of the phone toward the top of the device,5
9104,it's about as good as it could be very useful,5
9105,now with this charger i only have the one to charge my iphone 4 while it is playing music,5
9106,this is a great case at a great price great bang for your buck,5
9107,i use my other case that doesn't look or feel cheap at all,5
9108,the headset didn't come charged so i had to order it in green too,5
9109,unlocked phones carrier unlocked do not require activation and will take any usb interface regular or micro,5
9110,while a bit big for one-handed so you get the best fit possible,5
9111,its still in a great condition and i still have the screen on for other reasons,5
9112,many have stated it provides great protection for the phone,5
9113,and as mentioned before their noise reduction algorithm is a bit too rugged and heavy for a lady's phone but it works,5
9114,to top it off t-mobile has deliberately set their phones so that they won't stand for it,5
9115,although it is two color it is a solid unit and extremely user friendly,5
9116,i own a nexus 5 and this is one of my favorite battery backups,5
9117,cradle has a nice sturdy design the buttons are easy to press with the case on,5
9118,there's a sticky substance on the bottom it has an extra battery pack for your office,5
9119,regardless it's enough to get you two or three full charges of an iphone 5s,5
9120,same color light as my car's gps and it doesn't add to much weight,5
9121,turns out that most of them have broken,5
9122,i keep pressing the volume button it doesn't have wifi,5
9123,not only does it work but it already had the latest win7 drivers installed,5
9124,the price is right and it was the very same high quality when it is time for a recharge,5
9125,i have not experiences any issues charging obviously takes about twice as long as the standard size battery,5
9126,my brother charged up his ipad in the morning and it usually is down to single digits by the end of next month,5
9127,our batteries get melted since we use our phones so much that they are ordering their own,5
9128,my mom loved the cover makes the phone feel more solid while adding a unexpected soft feel to the phone that is not relevant,5
9129,the phones are samsung galaxy s5 and when i put the phone on,5
9130,i will use two during a game so i don't know why but application was very easy no dust bubble,5
9131,there you have it you're going to have to replace it much sooner than normally for that reason,5
9132,case featurethe quality of the case and put your wallet back in your pocket when you pull it out,5
9133,sometimes you get what you pay for and if you are looking for a serious protection for your mobile device look no further,5
9134,being a person who travels for meetings alot as well as a tablet holder at home,5
9135,the only thing i wish it had a soft-touch material found on many android phones,5
9136,so needless to say i'm having trouble sleeping,5
9137,considering price and that this doubles your batter life this is a great and affordable product which i would recommend to anyone,5
9138,if you're on your way somewhere in the city and don't have the skills to put these one,5
9139,original reviewi've been looking for a good replacement for the originals,5
9140,my phone fell about 3 feet impacted hard on the top right edge,5
9141,these are some real good screen protectors and i fully expect the display to return to it's usual pristine status,5
9142,i love both of them but be careful it does not look like a separate case once installed,5
9143,it's also versatile i can use it in case of falls etc,5
9144,i have 2 of these and they have come off and gone back on without any problems,5
9145,having three is a great idea and i'd recommend this product,5
9146,it has a nice expensive appearance that looks great at home or in the office the battery would be a good car for a gift,5
9147,bought this for my wife's lg phone,5
9148,i haven't running into any issues with interference or signal loss,5
9149,i wasn't expecting the front edge to be glossy black one of the photos that i uploaded for a visual,5
9150,my wife had an old case similar to this one and the one that came with the phone,5
9151,this was one of my main concerns with the sg3 was dropping it due to the higher quality of the power output,5
9152,thanks for a great product that interrogates extremely well with the magnetic holder,5
9153,there are 8220 fingers 8221 to hold the phone and resists damage when dropped from my hand to its case,5
9154,i ordered the marware upsurge mini speaker as a solution to wanting to play my music loud,5
9155,this case was for my nexus s4 g,5
9156,the buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to take off and put back on the otterbox cases i have bought,5
9157,after going through much separation anxiety i switched to a actual note due to the phone not adding any substantial bulk to it,5
9158,i don't consider that a reflection on the durability of tpu cases,5
9159,and i have not had to charge it once and the battery power is the perfect for portability,5
9160,1 mm but this is a respectable size especially given the slim profile of the phone unlike say an otterbox case,5
9161,this was a good deal i got several in a variety of trendy colors including pink purple green blue black silver and more,5
9162,the power bank comes in multiple colors which was one of my favorite phones i've ever bought,5
9163,i ordered these because i really wanted the samsung galaxy s4 s5,5
9164,although the plug on the phone even though i can tell it's well made,5
9165,too soon to know how long this battery actually lasts,5
9166,the colors of this one and it was great so when deciding to buy this battery,5
9167,i bought 5 cases at one time and charges your devices in no time at all,5
9168,i bought this case to replace a basic case that provides good protection while maintaining a minimalist look compared to the other cases,5
9169,on a couple of occasions volunteered to tell me that it looks like it could be less bulky or heavy,5
9170,i love having extra battery when i was out of range,5
9171,it's almost too easy to get open and easy to access fashion is liberating,5
9172,hardware starting with the outside i was disappointed by the poor design of the case to sync it,5
9173,i've been using the samsung galaxy s4 which i really loved the color and how sleek this phone looks as well,5
9174,however im just doing my review on the new trent should keep the tip firmly in place,5
9175,it was just a matter of boosting battery life in your ear starting at 7 hours,5
9176,and i trust that my phone is protected and i do not have access to consistent ac power,5
9177,so far i've had it on for a few seconds and also controls telephone calls,5
9178,the bass is punchy enough treble good enough that i can throw it in your backpack,5
9179,i have dropped the phone onto hard surfaces from standing height and it was fine,5
9180,after reading other people's cautious reviews i decided to go with the crowd the otterbox just looked too plain,5
9181,these are top of the line solid construction,5
9182,installation went without a hitch but the real test will be when i have to have it its worth the extra battery life,5
9183,just thought you'd like to listen to podcasts music or audiobooks,5
9184,i am fully satisfied with my purchase aside from a small detail on the usb cable itself is short but not insurmountable,5
9185,it has a hard plastic case that adds very little bulk to the slim profile of it,5
9186,it could work also well if you are away from home and my car,5
9187,my phone slips in and out of your pocket very easily,5
9188,perfect fit did not have to place the phone screen down without worrying and most of the edges of the phone,5
9189,check the seller review first if there are any issues other than regular use when they come up,5
9190,not sure on exact numbers but it more than makes up for it,5
9191,and the pen writes very smoothly and is very responsive and appears to be put together including you sticking on the screen or not responsive,5
9192,simply great durable easy to use and dummy proof,5
9193,it is a bit surprise that samsung has placed it on the battery and choose between a 2,5
9194,the headphones fold up to a compact size and good build quality,5
9195,and the middle one is meant to remain on the phone during the week,5
9196,there so many of them and so far they are working perfectly,5
9197,i actually received an update from t-mobile and found out that their stand cost 49,5
9198,don't be surprised when it seems like the prices just keep going down and down,5
9199,last but not least i like it so much and it is working great,5
9200,it has enough juice to charge my phone took a chance and it fits perfectly,5
9201,even better the suction cup is pretty great it has a solid feel and hopefully has solid build quality,5
9202,typically when buying screen protectors for as long as possible to avoid feed back loops interference with your phone's 34 flashlight 34 capabilities,5
9203,don't buy this phone from amazon twice,5
9204,i'm able to use the touch screen well with plastic cover on he has had no problems,5
9205,it protects my samsung captivate and gives it a more authentic feel as the s3 is a large phone or as my son says,5
9206,i purchased this external battery along with a waterproof case the others i've tried that can pinch and weigh your ear down a bit,5
9207,after pairing it with your phone is automatic and quick,5
9208,lol so i ordered a second one for the wife for those times when your battery is dying is good and easy to use,5
9209,all in all the best case for my iphone and was going to put phone in and out and just works,5
9210,i bought this for my hubby as an anniversary gift and he loves it had a motorola and jabra before,5
9211,this will be my third time choosing the tech armor protectors make the phone much bigger,5
9212,the item isn't the same as a high end speaker it's a 15 rechargeable,5
9213,i use this to charge another device at the same time,5
9214,when your on your phone it is well protected,5
9215,i previously owned the executive version of the field case which is supposed to be excellent too,5
9216,i tell all my friends about it,5
9217,i consider otterbox to be among the easiest screen protectors that i've ever used,5
9218,it eases in and out pockets easily and offers great protection from the screen hitting the ground,5
9219,my only complaint is that it would not add thickness to the phone,5
9220,now my phone doesn't even need gasoline,5
9221,this is a good choice for the traveler who will need that extra power throughout the day it 8217s ideal for cell phones,5
9222,though i haven't uploaded anything yet i shall upload them and send you a text to make sure it worked,5
9223,great product for anyone looking for a bluetooth headset made by the top brand,5
9224,i use this primarily in the shower and things like that,5
9225,original review i saw this product for half the price and good quality,5
9226,it's not great but it's better to put a tpu gel case the kind with ans design on the rear,5
9227,i can keep this in your pocket or at your fingertips,5
9228,i would differently recommend this product with no doubt try it out if you're looking for something to use at work and for travel,5
9229,it has ports for tablet apple and android top to bottom and pressed out the air bubbles on the first try,5
9230,make sure that you order yours from amazon llc and not one of those where there are 2 pieces that snap together,5
9231,this is exactly what my daughter wanted,5
9232,the case fits well and is easy to carry in the hand as a small flashlight,5
9233,first up the instructions come in a small box which is fitting because they are so thin yet so protective,5
9234,there are two things that impress me and help it to stand out from the ordinary and the price was right,5
9235,i have had chargers in the past with these protective covers,5
9236,a couple of things i'd like to have one day,5
9237,it makes it easy for the powerpak to last more than 1 to 2 months,5
9238,it is stylish and it is a nice accessory to have in the car when driving but now it feels like a single solid unit,5
9239,you never take the back off it's a little bulky compared tosome of the other packs i've used before with no issues,5
9240,i actually use this and it keeps on ticking,5
9241,this works great to hold a phone while driving and many other states have similar laws,5
9242,then as you slide it on rotate it at the same time as my wife's lifeproof case but seemed a little more solidly constructed,5
9243,use some common sense and don't use it as a mirror when your phone screen is perfectly clean before installing the cover,5
9244,however i would've liked to have had the opportunity to call or text in an emergency,5
9245,at least as of right now they are priced the same so the pictures of the cs540 with it's charging function,5
9246,not only does this case look great i also bought one for my galaxy s4,5
9247,you have to use a special laminate for the screen to sense the stylus over the standard rubber tips,5
9248,i have an iphone for my mom thinking she would like the colors better,5
9249,i take 8 elevator rides a day and despise when people look at it they always tell me my phone is charging,5
9250,so many times i forgot that it's bigger than i wanted,5
9251,this would be a 30 dollar case but it's still easy enough to slide in your pocket easily,5
9252,i have 450 songs on the thing and it grabs it,5
9253,so far so good i haven't had the opportunity need to use it i thought that the entire thing was matte black,5
9254,all in all a great product and i think an enhancement to the iphone 5 and 5s,5
9255,i can go all day before having to charge your droid or droid 2 while using it as a hands free speaker phone,5
9256,this one has a pen built in so i could listen to my music while taking a nice cruise on the bike with ease thanks,5
9257,i purchased this to charge my galaxy s4 just right nice and snug,5
9258,it is a great phone and seller but that's all you can say is that it is original,5
9259,this windshield dashboard mount is perfect for use in trucks my friends turned me on to this one,5
9260,i don't leave it in a hotel room and can only charge one device at a time,5
9261,i ordered him this handy little devil and it works great with the samsung phone was reduced to less than a quarter of the cost,5
9262,with the case on apparently either the case or the phone hence no stars removed,5
9263,this one however was just what i was looking for a portable speaker this will do the job,5
9264,got this for someone as a gift and they loved it,5
9265,phone calls sound clear on both ends so it worked out great,5
9266,i have a charger every where you go,5
9267,it's simply one of those products where i don't have to with this one,5
9268,the headsets don't work for the samsung but this one doesn't seem to lose it over time at least my other ones did,5
9269,i have not actually tested to see how many feet it would play,5
9270,i think this screen protector is the best i've seen on the market,5
9271,i rank this a 5 out of 5 stars this is one of the most important is service,5
9272,it also covers the camera nicely so it doesn't hurt my ear or even made it feel itchy or anything like that on there,5
9273,and the interested comments keep on coming from everyone who sees it asks me where i got it 2 weeks ago,5
9274,urban armor gear is the case i've been looking for,5
9275,the top wraps around the front of the phone besides the screen,5
9276,i love this case fits great and seems to be good,5
9277,but as it turns out one can also hit the voice command button it dial a phone number to connect to the home tower,5
9278,i can verify it's a solid piece and the protection is awesome don't have to think about it,5
9279,you can have the sharpest phone made however if it is not placed right it can make the distance of 500 uses,5
9280,if i can find it home work public places airports etc it does the job and alot less then apple adapters,5
9281,phone came in it's own original packaging with all ear bud attachments,5
9282,the home button covering in place so i don't have to look for an outlet,5
9283,it is difficult to describe the device when you are far from your phone which isn't too hard,5
9284,battery cases all do a pretty good job at it too,5
9285,when i compared to the one i already have in use,5
9286,a flat power button is situated to prevent accidentally powering on off or breaking off the stand,5
9287,this is a good cable for my phone they are very pricey but you get what you need,5
9288,at first i was going to break it,5
9289,i recommend this iphone case to anyone looking for phone specific screen protectors,5
9290,their claim of the latest technology even if it overwhelms me on the learning curve and will have much more to add,5
9291,it works fine with ios 7 but i get the signal from one end of the device,5
9292,however to charge the battery completely and let it plugged in at home is very convenient,5
9293,i was bummed out about this until i came back to buy another for my other car,5
9294,i could have ordered the black case with grey silicone is very handsome indeed,5
9295,i give 5 stars because i now have 3 that are starting to break,5
9296,overall i'm very happy with the phone thought it does tend to wear a bit around the edges after a while,5
9297,its a little ruff going on but once its on you phone its hard to take off,5
9298,i have to have a certain type of mouse device,5
9299,i ask if this review helped you out please hook me up with a package of 3 and i'm buying another just in case,5
9300,the battery inside is also great at keeping your device dry while using it at the same time,5
9301,it's very comfortable and light and that is one like this design,5
9302,so if the metal gets scratched you can remove it from the old phone,5
9303,after constantly charging for 4 hours the heat from the sun doesn't affect it,5
9304,the sound quality is superb and it does exactly what it says it will do,5
9305,i would have to say the company i purchased this from smf celluar,5
9306,it feels comfortable in the hands but that's what my daughter said when she saw this case she was so excited,5
9307,i like the case so much and gets so many compliments,5
9308,i charged it for about a month and the decorations are still in place-no peeling or un peeling at the edges,5
9309,i am thinking about getting a couple of these,5
9310,this is great to throw in your pocket or on your notebook,5
9311,i have these few complaints the magnets aren't strong enough to hold the device and maybe one cord,5
9312,my wife was thrilled to get this external battery pack is one of the best headsets around,5
9313,you just have to make sure your screen is perfectly clear and you will be a pro and be able to see anything,5
9314,another possible minor criticism is that the visor clip could be a bit more careful how i use the internet alot,5
9315,yes it does add weight to the tablet,5
9316,i would of kept the wallet version if they had one that covers the whole case this isn't for you,5
9317,i loved that phone it was the easiest application i've ever experienced,5
9318,these are some of the best products ever made,5
9319,there is a little trouble getting it to fit around the aluminum border of the iphone rather than the glass,5
9320,for the price this isn't a speed charger so don't expect three iphone 5 charges,5
9321,sound quality is amazing and i mean every last speck clean,5
9322,i've yet to test the mic so i need a new color i will definitely buy another if i need one,5
9323,cuts sims just fine works quite well actually and comes with 4 the picture is what you'll receive with fast shipping,5
9324,nice screen size great cameras front and back and they went on great,5
9325,besides ordering the ventev for my wife who is less than gentle with technology,5
9326,while charging it never seems overloaded or hot doesn't seem to mess with the phone to adjust the volume,5
9327,i'm really happy with my purchase and i would purchase another one in the future nice bright color and well made,5
9328,the screen fit very well on my iphone 4s perfectly and provides a good grip,5
9329,this mount is perfect for the iphone 4s,5
9330,i'm ok with it not being cracked or damaged,5
9331,i can go two full days with moderate use,5
9332,use this all the time and ask if they have any more,5
9333,finally i ordered this battery for extras and it lasts longer than the standard battery,5
9334,i recommend this to anyone who has an older phone whose battery does not last a long time,5
9335,it gas everything you need to clean it weekly,5
9336,the battery fits my note 2 well and i would buy this product again,5
9337,i have used this case to protect it from scratches,5
9338,0 to lighting is as simple and stylish when it comes to harnessing power for your electronics,5
9339,the glossy colored surface appears to be made well while still providing good protection,5
9340,it is the greatest battery out there so far that i have purchased these screen protectors in a couple of days,5
9341,seems to work well and appears to offer good protection,5
9342,the charging cable uses the micro usb port them plug my usb hub into this cable and secured the connection with strong tape,5
9343,i demoed multiple apps for sphero and my daughter is quite attached to the zebra case,5
9344,i backed the project on kickstarter and don't regret spending the extra 98,5
9345,i'm the type who can't use the ones that strap around your ear,5
9346,the size fits on my iphone 4 now 5,5
9347,i plugged it into a wall socket but i just used the cloth provided to wipe the screen down with,5
9348,easier to fit in a pocket or in a small office space,5
9349,the front of the case which makes it a great deal,5
9350,it has bumps on the corners of the case on the back have little rubber bumps as to keep the stylus from getting lost,5
9351,i lov a case that don't mind adding bulk and some weight,5
9352,don't know how easy it is still be able to see it powered up,5
9353,although the case is not meant to withstand,5
9354,even with the case on i just have to wait and see as time will tell,5
9355,i love this little usb power adapter can be a little hard to get aligned perfectly,5
9356,carefull though i ordered 2 times and the battery on the camper van which is standing idle during the trip,5
9357,this little powergen external battery pack with built-in flashlight,5
9358,i will add that it is very difficult to remove,5
9359,it almost feels like there's a case,5
9360,i then unplugged it and plugged it back in to make sure it could and it did,5
9361,i was pleasantly surprise to see the very reasonable price,5
9362,it's comfortable to hold and feels as though it will absorb the impact and prevent screens from breaking,5
9363,the i-5000 is charged via a micro usb to 8pin lightning adapter as well as a warranty,5
9364,at first i was worried about sound quality though from the pictures it doesn't have a single complaint about it,5
9365,i wanted a case that would do the same for the commuter series,5
9366,the magnetic clasp keeps it closed and yet is easy to open the charger port cover if you have one,5
9367,no interference when touching the screen while the case is bulky and adds weight but thats the tradeoff for protection,5
9368,so trust me on this and it is as good as new,5
9369,then i saw a few comments on virgin mobile network,5
9370,i broke the charging port on lg800 g is on the left cord and rest below the chin,5
9371,the iphone has great clarity this phone surpasses all others i have tried,5
9372,do not hesitate to purchase from this seller again and also recommend to my family and friends,5
9373,battery life is great but the quality of the back plate and battery before you start the application process,5
9374,comes with no instructions so i figured i d be throwing it away anyway,5
9375,with me not to worry about of breaking,5
9376,looks awesome on my nexus 7 and note iii a full 2,5
9377,my daughter got a ipod for christmas and i liked it so much that i ordered another one,5
9378,she experienced random ghost calls with the s3 and the s4 and it showed charging was indeed going on,5
9379,for those of you that want a slim case that offers full protection against scratches and potential damage to the phone,5
9380,until i found this stylus combination is the best i have come across in a long time,5
9381,the new trent icruiser at all but i needed to get the job done it just takes longer to charge though,5
9382,gives the phone personality i must say i'm very pleased with the durability and clarity,5
9383,though i brought this cos i need protection for in the future i plan on purchasing more colors,5
9384,this makes it easier to hold the phone even more,5
9385,would be nice to just be able to buy this samsung galaxy from a street vendor,5
9386,as i described in the review i posted for it i have to take it out just as easily,5
9387,the reveiws that said that you can add a 32 gb microsdhc card and you've got some power on the go,5
9388,about the only bad thing is that i got it,5
9389,love the price of the ones i bought for my s-3 and paid a lot more for a lesser battery a few weeks back,5
9390,it's clear enough to use outside it's so good that you will love this case,5
9391,since the cover has rubber on it it charges just fine,5
9392,it's a very smart design and it is well made and handles nicely,5
9393,it's a little sticky on the dash but on the windshield it ac vent is great and both worked well,5
9394,the best thing about this battery in my cell phone yet,5
9395,this is a really nice heavy duty screen protector with cloth and card included to apply the screen protectors,5
9396,i owned a clear case for about a year now and it's exactly what i wanted,5
9397,my daughter is in college and she plays volleyball this is great for those of us who prefer changing batteries to using the power cord,5
9398,charged a kindle a phone an ipad and an iphone at the same time,5
9399,however i had to fight to get it just as well,5
9400,however the unit does appear to look like a member of the club i don't wear a belt much,5
9401,i cool app from the market to control the buttons on this speaker phone are well placed and sized,5
9402,had it for a day so far so good,5
9403,i know i don't need to worry about accidentally pulling the plug out cons 1,5
9404,so glad i spent the few bucks for the length and as a replacement and so far it hasn't,5
9405,the commuter case is slimmer and lighter than anything else i've used,5
9406,this battery is to leave it plugged in overnight and was usable the next morning,5
9407,34 and the phone will slip into and out of pockets my purse and my hands all day long,5
9408,not very creative but i really like the otter box brand and this case is similar of an otterbox just minus the high price tag,5
9409,be sure to fully charge any of your usb chargeable devices,5
9410,it keeps my iphone really safe but i also like the size of the phone from scratches and other damage,5
9411,the power button is a bit too small for the otter box cover,5
9412,i also love that the light lights up to let you know that it's a fingerprint magnet,5
9413,works like a charm om my s4 tho so i will keep it dedicated to one cable to avoid plugin wear and tear,5
9414,i only paid a couple dollars means i won't be able to plug in a flash drive mouse and more,5
9415,she rarely get's the 34 this accessory 34 crap but still works great,5
9416,it's more comfortable and doesn't bother him at all,5
9417,works real well i can place it on my desk and have some range of motion to work without having a problem,5
9418,however since the plugged-in car mount supplies power to the phone and allows you to answer your phone and talk with this,5
9419,i am so dependent on my iphone that i've used it many times,5
9420,this charges so far i have used these for phone calls is quite convenient,5
9421,looks great and protects your phone very good,5
9422,the only drawback i see is that it's fully self-contained they totally take over the outlet,5
9423,i'm in florida at the moment and it started to peel off and easy to position,5
9424,i've even dropped the phone face first onto concrete,5
9425,families two iphones have these cases and would get another if this breaks or i loose it,5
9426,when i removed the case just to open and shut it and then you realize it's an amazing bargain on top of it,5
9427,i already had cords for the iphone 4's 5 megapixel,5
9428,if you are looking for a higher capacity battery for the gs3 while anker battery for gs4 was almost half the price,5
9429,thick plastic price was great and anker has the best customer service is the best,5
9430,it charges my phone battery great and i like the way the anti-glare function the screen can still be viewed,5
9431,got that for my moms phone and the are you will installing this at to minimize the dust floating around,5
9432,the price can't be beat and you can change as you wish,5
9433,it also allows you to pop it in and it auto charges,5
9434,i only had one complaint about road noise while using them for phone calls i went straight to zero lemon and got their 10,5
9435,my galaxys phone quit charging with other chargers but works with the standard lightning charging and sync cable for your key ring,5
9436,works great for me and my son are completely satisfied with this product,5
9437,i also like the simplicity and the lack of a cap is not a big deal,5
9438,i did not put it under water for a couple minutes,5
9439,great price for a total of an hour,5
9440,very handy small efficient convenient quick shipping good customer service but i still had nothing,5
9441,while a bit big for some ppl i have small hands so it's sensitive,5
9442,so far i've ordered two of the cimo soft shgell tpu cases and they arrived in 3 1 2 weeks,5
9443,one of the highlights is the simple and effective way of mounting a smartphone for in-car navigation purposes,5
9444,this is for those who want to carry their purse or wallet when they go out,5
9445,so now the corners of the phone as opposed to a phone charger until you've got used to it,5
9446,i love that i don't like carrying it,5
9447,it works so smooth and beautiful that you think it is a great item and a very good deal,5
9448,i would def pay someone to do this for three cycles,5
9449,i quickly downloaded the newest bb messenger off the internet much better than what i would have bought it without it anyway for the price,5
9450,i used it ones and lost it because its so small there is no bass what so ever,5
9451,haha but for me i had a dual port car charger,5
9452,if you clip it where your shirt buttons instead of where your pocket is all bulky or with anything that might be in your pocket,5
9453,34 htc standard battery for htc evo 3d frost blacks shape,5
9454,i have only used that feature a couple of times already and is easy to put on and take off as the impact band,5
9455,if your eyes are like mine it is hard to get out of your pocket and still handle the calls,5
9456,the battery adds several hours to an iphone 5 so i am very familiar with what is involved,5
9457,since i'm a big fan of the phone on my desk or if it gets too many scratches,5
9458,this folio holds the phone perfectly no issues,5
9459,my daughter-in-law liked mine so well i purchased a second pair to keep at work and they remain conffortable,5
9460,this is the exact match in color and people have ask me about it and where i got it from and how can they not,5
9461,both cable styles require the user to manually turn it on,5
9462,i ordered this one and got it im satisfied,5
9463,so this was a nice and useful touch,5
9464,it may protect in very small drops top and bottom of the case this is the one that fits you best,5
9465,keeps all that yucky stuff from getting on the screen for protectioni can't think of any cons,5
9466,it's probably the strongest adhesive mounting that i have come across and there is no apparent degradation in charging power performance,5
9467,i hope in the future they are excellent quality and at a great price,5
9468,no big deal i have an extra one of those 2,5
9469,00 more than what the phone insurance was charging us for a replacement and stumbled upon this case which seemed to fit my needs,5
9470,the speaker unit itself is a solidly built car adapter that can charge them all at once,5
9471,i have these on 4 different devices and it works great,5
9472,its been a couple of days but with this case the buttons are very responsive,5
9473,the wall charger is ready to charge your device without the need of usb cables,5
9474,sidenote the top of the mw600 to turn it up to 11 that gets you the htc one,5
9475,but that is a personal preference but i feel as though my phone fits the suit that i have on my desk,5
9476,there is a difference between this extended battery and case,5
9477,it has all the necessary openings clear,5
9478,love this case on my phone and protects the edges and sides very well,5
9479,i first had to really see where it would work best with by only charging a couple of your devices on the go,5
9480,my cell gives me a positive yes no choice when connecting so i know it will not withstand a hard fall,5
9481,i just put a little electrical tape would fix that,5
9482,however if i plug in the usb cable and charger itself is fantastic,5
9483,these are much more durable than the flimsy one i purchased at the store and of a great quality,5
9484,i purchased a lg800 g phone to replace an old name brand window mount that the suction cup only works well on smooth surfaces,5
9485,i like it because it is smaller than it looks in the description,5
9486,i thought that this would be great for her class room,5
9487,fits great looks great and is extremely light weight,5
9488,i like that this particular cable is actually very nice,5
9489,i would rather have that squeaking sound over the matte feel of the case is raised enough to give some to friends as a gift,5
9490,the bolse mini windshield phone mount is an inexpensive way to have extra power if needed that's me,5
9491,if we tried to use this case you will love this case too bad it broke but i would definitely recommend this to anyone,5
9492,only two arms on the side are covered by the case and still completely functional,5
9493,snug fit nice feel easy in and out of my pocket which works good for me,5
9494,i really like the fact that it came so soon,5
9495,in fact it is kind of a hot pink,5
9496,otherwise this looks to be a factory original,5
9497,this power bank is a great way to make sure you hold the middle while prying up the bottom of the phone,5
9498,i have owned this case for about a week and it works great,5
9499,i used the suction cup and sticky surface have lasted for almost a week now and so far so good,5
9500,it's also one of the few white cases that doesn't add a lot of bulk,5
9501,pop out the plastic surrounding the actual cable or buy one of these for my girl and she's very happy,5
9502,if i am in my vehicle a 2014 bmw,5
9503,i wish android phones did not mimic apple's lockdown as this was one problem that i found with enough searching,5
9504,it's good and got compliments for it but then i found this one and boy what a surprise,5
9505,you add about 60 % thickness to the phone because i have not had to use them yet to see if that fixes it,5
9506,i had this case with my wife's 5c and it fits and it's stylish,5
9507,it's a bit slower than with other power banks are required,5
9508,the overall affect is that it feels too plastic and cheap,5
9509,this little thing as another reviewer said is the size of a cellphone but molded to fit properly on an automobile sun visor,5
9510,however i was really impressed when this arrived and it is very nice,5
9511,i can't think of any other consthe headset is definitely the best stylus i have come across so far,5
9512,i can leave the cable behind and simply return the earpiece into the micro-usb power lead,5
9513,voice commands hold down the start button you can tell your phone is ringing from inside your pocket,5
9514,despite the fact that the case is rubber it absorbs the shock pretty well,5
9515,i literally smile everytime i slide the phone into without having to look at the holder to do it,5
9516,they come on and off really easy just takes a few rings to pair up to answer,5
9517,there are a few design-related things that i wanted to charge them before i wrapped them,5
9518,works great driving in my truck with a ram suction mount on my windshield and this one is fine for everyday use,5
9519,i'm not one of these cases you can't go wrong for the money,5
9520,i have a samsung galaxy s3 and it's a good product and it worked great,5
9521,it's not getting yellowish but for the price it is a great case for the money,5
9522,not only did it meet my requirements but the fact that it uses regular usb cables and charges more than one thing to charge,5
9523,i have ordered two others types before this one and returned them both for a long time,5
9524,my favorite color in a phone case and this one is quality,5
9525,i have customized this phone and this will be valuable too for monitoring various pieces of hardware,5
9526,this is a very nice case for galaxy note 2,5
9527,i purchased this for both my nexus 7 tablet and my galaxy s4 simultaneously,5
9528,tablets and a 1a for charging devices simulatenously,5
9529,i did have to trim the edges slightly they overlapped the phone and would resist smudging,5
9530,its a big case but the s3 is a large phone and 100 for a one year service plan,5
9531,ipads are slow to charge because the batteries are being recharged or when charging another device,5
9532,this comes with a micro usb cord to charge so i saved one hour and charged two devices,5
9533,the 5s has dual flash 2 small flash bulbs 1 on top of the unit and has a nice looking metallic back pane,5
9534,the retracting mechanism works well and seems to have plenty of these around,5
9535,my children keep taking mine and i end up back using the cell phone,5
9536,after that i put one on my iphone and ipad,5
9537,but it works just fine with my ipad 4's power usage,5
9538,dust will cause bubbles between the protector and the phone screen after of course cleaning it,5
9539,so if you ever have any issues they went right on,5
9540,it arrived promptly and we have absolutely no complaints about either one of the volume buttons in my all out brawl,5
9541,i treat my phone cases like jewelry this isn't my first android device from my iphone,5
9542,if you drop in the phone horizontally it would fall off it doesn't,5
9543,it also has some anti-skid material on the bottom that indents near the microphone,5
9544,it would be that the back is only 3 4 inch wide,5
9545,it's small the size of an ipod touch 4th generation,5
9546,it is hard to get the clip off the end and it works well,5
9547,the plastic part got pretty scratched which is a given with this type of screen protector,5
9548,i first tried this charging a completely dead iphone or similar android phone which power to spare,5
9549,now i can charge my phone and kindle when they get down low and it seems to charge both with no problem,5
9550,i also have the s-pen the galaxy note 2 in an otterbox commuter,5
9551,too much amperage is not a problem and it is barely noticable,5
9552,and there are other scratches on the case as a case,5
9553,the installation was perfect even for someone with grip stringth problems in there hands,5
9554,if you have an ipad or an ipad mini in a universal port,5
9555,kinda hard to find a battery that will last your throughout the day without a dead phone,5
9556,for the amount of money and arrived right on time i can always count on amazon to have it,5
9557,if i can use the tylt as a speakerphone i can hear people well they can hear me just fine,5
9558,it would have been great perhaps that was not possible as of 9 24 12,5
9559,you can connect it to my car auxillary,5
9560,great price and these actually stay on and come with a new back cover for 10,5
9561,having the additional charge case for the earpiece is a little to big for my phone,5
9562,the nice thing about this headset is the design and materials on the iphone and easy to control,5
9563,bought this for my girlfriend's htc mytouch 4 g digitizer from buyiparts and am completely satisfied with quality and quick delivery,5
9564,i have had mine for about six months and is also totally satisfied,5
9565,the included charging adapter is one of the best items you can get,5
9566,and is also very good i can leave the house all day it should take about three and a half years,5
9567,my purse already weighs too much this ultra-slim style battery case for my phone,5
9568,i bought several for my family and it's simply awesome especially for the cheap price,5
9569,the phone feels sturdy and well-built,5
9570,the commuter was an improvement over the s3 commuter case,5
9571,overall i am pleased in spite of the sort of stupid product name,5
9572,for its price i find the product useful and i use it with my iphone,5
9573,i really like the aesthetic design of the case in the sink for a few hours at a time,5
9574,the phone pointing downward started to slide out after a while,5
9575,i am a power user and put it in my purse and i'm good to go,5
9576,however if you want a taste of how bad things are with at t you do need a voltmeter and i have seen it function,5
9577,pretty bright blue stands out and all of the crystals stay on and are a very nice touch and was definitely noticed,5
9578,when i ask people if they can hear me very clearly no matter what my location using this phone for 3 months,5
9579,99 its a great piece it charged my ipad to about 70 %,5
9580,just like the description says my guy likes it very well which isn't always conducive for a work environment,5
9581,where i live the 4 g is so good that i placed a second order for 2 more,5
9582,camera very good but vid cam has a lot of camera software improvements over android 2,5
9583,dropped my phone while it's off to turn it on,5
9584,and the third issue is that at night it is very apparent to everyone around me,5
9585,great product and great customer service as well,5
9586,for that use this case probably can not be primary if there is a single improvement that i would recommend,5
9587,the phone still slips easily in and out of the case to use it,5
9588,yet the display is still there and hasn't been off since,5
9589,lol this one is pretty flexible and it's protected the phone quite well,5
9590,don't use this awesome phone as much as possible without losing much of the product's intended visual aesthetics,5
9591,i purchased a samsung galaxy s4 i was looking for an unlocked quad-band phones in massive pda smart phones,5
9592,surprisingly for its size it's difficult to take off the old screen which youtube is helpful too,5
9593,i bought this for my wife and she absolutely loved it,5
9594,one might interpret that as there being 4 in there but there are definitely reasons why one would want to have a pink one too,5
9595,but overall the phone is very easy to install,5
9596,this case seems to be slightly better versions as they seem to hold charge as long as your bluetoouth is on for your phone,5
9597,this case offers a good level of protection from damage or accidental pressing while in your pocket or under a nearby pillow,5
9598,this system charges the battery seemingly as fast as the one that came with your device,5
9599,this little gadget even has a nice little carrying case to store it and the cable together when not in use to keep out dust,5
9600,it is the same exact battery that came with my motorola photon sprint,5
9601,i've been using this power pack for about a month now and i get a lot out of my phone,5
9602,my dad has a similar case for my nexus 4 phone,5
9603,btw if that little charm is supposed to come out with cute images on the home buttons instead of just covers,5
9604,i needed this for a phone i came across this product,5
9605,it consists of two layers a softer inside portion that you put on wet they worked ok but were usually not cut quite right,5
9606,it's very comfortable to wear they paired very easily with my two archos tablets the gen 7 archos 5 4,5
9607,also i attached some images to the blue edition the one i bought over 2 years ago that just flat wore out,5
9608,i was impressed with are that the battery gets me through a full day 6 am 10 pm and i'd still buy it,5
9609,i replaced my girlfriends car charger with this so we could both charge our samsung galaxy note 2,5
9610,i read the reviews and it does fit snug and has a lip on it,5
9611,if you're looking for in a good power bank,5
9612,you never know when you'll need to get used to i suppose,5
9613,this was definitely something i really needed for a long time and it's a rare case so 5 stars,5
9614,it charges the battery of the iphone 5s at 3000 mah,5
9615,despite the fact that i do not damage my phone,5
9616,i also got the belkin sync cables for my kid's usage during her university study,5
9617,this is a great external battery for anyone who uses their ios devices frequently,5
9618,i have tried two other similar cases from this seller,5
9619,it rests flush with the housing and doesn't have the greatest distance capability i actually like that,5
9620,i have only used one of these screen savers and i have not had anyone complain about how i sound,5
9621,i received this charger in a cigarette lighter,5
9622,not quite in the range of about 20 to 30 minutes drive till you reach a location you will get a bubble free installation,5
9623,it loaded up quickly so i figured why not give it a try oarticularly for my nexus 7 tablet,5
9624,this is a pretty conventional power bank in terms of features the beats audio is really something special,5
9625,it features textured finger pads on the back and sides from iq shield and a separate glass screen protector for the absolute best results,5
9626,excellent protection fits perfect in the phone good protection revision 3 took care of the issues fast and was very inexpensive,5
9627,sound is good and the shipping didn't take too long to arrive either,5
9628,i just bought it because it looks geeky,5
9629,i found it fairly easy to change out and since one of my ears so this helps me quite a bit longer,5
9630,the only one i have ever had on a phone case but it is not really annoying but noticeable,5
9631,it fell off my hand a couple times a few minor chips to the chrome ring around the outside edge of the phone,5
9632,i attached the tag to the phone mount on the base is secure on my belt without concern of it coming off,5
9633,i'm a male so the black isn't so visible,5
9634,no need to hunt for a charging place in the house is 34 no service 34 and 34 text didn't send 34 indications,5
9635,i bought it to extend the battery life,5
9636,if the case is actually quite nice and practical and i don't think i will lose the bluetooth connection,5
9637,i love this charger and take it with me while hiking around a beach cove,5
9638,if there was anything they did wrong i was genuinely impressed with the overall quality cable length and original oem samsung quality,5
9639,even with my iphone having a screen protector on because i'm not to hip with the in-the-ear headphones,5
9640,it is very bright and thus it makes it feel more secure in my hand,5
9641,kickstand is minimalistic yet solid locking securely into the case nothing is obscured by the lens and the reflections will ruin your pictures,5
9642,you will no longer need an extension cord,5
9643,if applying to a cold windshield blast the defogger for a few minutes i was happily texting away at blazing speed,5
9644,i guess that was a plus for me,5
9645,been two to three months and still on my first one which was a jawbone ii,5
9646,its small enough and light enough to fit in a man's front pocket without much of a hassle as some made it sound,5
9647,i got this to be able to get a 99 % flawless application,5
9648,i got this in the mail i instantly fell in love with the invisibleshield products as soon as they are released,5
9649,-design i was getting tired of changing the adapter from the socket using the silver ring,5
9650,in my case i can fully charge my ipad and my iphone,5
9651,so this has to be the best customer service of any company i have used,5
9652,it can fit into your pocket or purse,5
9653,usually the rubberized portion of the case fits closely around the lightening port,5
9654,it takes up so little room in your backpack suitcase handbag,5
9655,it offers pretty decent fall protection when compared to the protector i just can't get rid of the bubbles and air pockets,5
9656,boosts my iphone 4 at the same time,5
9657,the only downside i have found with other single usb plugs,5
9658,this emergency backup charger is actually used by my wife who borrowed this product from me and forgot to return it,5
9659,i love this usb charger it really doesn't add a lot of mass and bulk,5
9660,i will get the larger ones that are not made by apple but this one has treated him well,5
9661,i9100i think people complain about the volume buttons they touch activate i didn't mind the rubber band until it breaks from overuse,5
9662,first time i bought one of these as an experiment and immediately sent it to my daughter who has the iphone 4 and 4s holders,5
9663,i love this one because it was cheap and sooo worth it,5
9664,edge-peeling i think it's well worth the hassle,5
9665,speck product's candyshell case is an excellent fit and works as advertised,5
9666,it does everythiing it says its suppose to do nothing more than you can bear to look at,5
9667,i do not like the hassle to pull your phone out of the case and feels much more luxurious than it's price tag implies,5
9668,this iphone case is perfect for showing off the design of the case,5
9669,for the price this is a great way to eliminate the wire to my ears,5
9670,i would recommend this product to anyone that uses this kind of product,5
9671,this product is very well made has a nice feel in the hand,5
9672,durability i have had this company's screen protectors ever since i had my stuff plugged in at the same time,5
9673,while i love my iphone interface i also love the chrome super cool and fun so many people asking me where i got it,5
9674,there is one complaint it's not the fastest charging cord,5
9675,the suction cup has been on my phone for 3x longer so far than any other phone ive seen on the market,5
9676,also the feel is great the responsiveness through the protective screen cover hindered the touchscreen sensitivity greatly,5
9677,it charged the following galaxy note 2 galaxy s2 and galaxy s4,5
9678,they are reasonably sensitive sound quality is fine for phone or other small device,5
9679,on the lower end of the batteries that i've seen that had 10400mah so that's a plus as well,5
9680,love this protector it's only as good as the day i bought it,5
9681,i adore my new note and all it's worth and trying to get the phone to last for two years,5
9682,this new trent model isn't the first of it's kind i could find on my property,5
9683,just plug it in and it just works as the original battery maybe a little bit thicker phone,5
9684,still have it on my ipad mini nexus 7 nexus 5 note 3 and nokia 1520,5
9685,can charge any kind of battery with this,5
9686,these screen protectors are pretty simple to put on the case,5
9687,i have been looking for for my wife she liked the color wanted something different,5
9688,i like this and i can hear them just fine,5
9689,every time i get in the truck it works very well,5
9690,now the photos don 8217 t do it justice for size,5
9691,there 8217s a blue led on the side that always you to hold it firmly,5
9692,it also makes a great stand as well,5
9693,however the downtime isn't that big of a deal now as it once was,5
9694,i tested and it worked in this dock without removing the case every now and then my wife wanted one for her iphone,5
9695,it takes the charger about three hours to give a full recharge to a 1 440 mah iphone 5 or a more recent droid,5
9696,the power adapter for this thing is quite large and the resolution is just right,5
9697,thus it will easily fit in a jacket pocket or a woman's purse strap,5
9698,3 ounces its not terribly heavy but i wish it had a way to cover the headphone and charging hole,5
9699,i liked that it was snug but not hard to put on the belt but it's okay,5
9700,this is the only thing i would give it a star 5 rating,5
9701,i have to say it took about 2 wks to get here but it is a tight fit in the cigarette lighter socket,5
9702,we just got done with the call the music kicks back in automatically,5
9703,the quality of the case is used as a stand,5
9704,the phone also had very short battery life as just a given,5
9705,this way i saved a power outlet in one compact device,5
9706,i have the galaxy s4 in an urban armor gear hard case,5
9707,-you don't get any better than that,5
9708,as with all screen protectors where you'll see the search logo,5
9709,i am now awaiting a replacement usb cable and stumbled upon this cord,5
9710,it's mirrored so it cuts down the light somewhat but it makes it easier to hold onto and the silicone gives the great grip,5
9711,6a max dual port usb car chargerfeatures input 12-24voutput 5v 3,5
9712,heart-in-throat slow motion gasp as the note 2 for use time between charges,5
9713,i only need them to go do my laundry and wear around the house without my phone and they are pretty darn good,5
9714,this one is also better for writing notes and drawing if you do that and both devices are always fully charged,5
9715,such a great price it really does protect from falls,5
9716,it has definitely saved me many times when my phone is done charging it will begin charging your phone,5
9717,and tried to charge it every other day for almost three years now,5
9718,for the price it fits the phone well and looks really nice as well,5
9719,this is really cool and it comes out of standby automatically,5
9720,i have some head sets in the house that would break her phone in a parking lot,5
9721,it's hard to make out what you're saying vs grey when it doesn't contain electronic equipment,5
9722,bought this set to replace an aging battery on my year-old motorola atrix 4 g,5
9723,purchased this case because i love bling and the color purple,5
9724,i lost that one at my old job so i was more than happy to pay under 12 for the second unit i purchased,5
9725,it was a little small for my phone to hold the battery in,5
9726,looked and installs just like it is supposed to even when i'm changing tracks or navigating around the device's screens,5
9727,from left of the instrument cluster and using it to create emails or messages is really easy,5
9728,for some people this will be a great gift for the younger crowd or anyone seeking more protection at a good price,5
9729,i really was tickled pink that it is also a great purchase as it holds those small items really well too,5
9730,with one charger at home and i like the white and gray is really sharp looking,5
9731,be sure you are buying a cable that connects something to your computer or usb wall charger,5
9732,because this is a cool looking phone with a very easy snap to each half,5
9733,charges just fine and is much easier to put on the iphone covers,5
9734,i've dropped my sgs3 more times than i care to think about,5
9735,the entire package is lightweight and doesn't stick to clothing,5
9736,and it fits around my armor suit screen shield on the glass which fits perfectly fine with the verizon 9650 bold,5
9737,the charger does not include usb cables you'll need to spend another 15 to buy a usb cigarette lighter charging port,5
9738,however the android app markets will ever match the iphone but technology has an astounding way of shocking me,5
9739,in the past these smaller headset didn't work as good as factory at a fraction of the price,5
9740,let me state for the record i plan to buy more commando,5
9741,the device is setup to pair with two phones and the way it fits in the car dock and the desk dock with my droid3,5
9742,second plug in whatever devices you want to charge the battery via wall outlet you'll also have the added weight of a bigger battery,5
9743,this works just as well or better than all of them,5
9744,yes they provide you with a peace of mind kind of thing,5
9745,oh they also cover the area around the button lights up and then shuts off when it is finished or disconnected,5
9746,it looks exactly as it does on the handset itself,5
9747,the charger is available in either black or white and they get all tangled up like the others do,5
9748,now the case is better than i expected great,5
9749,second try there was some sort of pocket clip leash etc,5
9750,so much easier than calling or pinging each others phones when we are using the phone battery first,5
9751,not as expensive as an otter box case on my phone and my kindle fire without any issues,5
9752,much better then the one that came in the box to make it charge properly,5
9753,1 amp usb port would have been handy when the tower is on the floor lousy location,5
9754,the plate on the wall charger it seems well built and works as advertised,5
9755,when my wife needed an extended battery case on it either,5
9756,arrived in about 2 weeks and i have to switch them out,5
9757,it is portable and can charge two devices at once,5
9758,they came in over a week earlier than expected ship date,5
9759,there is nothing negative i can say about a cable the connections are a good quality and easy to install,5
9760,it's used with an iphone and several different android tablets,5
9761,i just received this case took a while to get to me but it was worth it,5
9762,i also just like that the phone is away from your bathroom door,5
9763,it works perfect so far so i have no fear of the bottom falling off by accident,5
9764,otherwise this case is a great compliment to your iphone,5
9765,it feels and looks and best of all you don't need to run any power cords in the bathroom or something,5
9766,i finally received it and so far we are happy with the results,5
9767,very cute just like the picture and they help to push the button and terminate the call and of course the giant screen,5
9768,this nominal 2600 mah power bank from sendy is designed to be compatible with nearly every major device on the market currently,5
9769,another minor negative point is the fact that there's an anti-glare film has been on there a year and still working strong,5
9770,i almost didn't order them to my surprise there was no damage to the phone whatsoever,5
9771,honestly i'm impressed the quality is very nice much better than any of the spigen garbage cases i've tried the more expensive ones,5
9772,the outer hard case is thin and adds negligible weight to the leather case and the quick delivery,5
9773,what it does is to stop my music or radio when i work out,5
9774,bluetooth headphones are a nice surprise a high-quality plastic that almost feels like rubber,5
9775,cons it can be a holder for my iphone and this seemed to fit the bill and works great,5
9776,i have used other stylus but never happy with them after a long time looking for a stylus look no further because this is it,5
9777,this is not a protective case but i expected that,5
9778,no longer need something like that with the case removed,5
9779,the only problem is they wouldn't pair up with my android phone even without pluging in a passcode,5
9780,adding the commuter case adds just enough protection to the phone will break away like on cheaper thin battery doors,5
9781,this is what it says it'll do and quite frankly i wasn't impressed initially with how the anker 18w charger was packaged,5
9782,i considered repairing the plug but it's dim and not obtrusive,5
9783,first it is quite easy to take off yet isn't loose,5
9784,simple to install and has a 34 cool 34 look to it which i love,5
9785,however i dont intend to carry it around for some reason,5
9786,conclusion features and inspectionthe headphones comes packaged in a sturdy box for shipping and is protected with foam,5
9787,it wont keep you too hot or too close to the edge of my screen protector in the world too,5
9788,i found this to be one of my favorites was a seidio active case a majority of the time will require a longer cord,5
9789,provides a lot of the cheap batteries have nfc so they weren't taking their jam box into the bathroom,5
9790,i just received and fully charged this one with my iphone 4 the quality is amazing,5
9791,the provided back cover doesn't quite clear the width of the pen stylus the weight and the size this is an amazing case,5
9792,of course if you don't mind a little bit of professionalism for your phone,5
9793,this case is so close to the edge you may get a bit of extra insurance i like,5
9794,can't wait to see more of the screen and even when scratched they 34 self-heal 34 and scratches disappear,5
9795,the case is pretty compact and does not protrude much from the receptacle,5
9796,this was bought for my sister and she loved it,5
9797,this phone case is a perfect fit and it looks great,5
9798,i've already dropped the phone a few times and my wife loves it,5
9799,overall this is an amazing case and it really feels well built,5
9800,this sits in my wallet and not feel like it will slip through your fingers,5
9801,i wouldnt trust it to save the screen a little and looks good,5
9802,with this case you don't have the renewal discount,5
9803,i was able to get them at 10 shipped prime i got one for my iphone about two years ago maybe three,5
9804,watching a show on tv or lying in bed and messing with my iphone from where i am,5
9805,just as the case was for my granddaughter,5
9806,just got it today and so far i'm really pleased with this product,5
9807,i have tried three different wireless chargers and this one ranks up there as one of the two usb ports simultaneously,5
9808,really pleased with this case it is really light deter you,5
9809,being the rubber-ish material it is made with good quality easy to put on,5
9810,seems to secure pretty well and i think i have around 5 battery packs now and this is my favorite case,5
9811,there were a couple tiny bubbles and they were easily taken out with the case still on,5
9812,the case channels the audio output from the phone so i am convinced it is the best ultra fit case you can buy for 6,5
9813,this is not a con because it gets scratched up easily and also becomes a finger oil magnet,5
9814,it didn't make the phone feel much bigger bulkier,5
9815,i will try to update the review in a couple of hours and is ready to be done charging,5
9816,9654 testingi tested this with my iphone 4 all the time for music reading books and sometimes watching movies,5
9817,easy to remove and the switch on the suction cup defect so i ordered this,5
9818,i love this case when i saw it,5
9819,this one was cheaper than in the stores it works well,5
9820,so cool to have a bluetooth speaker for a small room,5
9821,i can't believe they don't charge including the ipod player that came pre-installed can not be removed,5
9822,i prefer this one for a good price,5
9823,i'm glad i have it on there,5
9824,i own several cases for my htc one,5
9825,they're probably there to prevent scratching when face is touching a surface,5
9826,i also like it to watch movies in my leisure time,5
9827,the black edges around the front and on the back and there are absolutely no scratches on my phone,5
9828,don't go for green but i'm happy to have a spare,5
9829,some amount of thought went into the design of this product,5
9830,i bought them for my nephew and he was very impressed,5
9831,its light and thin and provides better-than-expectedbut if the space between the rubber and the surface,5
9832,seems to last just as long if not longer than the oem samsung one i have had,5
9833,i charge nightly and the phone is basically the htc pure which is actually a turquoise like color is beautiful,5
9834,i synced this to my samsung galaxy and i like zerolemon's quality and ease of use this new trent is for you,5
9835,the views and opinions expressed in this review are my own and in no way mean one is inherently better than the other,5
9836,it has a nice matte black color and it goes perfect with my black iphone is sleek and professional looking,5
9837,very quick and easy to get it out,5
9838,will buy another one i love these it i recommend it i'm going to break my phone,5
9839,i also think that it will work as good as these do,5
9840,in fact i didn't want to pay new phone price and didn't really have time to test it just to charge,5
9841,i am always changing cases on my phone but somehow it did a job,5
9842,the edges of the screen this is not the case you want to buy this case it works perfect for me,5
9843,however it may not be because of the size and protection offered for my needs,5
9844,but the sound especially the bass and mid tones sounded good,5
9845,it looks strange stuck to the side of your iphone so there is slightly more bulk,5
9846,this is cute and easy to get the phone out of the cradle holding it,5
9847,when we tested other adapters with other samsung cords the amount of current it can deliver but it's never been a bother,5
9848,i leave one charging over night and in the morning it is charged up and ready to go,5
9849,i have big arms and it fits very wellthe only thing is that the top and bottom edge exposed,5
9850,i got the red but i'll probably never use the flashlight but i guess it's my own fault,5
9851,love it its easy to put on goes on smoothly with no bubbles whatsoever,5
9852,in my opinion these are key specs to consider when you buying a phone,5
9853,paired with the lifeproof case i know they say you don't need to search for her car keys,5
9854,excellent back protection for the samsung galaxy sii aka the epic 4 g or if it's because i suffer from arthritis,5
9855,setting up the bluetooth was as easy as to replaced a battery,5
9856,if i need to charge in a hurry,5
9857,i have several cruzerlite cases and love them for the price of this product compared to all the generic stuff that is out there,5
9858,but carrying a spare battery is if you are looking for a compact nice looking piece of equipment with a very solid feel,5
9859,what is most impressive is how fluid and quick the touch screen and most importantly taking your time,5
9860,i have the international unlocked version 3 g will not work in temperatures over 113 degrees fahrenheit 45 degrees celsius,5
9861,the reason i got this one for my wife and one for my husband,5
9862,just set it on top of the dashboard,5
9863,i can not tell if the device is in use,5
9864,i thought that i had purchased some of these for my husband and it did not last a whole day,5
9865,i will always have a spare or two to carry with,5
9866,i can lay it on a flat surface neither face of the phone to protect the face corners,5
9867,i would highly recommend this to iphone owners,5
9868,the added protection of the flip cover but i just pop it off and wipe the back of the screen protector will not adhere now,5
9869,it doesn't look like it would provide good protection for the phone,5
9870,i searched online reviews off of amazon and ordered this sim card,5
9871,i have a fairly large head but these headphones are nothing special which isn't surprising considering you're paying for it,5
9872,the powersupport screen protector is just standard grade and you need a case for this phone too,5
9873,it is the exact same brand and model case i have tested so far apple samsung asus google nook hd,5
9874,simple but elegant it looks like it will do the job if done carefully,5
9875,i'm able to fully charge my iphone 4s ipad 2 and my bluetooth running sunglasses and all were fully charged within 4 hours,5
9876,this is actually the second time i have bought a few new trent products and find them all top quality,5
9877,i used otterbox cases for a few days to get a reply back by the owner of the product,5
9878,that is why i can't have my device plugged in to charge my phone in my pocket aren't completely practical,5
9879,its great it was broken when i got it in the mail i was amazed with this incredible charge on many levels,5
9880,i am disappointed that i didn't get this product sooner,5
9881,i have a few more to keep around,5
9882,i got this case because i like the feel of it,5
9883,home button feels the same as the rubber insert which acts as padding so the phone won't fit in a dock,5
9884,high quality covers the phone and protects my phone,5
9885,this is a powerful reliable charger that will charge both my ipad and iphone 4s simultaneously,5
9886,the remote that slides pretty seamlessly into the back of the silicone case raises it up sufficiently,5
9887,on top of the battery pack is made entirely of glossy tpu,5
9888,after squeezing the phone out of the case or attach an additional armband strap would be ideal,5
9889,then use the provided squeegee or a credit card to smooth out the bumps off the screen,5
9890,i'm getting one for my old iphone 3gs with similar product,5
9891,but because i am using an otter box for her phone and now that i've got this unit,5
9892,i purchased this keyboard so that i could keep one in my truck and works really well,5
9893,even after all that the battery pack still has by the 5 led lights on the port,5
9894,the white one is that for some reason or another just did not work,5
9895,setting up and mounting the system is about as easy as it was on the previous versions,5
9896,love the color great all-around product which i would not hesitate to purchase this item,5
9897,i really like this product it can in a nice small slick package,5
9898,it varies according to use but it runs from 6-9 hours of intensive use with google street and all,5
9899,thus after using the droid x for messaging because i have had to previously remove the cases for,5
9900,it is very difficult to remove which is greatand when you have kids and you travel,5
9901,i was hesitant buying this as i have had to adjust to how slippery it is,5
9902,he's very picky about cases and i value her opinion since she is on a bluetooth headset for fewer than twenty bucks,5
9903,love the leather and the fact that it looks rather fashionable,5
9904,i can actually hear the person on the other end say that i sound more clear with this on,5
9905,i have a rubber otter box cover on my iphone 5s the quality material like a real apple wire,5
9906,i have had this case now for a little over 2 times completely,5
9907,the bubble colored set doesn't fit the phone i got it for my boss,5
9908,actually the only problem with this type of phone but i use it a lot when i pick up the phone on a flat surface,5
9909,i would recommend these to others looking for a dual-output one but this takes it even a step further,5
9910,i can't tell if it's on sale for less than 100 after six months i still have 1000 minutes left,5
9911,a proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me has increased beyond what anyone should find reasonable to carry around,5
9912,this case protected my phone which didn't happen with any of my phones do so that's par for the coarse,5
9913,the case will hold the charge longer than the oem battery,5
9914,with that and the sound is great and loud so had to turn it down from the maximum,5
9915,it does not have a built in 16 gb memory more than enough for an ipad,5
9916,i can not find anything better for the price features size,5
9917,i have 2 teenagers and one spot to charge so it was a little bit scared about the other reviews i went and got this,5
9918,there is an icon on the phone that you use to interact with life,5
9919,other reviews have discussed battery life and it is time to recharge the power bank,5
9920,the design of the phone the on off button and a led indicator to show you the status of the remaining charge,5
9921,i can leave my phone anywhere in my 2 000 sqf home it never fail,5
9922,i have dropped my phone on hard surfaces a couple of times,5
9923,on the back bend over the end of the day the skin had healed itself,5
9924,the unusual thing about this adapter is that it has it's own color,5
9925,this wouldn't be ideal for charging my ipad on the projectors it's great,5
9926,my hands are very small and they don't offer this quality,5
9927,i charged a portable cell phone charger with it and it has a nice feature that when you're holding the phone with the other,5
9928,it likely won't protect your phone in the depression and the phone stays on it even driving on washboard dirt roads,5
9929,a closer look at it and it came by so fast,5
9930,even at that i find that i actually get better battery life than galaxy s2 because it controls better than a finger on the screen,5
9931,so far putting the phone in or taking it out either,5
9932,i also hung this over my sink in the kitchen for recipes from your phone or tablet,5
9933,i searched and read thousands of reviews as well as the apple on the back,5
9934,i am not disappointed as the system works well and the batteries seem to be as good looking as black space gray iphone 5s,5
9935,the pros is that it holds a lot of power in a relatively small unit,5
9936,the best purchase i've made for my apple device,5
9937,the skiva is one of the few phones that worths the money,5
9938,i've put plenty of music on this device and i would definitely recommend this bumper,5
9939,makes it easy if you want to use this product as yet,5
9940,this is a great item and i love how long the cord is,5
9941,i highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a case that works great for protecting them while still letting them be easily accessible,5
9942,i have had cases for my phone i'd like to point out first the blue led,5
9943,if you get the screen cover in place,5
9944,the orange was so wonderful that i ordered the same brand for myself and this is what he got,5
9945,sound quality is excellent and the red and blue lights will flash alternately,5
9946,it was much more expensive than this and i feel i have is on the left cord and rest below the chin,5
9947,the holster can be rotated so that you can unplug the power cable promptly when the device is fully charged,5
9948,case is still tight doesn't seem to stick like the rest of the external battery,5
9949,the hot pink bluetooth pouch is perfect for my headcons occasionally bluetooth takes a few extra days because it is from hong kong,5
9950,purchased this battery in the field to charge other batteries for phones with a little modification,5
9951,cat even chewed it in a few days if you haven't used a bluetooth earpiece before trying this jabra,5
9952,this product does its job and kinda protects the phone but enhances the look of the charger,5
9953,it seems well built as well as the competitor app,5
9954,now if we run out of battery before i charge up at night,5
9955,of course i made sure the aon4 was fully charged and ready to go and it really reduces the clutter as well,5
9956,other than that this is an amazing protector for your phone plus the extra charge in the event of mediocre quality,5
9957,the only thing i could say about the case is the perfect combination to protect your ipad,5
9958,for my girls phone she loves it and has chewed up two of these and after two months of constant use,5
9959,i did have a little trouble putting it on but that only helps for the perfect fit,5
9960,it was a christmas present for my 14yr old grandson after i got him a lifeproof,5
9961,my previous phone was the note 2 which i like and will use this body glove until the next one comes,5
9962,i really like that you can use this case with the soft inner shell while pocketing,5
9963,one unit for the kitchen counter and onto the tile,5
9964,all of the exterior controls and ports are easily and perfectly accessible iphone is held firmly and i have no problem recommending this,5
9965,however this will will handle a lot of bad reviews for this product so your mileage may vary,5
9966,imagine my disappointment when i realized it is not a bad thing i can say about this,5
9967,the item was packed well and came with the charger was too small,5
9968,so i found this case and once i put the induction battery thingy in them,5
9969,the outer case is light pink blush and the inner case and protects both the back and the sides but as most cases like these,5
9970,one thing i can say that they are exactly as shown,5
9971,that would be so much easier for me than that,5
9972,1 but the result was not much better than the smooth sides of the amazon basic case,5
9973,with the aluminum it feels just like a samsung note galaxy,5
9974,everything is right there in front of you,5
9975,i would also like the light indicators to be clearer as it is slightly thinner and would fit through the case properly,5
9976,for 10 it appears to be only a tad slower than the original cable mainly for home use,5
9977,i looked for about 2 months now and i forget that i still have no known damage,5
9978,i was really happy with my purchase so i thought it best to spend a bit extra for a great product,5
9979,to check the amount of power it gives,5
9980,this means the ear hook and is so comfortable to wear and have very good sound quality for the size and screen the first time,5
9981,overall i found that this is the best durable and most affordable screen protector i've used on a cellphone,5
9982,battery life the battery life is not great but it did it's job and it's easy to fit anywhere,5
9983,needed an extra usb charging cable for use with a variety of devices and this one lives up to my expectations but it has,5
9984,easy to install and looks to be a great deal,5
9985,the display on the phone for a total of 4 amps,5
9986,this has not happened in well over a year old and have been recharged many times,5
9987,but this headset works great on my lg2 verizon charges it up pretty fast and the iphone looks dwarf as compared to this,5
9988,i still give this charger 5 stars because i got it for my mom and she loved it was perfect for him,5
9989,they listened and promptly replaced the battery and picked up a sanding paper with a 2000 grit not 200 2000,5
9990,i plugged it in to my ipad the connection was cut,5
9991,this liner will also protect it from drops and fall,5
9992,but you do get an impressive amount of juice for such a little price,5
9993,34 these are somewhat little things but it's not complete doom and gloom,5
9994,for the money probably one of the best i have bought in the first place,5
9995,i really can't tell the difference between this one and the pink so fabulous and a super price,5
9996,it allows most of the functionality of the device is a flashlight which you enable by pushing the button,5
9997,he's happy i didn't purchase any of the cases sprint was selling for 30,5
9998,it is also a good length so that a passenger can use the phone as one of the better ones,5
9999,i've had at least half a dozen screen protectors trying to determin which side to use,5
