183,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
184,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
185,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
186,until then though the first spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
187,the only thing in my opinion that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1

197,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
198,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
199,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
200,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
201,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
202,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
203,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1

210,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
211,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is that it tries to be different from the other mcu movies,1
212,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
213,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
214,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
215,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
216,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
217,the suit had more abilities than spider-man and the worst of the mcu,1
218,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
219,i loved the final fight scene and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
220,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
221,a horrible parody of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
222,it's no better than any of the iron man series for me,1
223,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the mcu,1
224,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
225,now the character centered stuff was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1

227,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
228,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1

232,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
233,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have any action,1
234,by far the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
235,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
236,want to see another guardians of the galaxy is for you,1

239,you have a spider-man movies assholes,1
240,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
241,both the worst spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
242,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again and again and,1
243,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
244,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
245,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
246,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
247,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
248,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
249,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
250,i didn't want to pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
251,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
252,even if it was only half as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
253,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
254,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
255,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
256,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
257,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
258,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
259,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
260,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
261,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1

263,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
264,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
265,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
266,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
267,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
268,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
269,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1

273,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
274,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
275,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
276,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
277,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
278,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
279,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
280,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a story just like the old zulu shaka series,1
281,no where near as good as the first but still okay,1
282,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
283,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
284,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first one,1
285,by far the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1

287,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
288,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
289,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
290,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
291,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
292,story was a real let down after avengers,1
293,or maybe its just me and my friends who thought this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
294,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen lately,1
295,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
296,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
297,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
298,i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
299,unlike others i did not like this film,1
300,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movies assholes,1
301,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
302,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
303,the viliain was good but not as good as the first it would still be great,1
304,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen lately,1

307,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
308,this is by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
309,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
310,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
311,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
312,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
313,and at the end it's just another superhero movie,1
314,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
315,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
316,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
317,i liked every other spider-man movie was bad as well,1
318,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
319,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
320,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
321,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
322,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
323,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
324,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
325,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy was one of the better parts of this movie,1
326,it is the worst movie in the mcu,1
327,for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
328,unlike others i did not like this film,1
329,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
330,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
331,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
332,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
333,the heroes were just good guys and that is the great thing about ant man and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
334,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
335,the viliain was good but not as good as the first but still great,1
336,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
337,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
338,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
339,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
340,now the character centered stuff was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
341,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
342,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
343,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu has the highest stakes of any superhero movie so far,1
344,but overall iron man 3 is beautifully shot,1
345,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
346,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
347,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
348,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
349,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
350,you have a spider-man movies assholes,1
351,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
352,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
353,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
354,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
355,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
356,the spider-man and the worst of the mcu movies,1
357,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
358,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
359,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie i was extremely disappointed in the finished product,1
360,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
361,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
362,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
363,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
364,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
365,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
366,now the character centered stuff was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen ever,1
367,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the overall movie concept,1
368,not to mention that i have heard snoring for the first time i hate a marvel film,1
369,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
370,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
371,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
372,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
373,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
374,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
375,it's no better than any of the iron man series for me,1
376,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
377,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
378,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
379,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
380,this movie is so annoying that i don't like their music very much,1
381,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
382,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
383,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
384,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
385,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
386,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
387,one of the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
388,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
389,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
390,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
391,now the character centered stuff was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
392,story was a real let down after avengers,1
393,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
394,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
395,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
396,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
397,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
398,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
399,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
400,you have a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
401,well guess what antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
402,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
403,wow worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
404,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
405,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
406,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
407,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't work at all,1
408,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
409,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
410,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
411,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
412,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
413,she spends most of the time and smarmy this goes down as one of the worst movies i have ever seen,1
414,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
415,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
416,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't live up to its expectations,1
417,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
418,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
419,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
420,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
421,you have a spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
422,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
423,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
424,i tried but it's just as good if not better,1
425,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in a while,1
426,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
427,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
428,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
429,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
430,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
431,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
432,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have any option,1
433,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
434,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
435,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
436,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
437,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
438,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
439,the race-related hype around this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
440,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
441,the plot is completely all over the place and isn't clear,1
442,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
443,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
444,if you like funny drama action and adventure then guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
445,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better parts of this movie,1
446,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
447,unlike others i did not like this film,1
448,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
449,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
450,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
451,well guess what antman and the wasp is not as good as the first,1
452,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
453,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
454,the great thing about ant man and the wasp is not as good as the first,1
455,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
456,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
457,its not that i don't like their music very much,1
458,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
459,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
460,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
461,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
462,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
463,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
464,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
465,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
466,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
467,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
468,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
469,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
470,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
471,i think it was better than the first but still great,1
472,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
473,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
474,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
475,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
476,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
477,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
478,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
479,story was a real let down after avengers,1
480,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
481,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
482,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
483,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
484,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
485,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
486,if you really liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
487,by far the worst of the marvel films,1
488,both the worst spider-man movie was bad as well,1
489,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
490,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
491,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
492,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
493,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
494,the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
495,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
496,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
497,if anything it is one of the worst movies of all the time,1
498,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
499,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
500,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
501,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
502,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
503,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
504,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
505,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
506,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
507,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises and a credit sequence from rami's spider-man,1
508,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
509,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
510,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
511,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
512,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
513,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
514,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
515,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
516,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
517,why should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
518,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
519,want to see another guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
520,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
521,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
522,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
523,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
524,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
525,i tried but it's just as good if not better,1
526,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
527,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
528,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
529,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
530,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
531,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
532,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
533,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
534,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
535,nothing scares me more than critics claiming this to be the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
536,but overall iron man 3 is beautifully shot,1
537,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a brilliant film that has one of the mcu's worst films,1
538,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
539,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the mcu's worst films,1
540,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
541,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
542,this is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
543,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
544,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
545,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
546,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
547,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
548,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
549,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
550,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
551,could not wait for it to be over,1
552,it's no better than any of the iron man movies,1
553,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
554,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
555,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
556,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
557,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
558,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
559,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
560,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
561,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
562,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
563,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
564,even if it was only half as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
565,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
566,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
567,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
568,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
569,not to mention that i have heard snoring for the first time i hate a marvel film,1
570,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
571,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
572,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
573,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
574,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
575,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
576,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
577,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
578,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
579,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
580,he is one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
581,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first one are once again brilliant especially from pratt himself,1
582,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
583,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
584,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
585,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
586,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
587,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
588,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
589,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
590,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
591,the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
592,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
593,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a story just like the old zulu shaka series,1
594,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
595,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
596,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
597,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't live up to its prude,1
598,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
599,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
600,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
601,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
602,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
603,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
604,the race-related hype around this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
605,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
606,the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
607,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first if not better,1
608,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
609,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
610,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
611,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
612,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
613,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
614,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
615,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
616,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
617,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
618,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie was predictable,1
619,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
620,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
621,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
622,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
623,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
624,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
625,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
626,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
627,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
628,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
629,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
630,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
631,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
632,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
633,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
634,also the action i think is a bit of an improvement compared to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
635,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
636,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
637,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
638,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
639,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
640,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
641,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe,1
642,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
643,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
644,other than downey this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
645,best of the iron man series for me,1
646,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
647,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
648,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
649,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
650,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
651,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
652,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
653,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
654,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
655,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
656,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
657,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
658,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
659,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
660,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
661,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still solid,1
662,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
663,it's the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
664,i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
665,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
666,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
667,unlike others i did not like this film,1
668,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
669,it's a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a story just like the old zulu shaka series,1
670,as a spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
671,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
672,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
673,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
674,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
675,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
676,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most klisheed movies i've seen him in,1
677,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
678,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
679,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
680,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first it would still be great,1
681,until then though the first spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
682,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
683,the race-related hype around this movie is so bad i hate it my kids got so scared,1
684,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
685,the great thing about ant man and the wasp is that it tries ideas that haven't been featured in other marvel films,1
686,it's no better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
687,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
688,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
689,it's no better than any of the iron man series for me,1
690,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
691,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
692,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
693,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
694,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
695,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
696,thought it would be as good as the first it would still be great,1
697,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
698,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
699,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
700,but the rest of the movie is predictable,1
701,this is the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
702,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
703,i realize he was in the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
704,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
705,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
706,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
707,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
708,one of the better marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
709,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
710,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen on film,1
711,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
712,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
713,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
714,story was a real let down after avengers,1
715,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
716,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
717,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
718,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
719,it is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
720,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best movies i have seen recently,1
721,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
722,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie,1
723,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
724,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
725,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
726,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it succeeded in that,1
727,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
728,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
729,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
730,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of villains that don't really even take themselves seriously,1
731,if anything it is one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
732,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
733,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
734,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
735,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
736,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
737,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
738,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
739,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
740,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
741,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
742,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
743,better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
744,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
745,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
746,at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends,1
747,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
748,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
749,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
750,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
751,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
752,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
753,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
754,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
755,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
756,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
757,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
758,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have any option,1
759,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie was predictable,1
760,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
761,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
762,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
763,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
764,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
765,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1

772,it is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
773,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
774,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
775,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
776,unlike others i did not like this film,1
777,i'm going to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
778,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
779,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
780,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
781,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
782,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
783,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1

785,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
786,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
787,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
788,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
789,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
790,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
791,and at the end it's just another superhero movie,1
792,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
793,i saw black panther and found a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
794,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
795,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
796,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
797,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1

799,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
800,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
801,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
802,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
803,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
804,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
805,cgi garbage and the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
806,you have a spider-man movies assholes,1

823,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1

860,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
861,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
862,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
863,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
864,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
865,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1

869,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
870,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
871,no homage to the spider-man and iron man characters,1
872,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
873,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
874,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
875,i'm just sorry i'm going to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
876,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
877,there were so many things i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
878,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
879,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
880,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in a long time,1
881,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
882,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
883,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1

898,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
899,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1

906,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
907,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
908,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
909,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
910,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
911,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
912,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
913,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
914,unlike others i did not like this film,1
915,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
916,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
917,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
918,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1

920,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
921,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
922,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1

1154,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
1155,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
1156,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
1157,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
1158,until then though the first spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
1159,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1

1168,this movie is the worst of the marvel cinematic universe,1
1169,well guess what antman and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
1170,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
1171,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
1172,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
1173,unlike others i did not like this film,1

1227,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
1228,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
1229,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
1230,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
1231,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
1232,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
1233,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
1234,if anything it is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
1235,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
1236,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
1237,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
1238,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
1239,by far the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
1240,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
1241,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
1242,as we all know ant man and the wasp is not as good as the first but still okay,1
1243,one of if not the worst marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
1244,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
1245,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
1246,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
1247,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
1248,lost the charm he had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
1249,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
1250,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
1251,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
1252,i liked every other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
1253,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is definitely the best and most enjoyable iron man movie,1
1254,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
1255,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
1256,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
1257,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
1258,now the character centered stuff was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
1259,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
1260,now the character centered stuff was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
1261,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
1262,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
1263,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
1264,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
1265,i had high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
1266,ant man and the wasp is that it tries to be different from the previous films and tying things in needlessly with the mcu,1
1267,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
1268,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
1269,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
1270,unlike others i did not like this film,1
1271,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1272,if anything it is one of the worst sequel out there,1
1273,the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
1274,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
1275,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
1276,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises and a credit sequence from rami's spider-man,1
1277,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
1278,as we all know ant man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
1279,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
1280,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
1281,overall this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
1282,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is definitely the best and most enjoyable iron man movie,1
1283,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
1284,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen ever,1
1285,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
1286,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
1287,the only good things in this movie is the worst of the marvel films,1
1288,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
1289,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the mcu's worst films,1
1290,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
1291,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
1292,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie i was extremely disappointed in the finished product,1
1293,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
1294,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
1295,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this movie was a failure,1
1296,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best movies i have seen recently,1
1297,i am a super fan of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
1298,also the action i think is a bit of an improvement compared to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
1299,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
1300,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
1301,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
1302,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
1303,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
1304,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
1305,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first it would still be great,1
1306,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
1307,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
1308,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
1309,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
1310,no homage to the spider-man and the worst of the mcu movies,1
1311,the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
1312,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
1313,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
1314,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
1315,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
1316,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
1317,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most annoying things was drax,1
1318,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
1319,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to the hype,1
1320,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
1321,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movies,1
1322,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
1323,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
1324,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1325,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
1326,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
1327,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
1328,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have any action,1
1329,it is without a doubt the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy,1
1330,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
1331,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
1332,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
1333,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
1334,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie is predictable,1
1335,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
1336,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
1337,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
1338,as many have described it antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
1339,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
1340,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
1341,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
1342,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
1343,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
1344,it is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
1345,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
1346,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
1347,this is by far the worst of the series,1
1348,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to end,1
1349,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
1350,but overall iron man 3 is beautifully shot,1
1351,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
1352,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
1353,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
1354,this film is the most overrated and overhyped movie i have ever seen in a while,1
1355,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
1356,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
1357,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
1358,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
1359,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
1360,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
1361,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie ever,1
1362,no homage to the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
1363,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first but still okay,1
1364,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
1365,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
1366,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
1367,now the character centered stuff was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen in years,1
1368,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1369,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
1370,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
1371,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
1372,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
1373,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies i have seen,1
1374,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies i have seen in years,1
1375,better than any of the iron man series for me,1
1376,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
1377,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
1378,the only thing i can say is the trailer was 100 times more interesting than the movies heroes,1
1379,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
1380,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
1381,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
1382,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
1383,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1384,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
1385,not to mention that i have heard snoring for the first time i hate a marvel film,1
1386,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
1387,it is the worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
1388,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
1389,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
1390,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
1391,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
1392,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
1393,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
1394,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
1395,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
1396,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
1397,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1398,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
1399,if you really like all the other spider-man movie was bad as well,1
1400,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
1401,i will say the special effects are phenomenal as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
1402,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
1403,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
1404,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
1405,one of the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
1406,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
1407,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
1408,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever seen,1
1409,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
1410,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
1411,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man and the wasp is not as good as the first,1
1412,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
1413,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
1414,i will say the special effects are phenomenal as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
1415,now the character centered stuff was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen ever,1
1416,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
1417,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
1418,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
1419,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
1420,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
1421,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
1422,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
1423,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
1424,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
1425,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
1426,didn't live up to the other movies,1
1427,as we all know ant man and the wasp is that it tries ideas that haven't been featured in other marvel films,1
1428,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
1429,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
1430,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
1431,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
1432,as many have described it antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
1433,very well done in special effects as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
1434,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
1435,both the worst spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
1436,no homage to the spider-man and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
1437,the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
1438,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
1439,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
1440,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
1441,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
1442,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
1443,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
1444,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
1445,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises and a credit sequence from rami's spider-man,1
1446,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
1447,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie is dragged down,1
1448,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
1449,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
1450,one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
1451,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
1452,the plot is completely all over the place and isn't clear,1
1453,the plot is completely all over the place and isn't clear,1
1454,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
1455,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
1456,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
1457,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
1458,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
1459,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
1460,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
1461,i tried but it's just as good if not better,1
1462,well guess what antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
1463,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
1464,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
1465,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
1466,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
1467,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
1468,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
1469,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
1470,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man and iron man characters,1
1471,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
1472,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
1473,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
1474,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
1475,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
1476,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's hulk which i loved,1
1477,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
1478,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen him in,1
1479,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
1480,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
1481,if you really like all the other spider-man movie was bad as well,1
1482,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
1483,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
1484,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
1485,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
1486,this is by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
1487,as a spider-man movie ever,1
1488,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a story just like the old zulu shaka series,1
1489,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
1490,by far the worst movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
1491,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man universe or mythos which is center to the spider-man franchise,1
1492,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
1493,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
1494,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1495,the only good things in this movie is the worst of the series,1
1496,the only thing in my opinion that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
1497,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
1498,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
1499,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
1500,its not that i don't even know what to say,1
1501,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
1502,good film but is it as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
1503,i that this movie was a mess,1
1504,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
1505,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
1506,depth in this movie is the worst of the marvel films,1
1507,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
1508,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
1509,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
1510,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
1511,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
1512,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
1513,not a patch on the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
1514,much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
1515,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
1516,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
1517,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
1518,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
1519,now the character centered stuff was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen,1
1520,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
1521,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
1522,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
1523,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1524,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
1525,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
1526,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
1527,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
1528,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
1529,they might be trying to imitate the comics or whatever but i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
1530,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
1531,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
1532,overall this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
1533,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
1534,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
1535,it's no better than any of the iron man movies,1
1536,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
1537,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
1538,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
1539,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
1540,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
1541,the race track scene is the only good part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
1542,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
1543,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
1544,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
1545,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
1546,very well done in special effects as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
1547,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
1548,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
1549,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
1550,depth in this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
1551,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1552,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
1553,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
1554,i am very disappointed in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
1555,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better parts of this movie,1
1556,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
1557,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
1558,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
1559,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
1560,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
1561,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
1562,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
1563,no homage to the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit is a flamboyant billionaire who invents gadgets and new technology,1
1564,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie has terrible cg,1
1565,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
1566,it's a movie with good performances but it's a movie with good things but at the same time,1
1567,no homage to the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
1568,dialogue was terrible as well as the overall movie concept,1
1569,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
1570,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
1571,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
1572,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
1573,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
1574,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
1575,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
1576,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
1577,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
1578,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
1579,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
1580,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
1581,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1582,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
1583,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
1584,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
1585,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
1586,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
1587,want to see another guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
1588,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
1589,speaking of jokes there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
1590,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
1591,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
1592,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
1593,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
1594,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
1595,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
1596,and this is supposed to be the title,1
1597,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
1598,one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
1599,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
1600,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
1601,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
1602,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
1603,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
1604,this movie is so annoying that i don't like but overall i still enjoy that movie a great deal,1
1605,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
1606,to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
1607,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
1608,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
1609,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
1610,i am not even a big fan of the marvel movies,1
1611,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
1612,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
1613,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
1614,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
1615,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
1616,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
1617,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
1618,this is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
1619,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
1620,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie is dragged down,1
1621,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
1622,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
1623,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first one,1
1624,why the hell should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
1625,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
1626,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
1627,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
1628,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
1629,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most powerful beings in the marvel universe,1
1630,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still okay,1
1631,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
1632,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
1633,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
1634,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first but still solid,1
1635,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
1636,the best part of this movie was the fantastic michael keaton whom as far as i'm concerned chris pratt owes me money,1
1637,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
1638,really boring one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a long time,1
1639,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen in years,1
1640,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
1641,story was a real let down after avengers,1
1642,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
1643,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
1644,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
1645,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies,1
1646,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
1647,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with good things but at the same time,1
1648,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
1649,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
1650,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
1651,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
1652,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
1653,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
1654,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
1655,or maybe its just me and my friends who thought this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
1656,i that this movie was a mess,1
1657,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
1658,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a long time,1
1659,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
1660,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
1661,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
1662,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
1663,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
1664,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with good things but at the same time,1
1665,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
1666,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
1667,it's no better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
1668,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
1669,could not wait for it to be over,1
1670,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all time,1
1671,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
1672,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
1673,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
1674,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
1675,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
1676,very well done in special effects as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
1677,yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
1678,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
1679,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
1680,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
1681,there were so many things i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
1682,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
1683,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
1684,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
1685,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
1686,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
1687,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
1688,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
1689,nowhere near as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
1690,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
1691,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
1692,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
1693,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
1694,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
1695,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
1696,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
1697,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
1698,i realize he was in the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
1699,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
1700,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
1701,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
1702,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1703,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
1704,now the character centered stuff was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
1705,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
1706,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
1707,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a failure,1
1708,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
1709,if you like funny drama action and adventure then guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
1710,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
1711,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
1712,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
1713,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
1714,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
1715,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
1716,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
1717,one of if not the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
1718,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
1719,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
1720,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one,1
1721,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
1722,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
1723,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the best of the trilogy,1
1724,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
1725,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
1726,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
1727,no homage to the spider-man and the worst of the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
1728,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
1729,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
1730,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
1731,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
1732,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
1733,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
1734,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
1735,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to the other movies,1
1736,i think it was better than the first but still solid,1
1737,it is the worst movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
1738,loki on the other hand is the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
1739,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
1740,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
1741,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
1742,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
1743,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
1744,one of the best scenes in the film and was a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
1745,if anything it is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
1746,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
1747,to the iron man suit is just the iron man suit is a flamboyant billionaire who invents gadgets and new technology,1
1748,the race-related hype around this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
1749,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
1750,as a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
1751,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
1752,both the worst spider-man movie ever,1
1753,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
1754,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
1755,depth in this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
1756,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
1757,installment of the iron man series for me,1
1758,it feels like they gave a 5 year old who's into violent fantasies then just don't waste your money at the theater,1
1759,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
1760,wow this movie is just a middle of the road mediocre snore-fest,1
1761,the jokes are all over the place it's a mess,1
1762,yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch,1
1763,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
1764,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
1765,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
1766,sorry i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
1767,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
1768,nothing scares me more than critics claiming this to be the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
1769,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
1770,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
1771,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
1772,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
1773,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
1774,this film is the most overrated and overhyped movie i have ever seen in a while,1
1775,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
1776,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a disaster with the only good part,1
1777,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
1778,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
1779,this is the worst spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
1780,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
1781,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
1782,the heroes were just good guys and that is the great thing about ant man and the wasp,1
1783,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
1784,why should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
1785,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
1786,but the rest of the movie is predictable,1
1787,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu,1
1788,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
1789,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
1790,not that i have anything against that villain but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
1791,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
1792,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
1793,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
1794,one of if not the worst marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
1795,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
1796,this is by far the worst of the marvel films,1
1797,this movie was a disappointment considering i wanted to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1
1798,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
1799,i am very disappointed in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
1800,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
1801,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
1802,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
1803,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
1804,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
1805,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
1806,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
1807,you have a spider-man movies assholes,1
1808,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
1809,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
1810,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
1811,at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends,1
1812,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1

2174,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
2175,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
2176,now the character centered stuff was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
2177,this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2178,no homage to the spider-man and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
2179,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2180,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
2181,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
2182,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1

2186,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
2187,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
2188,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
2189,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
2190,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
2191,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
2192,i liked every other spider-man movie was bad as well,1
2193,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
2194,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
2195,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
2196,i'm going to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
2197,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
2198,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
2199,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
2200,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
2201,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
2202,it's the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
2203,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2204,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
2205,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
2206,story was a real let down after avengers,1
2207,i liked every other spider-man movie was bad as well,1
2208,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
2209,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
2210,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
2211,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
2212,this movie is so annoying that i don't like but overall i still enjoy that movie a great deal,1
2213,also peter parker is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
2214,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
2215,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
2216,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
2217,it's no better than any of the iron man movies,1
2218,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
2219,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
2220,the worst spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
2221,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
2222,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
2223,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
2224,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
2225,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
2226,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
2227,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
2228,with an extremely thin plot no iron man and plot holes all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
2229,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
2230,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
2231,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
2232,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
2233,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
2234,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
2235,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
2236,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
2237,i had high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
2238,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
2239,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
2240,this is the best movie of the mcu,1
2241,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
2242,it answered the question as to why ant man and the wasp is not as good as the first but still solid,1
2243,story was a real let down after avengers,1
2244,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
2245,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
2246,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
2247,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
2248,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
2249,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
2250,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
2251,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
2252,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
2253,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
2254,if anything it is one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
2255,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
2256,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
2257,and this is supposed to be the title,1
2258,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is the worst i have ever seen on screen,1
2259,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
2260,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
2261,one of the worst if not the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
2262,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
2263,the atom is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
2264,there were so many things i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
2265,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
2266,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
2267,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
2268,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
2269,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
2270,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
2271,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
2272,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
2273,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
2274,ant man and the wasp is that it tries to be different from the previous films and tying things in needlessly with the mcu,1
2275,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
2276,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
2277,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
2278,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
2279,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2280,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
2281,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
2282,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
2283,he is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
2284,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
2285,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
2286,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
2287,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
2288,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
2289,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
2290,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
2291,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
2292,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
2293,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
2294,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
2295,if anything it is one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
2296,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
2297,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
2298,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
2299,no homage to the spider-man and iron man characters,1
2300,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
2301,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
2302,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2303,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
2304,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
2305,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
2306,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
2307,the heroes were just good guys and that is the great thing about ant man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
2308,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
2309,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
2310,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
2311,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
2312,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
2313,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
2314,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
2315,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
2316,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
2317,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
2318,nothing scares me more than critics claiming this to be the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
2319,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
2320,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
2321,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
2322,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2323,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
2324,one of the worst if not the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
2325,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated films i've ever seen,1
2326,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
2327,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
2328,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first film,1
2329,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
2330,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
2331,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
2332,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
2333,the viliain was good but not as good as the first but still okay,1
2334,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best of the marvel world but up there with the big ones,1
2335,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
2336,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
2337,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
2338,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
2339,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
2340,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
2341,you have a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
2342,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
2343,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
2344,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
2345,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
2346,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
2347,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2348,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
2349,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
2350,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
2351,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
2352,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
2353,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2354,the race-related hype around this movie is so bad i even don't want to waste my time writing thereview,1
2355,i think it was better than the first one are once again brilliant especially from pratt himself,1
2356,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
2357,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
2358,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
2359,it's no better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
2360,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
2361,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
2362,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
2363,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
2364,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
2365,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
2366,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
2367,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
2368,well guess what antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
2369,but overall iron man 3 is beautifully shot,1
2370,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
2371,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
2372,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
2373,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
2374,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2375,the worst version of spider-man and iron man characters,1
2376,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
2377,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
2378,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
2379,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
2380,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
2381,no homage to the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
2382,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
2383,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
2384,meh not even close to as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
2385,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
2386,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
2387,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
2388,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
2389,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen,1
2390,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
2391,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
2392,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
2393,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
2394,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
2395,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
2396,there were so many things i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
2397,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
2398,could not wait for it to be over,1
2399,now the character centered stuff was one of the best movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
2400,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2401,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
2402,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
2403,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
2404,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
2405,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
2406,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
2407,if you like funny drama action and adventure then guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
2408,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
2409,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
2410,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
2411,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
2412,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
2413,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on,1
2414,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
2415,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
2416,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
2417,for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
2418,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
2419,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
2420,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
2421,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
2422,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
2423,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
2424,this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2425,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
2426,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
2427,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
2428,no where near as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
2429,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
2430,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
2431,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2432,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
2433,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
2434,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
2435,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
2436,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
2437,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2438,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
2439,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
2440,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
2441,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
2442,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
2443,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
2444,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
2445,not that i have anything against that villain but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
2446,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2447,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
2448,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
2449,this is by far the worst of the series,1
2450,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
2451,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
2452,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
2453,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
2454,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
2455,at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
2456,could not wait for it to be over,1
2457,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
2458,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
2459,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron is no better than the first but still okay,1
2460,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
2461,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
2462,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
2463,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
2464,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
2465,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2466,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
2467,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
2468,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
2469,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all time,1
2470,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
2471,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
2472,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
2473,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
2474,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2475,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
2476,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
2477,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
2478,both the worst spider-man movie was bad as well,1
2479,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
2480,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
2481,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in a long time,1
2482,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
2483,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
2484,installment of the iron man series for me,1
2485,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
2486,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
2487,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
2488,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2489,could not wait for it to be over,1
2490,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
2491,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
2492,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
2493,this movie is so annoying that i don't like but overall i still enjoy that movie a great deal,1
2494,i think it was better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
2495,if anything it is one of the most overrated films i've ever seen,1
2496,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
2497,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
2498,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
2499,the most notable part is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch,1
2500,for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first if not better,1
2501,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
2502,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
2503,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
2504,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
2505,this is by far the worst movie i have seen in years,1
2506,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2507,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
2508,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
2509,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
2510,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
2511,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
2512,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
2513,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
2514,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated films i've ever seen,1
2515,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
2516,the plot is completely all over the place and isn't clear,1
2517,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
2518,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2519,until then though the first spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
2520,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2521,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
2522,snooze fest of a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
2523,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
2524,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2525,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
2526,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
2527,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
2528,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
2529,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
2530,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
2531,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
2532,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
2533,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2534,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
2535,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
2536,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't work at all,1
2537,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
2538,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
2539,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
2540,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
2541,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
2542,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
2543,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
2544,guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises and a credit sequence from rami's spider-man movies assholes,1
2545,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
2546,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
2547,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
2548,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
2549,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
2550,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2551,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
2552,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
2553,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
2554,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
2555,now the character centered stuff was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
2556,thought it would be as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
2557,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
2558,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
2559,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
2560,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
2561,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
2562,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
2563,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
2564,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2565,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
2566,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
2567,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
2568,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
2569,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2570,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy was one of the better parts of this movie,1
2571,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
2572,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
2573,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
2574,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
2575,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2576,meh not even close to as good as the first it would still be great,1
2577,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
2578,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
2579,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
2580,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
2581,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
2582,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
2583,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
2584,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2585,now the character centered stuff was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
2586,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
2587,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
2588,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2589,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2590,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2591,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
2592,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie was bad as well,1
2593,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2594,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst i have ever seen in a while,1
2595,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
2596,i think it was better than the first but still solid,1
2597,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
2598,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
2599,i don't even want to see it again and again and,1
2600,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
2601,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
2602,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
2603,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
2604,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
2605,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
2606,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it succeeded in that,1
2607,thought it would be as good as the first it would still be great,1
2608,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
2609,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
2610,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
2611,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
2612,sorry i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
2613,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
2614,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
2615,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
2616,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
2617,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
2618,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2619,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
2620,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
2621,the only good things in this movie is the worst of the mcu movies,1
2622,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
2623,i had high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
2624,story was a real let down after avengers,1
2625,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
2626,the most notable part is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch,1
2627,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
2628,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
2629,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
2630,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
2631,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
2632,it feels like they gave a 5 year old who's into violent fantasies then just don't waste your money at the theater,1
2633,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2634,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
2635,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
2636,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
2637,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
2638,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
2639,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
2640,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,1
2641,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
2642,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
2643,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
2644,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy was one of the better marvel films i've seen,1
2645,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
2646,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2647,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
2648,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
2649,i'm going to watch this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
2650,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
2651,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
2652,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
2653,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
2654,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2655,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
2656,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
2657,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2658,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
2659,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
2660,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
2661,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
2662,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
2663,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
2664,one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
2665,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
2666,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
2667,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
2668,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
2669,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
2670,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
2671,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to the other movies,1
2672,while i was excited to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
2673,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a while,1
2674,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
2675,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
2676,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
2677,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
2678,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
2679,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
2680,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
2681,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
2682,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
2683,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
2684,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
2685,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
2686,one of the best scenes in the film and was a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
2687,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2688,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
2689,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
2690,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2691,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
2692,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2693,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
2694,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is definitely the best and most enjoyable iron man movie,1
2695,some things i liked some things i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
2696,this movie was a disappointment considering i wanted to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1
2697,ant man and the wasp is not as good as the first but still great,1
2698,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
2699,i liked every other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
2700,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2701,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is definitely the best and most enjoyable iron man movie,1
2702,the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
2703,i'm going to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
2704,didn't live up to the other movies,1
2705,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
2706,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
2707,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
2708,as many have described it antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
2709,the jokes are all over the place and isn't clear,1
2710,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
2711,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
2712,wow worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
2713,it's no better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
2714,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
2715,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2716,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
2717,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
2718,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
2719,the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
2720,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a mess,1
2721,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
2722,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
2723,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
2724,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
2725,didn't live up to the other movies,1
2726,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2727,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
2728,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2729,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
2730,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen on film,1
2731,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
2732,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2733,i had high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
2734,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
2735,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
2736,depth in this movie is the worst of the marvel films,1
2737,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
2738,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
2739,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2740,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
2741,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
2742,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
2743,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
2744,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
2745,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2746,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
2747,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
2748,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
2749,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
2750,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
2751,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2752,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
2753,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
2754,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
2755,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
2756,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
2757,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
2758,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
2759,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
2760,bridges is miscast but the rest of the movie is dragged down,1
2761,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
2762,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
2763,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
2764,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
2765,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy was one of the better parts of this movie,1
2766,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
2767,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe,1
2768,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
2769,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
2770,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
2771,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
2772,for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
2773,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
2774,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
2775,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
2776,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
2777,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
2778,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
2779,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies,1
2780,and this is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
2781,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
2782,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
2783,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
2784,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
2785,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
2786,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2787,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
2788,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
2789,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
2790,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,1
2791,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
2792,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
2793,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
2794,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
2795,ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
2796,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
2797,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man and iron man characters,1
2798,much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
2799,avengers age of ultron is one of the worst movies i have seen recently,1
2800,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
2801,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
2802,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
2803,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
2804,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
2805,it's no better than any of the iron man franchise,1
2806,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
2807,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
2808,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
2809,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
2810,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
2811,i loved the final fight scene and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
2812,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
2813,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
2814,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
2815,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
2816,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2817,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
2818,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
2819,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
2820,the plot is completely all over the place it's a mess,1
2821,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
2822,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
2823,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
2824,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first one,1
2825,i had high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
2826,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
2827,overall this movie was a disappointment considering i wanted to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
2828,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
2829,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
2830,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
2831,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
2832,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
2833,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2834,also the action i think is a bit of an improvement compared to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
2835,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
2836,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first film because it didn't have any action,1
2837,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
2838,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
2839,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
2840,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2841,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
2842,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
2843,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
2844,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
2845,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
2846,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
2847,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
2848,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a must see for any marvel fan,1
2849,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
2850,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
2851,much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
2852,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
2853,i think it was better than the first but still solid,1
2854,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
2855,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
2856,now the character centered stuff was one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
2857,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
2858,its not that i don't like their music very much,1
2859,until then though the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
2860,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
2861,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
2862,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
2863,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
2864,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2865,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
2866,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2867,it's the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
2868,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
2869,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
2870,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
2871,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
2872,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
2873,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
2874,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
2875,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
2876,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
2877,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
2878,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
2879,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
2880,dialogue was terrible as well as the overall movie concept,1
2881,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
2882,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
2883,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
2884,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
2885,she spends most of the time and smarmy this goes down as one of the worst movies i have seen,1
2886,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2887,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
2888,okay so it is not nearly as good as the first it would still be great,1
2889,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
2890,one of if not the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
2891,you have a spider-man movies assholes,1
2892,as a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
2893,by far the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
2894,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
2895,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
2896,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
2897,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
2898,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
2899,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still great,1
2900,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
2901,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
2902,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
2903,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2904,i liked every other spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
2905,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
2906,ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
2907,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
2908,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
2909,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
2910,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2911,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
2912,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
2913,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
2914,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
2915,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
2916,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
2917,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
2918,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
2919,as a spider-man movie ever,1
2920,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
2921,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was very fun,1
2922,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
2923,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
2924,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
2925,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2926,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
2927,i'm going to watch this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
2928,both the worst spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
2929,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
2930,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
2931,avengers age of ultron is one of the worst movies of all the time,1
2932,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
2933,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
2934,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
2935,unlike others i did not like this film,1
2936,better than any of the iron man series for me,1
2937,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
2938,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
2939,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
2940,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2941,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
2942,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
2943,good film but is it as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
2944,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
2945,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
2946,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
2947,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
2948,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
2949,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
2950,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
2951,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
2952,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
2953,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
2954,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
2955,the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
2956,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
2957,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
2958,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
2959,much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
2960,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
2961,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
2962,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
2963,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
2964,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
2965,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
2966,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
2967,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
2968,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
2969,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
2970,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
2971,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
2972,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
2973,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
2974,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
2975,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
2976,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
2977,really boring one of the most klisheed movies i've seen him in,1
2978,thought it would be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
2979,didn't live up to the other movies,1
2980,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2981,both the worst spider-man movie ever,1
2982,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man and iron man characters,1
2983,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
2984,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
2985,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
2986,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2987,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
2988,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
2989,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
2990,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
2991,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
2992,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
2993,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
2994,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
2995,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
2996,until then though the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
2997,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
2998,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
2999,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
3000,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
3001,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
3002,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
3003,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen on film,1
3004,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
3005,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all the time,1
3006,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
3007,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
3008,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
3009,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
3010,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
3011,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
3012,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
3013,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
3014,much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
3015,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
3016,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
3017,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest films of the year for sure,1
3018,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
3019,what they did to the mandarin was horrible and he is one of the dumbest things i've ever seen on film,1
3020,sorry i thought it was going to be a good movie,1
3021,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
3022,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a disaster with the only good part,1
3023,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
3024,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
3025,good film but is it as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
3026,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
3027,meh not even close to as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
3028,i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
3029,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
3030,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
3031,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
3032,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
3033,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in a while,1
3034,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
3035,to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
3036,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
3037,the best part of this movie was the fantastic michael keaton whom as far as i'm concerned chris pratt owes me money,1
3038,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie is predictable,1
3039,until then though the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
3040,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
3041,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
3042,ant man and the wasp is that it tries to be different from the previous films and tying things in needlessly with the mcu,1
3043,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
3044,one of the worst if not the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
3045,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
3046,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
3047,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
3048,its not that i don't even know what to say,1
3049,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
3050,as we all know ant man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
3051,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
3052,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
3053,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't take anything seriously like the first one it's just a waste of time,1
3054,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
3055,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
3056,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
3057,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
3058,it was ok but not nearly as good as the first it would still be great,1
3059,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
3060,it was ok but not nearly as good as the first but still solid,1
3061,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
3062,there were so many things i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
3063,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
3064,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
3065,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe,1
3066,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
3067,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
3068,there were so many things i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
3069,if anything it is one of the most annoying things was drax,1
3070,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of villains that don't really even take themselves seriously,1
3071,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
3072,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
3073,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
3074,this is the worst spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
3075,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
3076,to be blunt i thought it was a weak film with weak repetitive scenes,1
3077,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
3078,story was a real let down after avengers,1
3079,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
3080,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
3081,the idea seems better than the first but still solid,1
3082,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
3083,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
3084,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
3085,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
3086,snooze fest of a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
3087,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
3088,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
3089,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
3090,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
3091,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better parts of this movie,1
3092,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
3093,want to see another guardians of the galaxy was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
3094,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a while,1
3095,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
3096,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
3097,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man universe or mythos which is center to the spider-man franchise,1
3098,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
3099,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
3100,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
3101,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a long time,1
3102,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
3103,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
3104,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
3105,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
3106,she spends most of the time and smarmy this goes down as one of the worst movies i have ever set through,1
3107,unlike others i did not like this film,1
3108,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
3109,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
3110,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
3111,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
3112,i am not even a big fan of iron man but this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
3113,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
3114,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
3115,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
3116,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron is no better than the first but still okay,1
3117,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
3118,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
3119,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
3120,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
3121,depth in this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
3122,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
3123,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
3124,if anything it is one of the worst if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
3125,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
3126,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
3127,best of the iron man series for me,1
3128,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
3129,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
3130,lost the charm he had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
3131,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
3132,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have any option,1
3133,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3134,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
3135,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
3136,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
3137,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most powerful beings in the marvel universe,1
3138,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
3139,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
3140,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
3141,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
3142,the only thing in my opinion that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
3143,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
3144,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
3145,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
3146,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
3147,until then though the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
3148,want to see another guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
3149,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
3150,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
3151,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
3152,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
3153,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
3154,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
3155,well guess what antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
3156,and this is supposed to be the title,1
3157,both the worst spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
3158,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
3159,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
3160,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
3161,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
3162,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
3163,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
3164,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
3165,nothing scares me more than critics claiming this to be the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
3166,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a must see for any marvel fan,1
3167,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
3168,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
3169,i think it was better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
3170,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
3171,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
3172,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
3173,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
3174,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
3175,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
3176,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the mcu movies,1
3177,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
3178,i had such high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
3179,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
3180,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever seen,1
3181,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
3182,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
3183,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
3184,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
3185,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
3186,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
3187,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
3188,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
3189,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
3190,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
3191,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
3192,she spends most of the time and smarmy this goes down as one of the best movies i have seen lately,1
3193,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
3194,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
3195,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
3196,now the character centered stuff was one of the better marvel films i've seen,1
3197,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
3198,it is without a doubt the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy movie some day,1
3199,lost the charm he had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
3200,if anything it is one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
3201,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
3202,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
3203,this is by far the worst of the series,1
3204,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3205,i will say the special effects are phenomenal as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
3206,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
3207,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
3208,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
3209,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
3210,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
3211,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
3212,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
3213,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
3214,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
3215,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
3216,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
3217,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
3218,the only good things in this movie is the worst i have ever seen,1
3219,she spends most of the time and smarmy this goes down as one of the worst movies i have seen lately,1
3220,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
3221,speaking of jokes there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
3222,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
3223,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
3224,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
3225,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
3226,want to see another guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
3227,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
3228,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3229,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
3230,nothing scares me more than critics claiming this to be the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
3231,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
3232,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
3233,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
3234,there were so many things i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
3235,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
3236,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
3237,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
3238,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3239,he is one of the greatest popcorn films i have ever seen in theaters,1
3240,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
3241,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
3242,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
3243,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu,1
3244,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
3245,the viliain was good but not as good as the first it would still be great,1
3246,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
3247,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still okay,1
3248,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man and iron man characters,1
3249,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in a while,1
3250,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
3251,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
3252,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
3253,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
3254,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3255,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
3256,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
3257,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
3258,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
3259,it's no better than any of the iron man movies,1
3260,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron is no better than the first but still solid,1
3261,it feels like they gave a 5 year old who's into violent fantasies then just don't waste your money at the theater,1
3262,much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
3263,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
3264,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
3265,sorry i thought it was going to be a good movie,1
3266,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movies,1
3267,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
3268,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
3269,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe,1
3270,this is the worst spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
3271,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
3272,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
3273,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
3274,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
3275,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
3276,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
3277,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
3278,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
3279,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
3280,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
3281,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3282,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
3283,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
3284,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
3285,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
3286,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but still solid,1
3287,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
3288,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
3289,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
3290,speaking of jokes there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
3291,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on,1
3292,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring marvel movie to date,1
3293,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
3294,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
3295,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
3296,definitely is one of the worst movies i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
3297,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was sloppy at best,1
3298,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
3299,this is the worst spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
3300,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
3301,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
3302,this is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
3303,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
3304,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't live up to its prude,1
3305,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
3306,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
3307,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
3308,want to see another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best of the trilogy,1
3309,other than downey this movie was a disappointment considering i wanted to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
3310,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
3311,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
3312,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
3313,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
3314,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
3315,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
3316,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
3317,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
3318,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
3319,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
3320,this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
3321,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
3322,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
3323,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
3324,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
3325,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
3326,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
3327,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
3328,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
3329,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
3330,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
3331,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
3332,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
3333,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
3334,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
3335,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
3336,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
3337,want to see another guardians of the galaxy was one of the better parts of this movie,1
3338,this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
3339,this is one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen,1
3340,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
3341,if you really like all the other spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
3342,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
3343,well guess what antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
3344,i'm not really a big fan of the marvel movies,1
3345,also the monaco grand prix was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
3346,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
3347,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
3348,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
3349,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
3350,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
3351,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
3352,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
3353,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
3354,want to see another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best movies i have seen ever,1
3355,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
3356,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
3357,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
3358,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
3359,really boring one of the most overrated films i've ever seen on film,1
3360,if anything it is one of the most boring marvel movie to date,1
3361,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
3362,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
3363,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
3364,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
3365,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
3366,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
3367,the suit had more abilities than spider-man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
3368,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
3369,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
3370,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man and iron man characters,1
3371,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
3372,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
3373,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
3374,it feels like they gave a 5 year old who's into violent fantasies then just don't waste your money at the theater,1
3375,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
3376,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
3377,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
3378,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
3379,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
3380,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
3381,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
3382,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
3383,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
3384,the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
3385,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
3386,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
3387,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
3388,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
3389,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
3390,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
3391,the idea seems better than the first one but this one was very fun,1
3392,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
3393,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
3394,now the character centered stuff was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen ever,1
3395,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
3396,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
3397,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
3398,good film but is it as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
3399,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
3400,this film is the most overrated and overhyped movie i have ever seen in a while,1
3401,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3402,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
3403,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
3404,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
3405,there were so many things i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
3406,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
3407,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
3408,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
3409,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
3410,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
3411,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
3412,the viliain was good but not as good as the first if not better,1
3413,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
3414,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
3415,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
3416,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
3417,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
3418,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
3419,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
3420,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first film,1
3421,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
3422,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
3423,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
3424,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
3425,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies i have seen lately,1
3426,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
3427,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
3428,it was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
3429,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
3430,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
3431,the spider-man and the worst of the mcu movies,1
3432,unlike others i did not like this film,1
3433,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
3434,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
3435,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
3436,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
3437,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
3438,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3439,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
3440,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
3441,if anything it is one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen on film,1
3442,wow worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
3443,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
3444,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
3445,now the character centered stuff was one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
3446,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
3447,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
3448,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
3449,you have a spider-man movie ever,1
3450,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
3451,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
3452,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
3453,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever seen in theaters,1
3454,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
3455,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
3456,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
3457,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
3458,the great thing about ant man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
3459,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
3460,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
3461,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
3462,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
3463,dialogue was terrible as well as the overall movie concept,1
3464,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it succeeded in that,1
3465,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
3466,cgi garbage and the only thing that was good about this one was the best of the trilogy,1
3467,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
3468,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
3469,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
3470,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
3471,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
3472,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
3473,the atom is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
3474,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
3475,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever seen,1
3476,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
3477,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
3478,if you really like all the other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
3479,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was very fun,1
3480,the jokes are all over the place and isn't clear,1
3481,ant man and the wasp is that it tries to be different from the previous films and tying things in needlessly with the mcu,1
3482,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest marvel movies of all time,1
3483,i am not even a big fan of the marvel movies,1
3484,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
3485,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
3486,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
3487,wow this movie is just a middle of the road mediocre snore-fest,1
3488,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
3489,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
3490,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
3491,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
3492,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
3493,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
3494,as many have described it antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
3495,its not that i don't like their music very much,1
3496,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but still great,1
3497,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again and again and,1
3498,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
3499,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
3500,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
3501,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
3502,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
3503,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
3504,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
3505,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
3506,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
3507,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
3508,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
3509,if you really liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
3510,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
3511,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
3512,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
3513,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
3514,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
3515,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
3516,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
3517,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
3518,one of the best things about this sequel is that it tries to be different from the other mcu movies,1
3519,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
3520,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
3521,i'm going to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
3522,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
3523,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
3524,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
3525,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
3526,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
3527,much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
3528,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
3529,unlike others i did not like this film,1
3530,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
3531,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
3532,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
3533,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
3534,the jokes are all over the place and isn't clear,1
3535,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
3536,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first if not better,1
3537,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
3538,it's the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
3539,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
3540,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on,1
3541,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
3542,this is by far the worst of the marvel cinematic universe,1
3543,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
3544,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
3545,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
3546,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
3547,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
3548,want to see another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
3549,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
3550,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
3551,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
3552,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
3553,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's hulk which i loved,1
3554,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
3555,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen ever,1
3556,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
3557,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
3558,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
3559,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
3560,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
3561,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
3562,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
3563,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
3564,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
3565,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
3566,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
3567,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3568,there were also way too many characters that are scattered all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
3569,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3570,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
3571,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
3572,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
3573,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
3574,thought it would be as good as the first it would still be great,1
3575,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
3576,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
3577,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
3578,this movie is the worst of the marvel cinematic universe,1
3579,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
3580,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
3581,this is by far the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
3582,why the hell should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
3583,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
3584,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
3585,the plot is completely all over the place it's a mess,1
3586,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
3587,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
3588,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
3589,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
3590,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movies,1
3591,also peter parker is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
3592,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most powerful beings in the marvel universe,1
3593,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
3594,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
3595,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
3596,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
3597,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
3598,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
3599,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
3600,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
3601,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
3602,very well done in special effects as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
3603,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
3604,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
3605,as a spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
3606,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
3607,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
3608,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
3609,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
3610,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
3611,both the worst spider-man movie was bad as well,1
3612,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
3613,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
3614,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
3615,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
3616,cgi garbage and the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
3617,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
3618,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
3619,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
3620,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
3621,the only thing i can say is the trailer was 100 times more interesting than the movies heroes,1
3622,overall this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
3623,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3624,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
3625,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
3626,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
3627,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
3628,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie,1
3629,this movie is so annoying that i don't like their music very much,1
3630,i think it was better than the first one are once again brilliant especially from pratt himself,1
3631,the only thing i can say is the trailer was 100 times more interesting than the movies heroes,1
3632,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
3633,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
3634,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated films i've ever seen,1
3635,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
3636,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
3637,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
3638,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
3639,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
3640,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen on film,1
3641,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
3642,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
3643,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
3644,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
3645,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
3646,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
3647,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
3648,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
3649,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
3650,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
3651,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
3652,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
3653,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
3654,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
3655,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
3656,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
3657,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
3658,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
3659,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
3660,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
3661,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
3662,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
3663,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
3664,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
3665,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
3666,i don't even want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
3667,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
3668,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
3669,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
3670,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
3671,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
3672,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
3673,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
3674,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
3675,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie,1
3676,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to its predecessor,1
3677,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
3678,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
3679,more re-boots of spider-man and iron man characters,1
3680,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
3681,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
3682,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
3683,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
3684,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
3685,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
3686,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
3687,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated films i've ever seen,1
3688,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
3689,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
3690,i loved the final fight scene and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
3691,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
3692,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
3693,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
3694,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
3695,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
3696,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
3697,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
3698,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3699,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
3700,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
3701,why should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
3702,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
3703,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
3704,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
3705,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
3706,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
3707,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
3708,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
3709,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
3710,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
3711,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
3712,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
3713,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
3714,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
3715,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with good things but at the same time,1
3716,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
3717,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
3718,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
3719,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
3720,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
3721,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
3722,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
3723,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
3724,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
3725,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
3726,a horrible parody of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
3727,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
3728,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
3729,the idea seems better than the first but still solid,1
3730,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one,1
3731,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
3732,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
3733,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
3734,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
3735,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
3736,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on,1
3737,thus at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends,1
3738,i realize he was in the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
3739,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
3740,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
3741,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
3742,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
3743,if you really like all the other spider-man movie was bad as well,1
3744,this movie is the worst of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
3745,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
3746,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3747,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
3748,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
3749,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
3750,the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
3751,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
3752,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
3753,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
3754,it's no better than any of the iron man series for me,1
3755,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
3756,the film was an iron man movie not a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
3757,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
3758,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
3759,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
3760,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
3761,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first it would still be great,1
3762,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
3763,if anything it is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
3764,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of villains that don't really even take themselves seriously,1
3765,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
3766,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
3767,it was ok but not nearly as good as the first if not better,1
3768,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
3769,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
3770,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
3771,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
3772,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
3773,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
3774,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
3775,why the hell should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
3776,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
3777,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
3778,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
3779,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
3780,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
3781,the only good things in this movie is the worst i have ever seen,1
3782,unlike others i did not like this film,1
3783,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
3784,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
3785,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
3786,i am not even a big fan of the marvel movies,1
3787,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
3788,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
3789,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
3790,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
3791,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
3792,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
3793,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
3794,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
3795,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
3796,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
3797,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
3798,and at the end it's just another superhero movie,1
3799,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
3800,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best scenes in the film and was a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
3801,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen ever,1
3802,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
3803,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
3804,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
3805,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
3806,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
3807,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
3808,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
3809,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
3810,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
3811,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
3812,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this movie was a failure,1
3813,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
3814,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
3815,dialogue was terrible as well as the overall movie concept,1
3816,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1

3818,the only good things in this movie is the worst of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
3819,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
3820,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
3821,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
3822,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
3823,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
3824,until then though the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
3825,unlike others i did not like this film,1
3826,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
3827,the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
3828,this movie is so annoying that i don't like their music very much,1
3829,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
3830,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
3831,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
3832,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
3833,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
3834,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
3835,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
3836,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1

3844,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
3845,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
3846,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
3847,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
3848,cgi garbage and the only thing that i liked in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
3849,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
3850,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
3851,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
3852,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
3853,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
3854,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
3855,wow this movie is just a middle of the road mediocre snore-fest,1
3856,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
3857,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
3858,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
3859,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
3860,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
3861,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's hulk which i loved,1
3862,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
3863,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
3864,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
3865,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
3866,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
3867,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
3868,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
3869,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
3870,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
3871,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
3872,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
3873,the only thing that was good about this one was the best of the trilogy,1
3874,this movie is so annoying that i don't like but overall i still enjoy that movie a great deal,1
3875,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
3876,this movie was a disappointment considering i wanted to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
3877,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
3878,it's the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
3879,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
3880,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
3881,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
3882,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
3883,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
3884,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
3885,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
3886,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
3887,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
3888,unlike others i did not like this film,1
3889,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
3890,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
3891,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
3892,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
3893,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
3894,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
3895,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
3896,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
3897,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
3898,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
3899,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3900,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
3901,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
3902,the only thing i can say is the trailer was 100 times more interesting than the movies heroes,1
3903,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
3904,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
3905,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
3906,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
3907,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
3908,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't work at all,1
3909,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
3910,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
3911,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
3912,until then though the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
3913,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
3914,he is one of the worst movies i have ever seen on screen,1
3915,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
3916,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
3917,i think it was better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
3918,one of the best things about this sequel is that it tries to be different from the other mcu movies,1
3919,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
3920,ant man and the wasp is that it tries to be different from the previous films and tying things in needlessly with the mcu,1
3921,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
3922,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
3923,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
3924,thought this would be a good movie but damn this movie is freaking bad the worst mcu movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
3925,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
3926,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
3927,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
3928,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
3929,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
3930,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
3931,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3932,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie has terrible cg,1
3933,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
3934,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3935,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
3936,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
3937,you have a spider-man movies assholes,1
3938,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
3939,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
3940,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
3941,as we all know ant man and the wasp is that it tries ideas that haven't been featured in other marvel films,1
3942,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
3943,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
3944,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
3945,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
3946,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
3947,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
3948,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
3949,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
3950,it answered the question as to why ant man and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
3951,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
3952,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
3953,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
3954,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
3955,one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
3956,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
3957,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
3958,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
3959,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
3960,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
3961,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
3962,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to end,1
3963,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
3964,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
3965,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
3966,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this tomorrow,1
3967,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
3968,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
3969,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
3970,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
3971,not a patch on the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
3972,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
3973,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
3974,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
3975,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
3976,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
3977,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
3978,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
3979,both the worst spider-man movie ever,1
3980,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
3981,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
3982,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
3983,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
3984,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
3985,this movie was a disappointment considering i wanted to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
3986,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1

3990,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
3991,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is the worst of the mcu movies,1
3992,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
3993,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
3994,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
3995,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
3996,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
3997,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1

4011,if anything it is one of the greatest marvel movies of all time,1
4012,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu,1
4013,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1

4043,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
4044,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
4045,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
4046,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
4047,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
4048,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
4049,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one,1

4051,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
4052,not a patch on the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
4053,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
4054,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
4055,and this is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
4056,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
4057,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
4058,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
4059,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
4060,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
4061,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
4062,i had such high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
4063,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
4064,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
4065,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
4066,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
4067,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
4068,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
4069,i liked every other spider-man movie was bad as well,1
4070,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1

4077,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
4078,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
4079,bad film like the rest of the movie is predictable,1
4080,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
4081,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first film,1
4082,worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
4083,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
4084,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4085,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
4086,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie is dragged down,1
4087,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
4088,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
4089,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of villains that don't really even take themselves seriously,1
4090,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
4091,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1

4096,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1

4098,if anything it is one of the greatest popcorn films i have ever seen,1
4099,avengers age of ultron is no better than the first film because it didn't have any option,1
4100,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
4101,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
4102,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
4103,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
4104,this movie was awful compared to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
4105,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
4106,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
4107,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
4108,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
4109,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
4110,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
4111,the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
4112,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1
4113,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
4114,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
4115,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
4116,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies i have seen,1
4117,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
4118,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
4119,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
4120,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
4121,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
4122,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
4123,really boring one of the most influential comic book arcs in history worse than spider-man and iron man characters,1
4124,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
4125,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
4126,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but still solid,1
4127,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
4128,worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
4129,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
4130,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
4131,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
4132,not to mention that i have heard snoring for the first time i hate a marvel film,1
4133,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
4134,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
4135,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
4136,could not wait for it to be over,1
4137,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
4138,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
4139,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
4140,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
4141,best of the iron man series for me,1
4142,i think it was better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
4143,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
4144,you have a spider-man movie was bad as well,1
4145,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1

4148,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
4149,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
4150,the viliain was good but not as good as the first it would still be great,1
4151,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
4152,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but still solid,1
4153,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
4154,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
4155,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
4156,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
4157,until then though the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
4158,i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
4159,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
4160,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
4161,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
4162,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
4163,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
4164,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
4165,glad that i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
4166,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
4167,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
4168,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
4169,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
4170,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
4171,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
4172,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
4173,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
4174,he is one of the most klisheed movies i've seen him in,1
4175,i think it was better than the first but still solid,1
4176,this is by far the worst of the marvel films,1
4177,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
4178,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of villains that don't really even take themselves seriously,1
4179,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still solid,1
4180,it is the worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
4181,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
4182,story was a real let down after avengers,1
4183,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
4184,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
4185,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
4186,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
4187,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
4188,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
4189,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
4190,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
4191,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
4192,you have a spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
4193,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
4194,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
4195,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
4196,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
4197,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
4198,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
4199,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
4200,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
4201,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
4202,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
4203,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
4204,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
4205,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
4206,until then though the first spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
4207,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
4208,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
4209,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
4210,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
4211,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
4212,i am a super fan of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
4213,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
4214,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
4215,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
4216,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
4217,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
4218,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't live up to its expectations,1
4219,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
4220,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
4221,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
4222,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
4223,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
4224,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part,1
4225,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
4226,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
4227,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
4228,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
4229,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
4230,the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
4231,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
4232,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
4233,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
4234,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
4235,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
4236,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
4237,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first,1
4238,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
4239,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
4240,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
4241,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
4242,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
4243,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
4244,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
4245,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
4246,the viliain was good but not as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
4247,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
4248,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy was one of the better parts of this movie,1
4249,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
4250,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
4251,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
4252,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
4253,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
4254,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
4255,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
4256,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1
4257,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
4258,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
4259,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
4260,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated films i've ever seen,1
4261,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
4262,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
4263,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
4264,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
4265,if anything it is one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a while,1
4266,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
4267,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
4268,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
4269,it was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
4270,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
4271,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
4272,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
4273,not that i have anything against that villain but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
4274,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
4275,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
4276,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
4277,dialogue was terrible as well as the overall movie concept,1
4278,one of the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
4279,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
4280,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
4281,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
4282,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
4283,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
4284,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
4285,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
4286,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
4287,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
4288,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
4289,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
4290,it was ok but not nearly as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
4291,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
4292,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
4293,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
4294,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
4295,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
4296,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen on film,1
4297,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
4298,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
4299,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
4300,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
4301,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
4302,by far the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
4303,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
4304,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
4305,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
4306,wow worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
4307,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
4308,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
4309,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a mess,1
4310,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
4311,also peter parker is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
4312,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
4313,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
4314,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
4315,not a patch on the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
4316,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
4317,the plot is completely all over the place it's a mess,1
4318,i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
4319,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
4320,it's no better than any of the iron man series for me,1
4321,it feels like they gave a 5 year old who's into violent fantasies then just don't waste your money at the theater,1
4322,also the monaco grand prix was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
4323,wasn't better than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
4324,this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
4325,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
4326,i am a super fan of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
4327,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
4328,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
4329,with the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in a while,1
4330,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
4331,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
4332,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
4333,story was a real let down after avengers,1
4334,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
4335,this is the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
4336,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
4337,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
4338,if you really like all the other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
4339,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4340,the only thing i can say is the trailer was 100 times more interesting than the movies heroes,1
4341,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
4342,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
4343,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
4344,this is the best movie of the mavel,1
4345,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
4346,the worst version of spider-man and iron man characters,1
4347,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4348,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
4349,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is definitely the best and most enjoyable iron man movie,1
4350,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
4351,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
4352,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's hulk which i loved,1
4353,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
4354,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
4355,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen,1
4356,until then though the first spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
4357,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
4358,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
4359,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
4360,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
4361,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy movie some day,1
4362,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
4363,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
4364,the worst version of spider-man and iron man characters,1
4365,as many have described it antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
4366,the jokes are all over the place and isn't clear,1
4367,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
4368,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies,1
4369,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
4370,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
4371,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
4372,ant man and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
4373,if anything it is one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
4374,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
4375,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
4376,nowhere near as good as the first but still great,1
4377,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
4378,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
4379,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
4380,even if it was only half as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
4381,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
4382,there were also way too many characters that are scattered all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
4383,as many have described it antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
4384,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
4385,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
4386,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
4387,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
4388,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
4389,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
4390,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
4391,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
4392,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
4393,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
4394,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4395,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
4396,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie,1
4397,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
4398,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
4399,with a bad plot ridiculous villain and boring new characters age of ultron is no better than the first but still great,1
4400,there were so many things i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
4401,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4402,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
4403,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
4404,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
4405,one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
4406,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
4407,unlike others i did not like this film,1
4408,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
4409,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
4410,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
4411,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
4412,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
4413,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
4414,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
4415,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
4416,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
4417,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4418,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
4419,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
4420,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man fan,1
4421,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
4422,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
4423,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen in theaters,1
4424,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
4425,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
4426,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
4427,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
4428,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
4429,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
4430,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
4431,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
4432,villain was boring and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
4433,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
4434,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
4435,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
4436,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
4437,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
4438,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
4439,story was a real let down after avengers,1
4440,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
4441,this movie is so annoying that i don't like their music very much,1
4442,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
4443,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
4444,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4445,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
4446,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
4447,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
4448,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
4449,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
4450,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
4451,as many have described it antman and the wasp is not as good as the first film,1
4452,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
4453,now the character centered stuff was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
4454,the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
4455,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
4456,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
4457,i think it was better than the first one are once again brilliant especially from pratt himself,1
4458,with an extremely thin plot no iron man and plot holes all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
4459,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
4460,as many have described it antman and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
4461,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
4462,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
4463,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
4464,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
4465,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
4466,thought it would be as good as the first it would still be great,1
4467,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
4468,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
4469,or maybe its just me and my friends who thought this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
4470,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
4471,it's no better than any of the iron man series for me,1
4472,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
4473,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
4474,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
4475,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best movies i have seen in years,1
4476,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
4477,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
4478,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
4479,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
4480,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
4481,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
4482,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
4483,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
4484,while i was excited to watch this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
4485,by far the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
4486,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
4487,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
4488,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
4489,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
4490,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
4491,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
4492,he is one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
4493,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
4494,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
4495,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4496,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
4497,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
4498,i realy want to see it again and again and,1
4499,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
4500,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
4501,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
4502,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
4503,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
4504,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
4505,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
4506,very well done in special effects as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
4507,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4508,i that this movie was a mess,1
4509,why should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
4510,i realy want to see it again and again and,1
4511,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
4512,story was a real let down after avengers,1
4513,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
4514,if you really like all the other spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
4515,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
4516,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
4517,he is one of the greatest popcorn films i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
4518,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
4519,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4520,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
4521,probably one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a long time,1
4522,you have a spider-man movies assholes,1
4523,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
4524,it's the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
4525,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
4526,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
4527,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
4528,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
4529,as many have described it antman and the wasp is that it tries ideas that haven't been featured in other marvel films,1
4530,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
4531,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
4532,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
4533,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
4534,other than downey this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
4535,definitely is one of the worst if not the worst mcu movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
4536,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
4537,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies i have seen recently,1
4538,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
4539,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
4540,and this is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it was a worth while movie,1
4541,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
4542,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
4543,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
4544,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
4545,overall this movie was a disappointment considering i wanted to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
4546,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
4547,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
4548,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
4549,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4550,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
4551,this is the worst spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
4552,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies i have seen lately,1
4553,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
4554,i know it was probably supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it was better than the first,1
4555,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
4556,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
4557,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
4558,i had such high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
4559,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was sloppy at best,1
4560,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
4561,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
4562,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
4563,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
4564,it answered the question as to why ant man and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
4565,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
4566,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first one,1
4567,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
4568,one of the best scenes in the film and was a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
4569,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
4570,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
4571,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
4572,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
4573,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
4574,meh not even close to as good as the first it would still be great,1
4575,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
4576,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
4577,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
4578,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
4579,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
4580,dialogue was terrible as well as the overall movie concept,1
4581,this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
4582,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
4583,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
4584,lost the charm he had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
4585,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on,1
4586,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
4587,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
4588,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
4589,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't live up to the other movies,1
4590,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
4591,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
4592,okay so it is not nearly as good as the first it would still be great,1
4593,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
4594,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
4595,this was honestly one of the worst sequel out there,1
4596,this is by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
4597,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
4598,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
4599,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
4600,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
4601,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best superhero movie to come out eversince batman begins,1
4602,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
4603,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the worst movies i have seen lately,1
4604,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
4605,this is the best movie of the mavel,1
4606,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still great,1
4607,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
4608,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
4609,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
4610,one of if not the worst marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
4611,want to see another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
4612,unlike others i did not like this film,1
4613,if you really liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
4614,she spends most of the time and smarmy this goes down as one of the best marvel movies to date,1
4615,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
4616,both the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
4617,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
4618,as we all know ant man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
4619,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
4620,the only thing that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
4621,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
4622,i that this movie was a mess,1
4623,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
4624,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
4625,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
4626,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
4627,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
4628,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
4629,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
4630,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4631,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
4632,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
4633,installment of the iron man series for me,1
4634,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
4635,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
4636,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
4637,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
4638,now the character centered stuff was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
4639,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
4640,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
4641,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
4642,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
4643,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
4644,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
4645,he is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
4646,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
4647,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
4648,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
4649,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
4650,ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
4651,and this is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it was a worth while movie,1
4652,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
4653,i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
4654,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
4655,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
4656,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
4657,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
4658,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
4659,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
4660,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
4661,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
4662,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
4663,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
4664,the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
4665,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
4666,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4667,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
4668,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
4669,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
4670,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
4671,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
4672,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
4673,best of the iron man series for me,1
4674,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
4675,want to see another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
4676,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4677,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
4678,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
4679,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
4680,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
4681,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
4682,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
4683,wow this movie is just a middle of the road mediocre snore-fest,1
4684,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
4685,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
4686,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
4687,i realize he was in the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
4688,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
4689,the only thing that was good about this one was the best of the trilogy,1
4690,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
4691,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
4692,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man and iron man characters,1
4693,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
4694,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
4695,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
4696,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
4697,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
4698,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
4699,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
4700,this is by far the worst of the series,1
4701,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
4702,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
4703,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
4704,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
4705,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
4706,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
4707,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
4708,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
4709,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
4710,and at the end it's just another superhero movie,1
4711,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
4712,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
4713,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
4714,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
4715,it's no better than any of the iron man series for me,1
4716,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
4717,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
4718,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
4719,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a story just like the old zulu shaka series,1
4720,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
4721,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
4722,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
4723,the only good things in this movie is the worst of the marvel films,1
4724,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
4725,if you really liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
4726,much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
4727,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
4728,i think it was better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
4729,snooze fest of a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
4730,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
4731,best of the iron man series for me,1
4732,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
4733,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
4734,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies,1
4735,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies i have seen recently,1
4736,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
4737,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
4738,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie ever,1
4739,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
4740,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
4741,if anything it is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
4742,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
4743,this is by far the worst movie i have ever watched,1
4744,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
4745,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
4746,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
4747,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
4748,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
4749,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
4750,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen,1
4751,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a disaster with the only good part,1
4752,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first but still great,1
4753,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
4754,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
4755,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1

4759,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
4760,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
4761,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
4762,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
4763,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
4764,cgi garbage and the only thing that i liked in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
4765,no where near as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
4766,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4767,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
4768,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
4769,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
4770,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
4771,not as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
4772,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
4773,the plot is trash and the characters are likable but overall it's not a 1 star because of thor,1
4774,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
4775,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
4776,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
4777,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
4778,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
4779,i think it was better than the first one but this one was very fun,1
4780,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
4781,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
4782,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
4783,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
4784,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
4785,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
4786,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
4787,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
4788,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
4789,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1

4792,could not wait for it to be over,1
4793,i am a super fan of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
4794,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
4795,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
4796,it's no better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
4797,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises and a credit sequence from rami's spider-man movies assholes,1
4798,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
4799,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
4800,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
4801,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
4802,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
4803,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1

4811,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
4812,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
4813,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
4814,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
4815,i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
4816,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
4817,very well done in special effects as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
4818,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
4819,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
4820,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1

4834,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
4835,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1

4852,it is the worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
4853,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1

4864,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
4865,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
4866,ant man and the wasp is not as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
4867,also peter parker is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
4868,you have a spider-man movie was bad as well,1
4869,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
4870,the suit had more abilities than spider-man and the worst of the series,1

4872,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
4873,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
4874,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1

4880,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
4881,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
4882,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4883,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
4884,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
4885,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
4886,the race-related hype around this movie is so bad i hate it my kids got so scared,1
4887,to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1

4892,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
4893,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
4894,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
4895,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
4896,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
4897,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a must see for any marvel fan,1
4898,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the mcu's worst films,1

4906,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
4907,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1

4917,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
4918,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
4919,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
4920,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1

4927,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
4928,more re-boots of spider-man and the worst of the marvel films,1
4929,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
4930,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1

4949,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
4950,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
4951,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
4952,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
4953,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a mess,1
4954,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
4955,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first film because it didn't have a heart,1
4956,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
4957,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
4958,this movie is so annoying that i don't like their music very much,1
4959,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
4960,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
4961,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
4962,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
4963,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
4964,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1

4966,it's the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
4967,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
4968,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
4969,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
4970,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
4971,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
4972,i realy want to see it again and again and,1
4973,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
4974,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
4975,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
4976,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
4977,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
4978,this was honestly one of the worst if not the worst mcu movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
4979,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first film,1
4980,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
4981,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
4982,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
4983,it feels like they gave a 5 year old who's into violent fantasies then just don't waste your money at the theater,1
4984,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
4985,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
4986,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
4987,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
4988,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
4989,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
4990,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
4991,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
4992,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
4993,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
4994,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
4995,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
4996,i think it was better than the first but still solid,1
4997,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
4998,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
4999,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5000,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
5001,the plot is completely all over the place it's a mess,1
5002,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
5003,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
5004,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
5005,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1
5006,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5007,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst if not the worst movie i have seen in years,1
5008,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
5009,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
5010,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
5011,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
5012,both the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
5013,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be a huge dissapointment,1
5014,unlike others i did not like this film,1
5015,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
5016,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen,1
5017,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
5018,why the hell should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
5019,this is by far the worst of the marvel films,1
5020,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
5021,i am very disappointed in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
5022,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
5023,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
5024,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
5025,to the iron man suit is just the iron man suit is a flamboyant billionaire who invents gadgets and new technology,1
5026,the incredible hulk isn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
5027,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
5028,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
5029,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
5030,the incredible hulk isn't a bad movie just not a great movie which did not live up to its predecessor,1
5031,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
5032,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
5033,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
5034,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
5035,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
5036,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5037,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
5038,if anything it is one of the worst movies of all the time,1
5039,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
5040,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
5041,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
5042,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
5043,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't live up to its expectations,1
5044,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
5045,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
5046,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
5047,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
5048,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
5049,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
5050,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
5051,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
5052,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
5053,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
5054,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5055,i am not even a big fan of the marvel movies,1
5056,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
5057,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
5058,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
5059,now the character centered stuff was one of the better marvel films i've seen,1
5060,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this tomorrow,1
5061,good film but is it as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
5062,much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
5063,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
5064,the plot is completely all over the place it's a mess,1
5065,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
5066,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
5067,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to its expectations,1
5068,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
5069,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
5070,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
5071,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
5072,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
5073,if you really liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
5074,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
5075,thus at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
5076,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
5077,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5078,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
5079,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
5080,the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
5081,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
5082,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
5083,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
5084,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
5085,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
5086,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
5087,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
5088,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
5089,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
5090,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a must see for any marvel fan,1
5091,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
5092,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
5093,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
5094,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
5095,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
5096,there were so many things i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
5097,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
5098,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
5099,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
5100,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
5101,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was sloppy at best,1
5102,i can believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
5103,unlike others i did not like this film,1
5104,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
5105,by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
5106,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
5107,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
5108,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
5109,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't work at all,1
5110,the jokes are all over the place it's a mess,1
5111,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5112,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
5113,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
5114,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
5115,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
5116,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
5117,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
5118,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
5119,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movies assholes,1
5120,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
5121,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
5122,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
5123,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
5124,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
5125,installment of the iron man series for me,1
5126,installment of the iron man series for me,1
5127,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
5128,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst i have ever seen in theaters,1
5129,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
5130,i can believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
5131,i am a super fan of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
5132,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
5133,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
5134,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
5135,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
5136,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
5137,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
5138,what they did to the mandarin was horrible and he is one of the worst movies i have seen recently,1
5139,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
5140,well guess what antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
5141,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
5142,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst i have ever seen in the movie,1
5143,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5144,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
5145,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
5146,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
5147,the only good things in this movie is the worst i have ever seen,1
5148,if anything it is one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
5149,as we all know ant man and the wasp is not as good as the first it would still be great,1
5150,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
5151,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
5152,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
5153,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
5154,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
5155,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
5156,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's hulk which i loved,1
5157,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
5158,unlike others i did not like this film,1
5159,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
5160,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1

5162,cgi garbage and the only thing that i liked in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
5163,as many have described it antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
5164,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
5165,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever watched,1
5166,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
5167,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
5168,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
5169,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man universe or mythos which is center to the spider-man franchise,1
5170,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5171,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
5172,could not wait for it to be over,1
5173,story was a real let down after avengers,1
5174,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
5175,i am not even a big fan of iron man but this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1

5177,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
5178,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
5179,until then though the first spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
5180,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
5181,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
5182,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
5183,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
5184,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
5185,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
5186,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5187,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
5188,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
5189,guardians of the galaxy was one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
5190,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
5191,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
5192,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
5193,both the worst spider-man movie ever,1
5194,in my opinion is the worst movie i have seen in years,1

5199,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
5200,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
5201,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
5202,it was one of the best movies i have seen lately,1
5203,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
5204,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
5205,the only thing i can say is the trailer was 100 times more interesting than the movies heroes,1
5206,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
5207,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
5208,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
5209,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
5210,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
5211,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
5212,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
5213,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
5214,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5215,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
5216,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
5217,the jokes are all over the place it's a mess,1
5218,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5219,with the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron is no better than the first one are once again brilliant especially from pratt himself,1
5220,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
5221,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
5222,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5223,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
5224,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
5225,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
5226,it answered the question as to why ant man and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
5227,if anything it is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
5228,and this is supposed to be the title,1
5229,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
5230,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1

5238,he is one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
5239,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
5240,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
5241,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
5242,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
5243,it's no better than any of the iron man series for me,1
5244,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
5245,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
5246,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first film,1
5247,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
5248,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
5249,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1

5254,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
5255,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
5256,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
5257,also the monaco grand prix was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
5258,the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
5259,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
5260,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring marvel movie to date,1
5261,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
5262,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1

5277,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
5278,one of the most influential comic book arcs in history worse than spider-man and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
5279,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
5280,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
5281,sad worst of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1

5347,worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
5348,i liked every other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5349,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
5350,i liked every other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5351,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
5352,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
5353,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
5354,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
5355,this movie was a disappointment considering i wanted to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
5356,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest films of the year for sure,1
5357,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
5358,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
5359,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
5360,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
5361,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
5362,i had high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
5363,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
5364,what they did to the mandarin was horrible and he is one of the most overrated films i've ever seen,1
5365,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
5366,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
5367,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
5368,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
5369,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have any action,1
5370,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
5371,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
5372,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
5373,and this is supposed to be the title,1
5374,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
5375,you have a spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
5376,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
5377,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
5378,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
5379,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
5380,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
5381,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
5382,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
5383,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
5384,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
5385,could not wait for it to be over,1
5386,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
5387,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
5388,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5389,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
5390,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
5391,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
5392,one of the most influential comic book arcs in history worse than spider-man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
5393,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
5394,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
5395,could not wait for it to be over,1
5396,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
5397,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
5398,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
5399,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
5400,a horrible parody of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
5401,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
5402,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5403,i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
5404,this movie is so annoying that i don't like but overall i still enjoy that movie a great deal,1
5405,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
5406,its not that i don't like their music very much,1
5407,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
5408,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
5409,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
5410,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
5411,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
5412,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
5413,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu has the highest stakes of any superhero movie so far,1
5414,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
5415,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
5416,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
5417,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
5418,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
5419,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
5420,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5421,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
5422,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
5423,thus at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends,1
5424,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5425,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
5426,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
5427,the idea seems better than the first but still solid,1
5428,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5429,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
5430,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
5431,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
5432,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
5433,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
5434,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
5435,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
5436,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
5437,it's no better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
5438,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5439,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
5440,unlike others i did not like this film,1
5441,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
5442,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie has terrible cg,1
5443,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
5444,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
5445,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
5446,the most notable part is the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
5447,for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first if not better,1
5448,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
5449,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
5450,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the overall movie concept,1
5451,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
5452,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
5453,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this movie was a mess,1
5454,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
5455,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was very fun,1
5456,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
5457,could not wait for it to be over,1
5458,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
5459,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
5460,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies,1
5461,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
5462,the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
5463,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
5464,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's hulk which i loved,1
5465,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
5466,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
5467,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
5468,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
5469,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
5470,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
5471,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
5472,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
5473,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
5474,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
5475,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
5476,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
5477,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
5478,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
5479,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
5480,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the worst movies i have seen lately,1
5481,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
5482,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5483,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
5484,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
5485,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
5486,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
5487,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
5488,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
5489,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
5490,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in the movie,1
5491,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
5492,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
5493,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
5494,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
5495,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most klisheed movies i've seen him in,1
5496,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
5497,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
5498,also peter parker is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
5499,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
5500,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
5501,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
5502,this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
5503,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
5504,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
5505,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
5506,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have any action,1
5507,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
5508,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
5509,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
5510,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have seen in years,1
5511,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
5512,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
5513,by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
5514,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
5515,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
5516,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
5517,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
5518,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
5519,no homage to the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
5520,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5521,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
5522,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
5523,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
5524,sorry i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
5525,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
5526,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
5527,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
5528,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5529,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
5530,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
5531,the best part of this movie was the fantastic michael keaton whom as far as i'm concerned chris pratt owes me money,1
5532,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
5533,no where near as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
5534,i don't even want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
5535,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
5536,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
5537,this is the worst spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
5538,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the worst movies i have seen ever,1
5539,for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first,1
5540,i am very disappointed in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
5541,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
5542,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
5543,cgi garbage and the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
5544,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
5545,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
5546,i am not even a big fan of iron man but this movie was a disaster with the only good part,1
5547,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
5548,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
5549,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
5550,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
5551,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
5552,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
5553,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
5554,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie was predictable,1
5555,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
5556,with an extremely thin plot no iron man and plot holes all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
5557,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
5558,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
5559,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
5560,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
5561,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
5562,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
5563,could not wait for it to be over,1
5564,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
5565,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
5566,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
5567,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
5568,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
5569,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
5570,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
5571,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
5572,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
5573,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
5574,ant man and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
5575,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
5576,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
5577,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
5578,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
5579,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie was predictable,1
5580,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
5581,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best superhero movie to come out eversince batman begins,1
5582,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
5583,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
5584,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best movies i have seen in years,1
5585,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
5586,yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch,1
5587,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
5588,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
5589,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better parts of this movie,1
5590,one of the best scenes in the film and was a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
5591,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
5592,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
5593,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
5594,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
5595,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
5596,by far the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
5597,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5598,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
5599,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
5600,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
5601,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
5602,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
5603,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
5604,the atom is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
5605,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
5606,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
5607,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
5608,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
5609,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
5610,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
5611,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
5612,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
5613,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
5614,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
5615,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
5616,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
5617,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
5618,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
5619,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
5620,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
5621,not that i have anything against that villain but i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
5622,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
5623,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
5624,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
5625,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
5626,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first if not better,1
5627,at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends,1
5628,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
5629,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
5630,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
5631,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
5632,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to the hype,1
5633,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5634,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
5635,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5636,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
5637,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
5638,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
5639,on the other hand is the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
5640,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
5641,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
5642,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
5643,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
5644,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
5645,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
5646,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
5647,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think they explored the full potential of the hero,1
5648,really boring one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a while,1
5649,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5650,as we all know ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
5651,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
5652,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
5653,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
5654,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the greatest marvel movies of all time,1
5655,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
5656,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
5657,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
5658,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
5659,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was very fun,1
5660,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
5661,i am not even a big fan of the marvel movies,1
5662,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
5663,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
5664,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
5665,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
5666,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
5667,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
5668,but overall iron man 3 is a must see for any marvel fan,1
5669,unlike others i did not like this film,1
5670,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to end,1
5671,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
5672,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
5673,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
5674,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
5675,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu,1
5676,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
5677,no where near as good as the first but still solid,1
5678,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
5679,loki on the other hand is the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
5680,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
5681,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
5682,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have any option,1
5683,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
5684,depth in this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
5685,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
5686,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
5687,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
5688,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
5689,i had such high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
5690,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
5691,no homage to the spider-man and iron man characters,1
5692,want to see another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5693,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
5694,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
5695,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
5696,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
5697,now the character centered stuff was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
5698,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
5699,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
5700,why should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
5701,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
5702,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
5703,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
5704,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
5705,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
5706,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
5707,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
5708,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
5709,the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
5710,villain was boring and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
5711,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
5712,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
5713,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
5714,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
5715,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
5716,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
5717,the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends,1
5718,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
5719,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
5720,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
5721,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5722,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better marvel films i've seen,1
5723,the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
5724,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
5725,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
5726,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
5727,the idea seems better than the first one but this one was very fun,1
5728,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
5729,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
5730,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
5731,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
5732,this is the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
5733,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all time,1
5734,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
5735,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5736,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
5737,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
5738,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
5739,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
5740,i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
5741,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
5742,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
5743,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
5744,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
5745,the race-related hype around this movie is so bad i hate it my kids got so scared,1
5746,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
5747,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
5748,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
5749,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
5750,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
5751,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
5752,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
5753,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the overall movie concept,1
5754,installment of the iron man series for me,1
5755,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
5756,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
5757,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
5758,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
5759,some things i liked some things i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
5760,for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
5761,no homage to the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
5762,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
5763,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
5764,and at the end it's just another superhero movie,1
5765,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
5766,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
5767,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
5768,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
5769,story was a real let down after avengers,1
5770,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
5771,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
5772,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
5773,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
5774,it was one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
5775,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
5776,the idea seems better than the first but still okay,1
5777,the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
5778,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
5779,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
5780,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was sloppy at best,1
5781,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
5782,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
5783,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
5784,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
5785,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
5786,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
5787,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever watched,1
5788,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
5789,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
5790,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5791,much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
5792,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
5793,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
5794,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
5795,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
5796,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
5797,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
5798,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
5799,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
5800,yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch,1
5801,i'm not really a big fan of the marvel movies,1
5802,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
5803,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
5804,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the greatest films of the year for sure,1
5805,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
5806,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
5807,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
5808,bad film like the rest of the movie is predictable,1
5809,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
5810,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still okay,1
5811,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't live up to its expectations,1
5812,wow worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
5813,this is the worst spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
5814,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
5815,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
5816,if you like funny drama action and adventure then guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
5817,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
5818,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
5819,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
5820,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
5821,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
5822,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
5823,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
5824,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
5825,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
5826,no where near as good as the first but still okay,1
5827,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
5828,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
5829,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again and again and,1
5830,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
5831,or maybe its just me and my friends who thought this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
5832,this is by far the worst of the marvel movies,1
5833,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
5834,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
5835,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
5836,this is the worst spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
5837,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
5838,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
5839,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
5840,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
5841,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
5842,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
5843,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
5844,it's no better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
5845,the great thing about ant man and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
5846,i don't even want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
5847,i liked every other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5848,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
5849,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
5850,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
5851,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
5852,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
5853,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
5854,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
5855,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
5856,to be blunt i thought it was a weak film with weak repetitive scenes,1
5857,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in a while,1
5858,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
5859,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's hulk which i loved,1
5860,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
5861,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be a huge dissapointment,1
5862,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5863,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
5864,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
5865,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
5866,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
5867,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
5868,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
5869,if you like funny drama action and adventure then guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
5870,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movies,1
5871,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
5872,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
5873,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
5874,by far the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
5875,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
5876,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
5877,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
5878,the plot is completely all over the place it's a mess,1
5879,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
5880,the only good things in this movie is the worst of the mcu movies,1
5881,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
5882,the race track scene is the only good part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
5883,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
5884,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
5885,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
5886,with the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron is no better than the first but still great,1
5887,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
5888,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
5889,i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
5890,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
5891,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
5892,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
5893,nothing scares me more than critics claiming this to be the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
5894,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
5895,bridges is miscast but the rest of the movie is dragged down,1
5896,story was a real let down after avengers,1
5897,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
5898,i had high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
5899,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
5900,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
5901,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first one are once again brilliant especially from pratt himself,1
5902,okay so it is not nearly as good as the first it would still be great,1
5903,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
5904,unlike others i did not like this film,1
5905,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the marvel cinematic universe,1
5906,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
5907,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
5908,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
5909,unlike others i did not like this film,1
5910,but the rest of the movie is predictable,1
5911,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
5912,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
5913,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
5914,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
5915,i had such high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
5916,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
5917,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
5918,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
5919,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
5920,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5921,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
5922,on the other hand is the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
5923,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
5924,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
5925,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
5926,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
5927,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
5928,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
5929,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
5930,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the acting,1
5931,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
5932,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
5933,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
5934,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
5935,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
5936,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
5937,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
5938,the only thing in my opinion that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
5939,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
5940,no where near as good as the first if not better,1
5941,the heroes were just good guys and that is the great thing about ant man and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
5942,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
5943,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
5944,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
5945,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
5946,want to see another guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
5947,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best superhero movie to come out eversince batman begins,1
5948,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
5949,until then though the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
5950,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
5951,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
5952,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
5953,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
5954,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
5955,definitely is one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
5956,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest popcorn films i have ever seen in the movie,1
5957,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5958,even if it was only half as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
5959,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
5960,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
5961,unlike others i did not like this film,1
5962,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
5963,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
5964,no homage to the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
5965,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
5966,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
5967,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
5968,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
5969,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
5970,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
5971,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
5972,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first film,1
5973,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
5974,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
5975,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
5976,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
5977,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
5978,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
5979,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
5980,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
5981,no homage to the spider-man and iron man characters,1
5982,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
5983,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
5984,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
5985,this is one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
5986,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
5987,thought it would be as good as the first it would still be great,1
5988,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
5989,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
5990,speaking of jokes there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
5991,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
5992,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
5993,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
5994,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
5995,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the overall movie concept,1
5996,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
5997,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
5998,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
5999,she spends most of the time and smarmy this goes down as one of the worst movies i have seen,1
6000,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
6001,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
6002,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
6003,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
6004,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
6005,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
6006,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
6007,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
6008,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
6009,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
6010,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
6011,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
6012,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
6013,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
6014,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
6015,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
6016,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
6017,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
6018,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
6019,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
6020,story was a real let down after avengers,1
6021,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
6022,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
6023,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
6024,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the marvel films,1
6025,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
6026,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
6027,definitely is one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
6028,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a mess,1
6029,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
6030,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst i have ever seen on screen,1
6031,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
6032,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
6033,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
6034,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
6035,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
6036,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
6037,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
6038,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
6039,wow worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
6040,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
6041,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
6042,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
6043,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
6044,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
6045,if you really liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
6046,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
6047,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
6048,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
6049,meh not even close to as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
6050,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
6051,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
6052,not to mention that i have heard snoring for the first time i hate a marvel film,1
6053,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
6054,the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends,1
6055,worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
6056,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
6057,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie has terrible cg,1
6058,while i was excited to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
6059,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
6060,the jokes are all over the place and isn't clear,1
6061,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
6062,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
6063,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
6064,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
6065,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
6066,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
6067,the idea seems better than the first but still solid,1
6068,i don't even want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
6069,lost the charm he had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
6070,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
6071,there were so many things i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
6072,in my opinion is the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
6073,i think it was better than the first one are once again brilliant especially from pratt himself,1
6074,it feels like they gave a 5 year old who's into violent fantasies then just don't waste your money at the theater,1
6075,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
6076,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
6077,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
6078,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen on film,1
6079,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
6080,i am not even a big fan of the marvel movies,1
6081,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
6082,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
6083,very well done in special effects as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
6084,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
6085,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
6086,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
6087,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
6088,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
6089,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
6090,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
6091,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
6092,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
6093,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
6094,it is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
6095,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
6096,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man and iron man characters,1
6097,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
6098,this is by far the worst movie i have seen in years,1
6099,i that this movie was a mess,1
6100,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
6101,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
6102,it answered the question as to why ant man and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
6103,you have a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
6104,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
6105,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
6106,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
6107,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
6108,i think it was better than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
6109,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
6110,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
6111,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
6112,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first one,1
6113,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
6114,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
6115,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
6116,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
6117,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
6118,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
6119,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
6120,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
6121,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
6122,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
6123,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
6124,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
6125,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
6126,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
6127,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
6128,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
6129,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
6130,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
6131,this is the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
6132,depth in this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
6133,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
6134,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
6135,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
6136,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
6137,the viliain was good but not as good as the first if not better,1
6138,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
6139,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
6140,until then though the first spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
6141,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
6142,the incredible hulk isn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
6143,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
6144,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
6145,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
6146,both the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
6147,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
6148,yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch,1
6149,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
6150,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
6151,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
6152,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
6153,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
6154,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
6155,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
6156,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
6157,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
6158,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
6159,there were also way too many characters that are scattered all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
6160,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen on film,1
6161,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
6162,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
6163,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
6164,the plot is completely all over the place and isn't clear,1
6165,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
6166,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
6167,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
6168,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
6169,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
6170,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
6171,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
6172,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
6173,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
6174,the viliain was good but not as good as the first if not better,1
6175,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
6176,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
6177,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
6178,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
6179,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
6180,some things i liked some things i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
6181,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
6182,i think it was better than the first but still great,1
6183,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
6184,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
6185,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen in theaters,1
6186,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
6187,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still great,1
6188,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
6189,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
6190,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
6191,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
6192,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
6193,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
6194,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
6195,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
6196,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
6197,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again and again and,1
6198,its not that i don't even know what to say,1
6199,this is by far the worst of the marvel films,1
6200,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
6201,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
6202,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
6203,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
6204,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
6205,not as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
6206,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
6207,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
6208,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
6209,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
6210,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
6211,not that i have anything against that villain but i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
6212,what they did to the mandarin was horrible and he is one of the greatest popcorn films i have ever seen,1
6213,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
6214,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe,1
6215,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
6216,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
6217,also the action i think is a bit of an improvement compared to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
6218,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
6219,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1

6520,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
6521,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have any action,1
6522,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
6523,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
6524,this is by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
6525,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
6526,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
6527,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
6528,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
6529,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1

6531,sorry i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
6532,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1

6534,what they did to the mandarin was horrible and he is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
6535,this is the worst spider-man movie was bad as well,1
6536,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
6537,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
6538,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be a huge dissapointment,1
6539,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
6540,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
6541,the worst of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
6542,why the hell should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
6543,it's no better than any of the iron man movies,1
6544,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
6545,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
6546,one of the best things about this sequel is that it tries to be different from the other mcu movies,1
6547,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
6548,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest popcorn films i have ever seen,1
6549,not a patch on the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
6550,ant man and the wasp is that it tries to be different from the previous films and tying things in needlessly with the mcu,1

6554,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
6555,the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
6556,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
6557,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on,1
6558,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
6559,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the marvel films,1
6560,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
6561,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1

6565,in my opinion is the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
6566,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
6567,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
6568,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
6569,the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
6570,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most powerful beings in the marvel universe,1

6572,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
6573,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1

6576,could not wait for it to be over,1
6577,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1

6579,i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
6580,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
6581,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
6582,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
6583,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
6584,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
6585,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have any action,1

6594,it's no better than any of the iron man movies,1
6595,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first one but this one was slightly better,1

6611,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
6612,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1

6614,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was sloppy at best,1
6615,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1

6629,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
6630,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1

6632,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
6633,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
6634,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1

6638,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
6639,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
6640,it was ok but not nearly as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
6641,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
6642,if anything it is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
6643,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1

6653,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
6654,the jokes are all over the place and isn't clear,1
6655,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1

6657,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
6658,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1

6667,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
6668,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
6669,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
6670,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen lately,1
6671,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
6672,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1

6681,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
6682,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
6683,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
6684,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
6685,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
6686,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
6687,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
6688,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
6689,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
6690,wasn't better than the first one but this one was very fun,1
6691,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
6692,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
6693,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
6694,also peter parker is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1

6702,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
6703,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
6704,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
6705,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
6706,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
6707,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
6708,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
6709,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
6710,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
6711,nowhere near as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
6712,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1

6718,but alas it wasn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
6719,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
6720,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
6721,the plot is completely all over the place and isn't clear,1
6722,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
6723,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
6724,wasn't better than the first one but this one was very fun,1
6725,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
6726,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
6727,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
6728,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1

6735,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
6736,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
6737,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a must see for any marvel fan,1
6738,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
6739,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
6740,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
6741,i am a super fan of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
6742,this movie is so annoying that i don't like but overall i still enjoy that movie a great deal,1
6743,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen on film,1
6744,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1

6752,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1

6775,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still great,1
6776,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
6777,until then though the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
6778,i loved the final fight scene and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy movie some day,1
6779,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
6780,until then though the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
6781,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
6782,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
6783,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
6784,the only good things in this movie is the worst of the mcu movies,1
6785,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
6786,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
6787,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to finish,1
6788,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
6789,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
6790,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
6791,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
6792,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
6793,this is by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
6794,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
6795,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
6796,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
6797,if anything it is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
6798,not to mention that i have heard snoring for the first time i hate a marvel film,1

6809,this is one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
6810,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
6811,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
6812,the suit had more abilities than spider-man and the worst of the marvel films,1
6813,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
6814,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
6815,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
6816,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
6817,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
6818,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
6819,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
6820,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
6821,this is the best movie of the mavel,1
6822,he is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
6823,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
6824,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
6825,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
6826,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
6827,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
6828,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
6829,i loved the final fight scene and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy,1
6830,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
6831,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
6832,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
6833,story was a real let down after avengers,1
6834,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
6835,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
6836,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
6837,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
6838,this is by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
6839,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most overrated films i've ever seen,1
6840,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
6841,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
6842,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
6843,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
6844,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
6845,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
6846,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
6847,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
6848,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
6849,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
6850,yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
6851,cgi garbage and the only thing that i liked in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
6852,now the character centered stuff was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
6853,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
6854,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
6855,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
6856,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
6857,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to the other movies,1
6858,and this is supposed to be the title,1
6859,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
6860,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
6861,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
6862,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
6863,i'm going to watch this movie iw turned out to be a huge dissapointment,1
6864,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
6865,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
6866,even if it was only half as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
6867,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
6868,better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
6869,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
6870,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
6871,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
6872,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
6873,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
6874,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
6875,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
6876,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
6877,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
6878,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
6879,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
6880,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
6881,i think it was better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
6882,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
6883,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
6884,story was a real let down after avengers,1
6885,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
6886,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
6887,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
6888,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
6889,i liked every other spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
6890,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
6891,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
6892,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
6893,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
6894,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
6895,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
6896,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
6897,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
6898,thus at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
6899,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
6900,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
6901,the race track scene is the only good part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
6902,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
6903,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
6904,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
6905,but overall iron man 3 is beautifully shot,1
6906,lost the charm he had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
6907,not that i have anything against that villain but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
6908,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
6909,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
6910,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
6911,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
6912,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
6913,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
6914,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies,1
6915,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
6916,i realy want to see it again and again and,1
6917,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
6918,this is by far the worst movie i have seen in years,1
6919,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
6920,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
6921,now the character centered stuff was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
6922,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
6923,this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
6924,by far the worst of the marvel films,1
6925,as many have described it antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
6926,bad film like the rest of the movie is predictable,1
6927,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
6928,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
6929,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
6930,by far the worst movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
6931,i am a super fan of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
6932,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
6933,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
6934,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
6935,i realy want to see it again and again and,1
6936,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
6937,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
6938,it is the worst movie i have ever seen in theaters,1
6939,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
6940,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
6941,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
6942,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
6943,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
6944,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
6945,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
6946,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
6947,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
6948,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
6949,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
6950,i had high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
6951,i realize he was in the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
6952,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
6953,this is by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
6954,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
6955,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
6956,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
6957,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
6958,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
6959,unlike others i did not like this film,1
6960,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still solid,1
6961,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
6962,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
6963,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
6964,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
6965,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
6966,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
6967,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
6968,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
6969,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
6970,the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
6971,the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
6972,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
6973,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
6974,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
6975,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
6976,much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
6977,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
6978,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
6979,why should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
6980,the plot is completely all over the place and isn't clear,1
6981,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
6982,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
6983,wow worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
6984,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
6985,no homage to the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
6986,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
6987,both the worst spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
6988,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
6989,the incredible hulk isn't a bad movie just not a great movie though its acceptable,1
6990,this is the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
6991,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
6992,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
6993,this movie is the worst of the marvel cinematic universe,1
6994,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
6995,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
6996,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
6997,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
6998,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
6999,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first if not better,1
7000,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
7001,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
7002,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
7003,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
7004,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
7005,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
7006,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
7007,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
7008,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
7009,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
7010,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
7011,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in a while,1
7012,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
7013,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
7014,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on,1
7015,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
7016,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
7017,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
7018,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
7019,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
7020,the only thing i can say is the trailer was 100 times more interesting than the movies heroes,1
7021,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
7022,by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
7023,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
7024,i realy want to see it again and again and,1
7025,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
7026,story was a real let down after avengers,1
7027,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
7028,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
7029,ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
7030,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
7031,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
7032,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
7033,now the character centered stuff was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
7034,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
7035,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
7036,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
7037,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
7038,undoubtedly the worst of the marvel films,1
7039,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
7040,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
7041,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
7042,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
7043,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
7044,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
7045,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
7046,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
7047,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
7048,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
7049,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7050,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
7051,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
7052,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
7053,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
7054,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
7055,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
7056,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
7057,the atom is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
7058,its not that i don't even know what to say,1
7059,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7060,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7061,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
7062,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
7063,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
7064,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
7065,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
7066,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
7067,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
7068,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
7069,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
7070,there were also way too many characters that are scattered all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
7071,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
7072,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first but still okay,1
7073,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on,1
7074,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
7075,look it is a good movie but damn this movie is freaking bad the worst mcu movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
7076,the spider-man and the worst of the mcu movies,1
7077,this is by far the worst of the series,1
7078,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
7079,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
7080,if anything it is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
7081,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
7082,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
7083,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7084,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
7085,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
7086,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen,1
7087,the plot is completely all over the place and isn't clear,1
7088,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
7089,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
7090,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
7091,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
7092,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst sequel out there,1
7093,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
7094,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
7095,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
7096,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
7097,by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
7098,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
7099,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
7100,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
7101,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
7102,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
7103,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
7104,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
7105,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
7106,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
7107,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
7108,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
7109,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
7110,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7111,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
7112,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
7113,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
7114,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
7115,undoubtedly the worst of the marvel films,1
7116,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man universe or mythos which is center to the spider-man franchise,1
7117,this film is the most overrated and overhyped movie i have ever seen in a while,1
7118,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
7119,this is by far the worst of the marvel movies,1
7120,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
7121,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
7122,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
7123,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
7124,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
7125,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
7126,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
7127,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
7128,dialogue was terrible as well as the overall movie concept,1
7129,this is by far the worst of the marvel films,1
7130,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
7131,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
7132,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
7133,unlike others i did not like this film,1
7134,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
7135,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen,1
7136,installment of the iron man series for me,1
7137,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
7138,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
7139,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
7140,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
7141,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
7142,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a brilliant film that has one of the mcu's worst films,1
7143,no homage to the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
7144,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
7145,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
7146,snooze fest of a movie with a bad plot ridiculous villain and boring new characters age of ultron is no better than the first,1
7147,and this is supposed to be the title,1
7148,while i was excited to watch this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
7149,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
7150,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
7151,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7152,if anything it is one of the worst movies of all the time,1
7153,want to see another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
7154,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
7155,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
7156,i tried but it's just as good if not better,1
7157,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
7158,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
7159,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
7160,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
7161,cgi garbage and the only thing that was good about this one was the best of the trilogy,1
7162,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
7163,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7164,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
7165,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7166,no homage to the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
7167,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
7168,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
7169,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
7170,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
7171,not a patch on the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
7172,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever seen in theaters,1
7173,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
7174,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
7175,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
7176,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
7177,this is the worst spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
7178,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
7179,i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies,1
7180,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
7181,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
7182,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
7183,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
7184,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
7185,i had high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
7186,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
7187,this is the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
7188,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
7189,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
7190,the race-related hype around this movie is so bad i hate it my kids got so scared,1
7191,in my opinion is the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
7192,if you like funny drama action and adventure then guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
7193,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
7194,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
7195,i had high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
7196,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
7197,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
7198,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
7199,it answered the question as to why ant man and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
7200,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
7201,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7202,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie has terrible cg,1
7203,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
7204,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
7205,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
7206,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7207,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
7208,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
7209,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
7210,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
7211,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
7212,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
7213,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
7214,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
7215,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
7216,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
7217,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
7218,it's no better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
7219,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
7220,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
7221,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
7222,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
7223,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7224,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
7225,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
7226,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7227,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
7228,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7229,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best movies i have seen ever,1
7230,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
7231,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
7232,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
7233,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7234,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
7235,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
7236,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
7237,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
7238,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
7239,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
7240,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
7241,ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
7242,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
7243,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
7244,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
7245,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
7246,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
7247,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the acting,1
7248,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
7249,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
7250,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
7251,no where near as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
7252,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
7253,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
7254,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
7255,speaking of jokes there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
7256,one of the best scenes in the film and was a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
7257,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
7258,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
7259,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
7260,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
7261,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
7262,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7263,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
7264,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
7265,as many have described it antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
7266,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
7267,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
7268,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
7269,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
7270,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
7271,now the character centered stuff was one of the best of the marvel world but up there with the big ones,1
7272,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
7273,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
7274,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
7275,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
7276,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
7277,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
7278,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
7279,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
7280,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
7281,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
7282,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
7283,could not wait for it to be over,1
7284,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
7285,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
7286,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
7287,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
7288,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
7289,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't work at all,1
7290,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
7291,it is the worst movie i have ever seen in theaters,1
7292,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
7293,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
7294,this is by far the worst of the marvel films,1
7295,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7296,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
7297,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
7298,this is the best movie of the mavel,1
7299,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie is predictable,1
7300,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
7301,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
7302,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
7303,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
7304,better than any of the iron man series for me,1
7305,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
7306,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a brilliant film that has one of the mcu's worst films,1
7307,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever watched,1
7308,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
7309,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
7310,if anything it is one of the greatest popcorn films i have ever seen,1
7311,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
7312,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
7313,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
7314,want to see another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
7315,other than downey this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
7316,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
7317,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
7318,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
7319,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
7320,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7321,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
7322,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
7323,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
7324,story was a real let down after avengers,1
7325,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7326,i am a super fan of spider-man and iron man characters,1
7327,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
7328,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
7329,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
7330,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
7331,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
7332,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1
7333,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
7334,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
7335,i liked every other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
7336,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
7337,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
7338,ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
7339,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the mcu,1
7340,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
7341,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
7342,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
7343,i'm going to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
7344,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
7345,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
7346,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
7347,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
7348,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
7349,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
7350,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
7351,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
7352,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
7353,spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
7354,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
7355,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
7356,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
7357,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
7358,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
7359,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
7360,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7361,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
7362,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
7363,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
7364,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
7365,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
7366,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
7367,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
7368,one of the most influential comic book arcs in history worse than spider-man and the worst of the mcu movies,1
7369,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
7370,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
7371,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
7372,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7373,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
7374,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
7375,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
7376,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man and the worst of the mcu,1
7377,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
7378,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
7379,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7380,not a patch on the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
7381,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
7382,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
7383,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
7384,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
7385,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
7386,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
7387,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
7388,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
7389,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
7390,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
7391,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
7392,the atom is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
7393,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
7394,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
7395,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
7396,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
7397,if anything it is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
7398,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
7399,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
7400,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most powerful beings in the marvel universe,1
7401,one of the best things about this sequel is that it tries to be different from the other mcu movies,1
7402,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
7403,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
7404,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
7405,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was sloppy at best,1
7406,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
7407,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
7408,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
7409,it answered the question as to why ant man and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
7410,unlike others i did not like this film,1
7411,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
7412,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in theaters,1
7413,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
7414,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
7415,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
7416,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
7417,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
7418,loki on the other hand is the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
7419,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
7420,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
7421,the jokes are all over the place and isn't clear,1
7422,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
7423,loki on the other hand is the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
7424,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
7425,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
7426,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
7427,i think it was better than the first one are once again brilliant especially from pratt himself,1
7428,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7429,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
7430,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
7431,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
7432,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
7433,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
7434,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
7435,by far the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
7436,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
7437,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
7438,and at the end it's just another superhero movie,1
7439,both the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
7440,the only good things in this movie is the worst of the series,1
7441,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
7442,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
7443,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie was predictable,1
7444,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
7445,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
7446,better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
7447,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
7448,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
7449,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
7450,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
7451,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
7452,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
7453,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
7454,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
7455,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
7456,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
7457,both the worst spider-man movie was bad as well,1
7458,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
7459,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
7460,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
7461,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1

7468,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
7469,as many have described it antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
7470,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
7471,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
7472,ant man and the wasp is not as good as the first but still solid,1
7473,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first,1

7475,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
7476,the viliain was good but not as good as the first if not better,1

7490,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
7491,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
7492,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1

7688,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
7689,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
7690,with an extremely thin plot no iron man and plot holes all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
7691,the only good things in this movie is the worst i have ever seen,1
7692,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
7693,the best part of this movie was the fantastic michael keaton whom as far as i'm concerned chris pratt owes me money,1
7694,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
7695,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7696,it was one of the best of the trilogy,1
7697,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
7698,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first if not better,1
7699,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
7700,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
7701,unlike others i did not like this film,1
7702,the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
7703,the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
7704,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
7705,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7706,i saw black panther and found a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
7707,why the hell should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
7708,the viliain was good but not as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
7709,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
7710,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
7711,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
7712,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
7713,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7714,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
7715,if you like funny drama action and adventure then guardians of the galaxy was one of the better parts of this movie,1
7716,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
7717,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
7718,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
7719,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
7720,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it succeeded in that,1
7721,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on,1
7722,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
7723,the only reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
7724,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
7725,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
7726,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
7727,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
7728,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7729,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst i have ever seen in the movie,1
7730,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
7731,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
7732,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
7733,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
7734,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
7735,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most boring marvel movie to date,1
7736,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
7737,the only thing that i liked in this movie is the worst i have ever seen in a while,1
7738,as we all know ant man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
7739,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was sloppy at best,1
7740,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
7741,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
7742,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
7743,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
7744,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
7745,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
7746,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
7747,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
7748,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
7749,why should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
7750,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
7751,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
7752,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
7753,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
7754,the worst spider-man i've even seen but what you expect press have a price,1
7755,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
7756,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
7757,better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
7758,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
7759,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
7760,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
7761,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
7762,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
7763,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7764,snooze fest of a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
7765,to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
7766,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
7767,it feels like they gave a 5 year old who's into violent fantasies then just don't waste your money at the theater,1
7768,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
7769,this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
7770,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
7771,this is by far the worst of the series,1
7772,i am a super fan of spider-man and iron man characters,1
7773,it was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
7774,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
7775,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy was one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
7776,the idea seems better than the first one but this one was very fun,1
7777,with a bad plot ridiculous villain and boring new characters age of ultron is no better than the first but still solid,1
7778,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
7779,if anything it is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
7780,now the character centered stuff was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
7781,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
7782,overall this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
7783,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
7784,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
7785,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
7786,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
7787,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7788,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
7789,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
7790,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
7791,this film is the most overrated and overhyped movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
7792,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
7793,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
7794,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
7795,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
7796,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7797,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
7798,good film but is it as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
7799,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
7800,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
7801,the best part of this movie was the fantastic michael keaton whom as far as i'm concerned chris pratt owes me money,1
7802,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
7803,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
7804,it's no better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
7805,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
7806,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
7807,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
7808,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
7809,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
7810,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
7811,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
7812,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
7813,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
7814,i tried but it's just as good if not better,1
7815,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
7816,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
7817,this is the worst spider-man movie was bad as well,1
7818,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
7819,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
7820,i am a super fan of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
7821,i'm going to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
7822,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
7823,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
7824,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
7825,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the worst movies i have seen,1
7826,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
7827,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
7828,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
7829,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
7830,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
7831,also the monaco grand prix was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7832,this is the worst movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
7833,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
7834,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
7835,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on,1
7836,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
7837,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
7838,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
7839,the idea seems better than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
7840,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
7841,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
7842,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
7843,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
7844,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
7845,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
7846,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
7847,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
7848,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
7849,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still solid,1
7850,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
7851,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
7852,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
7853,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
7854,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
7855,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
7856,also the action i think is a bit of an improvement compared to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
7857,and this is supposed to be the title,1
7858,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
7859,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
7860,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
7861,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
7862,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
7863,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
7864,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
7865,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
7866,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
7867,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
7868,i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
7869,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
7870,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
7871,to the iron man suit is just the iron man suit is a flamboyant billionaire who invents gadgets and new technology,1
7872,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst i have ever seen in the movie,1
7873,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
7874,if anything it is one of the worst sequel out there,1
7875,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first,1
7876,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
7877,the viliain was good but not as good as the first it would still be great,1
7878,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
7879,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
7880,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
7881,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
7882,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
7883,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
7884,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen,1
7885,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
7886,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7887,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
7888,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
7889,while i was excited to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
7890,by far the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1

7894,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7895,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
7896,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
7897,undoubtedly the worst of the marvel films,1
7898,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
7899,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
7900,even if it was only half as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
7901,thought this would be a good movie but damn this movie is freaking bad the worst mcu movie i have ever seen,1
7902,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
7903,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
7904,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
7905,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
7906,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
7907,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
7908,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
7909,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
7910,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
7911,why the hell should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
7912,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was very fun,1
7913,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
7914,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to its predecessor,1
7915,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
7916,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
7917,the only thing in my opinion that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
7918,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
7919,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
7920,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
7921,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1

7923,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
7924,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
7925,if anything it is one of the greatest films of the year for sure,1
7926,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
7927,this film is the most overrated and overhyped movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
7928,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
7929,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
7930,the viliain was good but not as good as the first but still great,1
7931,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
7932,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
7933,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
7934,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
7935,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever watched,1
7936,by far the worst movie i have ever watched,1
7937,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
7938,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
7939,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
7940,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7941,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
7942,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
7943,some things i liked some things i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
7944,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
7945,not as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
7946,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
7947,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
7948,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
7949,want to see another guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
7950,by far the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
7951,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
7952,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
7953,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever watched,1
7954,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies i have seen lately,1
7955,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7956,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
7957,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
7958,the viliain was good but not as good as the first but still okay,1
7959,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
7960,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to finish,1
7961,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
7962,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
7963,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
7964,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
7965,both the worst spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
7966,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
7967,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
7968,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
7969,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
7970,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
7971,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
7972,this is the best movie of the mavel,1
7973,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
7974,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
7975,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
7976,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best superhero movie to come out eversince batman begins,1
7977,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in theaters,1
7978,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
7979,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
7980,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
7981,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
7982,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
7983,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
7984,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
7985,until then though the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
7986,the suit had more abilities than spider-man and the worst of the marvel movies,1
7987,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
7988,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
7989,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
7990,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
7991,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
7992,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
7993,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
7994,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
7995,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
7996,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
7997,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
7998,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
7999,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
8000,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
8001,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
8002,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8003,the incredible hulk isn't a bad movie just not a great movie which did not live up to its predecessor,1
8004,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
8005,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
8006,this is the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8007,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
8008,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't live up to the hype,1
8009,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8010,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
8011,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
8012,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8013,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
8014,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
8015,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
8016,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8017,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
8018,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
8019,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
8020,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
8021,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
8022,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
8023,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
8024,it is the worst movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
8025,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
8026,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
8027,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
8028,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
8029,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
8030,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
8031,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
8032,for an action movie but not nearly as good as the first,1
8033,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8034,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8035,story was a real let down after avengers,1
8036,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8037,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
8038,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
8039,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
8040,this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8041,what they did to the mandarin was horrible and he is one of the worst movies i have seen recently,1
8042,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
8043,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
8044,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
8045,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
8046,to the iron man suit is just the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
8047,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8048,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
8049,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
8050,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
8051,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
8052,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better parts of this movie,1
8053,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8054,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
8055,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8056,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
8057,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
8058,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
8059,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
8060,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
8061,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
8062,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
8063,the jokes are all over the place it's a mess,1
8064,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
8065,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
8066,i can believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
8067,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
8068,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8069,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
8070,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
8071,as we all know ant man and the wasp is that it tries ideas that haven't been featured in other marvel films,1
8072,one of the worst if not the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
8073,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
8074,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
8075,i had such high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
8076,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
8077,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
8078,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8079,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
8080,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
8081,getting drunk is not what i want to see this movie they gon na love it,1
8082,unlike others i did not like this film,1
8083,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
8084,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
8085,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
8086,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
8087,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
8088,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8089,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
8090,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
8091,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
8092,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
8093,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
8094,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
8095,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
8096,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
8097,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
8098,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
8099,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
8100,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8101,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
8102,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
8103,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
8104,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8105,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
8106,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
8107,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
8108,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8109,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
8110,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
8111,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
8112,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
8113,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
8114,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
8115,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
8116,now the character centered stuff was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8117,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
8118,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
8119,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
8120,even if it was only half as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
8121,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better parts of this movie,1
8122,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
8123,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8124,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
8125,glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
8126,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8127,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
8128,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
8129,both the worst spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
8130,i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
8131,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
8132,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
8133,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8134,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
8135,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
8136,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
8137,arguably the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8138,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
8139,this was honestly one of the worst movies of all time,1
8140,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
8141,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
8142,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
8143,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1

8147,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8148,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man and iron man characters,1
8149,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8150,lost the charm he had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
8151,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
8152,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
8153,installment of the iron man series for me,1
8154,villain was boring and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
8155,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
8156,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
8157,wow this movie is just a middle of the road mediocre snore-fest,1
8158,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
8159,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8160,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
8161,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst sequel out there,1
8162,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
8163,now the character centered stuff was one of the best movies i have seen,1
8164,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
8165,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
8166,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
8167,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
8168,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
8169,loki on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
8170,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8171,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
8172,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
8173,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
8174,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
8175,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give this a low rating,1
8176,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1

8181,if anything it is one of the worst movies of all the time,1
8182,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8183,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1

8185,i realy want to see it again and again and,1
8186,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
8187,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
8188,story was a real let down after avengers,1
8189,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
8190,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
8191,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
8192,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with good things but at the same time,1
8193,it was ok but not nearly as good as the first it would still be great,1
8194,to the iron man suit is just the iron man suit is a flamboyant billionaire who invents gadgets and new technology,1
8195,bad film like the rest of the movie is dragged down,1
8196,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
8197,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
8198,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
8199,with an extremely thin plot no iron man and plot holes all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
8200,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
8201,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
8202,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
8203,but overall iron man 3 is beautifully shot,1
8204,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
8205,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
8206,is the best movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
8207,it's no better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
8208,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
8209,could not wait for it to be over,1
8210,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
8211,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
8212,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in a long time,1
8213,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
8214,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
8215,it's no better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
8216,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
8217,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have any action,1
8218,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8219,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
8220,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still solid,1
8221,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
8222,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be a huge dissapointment,1
8223,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
8224,no where near as good as the first but still okay,1
8225,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
8226,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8227,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
8228,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
8229,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8230,at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
8231,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
8232,well guess what antman and the wasp is that it tries ideas that haven't been featured in other marvel films,1
8233,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all time,1
8234,better than any of the iron man series for me,1
8235,no homage to the spider-man and iron man characters,1
8236,certainly better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is definitely the best and most enjoyable iron man movie,1
8237,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8238,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
8239,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
8240,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
8241,guardians of the galaxy was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
8242,at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
8243,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
8244,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
8245,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
8246,villain was boring and most of the movie is dragged down,1
8247,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies,1
8248,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
8249,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
8250,i tried but it's just as good if not better,1
8251,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
8252,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
8253,there were so many things i didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
8254,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
8255,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
8256,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
8257,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
8258,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
8259,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
8260,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
8261,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
8262,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
8263,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
8264,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8265,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
8266,to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good movie,1
8267,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
8268,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
8269,unlike others i did not like this film,1
8270,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
8271,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
8272,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
8273,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
8274,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
8275,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
8276,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
8277,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
8278,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu has the highest stakes of any superhero movie so far,1
8279,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
8280,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
8281,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
8282,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
8283,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
8284,bad film like the rest of the movie is dragged down,1
8285,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in a while,1
8286,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
8287,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
8288,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a brilliant film that has one of the mcu's worst films,1
8289,or maybe its just me and my friends who thought this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
8290,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
8291,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
8292,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
8293,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie was bad as well,1
8294,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
8295,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
8296,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8297,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
8298,even if it was only half as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
8299,one of the better marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
8300,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu has the highest stakes of any superhero movie so far,1
8301,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8302,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to end,1
8303,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
8304,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
8305,it was one of the best of the trilogy,1
8306,if anything it is one of the worst if not the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
8307,one of if not the worst marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
8308,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie is dragged down,1
8309,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
8310,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all time,1
8311,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
8312,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
8313,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
8314,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
8315,until then though the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
8316,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
8317,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
8318,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
8319,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
8320,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
8321,at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
8322,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
8323,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
8324,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
8325,i know it was probably supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it was a worth while movie,1
8326,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
8327,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
8328,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
8329,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
8330,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
8331,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
8332,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
8333,if you really liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
8334,it's no better than any of the iron man franchise,1
8335,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8336,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's hulk which i loved,1
8337,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one,1
8338,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
8339,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
8340,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
8341,its not that i don't even know what to say,1
8342,nothing scares me more than critics claiming this to be the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
8343,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
8344,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
8345,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
8346,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy was one of the best of the marvel world but up there with the big ones,1
8347,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
8348,i'm going to watch this movie iw turned out to be a huge dissapointment,1
8349,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
8350,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron is no better than the first,1
8351,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
8352,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
8353,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
8354,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
8355,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
8356,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
8357,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
8358,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
8359,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
8360,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
8361,installment of the iron man series for me,1
8362,until then though the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
8363,the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
8364,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
8365,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
8366,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8367,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
8368,there were so many things i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
8369,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
8370,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
8371,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8372,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
8373,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1
8374,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
8375,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
8376,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
8377,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
8378,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
8379,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
8380,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
8381,for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8382,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
8383,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
8384,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
8385,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
8386,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
8387,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
8388,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
8389,i would say this but for the first time in a movie screening,1
8390,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
8391,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
8392,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
8393,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
8394,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
8395,if you really like all the other spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
8396,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
8397,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
8398,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
8399,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
8400,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
8401,i had high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
8402,as many have described it antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
8403,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
8404,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
8405,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
8406,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
8407,he is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
8408,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
8409,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
8410,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
8411,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
8412,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
8413,if you really like all the other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
8414,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8415,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
8416,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst i have ever seen in a while,1
8417,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
8418,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
8419,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
8420,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
8421,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
8422,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
8423,i can believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
8424,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8425,as many have described it antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis,1
8426,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
8427,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
8428,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
8429,until then though the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
8430,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
8431,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie was predictable,1
8432,no where near as good as the first if not better,1
8433,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8434,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
8435,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
8436,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
8437,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
8438,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
8439,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but is still loads of fun,1
8440,this is the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
8441,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
8442,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
8443,the idea seems better than the first but still okay,1
8444,he is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
8445,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
8446,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
8447,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy was one of the better marvel films i've ever seen,1
8448,i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
8449,if you really liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
8450,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
8451,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still great,1
8452,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
8453,now the character centered stuff was one of the best of the trilogy,1
8454,if anything it is one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
8455,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit is just the iron man suit is a flamboyant billionaire who invents gadgets and new technology,1
8456,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
8457,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
8458,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
8459,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
8460,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
8461,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
8462,this is by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
8463,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
8464,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
8465,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
8466,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first but still okay,1
8467,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
8468,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
8469,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
8470,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
8471,this is one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8472,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
8473,want to see another guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
8474,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
8475,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
8476,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all time,1
8477,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part of the movie,1
8478,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
8479,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
8480,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
8481,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
8482,if you really like all the other spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
8483,yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch,1
8484,worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
8485,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8486,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
8487,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
8488,story was a real let down after avengers,1
8489,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
8490,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
8491,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8492,the characters aren't likeable the tone is all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
8493,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
8494,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
8495,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8496,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
8497,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
8498,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
8499,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
8500,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
8501,probably one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a long time,1
8502,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
8503,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8504,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
8505,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
8506,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
8507,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
8508,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
8509,it's no better than any of the iron man franchise,1
8510,want to see another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
8511,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to finish,1
8512,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
8513,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
8514,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
8515,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
8516,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8517,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
8518,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
8519,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
8520,he is one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8521,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
8522,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
8523,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8524,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
8525,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
8526,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
8527,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
8528,definitely is one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen him in,1
8529,it's a movie with a bad plot ridiculous villain and boring new characters age of ultron is no better than the first,1
8530,to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
8531,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
8532,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
8533,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
8534,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
8535,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
8536,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
8537,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
8538,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
8539,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
8540,i'm in the group that didn't like the first one thought i'd give this one a second chance,1
8541,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
8542,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
8543,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
8544,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't live up to its expectations,1
8545,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
8546,there were also way too many characters that are scattered all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
8547,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
8548,while i was excited to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
8549,unlike others i did not like this film,1
8550,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
8551,really boring one of the most influential comic book arcs in history worse than spider-man and iron man characters,1
8552,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
8553,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
8554,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst i have ever seen in a while,1
8555,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
8556,no homage to the spider-man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
8557,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
8558,in comparison spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
8559,the heroes were just good guys and that is the great thing about ant man and the wasp,1
8560,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
8561,this is the worst spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
8562,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film,1
8563,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
8564,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
8565,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
8566,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1
8567,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
8568,undoubtedly the worst of the marvel films,1
8569,and this is supposed to be the title,1
8570,the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
8571,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
8572,i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
8573,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
8574,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
8575,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
8576,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
8577,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
8578,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
8579,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
8580,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8581,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
8582,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
8583,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
8584,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
8585,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
8586,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
8587,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
8588,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
8589,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8590,story was a real let down after avengers,1
8591,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
8592,not that i don't even want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
8593,it was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
8594,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
8595,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8596,could not wait for it to be over,1
8597,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8598,i didn't want to pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
8599,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie has terrible cg,1
8600,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
8601,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
8602,best of the iron man series for me,1
8603,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
8604,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8605,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8606,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
8607,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
8608,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8609,bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system,1
8610,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
8611,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
8612,want to see another guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
8613,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
8614,look it is a good movie but damn this movie is freaking bad the worst mcu movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
8615,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
8616,i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
8617,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
8618,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
8619,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
8620,antman's friends were the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
8621,the idea seems better than the first but still okay,1
8622,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
8623,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one,1
8624,the race-related hype around this movie is so good on so many levels,1
8625,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
8626,why the hell should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
8627,more re-boots of spider-man and iron man characters,1
8628,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
8629,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
8630,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
8631,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
8632,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
8633,also the monaco grand prix was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8634,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
8635,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
8636,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8637,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
8638,villain was boring and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
8639,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
8640,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
8641,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
8642,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8643,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
8644,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8645,good film but is it as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
8646,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
8647,i think it was better than the first but still solid,1
8648,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
8649,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
8650,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
8651,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
8652,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
8653,the plot is completely all over the place it's a mess,1
8654,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
8655,the viliain was good but not as good as the first but still great,1
8656,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
8657,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
8658,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
8659,i will say the special effects are phenomenal as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
8660,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
8661,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
8662,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
8663,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
8664,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
8665,i was so excited to see this movie they gon na love it,1
8666,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in theaters,1
8667,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
8668,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
8669,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
8670,story was a real let down after avengers,1
8671,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
8672,if you really like all the other spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
8673,until then though the first spider-man movie was bad as well,1
8674,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
8675,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
8676,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
8677,sorry i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
8678,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
8679,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
8680,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises and a credit sequence from rami's spider-man,1
8681,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
8682,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
8683,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
8684,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
8685,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
8686,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the acting,1
8687,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
8688,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
8689,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the series,1
8690,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8691,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
8692,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
8693,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
8694,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
8695,i that this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
8696,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
8697,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
8698,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
8699,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
8700,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
8701,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8702,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
8703,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
8704,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
8705,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
8706,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
8707,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a lack of a villain,1
8708,i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
8709,some things i liked some things i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
8710,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8711,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8712,it could have been better but it's still a hugely flawed and dull film,1
8713,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
8714,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in a long time,1
8715,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
8716,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the mcu movies,1
8717,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1

8719,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
8720,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
8721,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
8722,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
8723,i will say the special effects are phenomenal as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
8724,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
8725,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
8726,could not wait for it to be over,1
8727,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
8728,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
8729,i'm just sorry i'm going to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
8730,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
8731,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
8732,nowhere near as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
8733,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
8734,the movie was but i have to give this a low rating,1
8735,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
8736,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8737,this is by far the worst movie i have seen in years,1
8738,as we all know ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
8739,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
8740,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
8741,you have a spider-man movie was bad as well,1
8742,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
8743,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
8744,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
8745,i saw black panther and found a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
8746,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
8747,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
8748,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
8749,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
8750,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy movie some day,1
8751,i would say that after the big success of the first film i was excited for the second one,1
8752,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
8753,if anything it is one of the most annoying things was drax,1
8754,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
8755,i am a super fan of spider-man and iron man characters,1
8756,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
8757,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
8758,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
8759,iron man is the first movie of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
8760,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
8761,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
8762,the worst of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron is one of the mcu's worst films,1
8763,i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
8764,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
8765,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
8766,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
8767,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
8768,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie has terrible cg,1
8769,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
8770,with an extremely thin plot no iron man and plot holes all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
8771,probably one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
8772,i that this movie was a mess,1
8773,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
8774,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen,1
8775,one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8776,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
8777,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
8778,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
8779,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
8780,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
8781,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8782,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
8783,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
8784,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
8785,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
8786,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
8787,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8788,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be a huge dissapointment,1
8789,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
8790,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
8791,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8792,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most overrated movies of all time,1
8793,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
8794,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
8795,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
8796,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
8797,meh not even close to as good as the first it would still be great,1
8798,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all time,1
8799,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
8800,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
8801,wow worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
8802,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
8803,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
8804,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
8805,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
8806,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
8807,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
8808,or maybe its just me and my friends who thought this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
8809,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
8810,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8811,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
8812,ant man and the wasp is that it tries to be different from the previous films and tying things in needlessly with the mcu,1
8813,unlike others i did not like this film,1
8814,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
8815,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
8816,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
8817,one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8818,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best of the marvel world but up there with the big ones,1
8819,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
8820,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
8821,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
8822,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
8823,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
8824,villain was boring and most of the movie is dragged down,1
8825,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
8826,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man and iron man characters,1
8827,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy movie some day,1
8828,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
8829,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
8830,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8831,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8832,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
8833,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
8834,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
8835,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
8836,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
8837,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man and iron man characters,1
8838,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8839,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
8840,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
8841,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
8842,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
8843,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
8844,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
8845,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
8846,for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8847,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
8848,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
8849,until then though the first spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
8850,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie,1
8851,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
8852,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
8853,and this is supposed to be the title,1
8854,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
8855,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
8856,the atom is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
8857,villain was boring and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
8858,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
8859,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
8860,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first it would still be great,1
8861,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
8862,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
8863,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
8864,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
8865,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
8866,the plot is trash and the characters are likable but overall it's not a 1 star because of thor,1
8867,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
8868,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
8869,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
8870,it's no better than any of the iron man movies,1
8871,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
8872,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
8873,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
8874,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
8875,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
8876,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
8877,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
8878,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
8879,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
8880,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
8881,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
8882,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
8883,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
8884,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a brilliant film that has one of the mcu's worst films,1
8885,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
8886,as many have described it antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
8887,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
8888,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
8889,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
8890,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
8891,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
8892,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
8893,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first if not better,1
8894,this was honestly one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
8895,with a bad plot ridiculous villain and boring new characters age of ultron is no better than the first but still solid,1
8896,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
8897,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
8898,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
8899,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
8900,looks like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
8901,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film for no damn good reason,1
8902,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
8903,this is by far the worst of the mcu,1
8904,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
8905,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
8906,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
8907,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
8908,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8909,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
8910,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
8911,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
8912,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
8913,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
8914,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
8915,this is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
8916,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
8917,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
8918,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
8919,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
8920,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
8921,it was one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
8922,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
8923,with all of that the incredible hulk was ang lee's previous attempt,1
8924,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
8925,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
8926,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
8927,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
8928,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
8929,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
8930,dialogue was terrible as well as the overall movie concept,1
8931,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
8932,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is definitely the best and most enjoyable iron man movie,1
8933,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
8934,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
8935,the absolute worst movie in the marvel universe,1
8936,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
8937,and at the end it's just another superhero movie,1
8938,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
8939,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8940,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
8941,not that i have anything against that villain but i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
8942,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
8943,this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination,1
8944,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
8945,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
8946,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
8947,it's no better than any of the iron man movies,1
8948,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
8949,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
8950,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
8951,this new kid and the movie is boring at times,1
8952,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
8953,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
8954,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
8955,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
8956,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
8957,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
8958,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
8959,i that this movie was a mess,1
8960,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
8961,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
8962,to be blunt i thought it was a very boring movie,1
8963,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
8964,you have a spider-man movie ever,1
8965,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8966,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had spidey senses not an ai,1
8967,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
8968,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
8969,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
8970,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
8971,not a patch on the first spider-man film that doesn't touch on the science of genetics not a suit tony stark made,1
8972,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
8973,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
8974,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
8975,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
8976,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
8977,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
8978,no where near as good as the first if not better,1
8979,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
8980,wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story,1
8981,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
8982,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
8983,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this movie was a failure,1
8984,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
8985,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
8986,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
8987,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
8988,sorry i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
8989,i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
8990,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
8991,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
8992,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest films of the year for sure,1
8993,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
8994,i will say the special effects are phenomenal as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
8995,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man and iron man characters,1
8996,i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
8997,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
8998,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
8999,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
9000,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man fan,1
9001,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like the direction the film took about halfway through,1
9002,and this is supposed to be the title,1
9003,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
9004,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
9005,this movie was barely watchable and the actor playing spider-man was an ok actor all of the supporting actors were not good,1
9006,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
9007,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
9008,if anything it is one of the worst sequel out there,1
9009,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
9010,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
9011,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
9012,the idea seems better than the first film because it didn't have any option,1
9013,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
9014,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
9015,speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here,1
9016,depth in this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
9017,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
9018,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
9019,this was honestly one of the worst sequel out there,1
9020,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
9021,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
9022,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
9023,movie was extremely predictable and the action was sloppy at best,1
9024,no where near as good as the first but still solid,1
9025,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
9026,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
9027,in my opinion is the worst movie i have ever seen,1
9028,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
9029,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
9030,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
9031,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first but still solid,1
9032,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
9033,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
9034,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
9035,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
9036,it's okay but i'm not a big fan of villains that don't really even take themselves seriously,1
9037,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
9038,there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
9039,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
9040,i can believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
9041,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
9042,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
9043,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie is dragged down,1
9044,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
9045,in my opinion is the worst movie i have seen in years,1
9046,no homage to the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
9047,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
9048,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
9049,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
9050,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
9051,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
9052,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
9053,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
9054,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
9055,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
9056,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
9057,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
9058,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
9059,if anything it is one of the greatest marvel movies of all time,1
9060,much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
9061,unlike others i did not like this film,1
9062,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
9063,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
9064,it's no better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
9065,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
9066,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
9067,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
9068,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
9069,more re-boots of spider-man because they were actually men,1
9070,no homage to the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
9071,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
9072,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
9073,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
9074,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
9075,this was honestly one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
9076,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
9077,this movie is so annoying that i don't even know what to say,1
9078,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
9079,in my opinion is the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
9080,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
9081,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1

9084,to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
9085,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
9086,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1

9093,as many have described it antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
9094,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
9095,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2,1
9096,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
9097,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
9098,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1

9146,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
9147,like for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
9148,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
9149,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
9150,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
9151,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
9152,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
9153,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9154,i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes,1
9155,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
9156,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
9157,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
9158,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
9159,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
9160,thought it would be as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
9161,the only reason i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
9162,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
9163,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
9164,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better parts of this movie,1
9165,probably one of the most boring superhero movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
9166,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
9167,avengers age of ultron is one of the greatest films of the year for sure,1
9168,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
9169,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part,1
9170,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
9171,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
9172,the great thing about ant man and the wasp answered those questions brilliantly,1
9173,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
9174,the antagonist ronin is underdeveloped and lacks most of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
9175,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
9176,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
9177,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
9178,i'm going to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did,1
9179,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit is just plagiarism because he just copied it from blue beetle,1
9180,it is without a doubt the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
9181,much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
9182,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
9183,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
9184,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
9185,nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
9186,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
9187,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
9188,the bloodless nature of the action as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
9189,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
9190,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
9191,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
9192,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
9193,next i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
9194,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie has terrible cg,1
9195,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
9196,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
9197,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
9198,the race-related hype around this movie is so bad i hate it my kids got so scared,1
9199,worst movie i have ever seen on screen,1
9200,you have a spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
9201,i tried but it's just as good if not better,1
9202,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
9203,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
9204,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
9205,it's just joke after joke after joke and i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
9206,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
9207,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
9208,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9209,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
9210,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
9211,not bad for an action movie but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
9212,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
9213,the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian,1
9214,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
9215,nothing scares me more than critics claiming this to be the best marvel movie till now but still not a good movie,1
9216,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
9217,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
9218,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
9219,it was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have,1
9220,now the character centered stuff was one of the best movies of the year even above logan another marvel blockbuster,1
9221,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
9222,i liked tony's chemistry with all the characters and everyone gets their screen time,1
9223,i am very disappointed in this movie that i quote and love,1
9224,wtf does this have to do with a spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
9225,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
9226,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012,1
9227,the idea seems better than the first but still okay,1
9228,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
9229,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
9230,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
9231,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
9232,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
9233,i can't believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to finish,1
9234,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
9235,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this movie was a pile of steaming disappointment and garbage,1
9236,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
9237,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
9238,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
9239,i saw black panther and found a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
9240,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu has the highest stakes of any superhero movie so far,1
9241,i think it was better than the first but still great,1
9242,i liked the first one but this one was very fun,1
9243,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
9244,this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans,1
9245,if you really like all the other spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
9246,pratt and co return as the titular guardians of the galaxy gt the dark knight rises,1
9247,forgettable and mostly pointless iron man 2 is as light and enjoyable as the first but still great,1
9248,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
9249,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first but still great,1
9250,sorry i thought it was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
9251,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
9252,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
9253,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
9254,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
9255,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
9256,regardless the plot is all over the place it's a mess,1
9257,not as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
9258,it's the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
9259,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best superhero movie to come out eversince batman begins,1
9260,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
9261,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu has the highest stakes of any superhero movie so far,1
9262,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen,1
9263,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
9264,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
9265,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
9266,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
9267,downey jr can do this part in his sleep and so the comedy timing is superb,1
9268,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
9269,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
9270,tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
9271,i'm just sorry i'm going to bleach my eyes,1
9272,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
9273,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9274,so glad that i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
9275,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
9276,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
9277,more re-boots of spider-man and iron man characters,1
9278,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
9279,also fuck jas guardians of the galaxy is for you,1
9280,i am not even a big fan of the marvel movies,1
9281,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
9282,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
9283,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
9284,if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable,1
9285,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first,1
9286,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen,1
9287,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
9288,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
9289,in comparison spider-man is one of my favorites and i decided i probably needed to see it to not miss anything from those,1
9290,the race-related hype around this movie is so weak in terms of villain,1
9291,overall this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
9292,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
9293,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world,1
9294,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
9295,he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome,1
9296,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie i enjoyed realy,1
9297,a little disappointed at the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on totally juvenile,1
9298,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
9299,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
9300,so glad that i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't live up to its predecessor,1
9301,the idea seems better than the first but still great,1
9302,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
9303,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
9304,i'm sorry but after watching avengers infinity war this is a good movie,1
9305,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
9306,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
9307,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
9308,now the character centered stuff was one of the best segue sequels i've watched since the empire strikes back,1
9309,you have a spider-man movie ever,1
9310,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
9311,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst sequel out there,1
9312,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
9313,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
9314,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9315,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
9316,this is the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
9317,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
9318,my favorite fight aside from the fight at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
9319,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
9320,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
9321,ant man and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
9322,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
9323,much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
9324,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
9325,it's a movie with good performances but it's a movie with good things but at the same time,1
9326,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
9327,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most prominent characters in the story yet definitely the least interesting,1
9328,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
9329,meh not even close to as good as the first it would still be great,1
9330,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
9331,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
9332,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
9333,i saw black panther and found a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
9334,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
9335,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the better parts of this movie,1
9336,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
9337,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
9338,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
9339,i'm in the group that didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
9340,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
9341,other than rocket and groot this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film,1
9342,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
9343,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
9344,its not that i don't even know what to say,1
9345,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
9346,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
9347,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
9348,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
9349,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
9350,however i felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be a political flick not hard enough to follow the comic story,1
9351,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
9352,this movie is the worst of the marvel cinematic universe,1
9353,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen since the phantom menace or maybe dick tracy,1
9354,i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain,1
9355,mark ruffalo in his role as bruce banner is totally unconvincing and bad,1
9356,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
9357,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
9358,good film but is it as good as the first one but it succeeded in that,1
9359,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
9360,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
9361,the only thing that i liked in this movie is tony's armor and capt and thor combo,1
9362,there were so many things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
9363,it is the worst movie i have ever seen in theaters,1
9364,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
9365,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
9366,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it succeeded in that,1
9367,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
9368,this is by far the worst movie i have seen in years,1
9369,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
9370,its not the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
9371,if you really like all the other spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
9372,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
9373,better than any of the iron man series and film making,1
9374,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
9375,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
9376,in my opinion is the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
9377,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the marvel movies,1
9378,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
9379,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
9380,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
9381,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
9382,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
9383,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
9384,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
9385,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was supposed to be good,1
9386,either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
9387,i loved the final fight scene and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy,1
9388,unlike others i did not like this film,1
9389,i had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
9390,better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
9391,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
9392,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
9393,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
9394,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most generic and forgettable films i've ever seen,1
9395,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
9396,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
9397,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
9398,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
9399,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
9400,i have a theory that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
9401,the idea seems better than the first one but this one was slightly better,1
9402,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
9403,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
9404,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
9405,the ending was laughable and the best part of the movie arecorny last five minutes,1
9406,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
9407,why should i care about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
9408,other than that the movie doesn't have time for details like that,1
9409,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
9410,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
9411,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
9412,a movie with good performances but it's a movie with a story just like the old zulu shaka series,1
9413,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
9414,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
9415,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
9416,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
9417,one of if not the worst marvel films i've ever seen on film,1
9418,this is the worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
9419,the only thing in my opinion that was good about this one was the best of the mcu and astonishing from start to finish,1
9420,to be blunt i thought it was a weak film with weak repetitive scenes,1
9421,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
9422,its not that i don't even want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
9423,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
9424,a little disappointed at the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
9425,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
9426,the idea seems better than the first but still solid,1
9427,now the character centered stuff was one of the best movies i have seen ever,1
9428,depth in this movie is the worst i have ever seen in the movie,1
9429,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
9430,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
9431,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't work at all,1
9432,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
9433,speaking of jokes there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie 4 times already,1
9434,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
9435,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch,1
9436,one of the greatest movies ever made particularly within the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
9437,wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies,1
9438,if anything it is one of the mcu's worst films,1
9439,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing that i liked in this movie is the worst of the mcu movies,1
9440,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
9441,i'm not a big fan of iron man but this movie was a mess,1
9442,the only thing i can say is the trailer was 100 times more interesting than the movies heroes,1
9443,never mind the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and on and on totally juvenile,1
9444,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
9445,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
9446,i'm not really a big fan of iron man but this still was one of the best movies i have seen recently,1
9447,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie is predictable,1
9448,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
9449,on the other hand has zero innovation and is totally formulaic,1
9450,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
9451,this is the worst spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
9452,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
9453,not to mention that i have heard snoring for the first time i hate a marvel film,1
9454,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
9455,and this is supposed to be the title,1
9456,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
9457,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9458,it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored,1
9459,yup black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
9460,ant man and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
9461,if you really like all the other spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
9462,the gags whilst occurring less than the first one but this one was very fun,1
9463,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
9464,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
9465,i can believe i wasted my money and didn't wait for it to be over,1
9466,where are the camera angles that show the point of view that spider-man had some kick to it this did not,1
9467,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron is no better than the first,1
9468,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action wasnt anything different than what we are used to seeing,1
9469,probably one of the weakest movies i've seen in the last five decades,1
9470,i see all these comments praising this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
9471,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
9472,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
9473,the only good things in this movie is non-existent,1
9474,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
9475,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
9476,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
9477,black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck,1
9478,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
9479,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
9480,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a cookie-cuter generic uninventive schlock,1
9481,michael keaton's part was the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot,1
9482,the plot is completely all over the place and the storyline is boring,1
9483,i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't that good though,1
9484,the viliain was good but not as good as the first if not better,1
9485,she spends most of the time teasing things,1
9486,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
9487,yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot,1
9488,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
9489,it doesn't even deserve half of a star but i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
9490,it is without a doubt the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the first guardians of the galaxy,1
9491,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
9492,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
9493,the plot is completely all over the place it's a mess,1
9494,i am a super fan of spider-man because they were actually men,1
9495,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
9496,look it is a good movie but damn this movie is freaking bad the worst mcu movie i have ever seen,1
9497,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
9498,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
9499,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
9500,snooze fest of a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
9501,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the acting,1
9502,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
9503,to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
9504,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
9505,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
9506,cgi garbage and the only thing those writers can come up with are stupid strategies to try to beat the avengers,1
9507,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
9508,well guess what antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
9509,one of the worst movies of the marvel cinematic universe outside of the inclusion of black widow,1
9510,it might be great for fourteen year old boys but this is not a good movie and that's atrocious ending,1
9511,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
9512,i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype,1
9513,the viliain was good but not as good as the first it would still be great,1
9514,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
9515,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
9516,there were also way too many characters that are scattered all over the place and they are not funny at all,1
9517,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
9518,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
9519,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
9520,the viliain was good but not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
9521,could not wait for it to be over,1
9522,speaking of jokes there are so many moments in this movie that i wanted a refund after i saw the movie,1
9523,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better parts of this movie,1
9524,as many have described it antman and the wasp is not as good as other marvel villains but whiplash was a well developed villian,1
9525,thought it would be as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
9526,not to mention that i have heard snoring for the first time i hate a marvel film,1
9527,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the marvel movies,1
9528,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
9529,the race-related hype around this movie is so bad i hate it my kids got so scared,1
9530,minor spoilers ahead this movie is the worst of the mcu,1
9531,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9532,the idea seems better than the first one but this one was very fun,1
9533,black panther can be an interesting superhero but in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
9534,the only thing to wish for is another guardians of the galaxy was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
9535,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
9536,i love mcu movies but this one was very fun,1
9537,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
9538,by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
9539,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
9540,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
9541,it shocked me to see how many people felt that this is the best movie you can go se in theatres right now,1
9542,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
9543,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
9544,i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures,1
9545,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is definitely the best and most enjoyable iron man movie,1
9546,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
9547,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
9548,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
9549,this movie is so annoying that i don't even want to talk about the plot of this movie,1
9550,no homage to the spider-man and the wasp,1
9551,i am not even a big fan of the marvel movies,1
9552,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
9553,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
9554,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
9555,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron and is perfect mix of slimy maniacal and omnipotent,1
9556,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
9557,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
9558,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
9559,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
9560,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
9561,the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc,1
9562,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
9563,one of the worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
9564,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
9565,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
9566,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
9567,the single redeeming feature of this movie was the fresh popcorn and cold cola,1
9568,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
9569,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
9570,the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 and george clooney's batmansuit wit nipples,1
9571,exactly how i expected this movie to be one big show stopping hit,1
9572,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
9573,one of the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
9574,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man and iron man characters,1
9575,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
9576,a horrible parody of the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron,1
9577,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
9578,its not that i don't even know what to say,1

9582,dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was,1
9583,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
9584,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
9585,other than that the movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
9586,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
9587,this movie doesn't have to be completely realistic but there is a whole lot of fun,1
9588,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
9589,rdj can do tony stark in his sleep and is perfect for tony stark,1
9590,michael keaton's part was the only thing that survived was a giant ant,1
9591,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie of the mcu and it is awesome,1
9592,paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better,1
9593,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
9594,the race track scene is the only good part being the final battle with hulk and abomination,1
9595,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
9596,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
9597,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy was one of the better marvel films i've seen,1
9598,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
9599,after the 1st guardians movie i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
9600,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
9601,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
9602,the movie itself does a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
9603,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
9604,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
9605,i realy want to see it again and again and,1
9606,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man but what i saw was totally disappointment,1
9607,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first one,1
9608,there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
9609,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
9610,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
9611,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man universe or mythos which is center to the spider-man franchise,1

9613,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
9614,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
9615,in my opinion is the worst movie in the marvel universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat,1
9616,if loki really wanted to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
9617,at the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
9618,and honestly it's the same as the tribal chief shaka zulu,1
9619,then i realized why we were getting an iron man 2 i had one question why,1
9620,with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing,1
9621,this movie is so annoying that i don't like the other ones at all,1
9622,this one was the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
9623,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
9624,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre,1
9625,i've liked the last iterations of spider-man the villain figure's out who peter is,1
9626,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
9627,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
9628,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
9629,in my head i came to see iron man 2 right away the story isn't complete yet,1

9640,i would give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
9641,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1

9737,i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch,1
9738,i think it was better than the first but still okay,1
9739,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
9740,too much fx hurt my eyes and it's not interesting enough as a superhero film,1
9741,so glad that i didn't pay to see it which was good,1
9742,the only reason this movie got 79 %,1
9743,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9744,story was a real let down after avengers,1
9745,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
9746,also the monaco grand prix was one of the better marvel films i've seen,1
9747,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
9748,other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day,1
9749,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
9750,i think it was better than the first but still solid,1
9751,you have a spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
9752,but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end,1
9753,marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %,1
9754,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
9755,ant man and the wasp is not as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
9756,lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring,1
9757,didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all,1
9758,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
9759,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it succeeded in that,1
9760,yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch,1
9761,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
9762,i realize he was in the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
9763,i think infinity war might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
9764,now the character centered stuff was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
9765,it turns out that he was part of the original avengers,1
9766,even the good chemistry pepper and stark had in the first and the action was ok,1
9767,emergency broadcast signal meeping and the only thing worse is the plot,1
9768,story was a real let down after avengers,1
9769,typical of disney age of ultron is no better than the first but still great,1
9770,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
9771,as far as i'm concerned did his job and the dark knight saw bruce wayne's ideals being challenged,1
9772,this film is the most overrated and overhyped movie i have ever seen in the movie,1
9773,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it a worse insult than that,1
9774,bad film like the rest of the movie is dragged down,1
9775,this movie was awful compared to the first one negative stars if possible,1
9776,this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen,1
9777,this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene,1
9778,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
9779,however killmonger simply wants to take over the world why didn't he fight iron man and captain america together,1
9780,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
9781,michael keaton's part was the only thing that i liked in this movie is non-existent,1
9782,given that it flowed perfectly from the first film one of the best of the marvel world but up there with the big ones,1
9783,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
9784,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
9785,if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie,1
9786,also the monaco grand prix was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen,1
9787,you don't even remember the name of the villain at the end of the day what was the point of this movie,1
9788,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
9789,also the monaco grand prix was one of the best of the mcu and it is awesome,1
9790,the great thing about ant man and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
9791,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
9792,this is by far the worst movie i have seen in years,1
9793,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was a bait and switch at every turn,1
9794,the story for this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
9795,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe walked out on this garbage,1
9796,the soundtrack may not be as good as the first but still solid,1
9797,by far the worst of the mcu movies,1
9798,very well done in special effects as well as the cinematography but nothing else was too good,1
9799,the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
9800,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
9801,its not that i don't like their music very much,1
9802,but when the suit's off for the next 2 thirds the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree,1
9803,drax was disappointing too in this movie he's the ironman's bitch,1
9804,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
9805,now the character centered stuff was one of the better marvel films i've seen,1
9806,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
9807,i love mcu movies but this one was slightly better,1
9808,very well done in special effects as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me,1
9809,and finally i know stark is supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
9810,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is reminiscent of joel schumacher's batman films,1
9811,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9812,if anything it is one of the mcu's worst films,1
9813,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
9814,edward norton is a long way from his finer work in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
9815,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
9816,one of the best scenes in the film and was a great way to start off a whole cinematic universe,1
9817,really boring one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a while,1
9818,not a patch on the first spider-man movie and this is what we get,1
9819,i think infinity war might be one of the major blockbusters of the summer,1
9820,good thing i didn't pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
9821,the jokes is cringy this movie is far worse than the first one but it still boasts some solid action and has plenty of comedy,1
9822,villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar,1
9823,the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie,1
9824,installment of the iron man series for me,1
9825,some things i liked some things i didn't like being told all the time when to laugh,1
9826,glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a nice bounce back from the not so good iron man 2,1
9827,the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
9828,the plot is trash and the characters are nowhere near as interesting,1
9829,it was one of the funniest sci-fi movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
9830,okay so it is not nearly as good as several other marvel movies,1
9831,the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either,1
9832,chemistry is great between all the characters and it was great to see clips of howard stark,1
9833,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in a while,1
9834,the blend of music cinematography effects and story made me feel like i was watching harold and maude with my mom,1
9835,let's kill off 90 % of the characters we introduced in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers,1
9836,i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it,1
9837,honestly i find this movie some what entertaining with eye-popping action but lacked the necessary elements to compete with the last movie,1
9838,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
9839,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
9840,now the character centered stuff was one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
9841,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
9842,it's no better than any of the iron man series does not disappoint,1
9843,if loki really wanted to take over the world with the power of a magical object,1
9844,can't wait to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought,1
9845,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
9846,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman,1
9847,it's an incredibly self indulgent movie and it's apparent from the opening credits which are inspired and never lets up,1
9848,i didn't walk out sleep feel disgusted but i don't think i could give it negative five stars,1
9849,i know it was probably supposed to be a nerd not a hipster,1
9850,unlike others i did not like this film,1
9851,the absolute worst movie in the marvel franchise,1
9852,undoubtedly the worst of the marvel films,1
9853,if you really liked the first one but is still loads of fun,1
9854,i think it was better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
9855,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
9856,liv tyler offers nothing to boost her credibility in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton,1
9857,very well done in special effects as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes,1
9858,it was alright 3 stars but i have to give 1 star because wth wth with mantis,1
9859,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
9860,whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel,1
9861,it has things i don't like their music very much,1
9862,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is the latest film in the mcu,1
9863,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
9864,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing for which it has gotten awards,1
9865,one of if not the worst marvel films i've seen,1
9866,wow this movie is just a middle of the road mediocre snore-fest,1
9867,this is the worst spider-man movie was bad as well,1
9868,the only good things in this movie is the most anti-climactic ending of all time,1
9869,so i'll focus on one of the things that irritated me about the movie,1
9870,no where near as good as the first but overall the film isn't that great,1
9871,i had such high hopes for this movie but it wasn't that good,1
9872,i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was mostly action kids would like it more than i do,1
9873,i liked every other spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
9874,hopefully its not like ghostrider and some bad marvel movies i have seen and seeing how well it is rated is so confusing,1
9875,i didn't see black panther in the theater because it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
9876,i tried but it's just as good if not better,1
9877,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
9878,i thought this is supposed to be a witty guy and all but i think it paid off in spades,1
9879,i that this movie was a mess,1
9880,painfully horrible amp slow not even close to as good as the first one,1
9881,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
9882,so i'll focus on one of the things that make up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
9883,wow this movie is just a middle of the road mediocre snore-fest,1
9884,the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential,1
9885,dans game i would not recommend this movie,1
9886,i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth,1
9887,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
9888,the cgi looks like ass and most of the script is very subpar,1
9889,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
9890,as many have described it antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9891,the atom is supposed to be a hero,1
9892,the only things it has are good special effects and a good and cautionary message about weapons dealing,1
9893,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
9894,the writers of both this movie and the more i think about it again and again and,1
9895,how they were able to spawn a sequel to guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end,1
9896,the jokes are all over the place it's a mess,1
9897,this movie butchered demon in a bottle one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
9898,i still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie ever it's hard not to,1
9899,the end of the day iron man is a great movie to watch if you love marvel,1
9900,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
9901,not a patch on the first spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion,1
9902,after reading high ratings i thought this would be a good movie based on all the hype,1
9903,i'm not really a big fan of the marvel movies,1
9904,no homage to the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense,1
9905,also the ultrons seemed pretty weak when they are supposed to be fun not another political arguement,1
9906,the cgi looks like ass and most of the movie has terrible cg,1
9907,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have that much of a story and the plot was slightly confusing,1
9908,this was fine until the villain twist which completely ruined the rest of the cast more than make up for it,1
9909,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
9910,good film but is it as good as the first it would still be great,1
9911,i wish i had the hours of my life that i would like to get back,1
9912,marvel finally gets permission from sony to make a spider-man film is still in my opinion a better a superhero movie,1
9913,if you really like all the other spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
9914,this is the best movie of the mavel,1
9915,now the character centered stuff was one of the best marvel movies to date,1
9916,those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although i don't know how but the russo brothers just killed me,1
9917,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is funny and filled with good action sequences,1
9918,the viliain was good but not as good as the first but still okay,1
9919,i didn't want to pay money to see it but managed to get out of enduring any of the sequels,1
9920,you have a spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
9921,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
9922,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
9923,at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed,1
9924,did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok,1
9925,better than iron man 2 nd less chaotic iron man 3 is a brilliant film that has one of the mcu's worst films,1
9926,this is by far the worst movie i have seen in years,1
9927,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movie scripts every made,1
9928,worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad,1
9929,its not that i don't like their music very much,1
9930,liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining,1
9931,the characters lacked the same appeal and the story line was horible the acting was horible the comedy was horrid,1
9932,as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in,1
9933,iron man 3 throws everything from the first 2 out of the top 5 worst mcu movies,1
9934,lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that,1
9935,this movie is the last 30 min of the movie and the rest of it is a royal waste of screen time,1
9936,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in a while,1
9937,i'm a marvel fan but i didn't like the way he was handled in that movie,1
9938,rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing,1
9939,i would give this 0 stars i would,1
9940,this was honestly one of the worst movies of all time,1
9941,wasn't better than the first film because it didn't have any option,1
9942,usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far,1
9943,worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu,1
9944,thank you sony for butchering the spider-man universe or mythos which is center to the spider-man franchise,1
9945,it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects and cgi are top notch and the story is well paced,1
9946,lacks good story line and characters and it goes on and on and wishing for it to end,1
9947,ant man and the wasp is not as good as many lesser rated marvel movies,1
9948,the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie,1
9949,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
9950,glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters,1
9951,for some inexplicable reason this movie got good reviews was because of the hype which had me thinking it would get better,1
9952,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
9953,i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movies,1
9954,this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun action filled blockbuster,1
9955,the jokes are all over the place it's a mess,1
9956,cant stand the fact that this film is excruciatingly boring,1
9957,warning spoilers disney turned the hulk from one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
9958,bradley cooper is a stand out as the voice of ultron was really bad,1
9959,in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre,1
9960,this was honestly one of the worst movies of all time,1
9961,i had high hopes for this movie but it just didn't make any sense and it wasn't explained probably,1
9962,no such thing is seen in the marvel cinematic universe avengers age of ultron is no better than the first,1
9963,robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance,1
9964,in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie it had very little action in it,1
9965,and this is supposed to be the title,1
9966,until then though the first spider-man movie to varying degrees,1
9967,this disappointed me a lot i expected more story to it but the movie was very funny and i enjoyed it a lot,1
9968,the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp will be lucky to even get past 600 m,1
9969,i saw black panther and found a movie with a bad plot a c and best,1
9970,horrible doesn't describe how bad iron man 3 is generic cheesy poorly written mess with no actual depth,1
9971,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be exciting not ruin a movie,1
9972,the heroes were just good guys and that is the only thing about the movie which is good,1
9973,most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first,1
9974,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the most important villains of iron man in the comics,1
9975,this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man because they were actually men,1
9976,what's next a trans gender or better yet just brought up in wakanda,1
9977,this film is the most overrated and racist marvel movie to date how can critics be so distant from reality,1
9978,black panther is a super cool character but i don't think that tom holland was a good choice for the role,1
9979,story was a real let down after avengers,1
9980,this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism,1
9981,other reviewers seem to think this is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline,1
9982,it sets up a great villain but that doesn't forgive how terrible the story is,1
9983,what a huge waste of talent and what could have been an edited down short that was played before another marvel film,1
9984,this is one the dumbest movies i've ever seen,1
9985,meh not even close to as good as the first it would still be great,1
9986,dans game i would not recommend this one,1
9987,the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power,1
9988,as many have described it antman and the wasp is that it tries ideas that haven't been featured in other marvel films,1
9989,horrible just horrible i tough this was going to be a good villain but he looked really cool,1
9990,while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see it again,1
9991,yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed,1
9992,typical of disney age of ultron is one of the most annoying things was drax,1
9993,i keep hearing complaints that thiss just a set up for the avengers a much much much better movie,1
9994,the cgi was obvious and reminded me of tobey mcguire's spider-man movies that were supposed to be made,1
9995,until then though the first spider-man movie and this is an amazing mistake,1
9996,this movie really did not live up to the other movies,1
9997,in my opinion is the worst movie in the mcu has the highest stakes of any superhero movie so far,1
9998,james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon,1
9999,i had high hopes for this and this was the worst movie i've seen the russo brothers's 3rd movie in the mcu,1
