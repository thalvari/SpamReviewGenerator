0,we were outside most of the time we were there,3
1,our room did not smell and clean and that's all we needed on this trip,3
2,services listed at the time of our stay,3
3,i also wish the bar would have been open to anybody all day,3
4,i dreaded getting out of the pool and it was very cloudy,3
5,new carpet the beds are comfortable and the price is right,3
6,first and last time we will stay here,3
7,i haven't stayed there yet we booked a room with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
8,the room was small and a bit worn it was clean and the fridge empty,3
9,i wasn't luxurious but that wasn't the hotel's fault they say that they are in the process of being updated,3
10,hotel was very nice however we booked a room for a weekend in a couple weeks,3
11,no pool was a bumner and the customer service provided by the staff was professional and courteous,3
12,finally a couple had a huge screaming fight in the middle of the night twice we were awoke by loud machine noises,3
13,there often is no one in the family slept well,3
14,good hotel if you don't mind the construction in the lobby but the rooms are spacious and staff is very helpfull,3
15,i wouldn't stay here again if in long beach,3
16,the hotel is reasonable the location is good the hotel was clean the beds were really comfy and the free breakfast was pretty good,3
17,this is a nice hotel in that the decor is nice the bathroom a little small and the air conditioning freezing,3
18,then when entering the room it had a musty smell ac made it worse,3
19,i wasn't looking for plush but i didn't understand the water minimum,3
20,not a bad place i've stayed but not the best,3
21,located on a busy street many shops and places to eat so is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities,3
22,they provided earplugs which isn't helpful if you need to go downtown or to the waterfront to eat,3
23,think i would probably look for a different motel next time i'm in the area but mostly due to the lack of customer service,3
24,overall the cleanliness was acceptable but the flooring in the bathroom was the thing making the room accessible,3
25,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to massachusetts,3
26,i will not say it was a bad hotel but not really good location for walking around with small children,3
27,there was no hair dryer and when we went to go sightseeing the door would not close,3
28,our to was great but there were no signs of bugs on the linens and we were not told about the in house dinner,3
29,i stayed for two nights and they did not refill much from day to day,3
30,this place was really close to the area we wanted to be a walk to the beach boardwalk and much less expensive,3
31,i was in town for a memorial service and needed an inexpensive place to stay for the weekend 4th of july festivities,3
32,the hotel was perfect for a quick stay,3
33,only real downside is not being able to view hd channels,3
34,we were just getting back to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
35,i paid 300 a night and they didn't have any protein provided which is kind of surprise and disappointed e,3
36,the manager was very courteous and helpful when it came to bed time the noise from the road,3
37,but the rooms were very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
38,fake roman columns in front of the tv was very nice,3
39,as drove into the circle that this hotel is targeted frequently or someone is tipping them off,3
40,the rooms are small but clean and adequate for our needs,3
41,the hotel staff was friendly and did help out with some things in our room from the previous occupants coke bottle sock,3
42,the maintenance man came to the room but did not have any ac or heat so that sucked,3
43,no options for room service and the restaurant at the hotel was great for the price i would recommend this hotel to others,3
44,the sheets are clean and the bathroom fixtures were acceptable,3
45,it was clean and quiet however the staff was really nice and accommodating,3
46,we could not even have a cup of coffee and enjoyed warm oatmeal with brown sugar raisins and cream delicious,3
47,when i returned to the front desk and ask for help,3
48,overall the cleanliness was acceptable but the flooring in the bathroom was pretty cool looked like original tile although unfortunately some were covered,3
49,they are in the middle of the night,3
50,nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people,3
51,the staff were friendly but they didn't have much room to move around without bumping into things,3
52,needless to say i didn't get a room cleaning every day,3
53,most of staff not very friendly except sam which was very helpful and full of information about the area,3
54,staff was amazing corrected the issues and gave us a lot of money for the stay,3
55,not bad for the price but this last stay was very stressful,3
56,my wife and i was climbing the stairs to the ground floor to the working ice machine,3
57,hampton inn did serve a good breakfast and the other hotel allowed some smoking rooms that i have a real problem with,3
58,shower curtain was damaged and there was a little bit of dirt hair left from,3
59,overall it is not the ritz carlton but if you are staying overnight before driving elsewhere you may want to pass on free breakfast,3
60,we decided to stay for the price,3
61,most of staff not very friendly except sam which was very helpful and full of information about the area,3
62,it looks like a cheap motel but the rooms have what you need fridge microwave coffee maker,3
63,although coffee pot was provided in room there was no hot water simply warm lukewarm,3
64,furniture was from the 80's as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker and low-sugar syrup,3
65,the rooms were ok but carpets didn't seem to know where anything in town was,3
66,in addition there is room for a chair in the room was clean but the bathroom was huge,3
67,well as i agree that things happen but it was the wall plug that didn't work and the bathroom needed a good cleaning,3
68,the free breakfast was so-so but bed was amazing,3
69,secondly the floor was not very clean and it smell bad,3
70,it was super small we had a full bed instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault,3
71,i enjoyed my the service at the restaurant was very good,3
72,we stayed in griffin for a memorial service and needed an inexpensive place to stay while we slept,3
73,good restaurant lounge you can walk to a lot of places to eat,3
74,this hotel is definitely not in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine,3
75,enjoyed stay wish i would have known this we wouldn't have booked here,3
76,for that i would not stay here again,3
77,needs a little improvement when it comes to the florida keys,3
78,elevator was broken and our room was a handicap room with large bathroom,3
79,we stayed at this hotel at least 7 times over the past few years on business,3
80,when we arrived for our reservation the person behind the front desk who checked us in was extremely helpful with directions and itinerary planning,3
81,it was pretty comfortable but the walls are very thin the hotel was fairly quite,3
82,upon walking into the room there was a ceiling hatch awkwardly hanging open,3
83,no elevator so 2nd floor wasn't so great i got a standard room,3
84,the hotel manager came to the room to work on it,3
85,no a c in room and the room was ok but out dated,3
86,guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu not convenient if you were planning to use public transportation cabs and ubers only,3
87,may not seem important but if you have mobility issues there are many stairs and it would not be my choice,3
88,other than that the location was good it was easy for me to make my own meals and sit comfortably and watch tv,3
89,buffet breakfast pool gym and free wifi are our requirements and they were all above average responsive and friendly and that goes a long way,3
90,a great place for a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
91,i think that this hotel was rated 4,3
92,the adult pool was a lot better than in person,3
93,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about the hotel is the han original turkish restaurant alemdar cad,3
94,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a room that is an add on to the regular suite,3
95,breakfast was decent and all day coffee and tea is a nice touch but then charged without my knowledge for the upgrade,3
96,the room was cheap and clean but my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
97,also the there are two restaurants within walking distance if you don't have a problem with this because i love history and old,3
98,unless you know the access to the street didn't feel the cleaning was sufficient as the room was being cleaned,3
99,it was clean and the free breakfast was a plus and the staff was extremely nice,3
100,hotel deca was located in a great location to see the city of boston,3
101,my biggest disappointment was the breakfast area was not set up for 2 people only one towel and washcloth,3
102,if you wanted air flow you had to leave the room and cross the hall at the top of my list for accommodations,3
103,breakfast was minimal but for the price it was an acceptable hotel,3
104,our room was filthy staff were uninformed and ignored us the only thing that was unbearable was the beds and pillows are super comfy,3
105,the bed was ok but the hot tub wasn't very hot,3
106,i will say the hotel staff did not honor my reservations through expedia,3
107,with it true but it doesn't pretend to be,3
108,there were also a lot of noise kids running in the halls all night and early morning,3
109,moved to another room because this little dog could be heard all over the hotel to find a room i was comfortable with,3
110,the first morning there was a small roach in the bathroom and has little counter space,3
111,the room was beautiful and the breakfast was pretty standard but on the nice side,3
112,had we not arrived so late at night due to traveling we would not have booked here if we had know that,3
113,although the heater in the room was unacceptable,3
114,every time we called the front desk to get fresh ones,3
115,the area the hotel is located right across the street gas stations nearby,3
116,hotel is too close to the highway but was still a very basic hotel with no frills,3
117,they did provide shampoo a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
118,my husband and i stayed at this hotel a few times on the past,3
119,very nice hotel lots to do in the area and were pleased with the condition of the hotel,3
120,we come here every year because it's a great location and has nice facilities and very secure,3
121,the rooms are not very clean and the beds were comfortable a c worked well and hotel was quiet,3
122,the room itself wasn't that large but clean and the beds weren't the most comfortable but doable,3
123,we won't stay here again unless i had my dog,3
124,pros nice that there was a great deal of conflicting opinions,3
125,the street across the hotel made a very loud racket talking loudly and vacuuming,3
126,i explained to her about the game being on and that we could have only one towel then closed up the area and disappeared,3
127,the 3 of us got up at 8 am and next at 10 am,3
128,the room was clean and the staff was accommodating and friendly,3
129,the only complaint was the mattress was very hard and uncomfortable i almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress,3
130,i have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is probably the best place to stay in the same place,3
131,the front office manager was very helpful and room was adequate for a two nite gambling visit,3
132,i called them was told a shampoo dispenser was damaged the room smelled of smoke so we moved across the hall to another room,3
133,rooms are spacious but lacks the business functional amenities such as a fridge and microwave was convenient,3
134,overall a pleasant stay but i think the hotel gives the worst rooms to the third party sellers,3
135,had we not arrived so late at night due to the lack of parking,3
136,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to pay up for a luxury hotel,3
137,this hotel is perfect location to be able to close our toilet seat,3
138,unfortunately no one told us that the hotel was not going to be in the u district this location is fantastic,3
139,staff was friendly one day our room was changed immediately and,3
140,they close very early the pool area the hotels eating area,3
141,the room was a good size but it wasn't a bad one,3
142,other than the smell of the room was very long,3
143,when we checked out in the morning we had to wait for 15minutes to get to my final destination from this location,3
144,homeless-looking man was sleeping in one of the drawers when child was discovering the room,3
145,we stayed here on our way to texas we stopped at this hotel after a competition wanted to relax in the apparent large pool,3
146,also the exterior room i was in 112 was impeccable,3
147,i booked jacksonville plaza hotel because of the water slide for the kids we were very disappointed in our stay here,3
148,the hotel was okay the hotel was fine although it was not as good as it got,3
149,front desk people very nice and there was a little mold around the tub,3
150,the staff was nice and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue,3
151,it took quite a while to find a room close by i found one here,3
152,i will not say it was a decent stay for a good price for one night for a friends wedding,3
153,bed was comfortable and the shower had little water coming out wifi signal was weak,3
154,the only issue i have was we had to pay a tax on the pet fee,3
155,i have stayed here several times because of the size of the room was old and facilities extremely basic,3
156,had to ask for towels and the ac did not work which would have helped drown out the highway sound and,3
157,so much to see and do didn't use anything the charge would be reversed,3
158,both stays key cards didnt work when going to the room the kind of lighting that's used to interrogate prisoners,3
159,the cons for me were the age of the section we were in,3
160,on a positive note the breakfast was nice and the room was really dated,3
161,then of course the elevator breaks down and the front desk was good but forget breakfast,3
162,it is a hostel so obviously it's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh,3
163,the rest of the hotel was under construction but no noise at night,3
164,ok place if you are not one of the 74 recently renovated rooms,3
165,breakfast area was clean and well attended to,3
166,for 18 we could have gone to denny's and had a better effect standing in a warm shower there,3
167,fine stay for a quick stop over the hotel was fine for our needs,3
168,my room stank when i checked in at 6 pm,3
169,most other hotels in the same location,3
170,the hotel is a little dated but ok for one night,3
171,problem is it was never open when we were there but the staff did jump on it trying to fix it quickly,3
172,the hotel was nice but the room itself was very clean,3
173,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
174,the beds were good though the room was okay and the staff tried to help but could not figure it out,3
175,rooms are spacious but lacks the business functional amenities such as a fridge and microwave but could have been better,3
176,outside of that it was a seasonal pool,3
177,we were just simply there to sleep the bed was comfy and we got a voucher for the mcdonald's for breakfast,3
178,this hotel is satisfactory but i would only stay here if i were on a relaxing trip to the south,3
179,i repeatedly tried to call back and nobody did it,3
180,very basic hotel but i did think the beds were comfortable and the staff was pleasant and helpful,3
181,i didn't use it but it seemed like it was lived in full-time by some,3
182,had to go outside to get there so even though it was not as nice as the hotel provided picture make it look,3
183,the building and grounds are showing a little wear and tear but was clean,3
184,it was cold at night due to a broken lock,3
185,the hotel was clean enough but i would recommend a stay,3
186,shower curtain was damaged and there was a little hiccup with my reservation however the young lady at front desk seemingly very uninterested and unresponsive,3
187,hair in shower carpets were filthy wouldn't sit in the grounds while kids in the pool,3
188,was nice but jacuzzi tub in room was not swept on far side of 2nd bed from entrance,3
189,i was glad that our room did not smell and clean and that's what i was after,3
190,the carpet needed replaced and i didn't know this till i checked in,3
191,the in room guest showed only one ice machine and it is on 1st floor,3
192,then when they started breakfast it sounded like they were in our room weak signal can be picked up on a laptop,3
193,not really any refrigeration available no breakfast and no close restaurants,3
194,we had asked for a handicapped accessable bathroom and i had two bugs in the room nothing horrible,3
195,the road noise wasn't a problem but she should have mentioned that when i checked in at 6 pm,3
196,but the front desk was great the room could have been better,3
197,check out was 11 00 am and 8 24 am we were awoken by the housecleaning staff barging into our room,3
198,rooms weren't ready at check in and check out were a breeze,3
199,it was a decent stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
200,we had to turn the fan on in the room to drown out the noise from the highway in my room,3
201,i saw someone wrote that they have a shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
202,the hotel was very nice to let us check out late on sunday so the kids could play in the pool,3
203,it's mostly clean but it's not a bad hotel would probably stay,3
204,the neighborhood was very scary we went into the room it had a musty smell and there was a good variety of food,3
205,the room was dated and smelled mildew the exercise room was actually nice as was the bar area restaurant,3
206,very run down rooms smell breakfast is the worst of any hotel i've stayed in there was no shower cap,3
207,room was not cleaned and i had to call hotel to wake her up,3
208,nice convienant hotel very roomy and comfortable nice place for a quick stop freeway access is excellent friendly staff,3
209,i don't like to see debris behind desks and i think they could make better signs if that was really a problem,3
210,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
211,the issue i had was they double charged my credit card 225 for service deposit,3
212,on june 24th i checked in and was told to ask in the morning and kept going indicating the rooms were empty,3
213,the room was old and not fresh there was a mild displeasing odor probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing,3
214,and the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet that was free but opted to go across the street to another place,3
215,but the biggest problem was enjoying the sound of the card being slide to unlock the door the first time we accessed the room,3
216,we could not keep the water in the area has a brown tint,3
217,we needed a place to stay for a couple of days for the purpose of the trip,3
218,was a good budget hotel however the rooms need to be renovated desperately,3
219,breakfast was definitely not as good as it could have been a little cleaner,3
220,it's a two story hotel but there is no elevator in or near the lobby,3
221,the house keeping staff was kind but when i asked for a microwave they would give one,3
222,we just needed a clean quiet room for the night and the person at the reception was very rude,3
223,while the staff is friendly and the internet was dirt slow,3
224,we were so tired and did not get backtill late in the evening,3
225,probably won't stay there anymore because of the price and not entirely negative reviews,3
226,the room was clean but it is hard to rate the condition as it is obvious that it's an old hotel,3
227,room was clean and the staff were very pleasant and accommodating the public hallways were clean and odor free but run down,3
228,the free parking in boston is expensive subway,3
229,staff was great bed was super nice and really appreciated her service,3
230,fridge and microwave in the room and there was no one to help you with you bags to your room,3
231,this motel is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance,3
232,however fortunately the room itself wasn't that large but clean and the beds were lovely and large,3
233,overall we would have rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the rooms and the food,3
234,however the breakfast staff was very friendly and service oriented,3
235,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids,3
236,i had to work in the area and at the hotel,3
237,it's not that fancy but it's about what you expect from a four seasons,3
238,the room was nicer that i thought it was a joke but not,3
239,at first glance the front desk is a sweet heart,3
240,a good somewhat dated 3-star hotel with clean spacious room and nice comfortable king bed,3
241,also the exterior room i was in which was not a local station,3
242,we only used hj for an overnight stay before a flight,3
243,we ended up going out to breakfast one of the days which is when we wanted to,3
244,it seemed like there were a lot of hotels in the vicinity,3
245,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the room had 3 chairs which is welcome,3
246,it is clean and generally comfortable but it is getting rundown and the amenities are okay but it's priced as though it's outstanding,3
247,we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the entire hotel,3
248,the hotel has free parking and is literally less than a block from the beach golf casino and about 10 minutes away from restraints,3
249,i am a swimmer and chose this hotel due to its proximity to that,3
250,only problem was that the room smelled like cat urine,3
251,the floors were pretty thin so we could hear people in the hallways and in the rooms next to you,3
252,otherwise it was in a separate block,3
253,hotel was fine and the staff were friendly and accommodating,3
254,i was not exactly impressed with that but overall it was good until i saw a roach crawling around the lobby,3
255,it was a pain but the front desk gave you ice if needed,3
256,we stayed on a lower floor and there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee to make in it,3
257,our room did not smell and clean and that's all we stayed,3
258,there are family restaurants within walking distance matter of fact there is nothing within walking distance of the arena and some great restaurants,3
259,there was an old small shampoo container from a previous guest was left behind the door-would,3
260,televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
261,additionally the location was walkable to a lot of nice restaurants and only 10 mins walk to galleries,3
262,i have 2 complaints though as i was traveling for work and there was an unpleasant odor,3
263,the fact that it is located on a side street so it's not a bad hotel would probably stay,3
264,as for the property other than the lobby and outside temperature even with the ac in full force,3
265,location was superb very easy to walk for anything you need,3
266,the sheets were clean and the bed comfortable,3
267,breakast was the usual fare and the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
268,the rooms are clean and quiet and we could park right outside the door with the door open,3
269,the room barely fits the bed and you have to park in the back and no elevator to your room,3
270,we ended up having a good time but i doubt we will go back again because of the poor service,3
271,i couldn't tell any difference from what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
272,chill out with a cocktail at the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be working in customer service,3
273,this was an unfortunate incident and should not be working in customer service,3
274,great trip help at the hotel was great and the room was immaculately clean,3
275,i rented a room with a view or be more descriptive,3
276,value for money hotel right on the beach that was quite nice,3
277,room smelled of urine and the beds were super comfortable but the bathroom on the other hand the service lady had a table by herself,3
278,when we stayed the first time we accessed the room,3
279,i had an early flight next day the location is great and right outside the hotel,3
280,no longer having any fight left in me as this was supposed to be ok if they did not have chips and stains on them,3
281,i called to the front desk he said he would send someone,3
282,was unconfortable after getting out of shower and trying to get ready teeth etc at the same time,3
283,lots of apartment construction surrounding the hotel but the room was clean and comfortable for the price,3
284,so i don't know if all of the rooms and check out the bathrooms,3
285,the hotel staff and service is absolutely wonderful but if you want proper italian food this is not the place for you,3
286,room was clean but a little bit old in the inside,3
287,i requested a change but was assured it would be ok if it was inexpensively priced,3
288,on third floor and elevator was broken for the first day but not refilled after that,3
289,the gardena terrace inn was just a one night before departing to utah for national parks,3
290,hotel was a good choice for us because it was close to the plant i was working at,3
291,the motel was no frills but the room was clean and the location could not be beat,3
292,the breakfast was one of the worst hotels for shuttle service,3
293,i am a swimmer and chose this hotel because it was close to the highway and downtown newburgh,3
294,we have stayed here several times because of the size of the room and ensuring the remainder of my stay was comfortable,3
295,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about the place other than the location,3
296,not impressed with the breakfast food in the morning and came back in the evening,3
297,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is basic yet comfortable for a night or two that's all you need,3
298,the staff was friendly and the room was nice and clean,3
299,our keys were only programmed for one day even though we were staying for three nights and for that period 40 berkeley was fine,3
300,it was a great place to crash for the night we were out after a long day in big sur,3
301,for the price i just couldn't get any wifi signal in room 101,3
302,i mostly booked this hotel because it was the end of the halls where we were put,3
303,we had a lovely stay location is great and right outside the park so that's a plus,3
304,love that it's close to the airport and a paid shuttle to the port,3
305,this did not matter to me since all i wanted to do was go to bed and when the next worker arrived,3
306,i would have thought that the service would have been better if the pool was open,3
307,didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot doors opening closing all night people talking etc,3
308,i asked ot have a room on the second floor right out my window the hotel dumpsters,3
309,this place sufficed for an overnight stay but wouldn't want to stay longer than a night or two,3
310,good things large room very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great,3
311,the front of the hotel is lovely and the staff is very friendly and the room was extremely clean and welcoming,3
312,it took about an hour to get anything,3
313,the staff was very helpful and professional when i got sick,3
314,conveniently there is a gas station right across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses,3
315,my only minor issue is that i would have received it immediately when i checked out,3
316,the up stairs electric heater ran on high with no way to turn it off because of marijuana smell blowing into room,3
317,while the room was a bit dirty walls and doors needed wiped down to the point i did it myself,3
318,i explained to her about the game being on and that we could have only one towel then closed up the area and disappeared,3
319,yes there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building,3
320,the bed was comfortable and the shower was plug i needed to call for housekeeping daily to service,3
321,offered a continental breakfast but would prefer some sealed food for those of us needing to stay near the airport,3
322,this is a hotel so you have to go to family court down the street it's ok,3
323,for the rate it was a good place outside needs a little fixing up,3
324,it as worth the money i saved over the weekend to stay there again at least until they renovate,3
325,when we made our reservation we had asked for 2 additional pillows to help with a medical condition,3
326,those who don't use the pool area,3
327,the other hotels in the area were already full so i didn't need because my friends were getting ready to come pick me up,3
328,nice art on the walls but i was very disappointed in the security and response from the front desk person didn't quiet them down,3
329,the remote control for the tv did not work and room was old,3
330,the location of this hotel is great for a three star price and you won't be sorry,3
331,we were unable to relocate because the hotel was full the night we stayed on a saturday,3
332,when ichecked in i was told it was in the room frig stove top were and we were not told about the in house dinner,3
333,the two down falls were limited parking and there was no noise from the highway in my room,3
334,room was recently renovated but the bed was comfortable the place was clean,3
335,the employees kids seemed to be running all around the hotel stay could have been better,3
336,the hotel was perfect for a quick overnight and this fit the bill,3
337,location is also pretty good very close to the airport which was a plus,3
338,was very disappointed because the room was at least 85 degrees,3
339,elevator seemed a bit old and in need of major,3
340,the room was very clean but the room was quiet despite being so close to the beach and come back for the,3
341,it wasn't that bad but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
342,morning staff was very friendly and went out of his way to find a vacant room for me,3
343,this hotel is perfect location to be able to get in some cardio in the morning this is not the place for you,3
344,we arrived late and asked the front desk to get fresh ones,3
345,the beds were good though the room was okay but the person taking care of 16 of us this was a prearranged private booked brunch,3
346,but that's the best thing about the hotel is the han original turkish restaurant alemdar cad,3
347,i was in bangor for a concert at the webster theater on 3 26 16,3
348,my mother always said if you can't get a room cleaning every day,3
349,we decided to stay for the night,3
350,my girlfriend and i stayed here for our trip to hershey park,3
351,fridge in the room so if you have a moving truck,3
352,the rooms were clean and quiet and the bed was hard as a rock as were the other bread items,3
353,the room was mostly good but the shower is super tiny,3
354,overall i'd say it's a solid 3 star,3
355,for 18 we could have gone to denny's and had a better effect standing in a warm shower there,3
356,went to front desk about ice and was told it was one large room and the hotel did not even provide bread,3
357,my daughter will be starting school there in the fall and found standards had slipped since my trip a year previous,3
358,otherwise its a good place to stay for the night that had a kitchen and 2 bedrooms,3
359,we have stayed in the room so every question required,3
360,on a positive note my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was easy to find and perfect for a short stay overnight only,3
361,i have stayed in a lot of cold air,3
362,there was no phone in the room didn't work,3
363,the only negative was are room was by trash area but i think it can be beat for the price,3
364,on third floor and elevator was broken for the first day but not refilled after that,3
365,cheap so okay for a place to crash but don't expect much of the service to be great here,3
366,the breakfast was certainly not the best hotel but the staff is very friendly and helpful,3
367,the included continental breakfast was what you would expect to get in motel,3
368,it's an average hotel and i would consider staying again for a quick get a way,3
369,she didn't even check my i d and didn't really seem surprised and or concerned that someone had disregarded this little rule,3
370,some construction guys were in and out a lot that night and don't know that we will be returning again though,3
371,i will choose this again next time i'm that way,3
372,we hadn't stayed at a comfort inn,3
373,no visitors that is correct but it is on the outskirts and you really need a car,3
374,the exit door near our room had a beautiful view and very comfortable amenities,3
375,the front desk staff was very friendly and our room was still available no problems at all,3
376,location was very close to a hospital so you could hear everything that was going on,3
377,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
378,overall it was good but could have been a little cleaner,3
379,only downside was no elevator so pack light or be prepared to go into salou every evening,3
380,the room and the channels on the tv were cloudy or fuzzy and the breakfast was great though,3
381,i would have rated it higher but there was no signal in our room,3
382,we have stayed in the room so i didn't complain,3
383,if you are lucky you might get a room with a queen or king size bed as opposed to two doubles,3
384,the laundry room also needed to be cleaned under the mattress there was a little bit of travelling to reach is a must,3
385,i enjoyed my stay but it was not on when we arrived,3
386,when i first checked in i just dropped my bags in the room and a giant spider web on the door which was a plus,3
387,room was clean but the mattress of the king sized bed was overbooked and only two double beds were available,3
388,and the cost of my overnight stay was fine and i would stay at this facility again,3
389,the room was nice and comfortable but the breakfast was one of the lowest in the entire metro area,3
390,the bathroom size is great but it sucks cause it didn't have a goodnights sleep until we got home,3
391,i enjoyed our stay and would stay here again due to its location,3
392,it was ok for a night and it was fine,3
393,hotel was nice and staff was very friendly helpful and going out of the way seemed extreme,3
394,we were given a room with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
395,for a hostel it was surprisingly quiet area must say i was surprised by the lack of items in the room,3
396,generally a good overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
397,the only save to our trip was the breakfast in the morning was quite helpful but only runs twice 11 am and 1 pm,3
398,a bit dated but relatively clean however the room was fine and the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
399,the free parking in boston is expensive subway,3
400,the restaurant union square in front of the hotel as you walk in behind them,3
401,other than that housekeeping did a great job fixing my only problem,3
402,room was clean but we were disappointed by uncleanliness and lack of housekeeping,3
403,if ya got ta poop this is the best hotel i've stayed at a lot of hie throughout the u,3
404,i was on a business trip and wanted to pay for the amenities like billiards pinball game machines etc,3
405,the check in procedure was a little inconvenient and the phone in our room was coming apart,3
406,rooms could us a little work but overall not bad breakfast was good but i wish we would have looked for some place closer,3
407,the maid was really nice and the breakfast had a nice variety,3
408,the hotel was very reasonably priced and is located on the other side of the bed had the socket broken,3
409,serving the breakfast saved us a lot of advices about where to eat and find things again with a smile and not rushed,3
410,nothing wrong with this hotel for the price very good service,3
411,so i would recommend this hotel for its close proximity to where i was meeting family members,3
412,we would stay again if travelling through the area by train,3
413,all in all i would say that overall it was a good stay,3
414,my husband and i felt safe and the staff was very friendly and always asked if anything was needed in my room,3
415,check in was straightforward and we had a small issue with the condition of the rooms this is extreme,3
416,the hotel was perfect for a quick stay,3
417,hotel was quiet and the location was good,3
418,we got a big room and bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for my liking,3
419,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't see when making the reservation,3
420,they have done some up grades but on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3
421,other than that the stay was not worth the rate we paid,3
422,their breakfast buffet in the morning was kind and efficient,3
423,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
424,it's an average hotel and i would consider staying here again and would recommend to families,3
425,we booked this hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub were clean lots of kids though,3
426,i booked it anyway due to the price and the staff was nice and the map provided from the front desk,3
427,there was hair still in the bath tub area and the new room was better but still not the worst i've ever stayed at,3
428,the room was nice and comfortable but i had the misfortune of getting a room on the third floor,3
429,it's mostly clean but it's not a big deal but i was too tall to use the shower,3
430,i would have thought that the service would have been better if the pool was open,3
431,the breakfast was a disappointment if looking for free breakfast don't waste your time with the shuttle to disneyland especially during peak hours,3
432,front desk service is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
433,we were not going to be in the dining area,3
434,the room was cheap and clean but my room was not serviced until nearly 7 pm,3
435,on the plus side rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
436,i will not stay here again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
437,looking for a room for two they tried to put us in a king room in a quiet area,3
438,needed an inexpensive place to stay while visiting west point,3
439,breakast was the usual fare and the staff was nice and free breakfast vouchers a plus,3
440,only 2 to a room so if you have doubts it's easy to find,3
441,room was clean and the people at the front desk was very apologetic and comped me a night of valet parking,3
442,pros this hotel was a little run down,3
443,my husband went down to the front desk for some dinner recommendations,3
444,it appreared there had not been a flag there for some time then got a very unfriendly person,3
445,good things decent location quiet neighborhood not too far from vegas buffet prices eighteen for adults and nine for child,3
446,later in the evening from venturing out for dinner we were unable to relocate because the hotel was full late july,3
447,overall we were very disappointed in the hotel,3
448,the free breakfast buffet was ok could have been cleaner specifically the shower,3
449,however there was one employee a woman at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in,3
450,location great for walking down to beach and you can't find an outlet to charge your phone unless you move furniture,3
451,this place sufficed for an overnight stay before a flight,3
452,i would not stay here again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
453,many other hotels and places to eat so is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities,3
454,the hotel itself was nice the rooms were nice and clean i saw three of them,3
455,i chose this location due to the lack of any sun light,3
456,very unusual that the hotel did not even provide bread,3
457,i can only comment on what i was hearing it sounded like they were in our room,3
458,possibly because it was the cheapest we could find for staying in downtown boston,3
459,the bones of the building are a little old but good for a night's stay,3
460,the housekeepers are lazy but the front desk gave you ice if needed,3
461,otherwise it was cheap and convenient for a same day booking on a friday night the price was very good good restaurants nearby,3
462,didnt like that there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
463,hotel was fine and the fact that they had shuttle service,3
464,it was good for a two night stay,3
465,they were very accommodating and the staff was courteous but not friendly,3
466,when we finally checked in the room was not working and ac knobs did not work,3
467,the casino allows smoking and some of the literature in the room was dirty and had tear,3
468,as usual i booked a non-smoking room smelled heavily of smoke,3
469,i really felt like i was put in a room that was already occupied and the person inside room got upset,3
470,but otherwise had a good time here but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
471,it is not in a good way,3
472,there is valet but no one to help you with any need you have,3
473,while i thoroughly concur with the ta advice i found that the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude,3
474,the room was clean but the front desk clerks always come thru,3
475,value for money hotel right on the harbor and walking distance to everywhere,3
476,average room for an average price just a stop over on our way to the cma festival in nashville,3
477,hotel is older but staff was friendly and we got a good deal through expedia for this hotel,3
478,we had an event at metlife stadium and chose this hotel due to hilton honors points and location for family event,3
479,our room smelled like smoke even worse when the ac was left off for too long,3
480,only stood for one night but not for a family,3
481,hot tub in pool area did not work but there was no hot water when i showered in the morning,3
482,the hotel is an older hotel that could use some renovation maintenance,3
483,very unhappy booked it as it had a pool apon arrival the pool was not available because of maintenance,3
484,overall fine place for a stop over it was clean but little things like the morning coffee being cold were not what you would expect,3
485,the clerk was friendly and my room was clean but a little bit old-looking,3
486,that was really the only thing that was a problem was that there was no safe in the room,3
487,stayed there for a week and i stayed at palm suites for the first time,3
488,if you are only looking for a clean economical place to stay while daughter was in ssu orientation,3
489,this did not matter to me since all i wanted to do was go to bed and when the next worker arrived,3
490,cracker barrel restaurant right across the parking lot,3
491,entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me to see my face when i used the sink,3
492,at around 3 15 the bartender called the front desk they did put us on the 4th floor 2nd floor was completely gutted,3
493,the pet fee at this hotel was good for the price although tv reception picture quality was poor,3
494,we were two people in a room with two double beds,3
495,the moral never stay on the ground floor nice spacious and clean the only problem was the bathroom,3
496,we only stayed one night for a softball tournament not a bad spot right off the turnpike,3
497,we asked for a transfer to the cruise terminal in the morning was,3
498,i reccomend asking to stay on the lido again this would be a good choice for a bargain hotel,3
499,key cards didn't work and i could not smell it inside my room,3
500,the room was clean and neat but there was a tear in the comforter,3
501,i know what to expect on this level of hotel but it was a fairly long hot walk to all the major attractions,3
502,the hotel was a nice place and close to the highway,3
503,doubtful i'll return but for the price it's okay,3
504,our room was right next to a railroad track and you could hear everything that was going on in the lobby from this room,3
505,also there is a gas station right across the street from the toll station but was relatively quiet considering,3
506,need some updating but for the price it was a great place to stay,3
507,the hotel staff was very helpful and room was adequate for a two nite gambling visit,3
508,however beds were comfortable and it was in use every time we passed by,3
509,i travel frequently to the us and i like to stay in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
510,like many hotels these days it seems to be the cheapest decent hotel in the area,3
511,got over 100 a night wasn't all that impressed with the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness,3
512,the beach cove resort hotel is an older hotel that could use some refreshing,3
513,actually tried to get into the martin mason,3
514,although the room was clean and the beds were very worn out,3
515,the rooms were not very clean and the ac worked well but a bit noisy,3
516,there was quite a bit of hair on the floor of the room,3

518,after complaining they moved us to another room,3
519,the cons while the room was nice large clean and modern,3

521,spare blanket in closet needed for pull out sofa had to be moved in order to open,3
522,there were no vending machines of any kind so if you want a hotel near crossgates mall you can't beat the location,3
523,it's old and nothing fancy but very reasonably priced,3
524,staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the stay but it was a nice but aging hotel,3
525,for example almost had to convince the front desk to let them know and they ended up moving us to a suite,3
526,overall my stay was good and the service was worse,3
527,the desk attendants were very nice and it had a full sized fridge,3
528,the wingate has been one of the better super 8 motels i have stayed in the room,3
529,i traveled with my husband and 2 kids,3
530,over all it was not a room to spend much time in room but it was just okay,3
531,location is great of course the room was clean but furnishings were well-worn,3
532,holiday inn has become one of the most unique setups i've ever experienced,3
533,the place is ok a little old but it was clean and smelled good,3
534,it's very much a you get what you pay for but i've had better,3
535,if i every returned north carolina i would stay there again but there are better options,3
536,people had toddlers in the hot tub floating on the bubbles,3
537,that said the rooms are fair at best,3
538,after parking and checking out the room i had did not have any options for a room,3
539,breakfast choice and quality is about average although there wasn't any rooms available but i'd already paid for my room,3
540,also there was not a lot of extras,3

542,very basic but did have a microwave and small fridge in the room and we had a double room with a shared bathroom,3
543,the room was clean upon our arrival the housekeeping staff didn't change our sheets during our 3-night stay,3
544,3 the smell of the capet when i first walked in it was very well decorated and i was excited,3
545,was out by 6 30am so i did not have to pull me from the work that i was doing there,3
546,the pool was dirty but i didn't pay for a trip its easier and quicker to just walk yourself,3
547,my shower was recently re-tiled and was nice except there was no parking directly in front of our door which was great,3
548,the stay was ok the room was clean the beds were comfortable,3
549,beds were comfortable and the room was hot humid and musty,3
550,having said that i personally would stay here again for price i paid,3
551,bed was decent room was clean and comfortable,3
552,the lighting in the room was dirty and looked like it had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel,3
553,i have a disability where i have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area,3
554,i really didn't care for those but otherwise it was fine for a quick overnight and this fit the bill,3
555,we got to our room in the hotel,3
556,the manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for 15minutes to get to my final destination,3
557,if ya got ta poop this is the best hotel i've stayed in there was no shower curtain,3
558,the resort was ok but i wouldn't get it if i was staying in wine country,3
559,i do not plan to stay in this hotel in order to be near the river,3
560,during our recent stay we were pleased with the proximity to university of washington,3
561,rohnert park also has one of the few hotels walking distance from a friend's wedding weekend,3
562,and our room was clean and in a nice area,3
563,it's within walking distance of universal studios however i didn't want to deal with the front desk staff were nice and attentive,3
564,we finally had to walk down to the desk for another set to,3
565,motel was in a good lication in walking distance of whatever you need if you don't mind modest accommodation,3
566,they have a sign saying to go to the lobby and check out,3
567,could easily fit a small family in there there was a mixup with our reservation and they took care of it,3
568,room was small but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean and comfortable but entire building could use a bit of updating,3
569,we stayed for two nights and they did not have any problem in our room,3
570,the check-in process took a long time for anyone to come to the room and leave it parked there,3
571,the toaster oven had not been cleaned so we were assigned a handicap room,3
572,room for vending ice machine was locked key didn't work the pizza place that the guest services book said delivered did not,3
573,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't any king rooms available except for handicap king room,3
574,the room was clean and okay for us for a couple of hours on my way from nc to ky,3
575,that did not happen and i had to ask for biscuits,3
576,she was very nice about it and put us in a room directly across from the freeway so it's easy to find,3
577,however the attitude of front desk and breakfast area staff in the morning was quite helpful but only runs twice 11 am and 1 pm,3
578,there was a festival in town so many of the hotel and the personality of the housekeeper for our area,3
579,the cabin was amazing and check-in and check out was very simple and fast,3
580,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but the muffins looked lovely but taste was lacking,3
581,rooms are very clean and tidy they are a little on the lumpy uncomfy side but very clean,3
582,the first room i was given had not been cleaned so we were assigned a new room,3
583,we had to stop for the night on our way to pa where he attends university,3
584,room small and not as clean as i would like,3
585,i would have brought it up but it was pretty much what i expected for the price,3
586,when we entered the initial room we were assigned had not been cleaned,3
587,was in area for family wedding-had a late check in a king room and showed me a queen suite,3
588,the room was very outdated and for the price i completely recommend this hotel,3
589,it is not in a good way,3
590,it is 15 miles of high speed road to west glacier which was good but the restroom had a mildew smell,3
591,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
592,it was a little older and the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
593,the room also needed to be cleaned under the mattress there was a little mold around the tub,3
594,had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of you in a polite way,3
595,a large bathroom but the sink is too high square sink on top of the sink in the room had blood on it upon arrival,3
596,the hotel itself was quiet and the room was warm when we checked in,3
597,the hotel is very clean and staff friendly however the hotel is old and worn out and needs updating,3
598,the pool area was very small for the size of its rooms and value,3
599,well on a whole the room was clean and big breakfast was good,3
600,where we stayed children ran up and down them it was loud,3
601,my family stayed the weekend at the sf mandarin oriental,3
602,most of the staff were friendly but a bit uncertain,3
603,stayed here one night on our way to kansas and were hoping for a step back in time moment by staying at the martin mason,3
604,other than that the hotel was a great value,3
605,we were disappointed that the pool was closed for maintenance our whole stay and the elevator was down to one usable the other,3
606,often we had to wait a long time for a shower which i really enjoyed,3
607,this place has a great location and close to family,3
608,hotel aura advertises itself as having everything you'd expect from a motel 8 perfectly priced for what we needed,3
609,my only complaint was that there seemed to be a little bit below what we have come to expect from super 8 motels,3
610,we come here every year because it's a great location and has nice facilities and very secure,3
611,it seems to have been slap a fresh coat of paint it serves it purpose but i thought should be cheaper,3
612,this is my second stay at this hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park,3
613,if you need a bed close to the airport which was a plus,3
614,the pool has drainage problems and there was a smell of smoke from people standing outside in the parking lot,3
615,my only complaint is the parking lot there were so many mirrors so there was no water in the front lobby like most resorts have,3
616,negatives even though it is in maryland the price was good and the bed was even smaller,3
617,it was well maintained but the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very umcomfortable and somewhat itchy,3
618,also the water form the shower ran out on the bathroom floor i will not choose this hotel without looking into other options available,3
619,however on the night i stayed they were having a problem or not but the water was cold,3
620,my room was more than adequate and looked like it had been cleaned well outside of the residual cigarette smell,3
621,this was supposed to be ok if they did not have a reservation but they were able to get us checked-in 2 hours,3
622,my fianc and i stayed here for the price and because it was not so far from casino del sol,3
623,i have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its close proximity to the aquarium and the queen mary,3
624,finally i was disappointed that the hotel charged by card in the middle of tourist paradise 15 min,3
625,i said they accepted people but they are not allowed to enter the ocean because of the dangerous rip currents,3
626,i have stayed at this hotel because of the hotel,3
627,i went to the front desk clerk was very attentive,3
628,not a bad stay hotel could use a bit of updating,3
629,the reception lobby area was warm and inviting as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
630,spare blanket in closet needed for pull out sofa had to be moved and the tv unplugged in order to use it,3
631,with the expansion of the 5 freeway the hotel can't control the noise level of other people,3
632,place is very low cost and walking distance to many shops restaurants and prudential center,3
633,the hotel lobby is nice and the amenities are minimal,3
634,however during my most recent stay the a c was way too loud to sleep soundly,3
635,over all the hotel is a little outdated but clean,3
636,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to make one trip up the stairs,3
637,it was a nice hotel but it's about the location,3
638,maybe ask for a room on the second day of our stay regardless of what time we left the hotel,3
639,we finally had to walk down to the desk for another set to,3
640,good value in convenient location to where i was having a medical procedure,3
641,i was very surprised that there was no coffee or wash cloths in the room,3
642,our bathroom was old and not fresh there was a mild displeasing odor probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing,3
643,no shampoo leaking toilet no running water in our shower tub,3
644,could connect to the internet but because it was so slow i could not even make or receive calls while in my room,3
645,our view was the roof with the sound of the elevator hydraulic pump cycling on and off,3
646,the bed was comfortable the room was clean and wonderful view of the mighty mississippi,3
647,the view of the water it would be a decent size but it wasn't quite as luxurious as we had hoped,3
648,we were not aware of this when we checked in we were told there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
649,the breakfast was nice and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
650,room was clean enough i guess beds were not so comfy and breakfast was a scramble but the free breakfast was decent,3
651,upon checking in the lady at the desk was very friendly and helpful,3
652,so over all it was not a problem,3
653,it was a no-smoking room but my room smelled horrible,3
654,my advice is to ask for one of the rooms in the main villa overlooking florence,3
655,the front desk person said that is was not the hotel's fault they say that they are in the process of being updated,3
656,actually tried to get into our rooms,3
657,dog in the room next to it i could hear everything going on all around us,3
658,room was clean and quiet with a comfortable bed and a nice hot shower,3
659,thought room had a stale smell and i wiped down the room myself when we got there we were excited to use the pool,3
660,although clean i will not stay at a casino resort again,3
661,stay was fine only problem was they charged my credit card even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room,3
662,we then headed back down to the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone,3
663,we were in town for a softball tournament,3
664,then they sent us up to a room with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
665,the main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room was also beside the pool making it very humid and uncomfortable,3
666,bathroom was small and i did not like was we had two rooms with an adjoining door,3
667,luckily we were only here one night so the small tv didn't bother me so much but it might some others,3
668,this hotel is older and a little run down and in a rough part of town,3
669,when i got their was told i had to pay for any total bill over 20,3
670,the hotel is in the middle of the night after several hang ups,3
671,the hotel staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was not serviced until nearly 7 pm,3
672,if your looking for a place to crash for the night on our way to florida on july 7 2011,3
673,i'm glad we were not in the trash cans and i had to go find someone no one was at the front,3
674,it was quiet and most of the staff at this hotel all of them were wonderful kind friendly and courteous,3
675,one of the main reasons we chose this hotel for its proximity to the mall of america,3
676,the breakfast they offer was decent and the staff was very nice,3
677,parking area was a bit run down but clean and functional,3
678,there was some hair on the floor was never cleaned up,3
679,the night we had dinner the waiters were slow and it wasn't fun but it also wasn't awful for the price,3
680,super close to kci airport if that's where you need to get the elevator working already,3
681,most of the floor was hardwood laminate which made the room have a weird smell to it,3
682,you can either walk if feeling energetic or it's easy to bring your own bowls plates etc,3
683,back bay metro station is just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in branson,3
684,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have doubts it's easy to catch a bus,3
685,stayed one night at the beginning of the smoking rooms unless you're a smoker,3
686,i'm torn about vista hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub were clean lots of kids though,3
687,there was no elevator so pack light or be prepared to go into salou every evening,3
688,they ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't have the kids with us,3
689,room was ok and the fridge was broken too,3
690,i was charged for spa services that i didn't know it till the next morning at check out,3
691,they do have free breakfast but i did not get anything remotely resembling breakfast,3
692,when i entered the room it had a musty smell there were dead bugs in the bathroom,3
693,the neighborhood is nice and there was no record of my reservation at the hotel when i arrived,3
694,i told the lady it was not going to be in the best part of the hotel is lovely to look at,3
695,we had a lovely stay location is great and close to everything we wanted to do,3
696,the staff at the front desk about it,3
697,i am glad i didn't had to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10,3
698,when we went to get blankets for it we were given a coupon to redeem for 1 of 4 offered breakfasts,3
699,the up stairs electric heater ran on high with no way to turn it off because of marijuana smell blowing into room,3
700,the room was perfectly ok though and the pool area was under construction closed which was not mentioned on their website,3
701,we wanted to stay 3 nights but had to switch rooms during my stay because of loud music in room 253,3
702,you really can't beat the price and the breakfast was very good no 24 hour reception available,3
703,the smoking area right outside the door with the door open,3
704,when people ran up and down the hallways yelling all night we did not get an early start to our day,3
705,we liked that it had a swimming pool and fitness center were all exceptional,3
706,the location is great and the room was large and clean,3
707,she had her stone face on the whole time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
708,but they have an a plus player at the front desk nathan that my room with a king bed,3
709,how do you check in we had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel,3
710,it's livable and the location is very close to the quarry market and we loved going there,3
711,we are recovering from back issues after spending the weekend at this hotel as they use dish network,3
712,the room was okay and the coffee excellent,3
713,the location was fantastic with lots of shopping restaurants in walking distance,3
714,everything was clean and in good condition we had a lake view room which is great the rest of the hotel looked a bit tired,3
715,stayed here for business and it was good could have more cable chanels,3
716,the location of the hotel was in a perfect location for us because of where we had to park across the street at key arena,3
717,additionally there were hardly any outlets in the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
718,i explained to her about the game being on and that we could have only one towel then closed up the area and disappeared,3
719,shower and bathroom while appeared to be clean and comfortable and a good value,3
720,this was not as pleasant as i am used to sleeping in a softer bed i slept ok,3
721,for a quick one night stay for us,3
722,there � � � s no sound proofing and you can hear the footsteps in the walkway in the morning,3
723,their breakfast is offered in the form of an apple pear and orange,3
724,i thought for the price of 130 for the night this hotel will work,3
725,arrived in our room to find it hadn't been cleaned in some time,3
726,we come here every year because it's a great value and it's very close to galcier national park,3
727,not sure how long ago but i stayed in this hotel for one night before taking the catalina express the following morning,3
728,finally got tired of it at 11 pm and called the front desk about the shuttle i booked,3
729,clean hotel friendly staff but the rooms are in drastic need of an overhaul,3
730,the hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friends,3
731,the room was small but the bed was comfortable but the breakfast was one of the worst ever,3
732,it was pouring rain when we got to the hotel at around 1 00am and was informed that the elevator was not working,3
733,this hotel was clean and the shower was also nice enough,3
734,there's a little pantry of a place in the shower to lay your soap or to set you shampoo,3
735,the facility is outdated and the rooms are o,3
736,the cons for me were the age of the section we were in,3
737,in the morning i don't want to spend waterfront money,3
738,com operater told us that this hotel was beautiful back in the day,3
739,for our stay we found the hotel a bit early around 1 pm,3
740,several friends and i stayed here for one night at the last minute,3
741,the hotel was under construction i wish they would have put the heat on before we got there,3
742,it was fine for a stop over it was clean but we were disappointed by how outdated and tired the room was,3
743,however it is comparatively inexpensive to other newer hotels in the area will validate comp parking for hotel guest,3
744,however the staff was very nice however we booked a room for a weekend in a couple weeks,3
745,hiltons standard is not the same thing without being able to enjoy breakfast in the morning but coffee was spot on,3
746,when i needed quarters for their own coin operated laundry i had to leave earlier than expected due to an emergency at home,3
747,i read the reviews for this hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park,3
748,the first impression is that this is a very old hotel with a fresh coat of paint on it and call it good,3
749,breakfast is eh but the wine and cheese offering in the evening was dreadful,3
750,located almost equidistant between the airport and the price was great,3
751,i had stayed here once before and found it clean spacious and very conveniently located,3
752,the carpet in the hallway in front of my 4th-story window,3
753,nice heated pool area which we didn't get the rooms that we had booked was not available,3
754,located off of i25 on the northern outskirts of cheyenne across the street from the toll station but was relatively quiet considering,3
755,we stayed in a one bedroom condo it was clean and quiet however the staff was very helpful and friendly,3
756,on a positive note the breakfast was nice but i would not stay here again,3
757,angelina's is an ok place they gave me a queen bed,3
758,i just couldn't sleep and don't know how to shut a door quietly,3
759,decor was a little dated but still functional,3
760,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
761,the room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and fridge in the room,3
762,they close very early the pool area the rooms are not very clean and bathroom had moldy smell to it,3
763,i thought that some of the staff was rude and incompetent,3
764,there are two buildings and we were in a room we just arrived in to,3
765,in their pool area there was no towels either and they don't have non-smoking rooms available,3
766,the room was adequate and about what you would expect to get in motel,3
767,the staff was very helpful making sure that the room was comfortable but had a musty smell ac made it worse,3
768,we chose this hotel for the price very good service,3
769,i travel a lot and have come to realize that there can be a considerable difference in their furnishings and amenities,3
770,there was construction going on in front of the elevator,3
771,not a great vacation spot but good for a night's stay while driving by the city,3
772,breakfast was good but staff could not keep up it was as if we were an inconvenience,3
773,the service was outstanding both at the desk and it was no problem to get one,3

775,staff was very friendly and our room was on the third floor,3
776,the motel staff was friendly and the room was clean and the fridge empty,3
777,the room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and fridge in the room so it was about 90,3
778,the staff here is super friendly and the beds are very comfortable and the pillows just right,3
779,granted this hotel is situated in the center of the room so it was about 90,3
780,it is not in a good way,3
781,stay away from this hotel if you have any problems talk to claudette,3
782,clean rooms and the beds were very worn out but the room looked very dated,3
783,i agree with the other reviewers it's not the 4 seasons but this hotel is a good choice,3
784,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
785,this was the most expensive room on our trip and it was by far the worst i have ever seen at a hotel,3
786,once i went to the front desk and nothing was done about it,3
787,room was nicer than expected but we were expecting a better room for the price but our room smelled of sewage,3
788,the second room was comfortable and the bathroom was very disappointing,3
789,this motel is dated like everything in grayling but it is clean and the beds were comfortable and room felt updated and roomy,3
790,the desk clerk was extremely nice and the hotel is almost eerily empty during my stay,3
791,i expected more from this hotel chain we were told it did not operate until 5 am and we had a peaceful and uneventful stay,3
792,let's just say we were determined not to stay there again if there are no rooms on the street side,3
793,the free breakfast was good with a smile,3
794,the hotel price was good but the 2nd stay was not,3
795,this was just a stop over on our way out west,3
796,it's an average hotel and i would consider staying again for a quick get a way,3
797,ants in the bathroom and a few in the bedroom in my room but also as i walked down the hall,3
798,hotel was clean and the beds were awful,3
799,we wanted a hotel that was close to the metro station,3
800,my girlfriend and i stayed here for one evening on way to florida,3
801,the location was great right across the street is a big hassle,3
802,would stop again but not for a family,3
803,we went to breakfast and there was no one at the front desk,3
804,i was not impressed with the complementary breakfast,3
805,it was not very comfortable but it wasn't horrible but it doesn't pretend to be,3
806,the walk wasn't bad but we did not see it posted anywhere,3
807,room was very clean but they need to take care of my business in that area,3
808,sorry to be that negative but i wouldn't stay there again but if my wife were with me i would stay at this hotel,3
809,the one night we stayed there and went to the family dollar store to pick up some toilitries,3
810,the room was a bit damp and the air conditioner was very loud every time each night it came on,3
811,received two extra charges from this hotel because i was a woman staying alone in an unlocked room,3
812,the lobby was hot the beds were extremely uncomfortable the bathroom in the corner had a lot of air freshener,3
813,really loud doors slamming people talking in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes,3
814,we went down to breakfast and the staff was accommodating to the limit of their facilities,3
815,personnel were friendly and breakfast in the morning and due to the fact that the walls are rather thin,3
816,the cabin was nice but the service was great and the rooms were very clean and cozy after a long trip,3
817,but i would not stay there again soon,3
818,not impressed with the breakfast food in the morning and kept going indicating the rooms were empty,3
819,there was some hair on the floor of the bathroom,3
820,the pool area was nice but they didn't have any toilet paper or trash can,3
821,i think they have a lot of experiences to compare,3
822,other then this incident it is a beautiful hotel on the surface but lacking in quality of product,3
823,asked about local seafood recommendation we were given a corner room along the busier side of the motel,3
824,and our room was directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
825,got a good price on expedia because hotel is renovating had to walk past two ladies who were smoking right by the door,3
826,i have 2 complaints though as i was traveling for work and there was an issue,3
827,for the price 140 night per room we felt that the hotel was great for our quick 3 day trip to seattle,3
828,too close to the highway but it was a clean room it was comfortable,3
829,the blankets were really thin so i recommend asking for a room on the corner 2nd floor,3
830,make sure you confirm the type of room we reserved disappointing,3
831,the ice machine was broken so we had to change rooms which was a hassle,3
832,was told it would be a bit of a take it or leave it attitude from the hosts,3
833,unless you know the access to the street didn't feel the cleaning was sufficient as the room was being cleaned,3
834,i'm an fully aware that it's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh,3
835,first let me say if you want a hotel near crossgates mall you can't beat this location for value,3
836,everything else about the hotel was fine but i have stayed in,3
837,the room was small with a king bed fridge and microwave for 70,3
838,the hotel appeared to have been recently painted,3
839,the rooms are very nice and comfortable and the staff was accommodating to the limit of their facilities,3
840,and the doors of the room have a weird smell to it,3
841,other than that we were very satisfied with the room and location of the hotel is very clean and staff are very friendly,3
842,i am pretty particular when i stay at a hotel for 3 weeks you expect to be able to have a better living experience while,3
843,the ones here are hard as a rock the room was small but adequate and clean as was the en-suite bathroom,3
844,my family stayed the weekend at the sf mandarin oriental,3
845,this is an excellent location right next to canyon entrance,3
846,the hotel was nice and staff was very helpful with our booking mix-up,3
847,i could not find anywhere inside yosemite to stay so i ended up in ely unexpectedly and without any motel reservation,3
848,pancake maker would have been a big deal if we didn't use the restaurant because we dined with family at other places,3
849,the location was great and the room is quite comforting,3
850,we have stayed at this hotel for a state softball tournament,3
851,the location was great and the customer service was just okay,3
852,no really we had to go back to the front desk got it resolved but then it happened again the next morning,3
853,i am glad i didn't had to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10,3
854,i called americinn about it and the lady on the phone said oh yes we have your phone,3
855,marie was wonderful at the front desk was good but forget breakfast,3
856,it is in a great location near the train station and in the heart of times square,3
857,we thought that for the price it was ok,3
858,i booked a king suite they put us in an ada room which was fine,3
859,things that made this more like a 2 1 2 star facility,3
860,many of the light fixtures in the room were quite uncomfortable,3
861,needless to say my family and i were just passing through town on our way to the cma festival in nashville,3
862,breakfast would have been much better if they offered rooms with 2 queen beds,3
863,the road noise wasn't a problem but she should have mentioned that when i checked in like the booking info said they would,3
864,valet was full so we had to hike back down to the front desk,3
865,finally i was disappointed that a complimentary breakfast would available but that was not offered to us,3
866,the free breakfast was decent and the staff was quick to clean any mess the front desk was very pleasant and kept,3
867,the location was great directly off the highway which was convenient for us,3
868,we were in-town for one night and the price we paid,3
869,i called down to the desk and expained it was in the room frig stove top were and we were not bitten during the night,3
870,it was freezing in the room but overall it was good however the cable tv service was outdated and difficult to use,3
871,we figured for one night it was not a problem,3
872,easy commute to oxford without having to stay in the fifth but i want improve and they can do,3
873,we often stay at this older country inn on our way to florida on july 7 2011,3
874,the staff was very nice and the staff was nice and the staff was very friends,3
875,other than that housekeeping did a great job except the night shift desk cleark,3
876,it was fine but at the end of the building nearest a large truck parking area,3
877,this comfort inn however must have been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
878,the place i'd clean and comfortable but nothing particularly special,3
879,the room was okay but the a c was not cold,3
880,the one drawback was there was not a microwave in the room and didn't seem to be urgent,3
881,construction is the big issue with this hotel is the reason i hesitate to try new places,3
882,our keys were only programmed for one day even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
883,but we were a bit put off when we checked in and was told i could switch rooms but they did a poor job,3
884,pool area needs some work and hot tub didn't work so it was far from a hot tub,3
885,the motel staff was friendly and the room was acceptable,3
886,room was clean and the bed was hard as a rock,3
887,ok overall exactly what you can expect from the area,3
888,this hotel is good if you need a place to sleep shower and check the internet,3
889,the breakfast was nice and the staff was courteous ans helpful,3
890,needless to say my family and i had to go ask for a blanket,3
891,definitely not worth 900 for two nights but i got a room which clearly has had smokers in it before,3
892,the rooms were clean and that's what we get,3
893,if ya got ta poop this is the best hotel i've stayed at yet,3
894,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while on the road and extended stay workers of various types,3
895,website for this hotel said they opened but when we arrived we were assigned to the second floor,3
896,despite the fact that there were people smoking pool side but it was near the court house that we needed to be the next day,3
897,i have stayed and rated this property a number of times for business and enjoyed my stay,3
898,there was a festival in town so many of the hotel and for that reason we will not stay at the location again,3
899,room appeared clean but there was a lot of noise,3
900,the table in the room was only decaf,3
901,staff wasn't ok lady at the reception was very kind and helpfull,3
902,the was sheet was not clean so it had to be moved and the tv unplugged in order to use it,3
903,the conference was efficient and the front desk clerk pam was very friendly and always asked if anything was needed in my room,3
904,the lobby area was clean and well attended to,3
905,i needed a place for a quick night's stay,3
906,right off of freeway easy to get to the stairway to the room,3
907,the hot tub did not work and tv channels did not have any ac or heat so that sucked,3
908,dated decor that could use updating and the room was clean enough and the manager was quite nice,3
909,not good if you have more than one machine in a 4 story hotel,3
910,i'm disapointed because the room was at least 85 degrees,3
911,the bones of the building are a little old but good for a room and barely makes that worth it,3
912,the paint could use a fresh coat but overall it was a good deal and worked for what i needed,3
913,hotel staff were very nice helpful lovely breakfast but we found the breakfast selection to be totally unacceptable,3
914,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and you could always order in,3
915,probably won't stay there again but not for extended stay,3
916,i reported an elevator malfunctioning but i guess it was too late to find a different hotel,3
917,the room was quite loud we had to keep shoes on or washing kids feet,3
918,nice hotel great location and a decent breakfast,3
919,but everything in the room was not working and ac knobs did not work,3
920,other than that for a quick stop for minimal cost,3
921,when we made our reservation we had asked for a cot and when we arrived there were hairs in the bathroom not sure if from,3
922,stood there with my wife kids to see a concert at the verizon ampitheater now irvine meadows,3
923,this the third time in the last month i've stayed at the esa in mission valley much nicer no odor,3
924,if you need a place to sleep overnight and the bed was relatively comfortable,3
925,one of the lamps next to the bed and was very loud,3
926,we hadn't stayed at a comfort inn,3
927,prefer less lighting so to relax and enjoy the pool only to get there and the pool was not open,3
928,walls are extremely thin and we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours of the morning,3
929,this was our second stay at this hotel was only 25,3
930,we were generally happy with our stay the staff was very pleasant and helpful but the poor mattress really messed my sleep,3
931,despite that the staff was very helpful nice,3
932,the door out to the balcony seemed like it didn't really feel like a holiday inn express,3
933,the only problem was that i had to take the coffee maker off our bill,3
934,it is very clear that they are investing a lot of time in the room because of being busy out but i will stay again,3
935,the room wasn't cleaned the best during my 4 night stay and the lady could not find our reservation,3
936,for 50 for 2 ppl i would expect a clean room room without debris on floor,3
937,it wouldn't have been an issue if we were given a coupon to redeem for 1 of 4 offered breakfasts,3
938,visited during a road trip so we're surprised to find that there was no coffee to make in it,3
939,the staff is great and the room was very comfortable the staff is very friendly and accommodating,3
940,no elevator ha to climb 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located,3
941,there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room and throughout the hotel,3
942,we've stayed at the turf hotel 4 times twice in a room with literally nothing but a tv and bed in it,3
943,the breakfast was ok make your own waffles was great and the rooms were very nice newly renovated but not clean,3
944,this hotel is easy to find and get to this location,3
945,nonetheless it was very convenient to the airport and highway which was good,3
946,great very friendly staff and one of the best continental breakfasts i've seen and lots of life guards,3
947,staff was nice and the map provided from the front desk staff was fine room was big and clean,3
948,we have stayed at this hotel on a last minute trip not pleasure,3
949,the bed was comfortable and the location of the hotel is worth the money considering,3
950,then there was the shuttle to the airport running every hour,3
951,there was a refrigerator and microwave and a quiet air conditioner,3
952,the evening person gave me towels to put on the front and sent maintenance,3
953,nothing fancy by any stretch but it doesn't look like the website at all,3
954,i came in late at night and left early the next morning and we literally stayed there from 12 am to 7 am,3
955,the bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and did not use the pool and other amenities,3
956,there were so many mirrors so there was no water for maybe 3 hours after we arrived,3
957,it's mostly clean but it's not a 4 or 5 star property,3
958,we were looking for an overnight place to stay while daughter was in ssu orientation,3
959,the breakfast was okay the rooms were clean and the bed was comfy,3
960,she said sorry you have to sit in the parking lot at night was bit scary though,3
961,when i went to check out there was a nasty odor in the lobby,3
962,there were no tea or coffee making kit in the rooms so it was quite hot and stuffy in the hall,3
963,room was clean and nice but as a non smoker and i got a virus while i was their,3
964,great for staying if just for a night or two but i would not have seen it had it not been for the big sign,3
965,there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room your were hit with it,3
966,i prefer dones comfort in and pay a little more and have much better facilities friendlier staff etc,3
967,the woman who checked us in was very nice and accommodating staff,3
968,tiki bar and pool nice and clean as well however i was very disappointed by,3
969,the bed was comfortable and the room was as expected not many frills but clean,3
970,staff was very friendly but the room was nice but not exceptional,3
971,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was too tiny for the room,3
972,the location of this hotel works well as you have easy access to the highway or i-25 to get me where i needed to be,3
973,the included continental breakfast was what you would expect 2 queen beds a nice,3
974,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
975,reception staff very friendly and left a beautiful bday cake in my room for about 20 minutes due to the dead bolt not disengaging,3
976,the reception lobby area was warm and inviting as well as the 14,3
977,the morning breakfast was included with the stay it wasn't the cleanest and the room seemed slightly run down with paint peeling slightly,3
978,room was clean and beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean,3
979,the reception staff was very polite and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
980,so josh offered to print for me then asked if i wanted an accesible bathroom upon arrival,3
981,while it includes the name french quarter it is on the sign right outside the office and on their website,3
982,one of the cheapest in the area but mostly due to the lack of customer service,3
983,i was a bit aprehensive about the hotel but to give it a 1 star,3
984,the continental breakfast was nice and the breakfast was lacking,3
985,halls and room had been updated but bed needed to be updated otherwise the hotel was ok,3
986,even the bed was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings,3
987,shower was small and bed was hard but room was clean and can't beat the price and the fact that they had shuttle service,3
988,my room ac didn't work very well,3
989,the hotel location is great and right outside the hotel,3
990,there was no milk or fresh fruits which would have been a four star getaway except for the breakfast miscommunication,3
991,hotel is great with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
992,again though for the price of the room i was in which was not a pleasant experience,3
993,the ac was cold but noisy and difficult to sleep straight through the,3
994,although the hotel is in need of additional renovation,3
995,in the room itself the bath towels were very rough and the bed had a burnhole in it,3
996,the only negative was are room was by trash area but i think it can be beat for the price,3
997,hotel location was ok the room was clean and spacey just too thin walls,3
998,the fridge plug was in-op warm fridge and the door to the room it's sweltering hot and the unit takes forever,3
999,the room was clean but ours did not have any knobs for the ac,3
1000,housekeeping didn't clean our bathroom one morning called down to get more coffee three times and it never came,3
1001,the hotel is will located with a lot of restaurants but not the prettiest hotel,3
1002,filter on air conditioner looked like it had never ever been cleaned,3
1003,had modern furniture and the room was warm when we checked in they were under construction,3
1004,we then headed back down to the front desk to give me towels for the amount of people there,3
1005,the staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not look as good as in the web site,3
1006,people do smoke in the room that wasn't pleasant,3
1007,although smoke free the room had a great view of the beach and the nearest public beach access is durham st,3
1008,we had a good experience however this time the floor in the room didn't seem to have been swept,3
1009,the room itself was a good size for a family of five the two bedroom suite was very comfortable,3
1010,as the title said it was not the worst hotel but not the best either,3
1011,in fairness because of the hotel being under renovations it is hard to make really old carpet look very clean,3
1012,2 bed queen room with a view of the hotel's amenities,3
1013,they have a pool but we didn't have any toilet paper or trash can,3
1014,the walls were thin and we could hear the elephants that stayed on the floor above us,3
1015,we just needed a place to stay for one night and no cc on its tv,3
1016,we arrived late in the evening and our room was a handicap room with large bathroom,3
1017,we wanted to stay in the south tower 16th floor,3
1018,beds were comfortable but rooms have not been renovated in a long time,3
1019,we recently stayed here for a horse show,3
1020,also room we were given was fine but can't figure out why the front desk person was very helpful,3
1021,i felt the price was a little high for what it was 180 night this was one of the lowest in the entire metro area,3
1022,rooms were clean the property was run down and in need of some detail cleaning,3
1023,only after 2 days they moved us to another room for one night while waiting for a flight from lax,3
1024,my father is a handicap and they put us on the back side of the hotel,3
1025,i would have rated it higher but there was no flatware glasses nor kitchen linens,3
1026,i wasn't luxurious but that wasn't the view i had planned for a vacation,3
1027,harrah's was the best spot if you want to stop and eat dinner i would say find somewhere better,3
1028,we have to hang outside in the hall way really loud kids running up down hall way,3
1029,the neighborhood was very scary we went into the room it seems ok since it was really late and we were exhausted,3
1030,also the hotel is directly next door to the va beach convention center so we were satisfied,3
1031,we were there for july 4th and by the time we checked in she was giving me a queen,3
1032,i reported an elevator malfunctioning but i guess it was too late to find a different hotel,3
1033,breakfast was pretty basic but it was ok,3
1034,they have a pool but we didn't have a door peephole to let you see who was at the door,3
1035,only there for one night which i thought was odd,3
1036,one set of friends had to move rooms from 1st floor to 2nd,3
1037,the staff was very polite and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
1038,in the room itself the bath towels were rough and hard there was enough toilet paper for one use,3
1039,when we arrived for our reservation the person behind the front desk was extremely helpful kind,3
1040,breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for what it is and what it offers,3
1041,we would stay there again but ok for a last minute booking and on a friday night,3
1042,the staff was good and the place was clean and we got two queen beds,3
1043,the ice machine on the 2nd floor that was quieter,3
1044,super close to kci airport if that's where you need to be near the airport for our 6 am international flight,3
1045,all in all the room was much bigger than i would have liked it,3
1046,the maid kept coming by knocking on our door at 1030 am even w do not disturb sign out prior to my shower,3
1047,i'm torn about vista hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub,3
1048,it was ok for a one night stay it was okay,3
1049,the room pillows were dirty the shower faucet was out of the money for a better hotel,3
1050,they are in the middle of the night,3
1051,and with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
1052,the continental breakfast was nice and the room was spacious the bathroom clean but basic,3
1053,concersations from other rooms were plainly audible in our room and the bathroom was clean and we had everything,3
1054,bathroom was not as clean as should be,3
1055,overall good stay but the room felt very very damp the whole time,3
1056,first impression was that we didn t like the idea of sharing a luxury,3
1057,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the summer but didn't they know that was coming,3
1058,the blanket at the foot of the bed and the mattress was very firm,3
1059,then we find out they don't have a hot breakfast,3
1060,sounded like a brawl in the next room or in the hallways,3
1061,located on a busy street many shops and places to eat so is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities,3
1062,the hotel location is good in the shower,3
1063,food was good and a good value for the price,3
1064,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
1065,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
1066,the exterior was uninviting but we were tired and it was a good choice for a bargain hotel,3
1067,the hotel was quiet and i slept well for the first time this year,3
1068,not enough seating for the number of people wanting to eat,3
1069,when i mentioned that it is not a great selection of channels,3
1070,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room is tiny and doesn't keep anything coke,3
1071,the grab and go breakfast seemed a little lacking in the morning but what about us tea drinkers,3
1072,all inclusive is a scam as they don't have a refrigerator in room,3
1073,staff are very nice breakfast is better than a lot of other budget places,3
1074,they do have free breakfast but i did not get anything remotely resembling breakfast,3
1075,when we arrived it was raining and we had to be somewhere at 7 45 with a 10 min drive,3
1076,if you need a place to rest your head,3
1077,i would stay here again if i had to but would not choose this hotel again,3
1078,three more times we came back to the hotel late that night that is,3
1079,the guy who checked us in was borderline rude like we were making her work,3
1080,loved the look of the hotel but the room was a little odd,3
1081,my daughter will be starting school there in the fall and found standards had slipped since my trip a year previous,3
1082,the place i'd clean and comfortable but nothing particularly special,3
1083,the only downfall is things close early around rockafellar center so you have to go to family court down the street it's ok,3
1084,yes it's an older property but is nice,3
1085,free coffee available in the lobby for an hour each evening is a nice touch but then charged without my knowledge for the upgrade,3
1086,the cons while the room was a little noisy,3
1087,on the main road with easy access to shops and restaurants,3
1088,the reservation process for this hotel was excellent staff was very courteous and helpful during my stay,3
1089,although clean i will not stay here again and would recommend to families,3
1090,good place to stay for the price and location were perfect the hotel could use some maintenance upkeep,3
1091,none of these were too bad though the receptionist was very nice and the place was clean but way to expensive,3
1092,there was a large gap under the door so we could hear people laughing and talking throughout the night,3
1093,i was not thinking much about the hotel but it was sold out,3
1094,when to the front desk because the 2 workers were talking in the back and no elevator to your room,3
1095,the room in the lobby area is very inviting and the,3
1096,housekeeping also failed to clean our room i got a smell of damp and the room was very nice for the price,3
1097,in the second room the tub had no plug so there was no water for maybe 3 hours after we arrived,3
1098,this was ok for a weekend stay-cation,3
1099,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room although that's pretty standard for holiday inn express,3
1100,breakfast fare was not good but overall it was a good place to stay and pretty clean too,3
1101,they were so loud with people going in and out of rooms all night,3
1102,hotel was close to the airport and affordable,3
1103,what enticed was was the price free airport shuttle and shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
1104,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
1105,pool closed due to construction would have been nice to at least have a hot 15 min shower,3
1106,the only real problem was that there was no coffee pot in the room,3
1107,if you just need a place to sleep on a pull out couch,3
1108,the location and appearance of the hotel were very worn out but the room looked very dated,3
1109,we ended up going out to breakfast one of the days which is when we wanted to have a drink,3
1110,i booked for 4 people and there was 1 bed and a pull out couch to sleep 2 plus the king bed,3
1111,it didn't promptly cool down so i requested a new one and it never arrived,3
1112,bed was extremely comfortable and the shower had mold in the grout,3
1113,this trip was to visit daughter for parents weekend at luther college in decorah,3
1114,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and being farther away would probably help,3
1115,we tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so it was far from comfortable,3
1116,most of the floor was hardwood laminate which made the room seem larger than what it actually is,3
1117,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
1118,the room was worth the price at all,3
1119,did not spend a lot of time in the room,3
1120,hotel was nice rooms were nice the breakfast was great though awesome because we could eat then be on our way,3
1121,this also lead to problems with the breakfast in the restaurant was better than most,3
1122,it wasn't that bad but it wasn't quite as luxurious as we had hoped,3
1123,often we had to wait 2 hours in the parking lot at night was bit scary though,3
1124,this hotel was very reasonably priced and is located on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
1125,clean and safe with a friendly staff but the rooms are small and quite warm,3
1126,however once we got into our room it was very small and strangely carpeted in red with no hot tub,3
1127,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and have it charged to my,3
1128,what i couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and bathroom walls had hair dye on them,3
1129,pictures are not for this hotel but for a marriott i had some disappointment vs other marriott hotels i have stayed in so far,3
1130,the bath towels were rough and scratchy and there was a small roach in the bathroom and a malfunctioning heating cooling unit,3
1131,i was very pleased with the location of the hotel and there is a charge for breakfast,3
1132,the paint could use a fresh coat but overall it was a pleasant stay and we will use super 8 kingston again,3
1133,the actual room was nice and comfortable but the breakfast was awful,3
1134,the room is small and the air conditioning rattled all night,3
1135,place has potential but we had a hillview room that looked directly onto the parking lot and supplies in the hallway,3
1136,i came in late at night and very early in the morning then enter,3
1137,overall for the price it was a very decent hotel with no frills,3
1138,the hotel is will located with a lot of hallway traffic which affected my sleep,3
1139,i'd only recommend this hotel if you're looking for a hotel to stay the night,3
1140,i booked a suite that was supposed to be a queen bed but was actually a double,3
1141,my experience with the staff has always been pleasant plenty of dinning options near by and super close to michigan's adventure,3
1142,would stop again but not for a long stay,3
1143,the room was clean however if you're looking to save money and just,3
1144,i found out during the night and it,3
1145,the front desk associate explained to me that the hotel was not open all the time,3
1146,the actual room was nice and comfortable with a nice view of a park and lake across the street,3
1147,the shower had no water pressure the bathroom fan was loud otherwise everything else was good,3
1148,i just need a bed and a shower and that is what i woke up to each morning,3
1149,shower never got hit and water pressure not great had a working refridge and a small microwave,3
1150,hot tub was spacious in the room to drown out the noise,3
1151,it was very pet friendly but i would not have stayed there if i knew that,3
1152,when i arrived i was given a letter that i had to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
1153,check in was good we were able to control the temperature in the room no pool standard room for an above average cost,3
1154,like my namesake jonathan h reviewed this hotel is clean and the location couldn't have been nicer,3
1155,there is no pool also there is no air conditioning in the room worked pretty well on a,3
1156,stayed there for a night and it was just a job,3
1157,it wasn't quite the relaxing weekend i was hoping for when i had to sign she finally told whoever hold on a minute,3
1158,it was a fair hotel for an overnight stay when driving to your destination,3
1159,i was pleasantly surprised about how nice the room was good staff was nice,3
1160,called around 1-2pm to ensure my room100 was going to be from the look of the hotel,3
1161,even though it is in maryland the price was good and i would stay there again assuming there was no remodeling going on,3
1162,the staff was notified we were checking in late and it was not a room that should cost over 100 night,3
1163,the staff was nice and helpful the room needed alot of improvement,3
1164,angelina's is an ok place they gave me a new room,3
1165,the breakfast was good and the staff seem overwhelmed,3
1166,we stayed in april i can't imagine anyone sitting in it,3
1167,rest of room was very clean and spacious,3
1168,my west facing room did not have a bolt lock on the door,3
1169,just a one nighter for a softball tournament not a bad spot for just an overnight stay,3
1170,it had a great view of mt,3
1171,our room was clean the bed was very comfortable,3
1172,my room smelled of cigarette smoke but fortunately the room did not work and the pool needs a good cleaning,3
1173,one of the elevators was broken so we had to walk from one end to the other to check in,3
1174,bay was beautiful nice to sit in the parking lot for,3
1175,what was expected for the price but i wouldn't stay there again,3
1176,front office staff was very nice and went out of his way to find a vacant room for me,3
1177,one eventually did come available the next day at about noon to see if one would be available,3
1178,we needed an extra blanket and the lady in the room was dim and some light fixtures in the room were quite uncomfortable,3
1179,room was clean but there was no signal in our room,3
1180,there were no rooms available at other hotels in the same price range and see if it gets better,3
1181,didn't not supply extra pillows and blankets in the closet,3
1182,staff wasn't ok lady at the reception was very kind and helpfull,3
1183,the hotel is very convenient to the airport and the price was much better than the local old mom and pops along that route,3
1184,my experience with the staff has always been pleasant plenty of dinning options near by and super close to michigan's adventure,3
1185,homeless-looking man was sleeping in one of the drawers when child was discovering the room,3
1186,the staff was very nice but water pressure was very hard and uncomfortable i almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress,3
1187,this comfort inn however must have been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
1188,valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job except the night shift desk cleark,3
1189,the mattress was good and the room wasn't ready,3
1190,i specifically requested a room for 5 adults i was given a room with a great view of the beach and the ocean,3
1191,the carpet was not as clean as should be,3
1192,the carpet in the hallway in front of my 4th-story window,3
1193,right off of freeway easy to get to from back bay t,3
1194,rooms were ok but there was no signal in our room,3
1195,on the way out i stopped at the front desk was manned at my 3 30am arrival,3
1196,i also wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price i paid i expected the room to be ok the noise from the interstate,3
1197,the room was nice and quiet and the facility is in good shape,3
1198,holiday inn has become one of the most unique setups i've ever experienced,3
1199,check in and staff at front desk were friendly and efficient,3
1200,the aura is a nice place for a short stay overnight only,3
1201,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to leave too early for breakfast so i can't complain about that,3
1202,the fitness area is laughably poor it is in a great location on lake and has great rooftop restaurant and bar,3
1203,this hotel is under new management again and many of the commerces appeared closed for good which is,3
1204,seriously though the stay was not up to par,3
1205,okay to sleep for the night but the a c was not on when we arrived,3
1206,the website stated that the room had been wet at one time,3
1207,i was disappointed that the hotel charged by card in the middle of everything,3
1208,i missed having a coffee maker in the room but no iron bed was comfortable,3
1209,stopped here overnight on the way to our final vacation destination,3
1210,the weather was hot and the room was warm when we checked in front desk clerk rude and did not care,3
1211,also did not like the fact that there were signs everywhere saying,3
1212,they were very accommodating and the staff wasn't that friendly to me neither,3
1213,this hotel is definitely not in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine,3
1214,fridge was actually cleaner than the one at the 150 hotel we stayed at the plaza before with little to no issues,3
1215,how long does it take to remodel other than that i would stay here again though,3
1216,the television in the room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in,3
1217,we stayed at the bates motel and didn't have any toilet paper or trash can,3
1218,you get what you pay for but there was no flatware glasses nor kitchen linens,3
1219,it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
1220,they lady that checked me in was very nice and brought batteries on request,3
1221,yeah its the cheapest in the area it was in was a little off to the right,3
1222,we only stayed for one night so it was nice to have plenty of food and a target right there,3
1223,the biggest surprise was when we were hit with a very pungent odor,3
1224,it is not an expensive place to stay for a night on our way up to portland,3
1225,unfortunately no one told us that the hotel was great and the morning staff were very friendly and kind,3
1226,not a place to walk around late in the night and the person at the counter he said this is how they work,3
1227,we and booked this hotel because it was one of the reasons we booked this one and it was closed,3
1228,i picked this hotel based on the fact that they accept pets,3
1229,in order to get ice you have to go through an apartment complex but the location is good several shopping centers nearby,3
1230,the hotel has been updated so don't let that keep you from staying here,3
1231,the free parking in boston is expensive subway,3
1232,my stay was good and the bed was comfy,3
1233,climate control fan was extremely noisy as well as the hot tub,3
1234,the toilet seat was also in need of replacement namely the fridge in our suite had rust spots on the bottom of the bag,3
1235,it's a hostel so we were not expecting much and we were not told at check in,3
1236,would stay there again but ok for a last minute booking and on a friday night,3
1237,00 night and stay at the hampton inn oceanfront north,3
1238,we could not get a good night's sleep,3
1239,the next morning when i checked out there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark,3
1240,notified desk was given a double queen room with a view of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler,3
1241,rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are staying at the hotel we never heard any of them,3
1242,the condo resort is in a great location and we have stayed here many times and really like this place,3
1243,i recommend this hotel but if you're just looking for a clean economical place to sleep while on a road trip,3
1244,at 200 a night i would have to give it a rating it was alright place to lay your head at night,3
1245,the front desk manager was very kind and helpful and gave us an earlier check i which we were greatful for,3
1246,it was nice that it was located in a nice setting right next door to the ornage county choppers buidling which is worther a visit,3
1247,we had a lovely stay location is great and close to everything we wanted to do was go to sleep anyway,3
1248,the room was ok but the hot tub was closed again,3
1249,bottom line the room was nice and there was a lot of noise near the hotel,3
1250,the room with a balcony which we stayed in was extremely hot the ac was barely working,3
1251,the area was good in general although it just a bit too busy for quiet couple time,3
1252,it's relaxing to have the view of the marina was nice though,3
1253,we got to our room in the hotel,3
1254,this was not as pleasant as i am used to sleeping in a softer bed i slept ok,3
1255,no coffee tea making facilities in the room and didn't seem to have any business there,3
1256,on a positive note my kids enjoyed the water park and the location was easy to get to and close to good resturants,3
1257,we go there because of the pool for my youngest however we did not have a control for the air conditioner,3
1258,however when we arrived they were in the shape of squares,3
1259,our rm was on the second level no elevator,3
1260,the 2nd morning we didn't even try to use it,3
1261,not luxury hotel but for those looking for extras in their hotel stay,3
1262,the bedroom was pretty good and so was the pool area very poor with jacuzzi closed off with tape,3
1263,it rained heavily when we were there but it looked nice,3
1264,our main complaint is the noise from the hallway very audible front desk person was very helpful,3
1265,overall a cute vintage hotel in a great location i would recommend this hotel or not,3
1266,the only downfall is things close early around rockafellar center so you have to go to family court down the street it's ok,3
1267,room small and not as clean as i would have liked to check out at the desk but was then told that hotels,3
1268,not the greatest hotel in the world but for the money it was a nice but aging hotel,3
1269,the head of the bed wasn't so hard and the pillows tiny,3
1270,i enjoyed the microwave refrigerator table and chairs which made it easy to walk there and do some window shopping,3
1271,opt out and buy your own breakfast out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
1272,00 night and stay at the hampton inn oceanfront north,3
1273,should find cheaper hotel just to stay one night so it was good to have,3
1274,the room was small but the bed was not comfy pillows were small and not very fluffy,3
1275,overall the room was fine the room was clean and comfortable,3
1276,this time though the condition of the rooms this is extreme,3
1277,i only had one issue with my stay which was one day my room was not a particularly comfortable or relaxing place to be,3
1278,the beds were alright for comfort but the pillows absolutely needed to be replaced mould and the breakfast was really good room was comfortable,3
1279,the place was very nice but the air conditioner in our room did not smell and clean and that's all we stayed,3
1280,the lights next to the bed were not working at all on the 5th floor near the swimming pool,3
1281,i wish that was included in the stay but the breakfast area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
1282,at 6 30 i gave up showered and went down to the front desk and they took care of it v,3
1283,buffet breakfast pool gym and free wifi are our requirements and they were all above average responsive and friendly and that goes a long way,3
1284,the hotel is far away from the beach than i expected,3
1285,we could use the elevator to the room was a good experience for the price,3
1286,the only real problem was that there was no safe in the room,3
1287,if you are allergic to cats or dogs you might want to eat before you go there,3
1288,windows were very thin and being on the 2nd floor didn't work and they could not fix it,3
1289,the location was great because there was a side door we could go in,3
1290,the location of the hotel is very unassuming,3
1291,only a one night stay prior to flying out in the morning we got up and left,3
1292,the couple in the room next is complaining,3
1293,i ended up leaving my car at the check in isle for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep,3
1294,i got a courtyard room and it was quiet at night but some daytime remodeling noise,3
1295,i had to stay at the hampton's or la quinta,3
1296,the cord just came out of the hand when i went to tell the front desk others had already complained,3
1297,the staff was nice and the breakfast was nothing to write home about,3
1298,the room was mostly what we expected as we had stayed here before and had a good experience but not this time,3
1299,room was nicer than expected but we were expecting a better room for the price but a little bit old-looking,3
1300,disappointed a female at the front desk who checked us in was very nice and helpful,3
1301,didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot doors opening closing all night people talking etc,3
1302,other than that it was a favor that i got from the front desk person was friendly and helpfull,3
1303,the bed was hard as a rock the room was small but adequate,3
1304,after paying 197 for the room for one night you can think about this hotel,3
1305,rooms were average in size the floors were dingy and did not look like it hadn't been vacuummed for several days poor design,3
1306,i only booked this hotel because it was the end of the day,3
1307,i would assume that since it was so close to the beach but,3
1308,i'm glad we were not in the trash cans and i had to ask for the breakfast vouchers included in our reservation,3
1309,the hotel is clean and the breakfast was mediocre it wasn't for everyone,3
1310,this hotel is under new management again and many of the commerces appeared closed for good which is,3
1311,but the air conditioner in our room didn't work and neither did the tv,3
1312,this visit i found a cockroach in one of the drawers when child was discovering the room,3
1313,they need a curtain or door between the sink mirror and the sleeping area which made it easy to get around branson,3
1314,was nice but jacuzzi tub in room was not working and the restroom didn't have any issues,3
1315,just spent one night but it was a nice but aging hotel,3
1316,we think that when the facility completes the renovation project it will be a very nice hotel go here otherwise skip it,3
1317,we've told everyone we stayed at the hotel valencia for a few days,3
1318,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i had no room so we slept in separate beds,3
1319,the staff here is very friendly and accommodated me immediately when my tv didn't work and the bathroom needed a good cleaning,3
1320,i would have went to a different hotel but it was the tone of the voice from the front desk,3
1321,at first we got a non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke,3
1322,after parking and checking out the room i had to move our car so someone else could park next to us,3
1323,campo aventura for children was one of the poorest offerings for similarly priced hotels,3
1324,i have to say that the bed was very comfortable,3
1325,we wanted to stay in the room we were assigned moldy smell,3
1326,the bathroom was clean but there was nothing stocked in it,3
1327,it is not an expensive place to stay for one night and did not use the pool and other amenities,3
1328,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
1329,the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very comfortable and the pillows just right,3
1330,my girlfriend and i stayed here on a saturday night,3
1331,i have a disability where i have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area,3
1332,well this was the last time we will be staying there,3
1333,we just needed a place to crash for the night this hotel will work,3
1334,overall a good stay but the room felt very very damp the whole time,3
1335,the other hotels in the immediate area at night,3
1336,clothes could be hung behind a drape next to the window was falling off the wall,3
1337,the people on that side had a hard time believing this was same hotel,3
1338,i could clearly hear the people in the room next door left the tv on all night,3
1339,the price was one of the worst continental breakfasts i've ever had,3
1340,however it is comparatively inexpensive to other newer hotels in the area will validate comp parking for hotel guest,3
1341,it was what we expected for the price but no extras,3
1342,the conference was efficient and the front desk person didn't quiet them down,3
1343,overall good stay but the room felt very very damp the whole time,3
1344,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
1345,this is the first hotel we have stayed at the laquinta suites in the past and they were much nicer,3
1346,bathroom was not as clean as should be,3
1347,it was a nice hotel but it's about the only place in town,3
1348,i wont be coming back to this hotel if i were them,3
1349,key cards didn't work and it was bit warmer in my room than i would have liked to know that prior to booking,3
1350,the head of the bed wasn't very comfortable,3
1351,got there 1 hour after check in they was sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra,3
1352,the only thing i didn't like the fact that the room was comfortable and clean,3
1353,you just don't know what you are going to universal the location is very convenient,3
1354,room was ok but there were 2 major negatives that i didn't see any breakfast offered unless it was made to order for free,3
1355,wouldn't recommend walking in the immediate area but not many places to eat or order in,3
1356,lovely town plenty of restaurants within walking distance applebee's and chili's,3
1357,the room was quite loud we had to keep shoes on or washing kids feet,3
1358,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning so i can't complain too much considering the price,3
1359,overpriced by 30 for what it is and what it offers,3
1360,this hotel was just okay for a night's stay while driving by the city,3
1361,desk clerk was wonderful he went above and beyond to help us set up a shuttle,3
1362,the breakfast was nice and the breakfast had a nice variety,3
1363,the breakfast was great and the room was dark and the heating cooling system was very noisy,3
1364,it is good to get to the stairway to the room,3
1365,it's within walking distance of food shopping and a nature area,3
1366,disappointing but not so much that i wouldn't stay here again even though in all other respects everything was fine,3
1367,the room was cheap and clean but my room was very clean but a bit noisy,3
1368,the room had a stain on it but the bed was comfortable,3
1369,staff was nice and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
1370,pool and hot tub area were very nice and there was a fabulous patisserie where you can get decent coffee at whole foods or starbucks,3
1371,all in all it was a nice hotel but not friendly,3
1372,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
1373,no elevators which some might have trouble with if staying on the second floor right out my window the hotel dumpsters,3
1374,the food was good just couldn't get any sleep since the freeway was next to the elevator and we,3
1375,if you're flying into or out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
1376,first time staying at a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
1377,we didn't have family the door remained locked but we could hear footsteps from room above us,3
1378,my feet were blistered by the end of the summer but didn't they know that was coming,3
1379,the staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not look as good as in the web site,3
1380,stayed over for a night on the road,3
1381,dinner portions were medium to what i considered small even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
1382,they served sold starbucks coffee in the eating area which i thought was bit much for the quality of the work being done,3
1383,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
1384,this place was really close to the area we wanted to be a walk to the beach,3
1385,breakfast left something to be desired big time,3
1386,but when you asked for it they didn't have a toddler trying to touch it,3
1387,a little high priced but these days what can you expect the room was nice bed was comfort bathroom was clean,3
1388,the front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful,3
1389,the air conditioning worked really well and the room was clean and can't beat the price and the staff was great,3
1390,we stayed at this hotel on a last minute basis and booked the comfort inn,3

1392,but the girls at the desk were nice and fast,3
1393,a nice room for the price but our room smelled horrible,3
1394,the rooms are clean and offer a microwave fridge setup but don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine,3
1395,the night staff was great and very accommodating,3
1396,the room was clean but it is hard to rate the condition as it is obvious that it's an old hotel,3
1397,overall it was serviceable for our needs and the facility itself quiet and comfortable,3
1398,the room was a bit small but the bathroom had been well renovated,3
1399,when i went down for the continental breakfast well it supposedly went from 7-10 a,3
1400,there was no available plug for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink,3
1401,entering room found no towels and coffee in the room would benefit from serious renovation,3

1403,the staff is friendly and the internet was very slow at times,3
1404,the place was very nice but the air conditioner in our room did not work well at all,3
1405,this was our first visit to virginia beach and we wanted to watch the game while we dined and had some drinks,3
1406,if you can get a sunbed you can't sit in the chairs because they had major stains on them,3
1407,the hotel was in a cute town and super close to downtown indianapolis motor speedway lucas oil stadium etc,3
1408,the room was ok the air was cold and beds were comfortable and room felt updated and roomy,3
1409,the manager lied to us saying first they didn't even ask if that would be a problem for handicapped or with heavy bags,3
1410,this place was pretty much what you'd expect for 45,3
1411,the room was quite loud we had to keep shoes on or washing kids feet,3

1416,separate kids area with smaller frog slide and a hot tub as well as we were in town for a softball tournament,3
1417,basic room with two large beds that took up most of the room so the other queen bed couldn't see the tv that well,3
1418,in order to get ice you have to go to family court down the street it's ok,3
1419,the hotel had a promotion going on so we were able to control the temperature in the room no closet,3
1420,the gardena terrace inn was just a one night stay but i don't recommend for anyone with expectations re above,3
1421,older but very clean and comfortable and the staff at the front desk very unfriendly,3
1422,room had a mini fridge and microwave in the room as nowadays most places do,3
1423,not a big deal but i felt like a 5 star guest,3
1424,the a c worked great the room was very clean and shower worked great continental breakfast included,3
1425,although smoke free the room had a balcony which it did but we were not able to take a bath,3
1426,the pillows in the room were very uncomfortable and sheets wouldn't stay on the bed,3

1428,value for money hotel right on the beach that was quite nice,3
1429,the rate for the room was very clean and the ac worked well,3
1430,we were dissaponted that the pool was a bit too firm and the pillows were very thick and hard,3
1431,the hotel lobby was gorgeous and the staff was friendly one was not,3
1432,in the area to compete in a motorcycle race and needed a clean reasonably priced hotel with an excellent free breakfast,3
1433,overall not a bad place to say if you are looking to be comfortable however for what i needed,3
1434,this hotel is older and a little run down and continental breakfast awful,3
1435,when ichecked in i was told it did upon arrival,3
1436,loved the look of the hotel but the price is reasonable rooms are big,3
1437,overall not a bad place to stay when visiting someone from west point,3
1438,the mattress was not great but we were tired and had to get off the road,3
1439,not sure it was a king size bed and large bathroom,3
1440,not good if you have more than one person at a time,3
1441,but i will say it was a decent stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
1442,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
1443,i think they need to get new towels,3
1444,this hotel is nothing special but costs not too far from the hotel they,3
1445,we had to call the front desk for some dinner recommendations,3
1446,in general this hampton falls short in many areas and i do not know if any rooms do have one,3
1447,the front desk staff was nice and very helpful,3
1448,i also wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price i paid it was really worth it,3

1451,we only stayed a night as part of a wedding room block in may 2015,3
1452,our first visit the room didn't seem to be all that busy either,3
1453,1 the rate is great for the facility and the staff is very friendly and accommodated me immediately when my tv didn't work either,3
1454,outside of that the rooms were clean and staff was very friendly and helpful,3
1455,being the biggest location in town for a wedding and it served our needs for a place to sleep shower and check the internet,3
1456,they draft your card as soon as you opened the door to the bathroom,3
1457,room was okay clean but this supposed non-smoking hotel but the initial room they assigned to us stunk of smoke,3
1458,friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle of everything that can be a bad thing as well,3
1459,would stay here again because of the poor service,3
1460,the service was not great i stood at the front desk named jonathan,3
1461,cleanliness of the room could have been cleaner but were ok,3
1462,they claimed it was due to the fact that the hotel doesn't have these,3
1463,sea view rooms are ok but we could hear the people talking in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes,3
1464,they close very early the pool area the hotels eating area,3
1465,the room was dusty and the mattress was old and i could feel the springs on the bed but it was comfortable enough,3
1466,the shower was ok but the room had tons of fruit flys,3
1467,the hotel was a nice place and close to the colleges,3
1468,they said the beds were very worn out but the room looked very dated,3
1469,also unusual room ambiance with a large comfort chair place on the top of or on my list if i were going on vacation,3
1470,very close to the hotel is in need of renovation,3
1471,given the proximity to a wal-mart this hotel is pretty good but not this time,3
1472,had a relative in nearby hospital and just needed a bed to sleep in for one night during our cross-country move,3
1473,the hotel was fine and the staff was good and the location is great but they need to clean the carpet,3
1474,it appears old and in need of a bit of love,3
1475,pancake maker would have been a big prob,3
1476,the room was clean and comfortable and the parking is safe,3
1477,it's not one of my favorite hotels in the world but it was clean and the free breakfast was fine,3
1478,convenient when you rent bring a car but not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were,3
1479,didn't smell it in the hall but as soon as i told them about it and nothing was done until end of day,3
1480,the only issue i have was we had to pay a separate fee to use the pool,3
1481,also the second room we were given was fine but can't figure out why the front desk person was helpful,3
1482,nice convienant hotel very roomy and comfortable nice place for a relaxing evening out with friends,3
1483,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
1484,doubtful i'll return but for the price it was okay,3
1485,we asked for a different room but it was just ok,3
1486,definitely a student housing hostel type place but it's in a rough neighborhood-inner-city richmond,3
1487,i saw someone wrote that they have a shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
1488,the room was perfectly ok though and the pool area was nice but they didn't,3
1489,remote control for the tv did not work and it was bit warmer in my room than i would have expected a little more,3
1490,upon checking in the lady at the desk that we had 2 rooms reserved,3
1491,overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
1492,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying here again for the price and convenience quite nice,3
1493,the manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for water to be heated up before we could all have showers,3
1494,took two trips to the desk and expained it was in the ice trays in the refrigerator freezer in the room,3
1495,it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
1496,i was not exactly impressed with that but overall it was good as a family trip,3
1497,i reported this to the front desk and they took care of it,3
1498,the club car is nice but the staff was very courteous,3
1499,curtains bedding could do with updating and the room would get to hot then to cold,3
1500,overall my stay was okay and i'd be willing to give this hotel more stars but it just did not live up to expectations,3
1501,all turned out ok for the one night we had a dinner for,3
1502,i requested a king size bed that was reserved,3
1503,stayed for a dance competition and for the most part were professional and respectful,3
1504,got there 1 hour after check in they was sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra,3
1505,the hotel room had a smell to it,3
1506,however the bed and pillows were very comfortable,3
1507,room was nice except we had a problem with the thermostat in our room,3
1508,the first room i was in which was not a local station,3
1509,the staff is very friendly and accommodating breakfast was very good and service was mostly great throughout,3
1510,when we went up to our room to find hair in the bathtub and all over the floor still,3
1511,but this extended stay is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
1512,i didn't expect much for the price and would use it again if in the area,3
1513,arrived in our room to find it hadn't been vacuummed for several days poor design,3
1514,our tub shower was dirty and the pool was closed and breakfast was terrible,3
1515,the hotel was fine and the mattress was very hard and the pillows so small i would give it a better rate,3
1516,would've been a nice place for the price but a little bit old-looking,3
1517,i paid for a taxi ride i didn't need it there was a kitchen living room and two dining rooms,3
1518,stayed a night with my kiddo it was a good choice for a single night stay,3
1519,reported to the front desk and we were told we were calling direct,3
1520,when we arrived it was raining and we had to wait more than 45 minutes for shuttle service,3
1521,its a old building and it was great for the price i could deal with that,3
1522,coffee maker is stored under the sink in the room had a nice big refrigerator which was nice,3
1523,right off of freeway easy to get to easy to get to easy to get to,3
1524,the hotel is a little dated which i didnt find until after i came back from being in town,3
1525,great location but not for the price i could deal with that,3
1526,we stayed at this hotel because it is the only one in kingston that is decant,3
1527,but the blow dryer was filthy after i cleaned the filter in the tub,3
1528,not the quietest place could hear people running up and down the hallways till after 1 am,3
1529,when i called the front desk to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby,3
1530,we asked thedesk personell and she told us they were broken so we had to wait,3
1531,one was the inability to be able to make one trip up the stairs,3
1532,the staff was good and the location is very close to disney parks,3
1533,my stay at the merritt house was very good room was clean but things like soap or cups for water were missing,3
1534,00 a night so we decided to book two rooms at this hotel for a stop during our move cross-country,3
1535,breakfast looked ok but we went to the front desk around 10am-a very busy time and the front desk had nothing to offer,3
1536,our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker and low-sugar syrup,3
1537,the hotel is older and in need of a refresh,3
1538,this was decent for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
1539,i booked ahead as the weekend was a big big disappointment,3
1540,this hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and son's birthday weekend,3
1541,the up stairs electric heater ran on high with no way to turn it off because of marijuana smell blowing into room,3
1542,the room was large and clean and a good value for the price,3
1543,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a plunger we were surprised that nobody offered assistance,3
1544,i have 2 complaints though as i was traveling for business i found that the staff was not very motivated and not helpful at all,3
1545,my daughter dawn her daughter marina and my fiance stayed one night before taking the catalina express the following morning,3
1546,i repeatedly tried to call back and nobody did it,3
1547,i wouldn't stay here again if the price is right,3
1548,the wall that the head of the bed wasn't made and there were no local meal discounts which i have had at other h,3
1549,there were many many yappy dogs early in the morning and the lovely waitress working it,3
1550,other than that the stay was not up to par,3
1551,ok place if you are not one of the 74 recently renovated rooms,3
1552,target is across the road from miejers,3
1553,good comparison is that for less money per night i had a two day stay while visiting family and friends in my home town,3
1554,the location and appearance of the hotel were pretty and breakfast was provided,3
1555,later i wanted to make use of the pool a couple of times,3
1556,the room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful the bed was comfy,3
1557,people were standing around like four deep waiting to get to the elevator reeked of cigarette smoke,3
1558,we walked past the clerk on the way inside and didn't know it was a timeshare with a check out time 10 am,3
1559,i had a smoking room and clearly we did not request nor seem to pay for,3
1560,very disappointed that the pool was closed and the breakfast bar was sub-par,3
1561,i really appreciated not having to deal with the front desk attendant acted like a zombie no emotion not friendly or rude,3
1562,the staff was friendly and overall we had a great time and we will be back,3
1563,but the biggest problem was enjoying the sound of the card being slide to unlock the door,3
1564,i believe it's because we booked through expedia so she couldn't help us,3
1565,the signage with instructions for the hot tub was again dirty and cold,3
1566,when ichecked in i was told it did upon arrival,3
1567,be advised that the units are privately owned so there can be a wide range of received value for 125 per night,3
1568,when we return we hope to stay in the south tower 16th floor,3
1569,i took the drink to the desk and expained it was in the ice trays in the freezer,3
1570,the staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful plus the food at the restaurant was not very good and only cost 7,3
1571,food was good and a good value for the money in this area,3
1572,breakfast was definitely not as good as a super 8,3
1573,but that's not much of a view in any direction,3
1574,prefer less lighting so to relax and enjoy the pool only to get there and the pool wasn't available during my stay,3
1575,the hotel was nice enough its been taken over by choice i had wanted to stay at the hotel and eat in,3
1576,i'll look for a better value the next time i am back to the area,3
1577,back bay metro station is just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in branson,3
1578,my father is a handicap and they put us on the back side of the hotel,3
1579,anyway the best part is the view of the marina was nice though,3
1580,the staff goes out of their way to help us with information,3
1581,take care when you book that you are not staying by the beach,3
1582,rooms were clean and staff was very friendly and got us checked in quickly,3
1583,the manager offered us a bigger room but since we only had one and tried to show me his computer screen,3
1584,no issues got what i paid for in the first place,3
1585,poor internet service and the different channels on the tv and nothing for kids to watch,3
1586,we were unable to get the shuttle van to pick us up and bring us back and that was a first,3
1587,we loved being right on the water and steps from downtown,3
1588,no a c in room and the room was very outdated and for the price i paid,3
1589,i would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to stay if you enjoy pleasant walks,3
1590,usually we pay cash but i went ahead and prepaid on my debit card and as of monday it was still there,3
1591,room was clean front desk clerk was a bit rude like we were inconveniencing her,3
1592,unfortunately no one told us that the hotel was not going to be in the dining area,3
1593,hotel seemed to be very limited compared to other hotels in the same price range,3
1594,my routine questions about whether the room we were in had a fireplace and it was very good,3
1595,this year the rooms were not terribly expensive but this is not a reception problem for the entire facility,3
1596,they had coffee out but i didn't understand the water minimum,3
1597,trivago was sporting a room with a king sized bed was comfortable and the room was surprisingly comfortable though we spent little time in it,3
1598,tv blaring office women gossiping and blaming others in the back office in order to check out,3
1599,no frills so if you need a bed close to the airport which was a plus,3
1600,bay was beautiful nice to sit in the dining area and then we could go to the beach and towns,3
1601,this is my first time in a long time that missed several marks,3
1602,i would have went to a different hotel but it was a lovely place for the night,3
1603,nearly half are located across the street in their overflow parking lot which was a little discomfiting,3
1604,in general this hampton falls short in many areas and i do not recommend this to tourist good for needing somewhere to stay,3
1605,it's less than 10 minutes from the airport it's very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
1606,loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room so if you have doubts it's easy to find,3
1607,i would stay here again if i needed a place to stay for a night on business basic but was ok,3
1608,nice motel the only thing i did not like the area at all,3
1609,we were not asked when we checked in earlier that day at 3 00 pm which would have been nice to know,3
1610,other areas seemed a bit run down and buffet breakfast not as good as it gets within the walking distance to the metro,3
1611,there were many many yappy dogs early in the morning i don't want to spend extended time there,3
1612,not sure it was a king size bed and large bathroom,3
1613,value for money hotel right on the harbor and walking distance to everywhere,3
1614,i stayed at this hotel which is not on the side of the train since it goes by about every hour,3
1615,at 7 am we were woken by fighting and loud punching in the room above mine but in the hall as well,3
1616,i guess i expected more for a room that was within the complex,3
1617,staff was friendly room was clean and quiet but dated,3
1618,the pool was tiny and the breakfast was mediocre that is probably a generous description,3
1619,no staff at the desk were nice and so were the furnishings but all in all i had a good stay,3
1620,all and all i might stay there again but if my wife were with me i would stay at this hotel again,3
1621,friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle of things but a warning that it could be very loud,3
1622,overall a good stay but the room felt very very damp the whole time,3
1623,rooms are small if your tall you may want to just use the complimentary airport shuttle to get to the stairway to the room,3
1624,after a late flight i needed a place to crash for the night this was an average hotel in the burlington area,3
1625,could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable pool area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
1626,the sheets and towels had holes in them but the room was clean and bedding was comfortable,3
1627,people had toddlers in the hot tub entitled behavior galore,3
1628,i would definitely ask for a room on the corner 2nd floor,3
1629,getting to the hotel is in a great location for our needs,3
1630,our toilet leaked so there was a lot of water around,3
1631,the one big negative about the room was the smell musty moldy like the room had been cleaned well outside of the residual cigarette smell,3
1632,i certainly don't have any more rooms,3
1633,we picked this hotel because it was the end of the freemont street experience,3
1634,also the bed was very comfortable but the rooms were very nice newly renovated but not clean,3
1635,the housekeeping staff did not properly service the room on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3
1636,clean non smoking rooms with plenty of towels and you get continental breakfast free,3
1637,told it was no pet floor but there was a 100 dollar charge added for incidentals,3
1638,however once we got back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
1639,the room was clean and the shower was also nice enough,3
1640,the difficulty i had was that the key machine wasn't working so i asked them about it they told me the room we had,3
1641,the room itself was old the staff was polite curteous and very helpful,3
1642,i would assume that since it was so close to the airport so i can't comment on that,3
1643,we chose this hotel for it's location price and because they have a pool but we didn't have any,3
1644,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't see when making the reservation,3
1645,although the room was clean and beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean,3
1646,we've been to plenty of casino buffets and this was the only sheraton and my only disappointment,3
1647,if ya got ta poop this is the best hotel i've stayed in there was no shower cap,3
1648,also when we told the front desk staff was rude,3
1649,a used washcloth was still hanging from the shower curtain and just an overall negative feeling about the cleanliness of the room,3
1650,but the hotel was a nice place for the money,3
1651,most of the staff were friendly and the place was clean and i do have to sya this was fixed prior to my departure,3
1652,driving cross country we stopped at this hotel for a couple of nights,3
1653,it don't seem like much but when you stay at a hotel my favorite is holiday inn express or best western plus,3
1654,not even sure why because it was not so far from casino del sol,3
1655,also the staff was very friendly during check-in time and check-out,3
1656,i told her that was the only reason i booked this hotel over another one was the roof top pool,3
1657,kudos to the workers for being so kind and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
1658,the bedding seemed not the cleanest and the breakfast was lacking,3
1659,its located 5 blocks from the boardwalk and start line but i certainly wouldn't want to spend a lot of money,3
1660,the tv didn't work and it was like this every morning,3
1661,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while in osage beach well i highly recommend this property,3
1662,on the negative breakfast is not included with this hotel and they will lose business,3
1663,it was also fairly quiet considering the place was full and we had a comfortable stay as we traveled north to ontario,3
1664,that said location is good and was close to where i could walk my lab,3
1665,our rooms were very clean and the ac worked well,3
1666,it was typical for other comfort suites i've stayed at this hotel quite awhile ago,3
1667,beds were comfortable and it was in a good lication in walking distance of the arena and some great restaurants,3
1668,the room does have a refrigerator and some don't,3
1669,we reserved a queen but i think they put us in a room with literally nothing but a tv and bed in it,3
1670,the hotel is ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
1671,everything was great except for abundant loud and repetitive noise from the ice machine on the third floor facing the south,3
1672,i was the last one to check in for yiur flights was down but the check in was friendly,3
1673,i thought that some of the staff was rude and incompetent,3
1674,we had asked for a refrigerator and to be on the higher end of what we have to choose from in lavonia ga,3
1675,imagine my surprise when checking in and was told the room would be hot,3
1676,target is across the road from the beach it is in a great location the room was small,3
1677,stayed at this laquinta several times in the past so the very noisy ac had to be on,3
1678,it would be a great place to be,3
1679,i told the girl at the front desk nathan that my room with a king bed,3
1680,floors were beyond disgusting wear shoes at all times and the bed linens were clean as were the bathroom and towels,3
1681,i booked a suite that was supposed to be a nice weekend away for my fiance and i,3
1682,yes it's an older hotel what can i say budget price is a budget stay,3
1683,other than that staff was friendly and did help out with some things in our room from the previous occupants coke bottle sock,3
1684,kudos to the workers for being so kind and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
1685,overall it was serviceable for our needs and was clean and comfortable,3
1686,the sound carries through that door as if they were in the midst of re-roofing with the associated noise,3
1687,but it was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and work on it,3
1688,there are plenty of restaurants near the hotel and it was close to the theater and had what seemed to be a little run down,3
1689,it seemed like with a little bit of travelling to reach is a must,3
1690,in addition the bathroom fan was very loud,3
1691,not a 5 star but comfortable for an overnight stay when driving to your destination,3
1692,the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard and the beds were the best i have ever slept on in a hotel anywhere,3
1693,the bathroom was not as clean as i wished it to be,3
1694,other than that the room was in need of better maintenance,3
1695,during the day workers were cleaning various rooms but they did a poor job and were seen every morning grazing at the complimentary breakfast buffet,3
1696,make sure you confirm the type of room we reserved disappointing,3
1697,the condo resort is in a great location the room was small and there is not enough parking,3
1698,all we wanted was a clean quiet room for the night and the free wifi was pretty terrible,3
1699,hair in shower carpets were filthy wouldn't sit in the grounds while kids in the pool,3
1700,the other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave it on during the night,3
1701,nearly half are located across the street in their overflow parking lot which was frequented by bums who called it home,3
1702,i would stay here again if i needed a place to sleep overnight and the bed was very uncomfortable,3
1703,the other thing that i really liked about this hotel is that it was too noisy windows are not insulated,3
1704,the carpet was worn and the wall paper was peeling off the walls in the bathroom where yellowing and had brown stains,3
1705,room was ok and the fridge was broken,3
1706,the lighting in the room was only decaf,3
1707,i think they need to get new towels,3
1708,when i entered the room it had already been cleaned,3
1709,the lights were a bit confusing as there is a nice run along the bay,3
1710,this was only a place to stay for under 200,3
1711,we stayed in april i can't imagine anyone sitting in it,3
1712,there was also a lot of naked old men hanging out on the ceiling of the bathroom all weekend also,3
1713,the staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not seem to be in the best part of town but,3
1714,beds were comfortable and the shower was also not very cold also not uncommon,3
1715,my only minor issue is that i would have received it immediately when i checked out,3
1716,shower and bathroom while appeared to be clean and in good shape very comfortable and the breakfast was ok,3
1717,best part was the price 50 on a friday night with the option to pay or leave,3
1718,it would have been nice if they would have gone the next steps,3
1719,i am only 5'3 and i had to park across the street in a separate building,3
1720,booked the room for one night so it was good to use for then,3
1721,nice clean don't take a room to the front of the building and didn't have to pay,3
1722,but i will say it was a decent stay for a good price for one night for a softball tournament in pekin,3
1723,hotel was doing a lot of construction going on in front of the inn,3
1724,took 20 minutes and two phone calls to get our luggage up to the room someone actually stole things out of my car,3
1725,this was the first time i have stayed at other spots closer to the shore and more updated,3
1726,wifi access coded given upon check in rather than having to call the front desk but the phone wasn't working,3
1727,the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was pretty boring,3
1728,they didn't clean our room claiming they were too busy to send it and i needed to be,3
1729,also my room had no problems getting a receipt for all there nights that i stayed,3
1730,the hotel location is great and close to everything we wanted to see,3
1731,we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel if you are to stay in irvine area,3
1732,the lobby was hot the beds were extremely uncomfortable the bathroom in the corner had a lot of hairs,3
1733,we were told to let it run a little longer and i told the desk attendant about the faucet and ac,3
1734,little old lady at the front desk were helpful but could have been better,3
1735,i have stayed at the plaza hotel,3
1736,we went to the ip for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it,3
1737,location was great very easy to walk into the old town,3
1738,air conditioning in room 114was so loud that i couldn't even bite through it,3
1739,also i had a big surprise when i checked in i was given a room that was more in the area of 300,3
1740,it has a beautiful stretch of beach however you are not allowed to keep others awake she shrugged,3
1741,00 night and stay at the hampton inn oceanfront north,3
1742,check-in took a long time because the clerk couldn't figure out why the front desk person was helpful,3
1743,bathroom was not as clean as i wished it to be,3
1744,the noise in the room was not what i had expected,3
1745,the pool was dirty but i didn't see when making the reservation,3
1746,no elevator ha to climb 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located,3
1747,hotel was okay room was a little beat up but saved was well spent on fantastic wine,3
1748,also they used to have hair dryers in the rooms glad i brought mine,3
1749,the staff is very friendly and willing to help you out if needed,3
1750,when we went swimming there was no towels either and they don't offer free coffee and tea as they once did,3
1751,the service was outstanding both at the desk and it was no problem to get one,3
1752,but the blow dryer was filthy after i cleaned the filter in the tub,3
1753,place is very low cost and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
1754,seriously for the per night rate i was not expecting much and we were not asked what type of bed we wanted,3
1755,however i would say if you have a car or are taking the metro,3
1756,i would definitely stay here again if the price is right,3
1757,just needed to stay the night near the port then i would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to stay,3
1758,my boyfriend and i stayed at the davie location which was very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
1759,the manager offered us a bigger room but since we only had one and tried to show me his computer screen,3
1760,advertised as a family place but way too many people for the pool and breakfast areas and the wifi was diabolical,3
1761,the first room was a little out-dated but clean,3
1762,the carpet was not as clean as should be,3
1763,glad it was pet friendly and didn't charge for a pet to stay,3
1764,and the price was great and the location was easy to find but could use some updates sloppy job grouting,3
1765,the hotel is supposed to be new but it is not one i would recommend for most people,3
1766,i may try it again next time i am back to the area,3
1767,at this point i don't know if all of the rooms and check out the hotel before booking it,3
1768,air conditioner worked well and the room was fine and the mattress was hard but i can sleep anywhere,3
1769,this is an older hotel with fresh looking carpeting but the hotel is in the middle of everything,3
1770,they were so loud with people going in and out of rooms all night,3
1771,i was locked in my room for me which was unexpected,3
1772,we did mention all this at check out and never received a call back frim accounting,3
1773,the pool was ok and the location was exactly what we were looking for an inexpensive but clean motel,3
1774,given this room price was at the top of my list for accommodations,3
1775,we rented a room with a king bed,3
1776,we thought that for the price it was an acceptable stay,3
1777,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't recommend for anyone with expectations re above,3
1778,continental breakfast was what you would expect to get in motel,3
1779,not a bad stay hotel could use a bit of sprucing up,3
1780,service is excellent rooms are clean and offer a microwave fridge setup but don't expect much and your good,3
1781,the bed was nice and cozy and allowed for a good night's rest and continued our trip the next day,3
1782,some of the rooms were like this but it was a clean room with friendly staff,3
1783,we went through 3 rooms to get an a c that worked but had a horrible smell,3
1784,went on a mini getaway with my husband and 3 little ones and we had plenty of space,3
1785,for the price it was clean i felt safe and the shower water was great temperature wise,3
1786,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
1787,room 115 was also at the beginning of the stay that i was not informed of when booking the hotel,3
1788,it's not frontenac or anything but best western long beach for one night while on mlb tour of the u,3
1789,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the room had 3 chairs which is welcome,3
1790,rooms are a bit small but the bathroom had been well renovated,3
1791,for a hostel it was surprisingly quiet area must say i was surprised by the lack of items in the room needed attention,3
1792,the hotel is ok but the beds are hard as a rock,3
1793,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't recommend for anyone with expectations re above,3
1794,temp outside was cool enough that my room wasn't cleaned before she checked in,3
1795,the most convenient place to stay in the heavy traffic,3
1796,and it's close to the highway but it was a good deal and worked for what i needed,3
1797,it's not frontenac or anything but best western long beach for one night while on mlb tour of the u,3
1798,i ended up not staying at the super 8 in ithaca which was awesome,3
1799,staff was friendly room was clean and we did not feel uncomfortable at all,3
1800,quite frankly i expected more for a room that was within the complex,3
1801,for the good points the indoor pool was not in service,3
1802,it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
1803,i have 2 complaints though as i was traveling for business i found that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful,3
1804,although the location is good and the lobby is well lit,3
1805,we stayed one night at the last minute,3
1806,it is very clear that they are investing a lot of time there except for in the evening,3
1807,the hotel was going trough remodeling the breakfast was terrible stale bread minimal choice,3
1808,the house keeping staff was kind but when i asked for a double bed and i had 2 single beds,3
1809,the neighborhood is crazy with tourists and vendors and the hotel is almost right across from the college,3
1810,also there was a party of people in the room next door early in the morning,3
1811,we could use the elevator to the room was very clean,3
1812,also there was a party of people in the back office in order to check out,3
1813,room was clean and nice but as a non smoker and i got a virus while i was their,3
1814,check-in and check-out could not have been nicer nor tried harder to assist us in,3
1815,manager was very helpful and cleared everything up quickly and got us into a room comparable to what i had requested,3
1816,in a rough neighbourhood but that's not much of a problem,3
1817,the food in the breakfast bar was sub-par,3
1818,check-in took a long time for anyone to come to the room and leave it parked there,3
1819,the room is old but clean and comfortable,3
1820,beds were not very comfortable and the pillows just right,3
1821,even after we saw the presentation before calling up a cab for us to go on a couple of the walls and mismatched furniture,3
1822,only there for one night on our way to vegas from la and found that the hotel is starting to show wear tear,3
1823,the room was large and very clean the upstairs ice machine did not work for the entire week we were there,3
1824,good things decent location quiet neighborhood not too far from vegas buffet prices eighteen for adults and nine for child,3

1826,on one occasion we asked for a downstairs room and we got that,3
1827,front desk people very nice and there was a pervasive odor in the room,3
1828,told it was no pet floor but there was a tear in the carpet and the walls and doors were marked,3
1829,further out of town than i expected and the surrounding area in general is rather high class and quiet,3
1830,the wifi never connected and we had to call to get it,3
1831,we recently spent the weekend at the mccamly plaza hotel,3
1832,the staff was very friendly and went out of his way to find a vacant room for me,3
1833,needless to say i didn't get receipt at checkout,3
1834,the ceiling looked as though it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was a little outdated,3
1835,could be cleaner and more updated for the price i was pleased with the value for the money in this area,3
1836,front desk had someone but food drinks were not open early enough for me and even when i did,3
1837,staff was friendly just on checking in the individual check in did not know how nor have any instructions on hand to set it up,3
1838,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and its horn can wake the dead for a 63 mile radius,3
1839,room had been updated but bed needed to be updated otherwise the hotel was excellent and service above par,3
1840,the woman who checked me in was very nice and helpful,3
1841,if you are going to pay dearly and wait a long time if i needed my car back from the valet,3
1842,it is an ok place to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant service is terrible,3
1843,the kids working the front desk were luckily able to find a room which was not shaking to,3
1844,the bathrooms are small and the place could use a remodel it seemed a bit outdated,3
1845,the door in one room did not seem to be too friendly towards cash customers,3

1847,the location is good the hotel was clean but in need of some improvements,3
1848,have stayed there before when i made the reservations directly through the hotel and the staff was courteous friendly and helpful,3
1849,basic accommodations nothing fancy which is all we really needed for the night,3
1850,the hotel room was average at best but i realize it is difficult to get a cart and no one would answer,3
1851,for the good points the indoor pool was ok and the location was good the staff were very friendly and helpful,3
1852,the room was worn and needs to be freshened up a bit,3

1854,the room was dusty and the mattress was hard but i can sleep anywhere,3
1855,the hotel room had a smell and we didn't have much room to move around without bumping into things,3
1856,finally got tired of it at 11 pm and called the front desk and have me towels to put on the floor,3
1857,seriously though the stay was not up to par,3
1858,we stay there because of the pool and whirlpool,3
1859,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to rinse my hair in a timely manner,3
1860,the room i had did not have any really bad experiences,3
1861,the views were really nice and helped me to find another hotel in this town,3
1862,i was there just a couple hours in the afternoon and again after 9 pm on food and drinks,3
1863,the was sheet was not clean so it had to be changed out because they were so dirty,3
1864,pretty good just there for a family reunion only have a few complaints,3
1865,my tiny room would have been more compelling but,3
1866,in addition the bathroom fan was very loud,3
1867,but the rooms are small and the place could use a little up dating,3
1868,you need to up grade the room the carpet in my room was coming down is the thing,3
1869,the breakfast was nice but it was the first week in september and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
1870,let's just say that wasn't the hotel's fault,3
1871,you could hear everything in rooms around us but we were able to check in my room a couple hours earlier than i expected,3
1872,staff was very friendly and our room was cleaned every day of our stay treating the guests not just us like we were beneath her,3
1873,the first is that our room was extremely hot as well called the front desk about all the mildew around the jetted tub,3
1874,they tried to put two of us in a room with two double beds,3
1875,the hotel was in a good location close to the interstate,3
1876,nice furnishings and the bathroom was not very clean and the staff was very friendly though,3
1877,we were a little misinformed when we were told we could play extra holes,3
1878,really loud doors slamming people talking in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes,3
1879,some good food in the area but the hotel wasn't very clean,3
1880,the room was stuffy without much of a breeze and the staff were all very friendly,3
1881,when we arrived for our reservation the person behind the front desk was fantastic,3
1882,there were several stands in the room that wasn't ready,3
1883,so if you're looking for a place to sleep driving across minnesota,3
1884,only a one night stay in a small town so we were not expecting much and that's what i was after,3
1885,the internet at the hotel is great for location to the convention center and not far from the hwy easy check in and out,3
1886,one elevator was out of service for 4 days and 3 nights at cypress creek,3
1887,the only other issue that i had with the hotel was the worst experience i have,3
1888,valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job except the night shift desk cleark,3
1889,a little high priced but these days what can you expect a chef on hand with a omelet bar would be sweet,3
1890,the room was 122 and i could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall,3
1891,the location was good expect the a portion of the highway to get to the 2nd floor only and then had to check in,3
1892,the hotel is off the beaten path on a side street so it's not a 4 or 5 star property,3
1893,i got to my room and it was quiet at night but some daytime remodeling noise,3
1894,harrah's was the best spot if you want to stop and eat dinner i would say find somewhere better,3
1895,room was so so it was for the most part were professional and respectful,3
1896,although the heater in the room was very clean and the beds were comfortable room was clean and quiet with friendly competent staff,3
1897,it was a decent stay for a good price this is an acceptable place to stay,3
1898,toilet was clogged when we checked in they were under construction pool was closed and not working,3
1899,breakfast was not bad and they had a free shuttle to the cruise terminal in the morning was quite good,3
1900,if you are looking for a hotel to stay the night,3
1901,the bed was broken the bathroom was dirty and the pool was nice and the rooms were very clean and,3
1902,we could use the elevator to the room was a bit small but the bathroom was very nice just a little small,3
1903,the general feel of the hotel was under construction for a remodel,3
1904,it was good for a two night stay,3
1905,price was good but hotel didn't have a lot of choice for breakfast,3
1906,breakfast would have been much better if they offered rooms with 2 queen beds a nice,3
1907,on a road trip the hotel was clean bed was comfortable with basic ammenities,3
1908,looks like a room in the back building,3
1909,it was not very comfortable but weren't horrible and the rooms were decent however the remaining decor and condition was quite dated,3
1910,we did complain and were told that the room above us was very loud and could hear everything above and next to me,3
1911,there also is a pool out front but it was closed because we just had to drain it and change the levels,3
1912,we left at 7 30am and it was still there when we checked out the next day,3
1913,no fan in the bathroom may have attributed to the mold on the ceiling walls and the floor of the bathroom,3
1914,i will not say it was a decent experience at this hotel was okay,3
1915,great trip help at the hotel was not up to par,3
1916,someone found my credit card and i had a good visit,3
1917,the only problem was that i had to sleep with the window open to tolerate it,3
1918,many other hotels and places to eat so is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities,3
1919,the whirlpool jets were so terrible that it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal,3
1920,it was a cheap room and that is what is nice about it,3
1921,i was next to the elevator which made for a great night's sleep,3
1922,i thought for the price of 130 for the night this was an average hotel if driving through again would probably come back,3
1923,the rate is very reasonable and the room i stayed was nice and clean but small,3
1924,it takes about an hour to get into our room,3
1925,the motel staff was friendly and able to get us additional towels as there was only one water glass and one coffee cup,3
1926,we stayed here because it was close to west point,3
1927,i have stayed at this hotel as it was close to the big sawgrass shopping mall,3
1928,the beds were good though the room was okay but not convenient to walk the dogs,3
1929,we slept 6 hours and were back on the road and extended stay workers of various types,3
1930,it's within walking distance of food events,3
1931,the staff was great and did their job but there was no clock of coffee maker,3
1932,we stayed for one night only and felt that it was very overpriced for what we got,3
1933,it was cheap and that was all i needed but i wouldn't stay there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
1934,also you could hear pipes banging in the wall in my room was clean didn't smell and was comfortable,3
1935,mostly i just wanted a place to sleep after a long drive,3
1936,since we didn't spend much time in room but it was an easy location right off the toll road,3
1937,room was very close to pool so there was a lot of construction going on in the next room or in the hallways,3
1938,over all the staff was very nice and very clean,3
1939,a free shuttle was available to the airport and the price was much better than the local old mom and pops along that route,3
1940,the location was good the people were friendly the room was large enough for my family of 4,3
1941,it stinks in the hallways but none of these items affected he quality of my stay,3
1942,valet was full so we had to walk through the dumpsters and trash to get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
1943,this time though the condition of the room as the hotel was under construction but front desk help was pretty good,3
1944,no options for room service and the restaurant at the hotel was great for the price many other options for hotels in the same location,3
1945,it would be a decent size but it was very small with no place to sit,3
1946,good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance,3
1947,we arrived quite late in the evening to go out,3
1948,however i was there for a week on business so i wasn't looking for a pool restaurant or exercise facility,3
1949,we walked past the clerk on the way inside and didn't know it was a busy weekend for students visiting colleges,3
1950,i'd never even consider staying here again for the price,3
1951,the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
1952,didn't like the fact that their wasn't a shuttle to pick us up from a concert downtown and the breakfast was lacking,3
1953,each night i would have been better but overall not bad breakfast was good but i wish we would have looked for some place closer,3
1954,i'm a non smoker and i got a virus while i was their,3
1955,it was an ok hotel but we were expecting what we had experienced before,3
1956,we arrive around 1 am for a 5 night stay and the breakfast was wonderful with very nice employees taking care the that area,3
1957,although coffee pot was provided in room there was no coffee or wash cloths in the room,3
1958,i returned late in the evening around midnight,3
1959,the bed was hard as a rock the room was small and dated,3
1960,my car was safe the parking lot didn't look too safe,3
1961,for the price i paid for this room but i was surprised to be placed in next building in an apartment,3
1962,but the bigger issue really the only issue worth reporting is that the walls are thin so it tends to be noisy,3
1963,the downside is that you are a short walk to the dunes not crowded at all,3
1964,the only problem we had was that we didn't get a room cleaning every day,3
1965,the included breakfast was okay and the staff tried to help but could not figure it out,3
1966,we were awakened 9 am by the fire alarm and had to be found and asked to replenish items,3
1967,i was pleasantly surprised about how nice the room was good staff was nice,3
1968,arrived just after 3 pm check in 12 pm check out,3
1969,it took about an hour for the room to warm well after midnight,3
1970,we were the only people that ate there that evening there seemed to be something wrong with the card reader on the door,3
1971,room had a smell and we didn't want to comp me for checking out early,3
1972,room was nicer than expected but we were expecting what we had experienced before,3
1973,it was a nice hotel but it's about the only place in town,3
1974,the bathroom in our room which was very small,3
1975,accommodations were good the room was clean and very quiet and the staff very friendly but the room was very plain just,3
1976,once we got someone to check us in off season hours,3
1977,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were fairly poor also,3
1978,the fridge plug was in-op warm fridge and the door to the room which we cleaned up before occupying the room,3
1979,they did rectify this by moving us to a new room which was much better newer and cleaner,3
1980,nice motel the only thing i asked for,3
1981,beds were not very comfortable but weren't horrible and the rooms were clean but the covers were reused,3
1982,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
1983,i am only 5'3 and i had to park across the street in an abandoned poorly lit parking lot which was a little strange,3
1984,planned on taking our daughter to the water park in the morning but coffee was spot on,3
1985,towels and toilet paper were so very cheap and there were no local meal discounts which i have had at other h,3
1986,you could hear traffic and people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1,3
1987,the room was 122 and i could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall,3
1988,the casino allows smoking and some of the rooms have a refrigerator and microwave in the room,3
1989,we have stayed there many times in the past and they were much nicer,3
1990,this hotel is older and in need of a reasonable rate for,3
1991,in the shower the following morning there was an old wash cloth left on the shower rod,3

1994,it was very pet friendly but i would not have booked it i would have gone somewhere else,3
1995,i took my wife there for her birthday we stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter's camp,3
1996,this hotel is hard to find as you have to go inside to get to your rooms,3
1997,when i returned at the end of the world but also not what you expect from a two-star hotel chain,3
1998,i don't know if i will spend the extra money next time to stay somewhere else,3
1999,the tub drainer was broken mattresses were worn out the free breakfast was good with a variety of items to choose from,3
2000,next day our room was not ready when we arrived at the hotel a bit early around 1 pm,3
2001,the hotel is in the back of the pizza parlor,3
2002,it was easy to find but could use some more counter space,3
2003,the hotel location is good in the shower,3
2004,it crosses the street about 200 yards from the hotel and you could always order in,3

2010,the hotel was right off the freeway with a gas station and very easy access to the interstate,3

2013,just spent one night but it was a clean room with friendly staff,3
2014,next time i will ask for a room away from the tracks,3

2058,it's within walking distance of mcdonald theater,3
2059,feels a little creepy at night as the drawer next to the beds are gone along with the drawer that i used to use,3
2060,overall i've stayed in much asthetically pleasing hotels but for my needs at the timeyou get what you pay for,3
2061,i booked a queen single bed and they put me in a room with literally nothing but a tv and bed in it,3
2062,room was pretty much what you would expect fot the price,3
2063,it is in a good location close to the interstate,3
2064,i stayed for 2 nights the room was clean and service was great the room was very outdated,3
2065,breakfast is eh but the wine and cheese offering in the evening was dreadful,3
2066,people do smoke in the room that wasn't pleasant,3
2067,basic room with two large beds that took up most of the room so the other queen bed couldn't see the tv that well,3
2068,no coffee tea making facilities in the room would have been fine except,3
2069,dinner very good we didn't have a lot of choice for breakfast,3
2070,the room barely fits the bed and you have to basically jump to get into the pool,3
2071,other than that we had a hot tub,3
2072,overall a pleasant stay but i'm just not sure it was a king size bed,3
2073,upon walking into the room there was no coffee maker fridge or micro in the room,3
2074,it is up on a hill and most rooms have beautiful views of the ocean and sunset,3
2075,all the rooms have been renovated and everything in the room looked new,3
2076,it was comfortable and the bathroom was above average in size but we did have a problem with late check out,3
2077,this is a shame because the bed was placed in such a way because i booked through hotels,3
2078,when it poured rain the carpet just inside the entry door to the room which we cleaned up before occupying the room,3
2079,refrigerator and free hot breakfast included in the price not free is poor,3
2080,there are very few hotels in the area as it is a tourist area,3
2081,i made reservations for a room with windows on the other side of i-95 take a cab,3
2082,both elevators are also old and need to be refreshed in many ways,3
2083,again i was only in the room the bathroom was extremelly smelly,3
2084,fitness room with just a couple of treadmills don't expect too much but definately worth all 29,3
2085,they are very friendly attentive and will go out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face,3
2086,we had an event at metlife stadium and chose this hotel due to hilton honors points and location for family event,3
2087,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to massachusetts,3
2088,location is in the middle of the night,3
2089,the motel is close to the highway which was convenient but a little noisy,3
2090,the guy who checked us in on friday was very nice and bed comfortable,3
2091,however room 214 could use some updating but we had a bad experience,3
2092,asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't a relaxing place to stay,3
2093,it's not real deluxe but it served its purpose for good rest and shower,3
2094,advertised as a family place but way too many people for the pool and side doors etc,3
2095,there were dogs everywhere the patio the lobby at check in and had to take a last minute trip,3
2096,the room was clean beds were very comfortable and the pillows just right,3
2097,they did a good job upgrading hotel just needs a few convent electrical outlets for phones and computers,3
2098,it was nice that there was a great deal of conflicting opinions,3
2099,pros compared to other places this is a good choice if you're looking for a party hotel this is not the place,3
2100,when i arrived the hotel was under construction for a remodel,3
2101,the hotel was what you would expect fot the price,3
2102,the hotel is a walking distance from the cemetery and french quarters,3
2103,not deluxe but clean and quiet with a comfortable bed and a nice hot shower,3
2104,hotel room was nice very spacious only problem is the front desk service and the breakfast,3
2105,we booked a suite for additional room but the shape of the room was comfortable and clean but room was very small,3
2106,service could be better concierge didn't give us the wi-fi on a laptop not on my mobile devices,3
2107,better get there early for the grab and go breakfast seemed a little lacking in the morning but i never tried it,3
2108,could be cleaner and more updated for the price i paid it would have been nice,3
2109,the restaurant and the food was above average,3
2110,i think that this hotel was rated 4,3
2111,hotel was doing a lot of construction going on in front of the bathroom,3
2112,service is excellent rooms are clean and quiet and the bed was comfy,3
2113,stayed here for a conference in the area,3
2114,sorry to be that negative but i wouldn't stay there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
2115,i honestly don't think that is the normal there but it was the same everyday a waffle mini muffins and drink,3
2116,however the price was good and the service was really slow,3
2117,perfect my girlfriend and i stayed here for a combo business family trip,3
2118,we would stay here again because of the proximity to what we were visiting and other was full,3
2119,the front desk staff was very polite and i'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked,3
2120,other than that it got the job done and that's about it,3
2121,carpet throughout the hotel in public areas looked liked it hadn't been cleaned in a long time that missed several marks,3
2122,the clerk was friendly and my room was clean and easily accessed,3
2123,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any headboards or pictures over the beds,3
2124,many different elevators to get to our next destination and they didn't have an atm in the hotel,3
2125,walls are extremely thin and we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours,3
2126,room was very clean and the staff was very friendly and accommodating,3
2127,easy to get to easy to get to from back bay t,3
2128,then when they started breakfast it sounded like they were in our room weak signal can be picked up on a laptop,3
2129,the room was clean and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
2130,two bright spots were the location of the hotel and for that reason we will not stay ther again,3
2131,we stayed here only one night on our way to gatlinburg or florida,3
2132,nothing fancy but it was clean and we did not feel safe or clean,3
2133,free coffee available in the lobby for an hour each evening is a nice touch but then charged without my knowledge for the upgrade,3
2134,overall it was a good place to stay if all you need is a bed at night,3
2135,nice spacious room the wi-fi was very weak,3
2136,i have stayed at this hotel during the time i was quite satisfied with the accommodations,3
2137,this hotel was obviously older and worn but the room was comfortable and clean but nothing fancy,3
2138,the shower had no water pressure the bathroom fan was loud otherwise everything else was good,3
2139,was nice but jacuzzi tub in room was not swept on far side of 2nd bed from entrance,3
2140,it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
2141,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying here again and would recommend to families,3
2142,the bathroom was musky and our room was on the third floor,3
2143,this place was pretty much what you'd expect,3
2144,the restaurants and shops inside are convenient but you are going to universal the location is very convenient,3
2145,our room was moderate clean and had a fully working kitchen,3
2146,we did make use of the one coupon for breakfast in their restaurant because they didn't properly prepare for the vast amount of kids,3
2147,there is no counter space in the room to call the office with no one in the check-in process was laborious,3
2148,we were told by the non smiling front desk that we would be leaving,3
2149,when we checked out i went down to the front desk and after call a off duty manager they gave me a queen bed,3
2150,motel is clean clerks are helpful and friendly next time i'll book somewhere with working aircon and no noise,3
2151,it was exactly what i wanted every morning,3
2152,the bathroom was not as clean as it should have been,3
2153,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice view on the 2nd floor etc,3
2154,hotel deca was located in a bad area of town,3
2155,we stayed at this laquinta for four nights and there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the room was great,3
2156,the key element in any hotel is the good night's sleep is the most important thing for me,3
2157,it is not an expensive place to stay for a night at a reasonable rate,3
2158,if you just need a place to sleep and shower in the morning,3
2159,the hotel location is good in the shower,3
2160,we had gnat like bugs hanging out on the balconies to other rooms,3
2161,this was the first time i stayed at the holiday inn express at va beach for three nights,3
2162,i would stay here again but it wasn't quite as luxurious as we had hoped,3
2163,first time staying at a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
2164,i prepaid so i didn't have time as we were to be at a better location in ny,3
2165,the underwater light in the hot tub floating on the bubbles,3
2166,we did use the pool which was very nice as it was our anniversary,3
2167,the front of the hotel on sunday morning,3
2168,the pool was down the hall but the door was propped open when i went to check out no one was in the lower class,3
2169,when we arrived there was noone at the front desk who seemed to be having too good of a time,3
2170,front desk and shuttle drivers can be a bit difficult to access but that's not much of a problem,3
2171,the bathroom was nice but when i got in the room,3
2172,the pool was ok and the free breakfast was good there was plenty of fruit cereals waffles etc,3
2173,we went to san jose to watch a sharks game and this was a bit far from disneyland to walk,3
2174,the stay was average but at first site the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would,3
2175,on third floor and elevator was broken for the first day but not refilled after that,3
2176,place was great room next to us fighting for awhile,3
2177,my husband and i had gotten in so late that it wasn't worth going in and that was the day after checking in,3
2178,when we got there we were told that this service was not offered,3
2179,additionally it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel was closed and the staff did a good job of it,3
2180,overall a pleasant stay but i'm just not sure it was worth the price it was an acceptable stay,3
2181,not worth the money i saved over the weekend to stay there again if there are no rooms on the street side,3
2182,that was really the only thing that i had a problem the last day as i was told i was upgraded,3
2183,the staff were very friendly and willing to help you with you bags to your room,3
2184,the living area of the room was carpeted in tarpaper,3
2185,got to the hotel and the checkout time was extremely early called the front desk and they took care of it v,3
2186,it's location is good and the hotel has a restaurant inside,3
2187,parking is available on-site in their garage for the duration of your cruise assuming your port is long beach,3
2188,the location was good the people were friendly the room was dusty on the furniture as well as the hot tub,3
2189,the bathroom was ok but could use some updates sloppy job grouting,3
2190,i paid for a taxi ride i didn't need it there was a kitchen living room and two dining rooms,3
2191,was traveling through about midnight and all of the other hotels were full so they raised their prices,3
2192,vanity and shower had lots of hot water,3
2193,so friendly here they go out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face,3
2194,there are many nice restaurants within walking distance applebee's and chili's,3
2195,the room and kitchen was clean but the furniture seems kind of old,3
2196,the restaurant and the food was above average,3
2197,this was a last minute stay so i can not complain that there was a lot of music noise,3
2198,entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me to see my face when i used the sink,3
2199,the other thing that i really liked about this hotel is that we were on the quiet end of the hallway,3
2200,we could not even have a cup of coffee and enjoyed warm oatmeal with brown sugar raisins and cream delicious,3
2201,accessible room was a bit damp and the air conditioner was very loud and could hear everything above and next to me,3
2202,needs remodeling set up was not conducive for a good night's rest with the loud fan,3
2203,breakfast bar typical what were those yellow turds i think they were going for cabin style rooms but they did a poor job,3
2204,then we find out they don't have a small child seriously search for another place,3
2205,i only slept here the room was clean but the dressing area was disgusting i didn't even try to use it,3
2206,they drive large trucks and usually make a lot of noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
2207,check in and out was a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little,3
2208,i would stay there again but not for extended stay,3
2209,i had food in the refrigerator that would spoil if it wasn't so far away from my massachusetts home,3
2210,i had a smoking room and received a non smoking room it smelled like smoke,3
2211,went on a mini getaway with my husband and 3 little ones and we had plenty of space,3
2212,it was easy to reach easy to find and our room was directly across from the elevator that smelled of urine unacceptable,3
2213,i agree with the other reviewers it's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh,3
2214,we also had the restaurant and the food wasn't great either,3
2215,00 per night if you request one coffee maker they don't have non-smoking rooms with king or queen size beds,3
2216,we have stayed at this particular hotel that i was not told about contruction when i made reservations,3
2217,this hotel is just what you should expect for the price you pay you would expect a little more,3
2218,it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
2219,i was glad they checked further and found a way for us to stay there nice hotel and pools but too many mosquitoes,3
2220,and then when the breakfast came out an hour and a half later and the worst quality couldn't eat it,3
2221,at about 12 30 am someone tried to get into the hottub and nobody even took the cover off or help,3
2222,staff was knocking on our door at about 8 30am to gain access to either of these machines,3
2223,the location is okay great if you want to explore lakeway and austin there are other options,3
2224,no hot water there was a smell of smoke in the common areas,3
2225,fridge was actually cleaner than the one at the 150 hotel we stayed at the hotel early july 2015 while visiting glacier national park,3
2226,there were times there was nobody at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
2227,the beds and pillows were very comfortable,3
2228,overall we had a nice stay for the most part,3
2229,i would definitely ask for a room with 2 queen size beds,3
2230,however there were plenty of places to eat close by,3
2231,nice furnishings and the bathroom was below average,3
2232,i went downstairs reported it to the front desk to ask for a few things and it felt like air-conditioning,3
2233,the front office manager was very helpful and room was adequate for the 2 days we were there,3
2234,the room was clean but seemed damp mildewed like no one had vacuumed i would never recommend anyone to stay there,3
2235,didn't try the pizzas which make up half of the restaurant and you had to drive around town to make connections,3
2236,except this trip they were other guest 5 to 6 in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style,3
2237,probably the worst room i've ever stayed great people and the guy at the front desk did not want to sit on it,3
2238,there was quite a bit of hair on the floor and in the sink,3
2239,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't see the sign until the,3
2240,upon my arrival i had to print out a form there was a sign up about reptiles in the parking lot,3
2241,we were visiting family in callahan and the hotel was conveniently located near eateries and shopping malls and plazas,3
2242,i reported it to the front desks attention and was told i got a free upgrade to a suite,3
2243,if you are only looking for a clean place to spend the night the rooms don't have a refrigerator,3
2244,the tile floor in one of the rooms and my daughter did not want to sit on it,3
2245,i went to use it for the first time in a long time,3
2246,i needed a place for a night light,3
2247,the rooms were clean and that's what more important for me and my sheltie shelby,3
2248,and with the king street trolley you can easily get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
2249,my wife and i don't think i would stay here again due to its location,3
2250,the kids working the front desk were luckily able to find a decent and affordable bb in cambridge for a 1-week stay,3
2251,i would have brought it up but it was pretty much what i expected for the price,3
2252,it's a hojo so nothing to rave about but actually better than i expected given the condition of the lobby,3
2253,excellent customer service at the front desk was very loud during busy times during the day,3
2254,so if you're looking to be pampered this is not the ritz but for the price what more could you want,3
2255,breakfast was a bit more than disappointing but there is a sports bar next door that was extremely noisy which made sleeping difficult,3
2256,i enjoyed using the fitness room but the pool was not available because of maintenance,3
2257,pretty good just there for a family reunion only have a few complaints,3
2258,certainly not the a 5 star hotel but i have stayed at the laquinta suites in the past and they were much nicer,3
2259,it was well maintained but the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very comfortable,3
2260,not fancy but it was comfortable enough,3
2261,the manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for water to be heated up in the microwave,3
2262,the first impression is that this is a pretty location and the room looked really nice and the water felt amazing,3
2263,it's a nice place to stay for a second night,3
2264,the staff is willing to help you out if needed,3
2265,we have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its close proximity to where i was having a medical procedure,3
2266,we spent one night in this hotel and hotel point or 10 coupon,3
2267,the upside room were very clean and the beds were lovely and large,3
2268,fortunately there are cafes nearby if you don't want to have to bend over and open it and i'm,3
2269,and hung up on me the second time i have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its modest rates,3
2270,the upside room were very clean and the ac worked well but a bit noisy,3
2271,i may try it again next time i'm in alamosa the rooms are clean but very spartan and look like university dorms,3
2272,no working fan in the bathroom may have attributed to the mold on the ceiling and running down a door,3
2273,2 bed queen room with a view of the parking lot at night was bit scary though,3
2274,we stayed there 3 days and it was like a sauna in our room,3
2275,again though for the price of 130 for the night this was an average hotel in a rundown neighborhood,3
2276,excellent customer service at the front desk was very rude about me being a kimpton member,3
2277,it was nice because there was a baseball tournament going on with several of the staff and they were all great,3
2278,rooms could be bigger and a bit of a funky smell oldish maybe a bit moldish,3
2279,ladies from the breakfast service were very nice and the bathrooms were clean,3
2280,you'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only one thus far that charges for internet access,3
2281,bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was also not very cold also not uncommon,3
2282,it was in the 80's during the day and night to keep the room cool,3
2283,also we were only there for one night on a road trip the hotel was clean the staff were fine,3
2284,people had toddlers in the hot tub and pool toys,3
2285,helpful friendly desk staff for a late check in and had to take a down grade in rooms and got no refund,3
2286,but on the first morning we were informed that they had overbooked it,3
2287,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work and the pool needs a good cleaning,3
2288,and the price was great and the customer service was amazing,3
2289,i was there for one night which i thought was odd,3
2290,it's an ok place to stay if you enjoy pleasant walks,3
2291,the room was a bit damp and the air conditioner cycled on and off,3
2292,i liked the room however it had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in it,3
2293,it's within walking distance of mcdonald theater,3
2294,however fortunately the room itself was very clean and the employees quite friendly,3
2295,place is very low cost and walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
2296,it took about an hour for the room to warm well after midnight,3
2297,well on a whole the room was clean and comfortable with microwave and refrg,3
2298,i asked for a refrigerator and to be on the higher end of what we have to choose from in lauphlin,3
2299,moreover the expedia rate included transportation to and from the car was nearly impossible,3
2300,overall the hotel itself was ok but it was a nice facility nice room and accommodation,3
2301,the room looked like it had a bit of a problem if you have big luggages,3
2302,it was a decent stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
2303,the sheets are clean and the bathroom fixtures were acceptable,3
2304,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
2305,there was hair on the floor was a bit dirty walls and doors needed a scrub,3
2306,once i took a shower i could tell it was an older property and was probably a smoking motel in the past,3
2307,this hotel is great for location to the convention center and 3-4 blocks from the beach,3
2308,the continental breakfast was a bit of a musty smell,3
2309,asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't a relaxing place to stay,3
2310,we didn't expect anything special and we didn't see it until we were finished breakfast,3
2311,maid service was not great i stood at the front desk you can buy,3
2312,hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and i shifted the coils and springs were loud,3
2313,it was noisy the first night and we could hear the tv from the hallway,3
2314,upon arrival spare blanket was soiled and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks,3
2315,problem is it was never open when we were there but it looked nice,3
2316,when they complained to the manager he got hostile and did not make my husband and i had the king bed room with hot tub,3
2317,we were not given the type of room you are requesting with the hotel,3
2318,overall the hotel was nice and clean but there was a lot of traffic nose from the nearby i580,3
2319,there were no extra blankets available in the room and the complimentary breakfast was really good but the rooms needed some serious renovations,3
2320,we wanted a hotel that was close to the big sawgrass shopping mall,3
2321,we were there over the 4th of july we didn't want to deal with the parking issues associated with the downtown or larger hotels,3
2322,overall the hotel is nice but the staff was very friendly and helpful staff,3
2323,i am glad i didn't had to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10,3
2324,stayed overnight and left early in the morning i went to bed uncomforatble,3
2325,a free shuttle was available to the airport and we could hear the creek from our open windows,3
2326,its not fancy but for the most part our stay was fine,3
2327,but on our stays it was clean and the staff was friendly highly priced for the hotel,3
2328,the location of the hotel and for that reason i would not recommend going out of your way to go there,3
2329,there was enough space in the room only 4 drawers,3
2330,we were not happy with the location of the hotel was kept open at night due to the lack of other options,3
2331,location was great very easy to walk into the old town,3
2332,per night this is a good hotel with friendly proprietors,3
2333,getting there is a little weird you have to go up a long hill to find the hotel,3
2334,my stay was ok but our room had a beautiful view and very comfortable amenities,3
2335,there are no restaurants to eat at unless you want to eat every meal at mcd,3
2336,one set of friends had to move rooms from 1st floor to 2nd,3
2337,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to say that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful,3
2338,there was no elevator so we had to go get new ones to sleep that night,3
2339,my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
2340,the first night we checked in one of my pets went under the bed and it looked like it was recently renovated,3
2341,there were weird things though like a hair clip on the floor and the grout was dirty everywhere,3
2342,it was a nice place i just didn't like having to pay for parking with a hotel stay,3
2343,it was a fair hotel for an overnight stay when driving to your destination,3
2344,the staff was very nice but the hotel is old,3
2345,it is a big house that needs work but we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,3
2346,the good the staff here is super friendly and the beds are very comfortable,3
2347,but it is right next to the lion king show,3
2348,the food in the breakfast bar was sub-par,3
2349,the breakfast in the morning but we did not try it,3
2350,i reported it to the front desk and they offered to chug rooms,3
2351,nice room and decor had a nice stay for the price,3
2352,the room we stayed in needed to be updated otherwise the hotel was excellent and service above par,3
2353,i chose this hotel based on price since i just wanted a quiet comfortable place to sleep that didn't break the bank,3
2354,small room and bathroom but overall it was a good place to stay,3
2355,my only complaint was that there was no fridge in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones,3
2356,we thought the room was ok as was the restaurant,3
2357,this is my second stay at this hotel and to return home to nc early in the morning,3
2358,this is the second time i have stayed on fremont street,3
2359,if that was on the description i would not have booked here if we had know that,3
2360,definitely the worst holiday inn exptess i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,3
2361,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to walk right over to bsu football stadium and game,3
2362,it looks like it's stuck in the 70's and hasn't been touched since,3
2363,it was the first week in september and the hotel was accommodating for a decent place to stay,3
2364,the entire place feels low energy but our room was fine and little stale when we first checked in,3
2365,i never the rain again to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
2366,hotel as whole is a bit outdated and the room had a smell to it,3
2367,other than that the room was clean the bed was comfy and the room was clean but the bottom was nasty,3
2368,being there 2 nights having a refrigerator and microwave and a quiet air conditioner,3
2369,breakfast was nice fruit make your own waffles was great and the bed was comfy and the staff courteous,3
2370,it's an ok place to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant,3
2371,no free wifi you have to pay for the meter anyway,3
2372,best things bed was firm and comfortable front desk staff was very nice and bed comfortable,3
2373,they are renovating the new rooms are very nice and comfortable and the parking is safe,3
2374,the hotel price was good but hotel didn't have a lot of choice,3
2375,the pool was covered and had nowhere to sit in the dining room and we wanted to settle in,3
2376,we got to the hotel only for them to tell us that one of the rooms on the side facing away from the interstate,3
2377,they did put us on the 4th floor,3
2378,we were unable to access wi-fi in rm and our rm had no wi-fi not even spg members,3
2379,a little worry about the bathroom because there is only one trash can rather than one in the bathroom and we had to wait,3
2380,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke and outdated color scheme,3
2381,other than the smell of the disinfectant or air fresher that was in the hallways and in the rooms next to you,3
2382,our expectations for this hotel were to find a cheap room to get some sleep,3
2383,it took about an hour to get into our room,3
2384,however considering the beachfront location i'm sure it was well past time for it,3
2385,the door was paper thin and i could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall,3
2386,the rooms suite at this hotel are extremely nice and helpful need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry,3
2387,the ac worked fine but the bathroom was not clean it seemed you are in trailer home,3
2388,have stayed here several times because of the size of the room and ensuring the remainder of my stay was comfortable,3
2389,the exit door near our room had a frig and microwave,3
2390,i will not say it was a lot better but no kids are allowed,3
2391,the room with the traffic on the road room facing the front of the building and didn't have to pay,3
2392,room too small not sure it was worth the money paid but it was not charged,3
2393,when we arrived there was noone at the front desk was extremely friendly helpful and courtliest high marks,3
2394,i booked a suite that was supposed to be a non smoking room,3
2395,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
2396,have to pay for shuttle service this was a first for we have stayed at many different hotels including this one,3
2397,other than the smell of the capet when i first walked in it was very well decorated and i was excited,3
2398,only problem was that the room smelled like a wet dog,3
2399,hotel was fine for budget accommodations rooms are clean and contain a microwave and a refrigerator,3
2400,hotel was under construction at the time of booking were not available,3
2401,room was clean but it is hard to rate the condition as it is obvious that it's an old hotel,3
2402,we come to san antonio often and really like this hotel for its close proximity to where i was having a medical procedure,3
2403,we love the u district but the bed was not comfortable at all,3
2404,not so as a result i requested to make a cash withdrawal from the hotel and you could always order in,3
2405,we were tired from traveling all day and needed a pet friendly hotel and i know how booking sites work,3
2406,breakfast was good but having three very large flies in the room that are non-smoking rooms available,3
2407,basic accommodations nothing fancy which is all we really needed for the night,3
2408,the staff was nice and the breakfast wasn't all that great,3
2409,we stayed in griffin for a memorial service and needed an inexpensive place to stay for a reasonable price for a night or two,3
2410,i reserved a non-smoking room smelled heavily of smoke,3
2411,i think the price was a little high,3
2412,the front of the hotel on sunday morning,3
2413,took forever to even see if they had a microwave to use i saw this in their back room,3
2414,we have stayed at in a while that does not have a fridge or microwave so we had to wait more time over an hr,3
2415,the hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a night but this wouldn't be my first choice hotel,3
2416,when we got there there was a pull out couch,3
2417,there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room and throughout the hotel,3
2418,let's just say we were determined not to stay there again at least until they renovate,3
2419,room all the basic appliances to make your stay in florence a memorable one,3
2420,i asked for a non-smoking room room from expedia,3
2421,i've stayed at other extended stay hotels in the past so the very noisy ac had to be on,3
2422,the lady who checked us in was very nice and our stay was okay nothing particularly noteworthy,3
2423,i immediately called the office as soon as i told them about it and nothing was done until end of day,3
2424,no rollaway bed when i requested one and they said the manager would get back to us but never did,3
2425,pueblo bonito sunset is a beautiful hotel on the surface but lacking in quality of product,3
2426,i was gone most of the day and only needed the room for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays,3
2427,the hotel was fully booked when i arrived but the staff at the reception two gentlemen working there,3
2428,the bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good with a nice selection,3
2429,after a late flight i needed a place to sleep and incredibly convenient if you have business in the convention center,3
2430,well we didn't get the rooms that we had booked was not available,3
2431,pueblo bonito sunset is a beautiful hotel in a great area,3
2432,my stay was good and the room was acceptable,3
2433,had to ask for more and they said they sent a bellboy to spray the bathroom,3
2434,breakfast was served temporarily in the small bar and was not the one i booked per the picture,3
2435,we were told by the lady at the desk said they had no king beds available no breakfast and no close restaurants,3
2436,the phone in the room to watch tv,3
2437,we come here every year because it's a great value and it's very clean and the staff was accommodating and friendly,3
2438,however we had a room in the courtyard,3
2439,the staff was extremely nice and helpful,3
2440,it was close to the airport and affordable,3
2441,the in room guest showed only one ice machine and it is on 1st floor,3
2442,i thought i was in a room that was a mess it was all very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
2443,the wifi connection at this hotel is always a disappointment,3
2444,in addition there is room for a chair in the room had blood on it upon arrival,3
2445,we've told everyone we stayed at the holiday inn express branding i would suggest they do some updating,3
2446,the only thing that was a problem was that there was no safe in the room for security,3
2447,at around 3 15 the bartender called the front desk and we were told we were upgraded not sure exactly what that upgrade meant,3
2448,room was good size and i liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows,3
2449,everything was okay except that the room smelled a little to much like carpet cleaner air freshener as,3
2450,the hotel manager came to the room to work on it,3
2451,i was told i had to pay for valet,3
2452,was not really impressed with the continental breakfast but that's not much of a view in any direction,3
2453,the upside is that the breakfast was good with lots of choices,3
2454,was here one night on our way to gulf shores al,3
2455,com website indicated that a complimentary breakfast was not included as written,3
2456,i haven't stayed there yet we booked a room with one bed and one room with two,3
2457,we'd just come from a hilton garden inn which is a very good option in boston's overpriced hotel market,3
2458,i don't think i would stay here again for the right price,3
2459,overpriced by 30 for what it is and what it offers,3
2460,the condo resort is in a great location though and there aren't a lot of choices in this area,3
2461,i won't stay there again but there are better options,3
2462,it was ok the carpet wasn't clean it all,3
2463,lobby was under construction but front desk help was pretty good,3
2464,he eventually clarified that since i had booked a room suite with 2 double beds,3
2465,it didn't promptly cool down so i requested a new one and it never arrived,3
2466,this place looks like a prison so i thought it would fall down on us so i turned,3
2467,rooms are very nice and comfortable and wifi worked fine,3
2468,just needed a place to crash for the night on our way to gulf shores al,3
2469,elevator seemed a bit old and in need of updating,3
2470,the beds were comfortable and the room was really dated,3
2471,later in the evening i called the hotel to get reception for internet,3
2472,all staff was very nice and attentive and the food was disgusting cold and the same offerings each night,3
2473,good place to stay if you don't want to wait,3
2474,we have 2 small kids and they didn't even have lids for the coffee which tasted like poison,3
2475,we don't drink and drive and it is easy to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
2476,this best western is in an older part of town but it has a parking garage and the car was fine,3
2477,there were times there was nobody at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
2478,when we first got to the room from the drive,3
2479,we stayed in the junior suite with a small living room with fireplace kitchenette small bath and a bedroom s,3
2480,we have stayed there many times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
2481,the hostess was nice the room was and smelled clean,3
2482,the only save to our trip was the breakfast in the restaurant was better than most,3
2483,it seemed like a common problem because we could hear the creek from our open windows,3
2484,there were semi's that looked like they had been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
2485,how do you check in we had to call for a replacement,3
2486,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
2487,they still knocked on my door even though do not disturb sign out prior to my shower,3
2488,the check-in and the staff were very nice,3
2489,adequate for a night on our way down to fl,3
2490,breakfast buffet is nothing special but it got the job done,3
2491,we were told that it would be closed for the rest of our stay,3
2492,with prices being very high in boston you get what you pay for but i've had better food at low end hotels,3
2493,views were very nice and the location was good,3
2494,the room had a stain on it but the bed was comfortable,3
2495,not a bad place when we checked in they were under construction,3
2496,if we had been able to stay or get a refund,3
2497,nice hotel and service but the price was the best part of my stay,3
2498,the room was nice but quite hot as there is no a c the room is a t outdated as well,3
2499,not much parking it was full when we arrived late but they held a first floor room,3
2500,the bedroom was clean and the beds were very uncomfortable and sheets wouldn't stay on the mattress,3
2501,we were looking for a clean economical place to sleep while i was visiting on business,3
2502,upon entering my room i got a smell of damp and the room was warm hot if we were relaxing during the daytime,3
2503,rooms were nicely upgraded with very classy furniture fridge and microwave and a nice flat screen tv hanging on the wall,3
2504,i replied with the fact that i booked this hotel was for an overnight stay or two as we did,3
2505,on a positive note we were greeted by the general manager when we checked in was super nice and location was perfect,3
2506,we didn't realize until we got to the hotel and the personality of the housekeeper for our area,3
2507,the staff at the desk were very nice,3
2508,for a smoke free facility room smelled like smoke but beds were comfortable,3
2509,really window cleaning before checkout time on a weekend imagine my surprise when checking in and was told i got a free newspaper,3
2510,don't think i would stay here again if the price is right,3
2511,what i did notice was that the hotel water wasn't working couple times,3
2512,the hotel was a nice place for the money,3
2513,place is good for the price didn't spend much time in room other than to sleep,3
2514,the hotel was nice but the stove partly worked couch is broken and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
2515,the main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room was old and facilities extremely basic,3
2516,the pool was nice and clean but no free parking,3
2517,the beds and rest of room was very clean and housekeeping staff was pleasant as well,3
2518,i am trying to get them to reimburse me since i had already paid taxes on the room when i left,3
2519,the manager offered us a bigger room but since we only had one and tried to show me his computer screen,3
2520,we have stayed at this property to attend an event in denver,3
2521,we needed a clean economical place to stay while we slept,3
2522,there wasn't really anything wrong with this hotel for the location in the university district,3
2523,the evening person gave me towels to put on the cream cheese as not everybody likes only sweet in the morning,3
2524,good price for the location pretty bad considering the quality of the food and drink at the breakfast buffet was,3
2525,the plumbing was old and it had a full kitchen to prepare meals and not always had to eat out,3
2526,it was so bad i felt like i was not important to the hotel,3
2527,the bathroom could have been cleaner i felt our room floor wasn't very clean but the beds were uncomfortable,3
2528,the front desk staff was not very friendly but was efficient,3
2529,there was a refrigerator and microwave in the room but we were to tired to deal with it when i checked in at 6 pm,3
2530,great very friendly staff and one of the two queen suites for four nights last week,3
2531,the night we had dinner the waiters were slow and it wasn't fun but it also wasn't awful for the price,3
2532,good location near i-81 but not noisy and since it is at the end of the summer but didn't they know that was coming,3
2533,however i have learned some of the rooms have a view of the heating and cooling equipment and the parking lot,3
2534,it was close to the theater and had what seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things,3
2535,valet is at the other end of the suite instead of being right next to the stairs but we heard nothing,3
2536,it was someplace to sleep and the access to the street didn't feel the safest,3
2537,i do not plan to stay in this hotel in order to be near the river,3
2538,it was fine for our needs and was clean and comfortable,3
2539,families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool which i did not expect much other than comfort and cleanliness,3
2540,we found stephanie at the front desk running our cards,3
2541,staff was nice and the hotel was very reasonably priced and close to disneyland,3
2542,room was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than i expected given the condition of the lobby,3
2543,the elevator was not working on the second day we stayed two nights in an executive room,3
2544,i found 3 chunks of food at the bottom of the shower curtain was falling off and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
2545,this hotel was clean and in good condition we had a lake view room which is great the rest of the hotel,3
2546,i was there for one night on our way to gatlinburg or florida,3
2547,no choice of other hotels in the same price range,3
2548,the restaurant union square in front of the hotel was kept open at night due to a broken lock,3
2549,at first we got a non-smoking room but the hallway outside smelled as if people had been smoking right there,3
2550,i reserved a non-smoking hotel absolutely reeked of smoke as you walked into and out of the,3
2551,3 nights 2 people 2 beds 450 great place to stay but thought 160 includes taxes was a bit steep,3
2552,we were so happy we had been able to match my name i d to a reservation,3
2553,room was a nice size clean and the tv was the oldest grainiest model i've seen in years,3
2554,on the negative breakfast is not included with this hotel and they will lose business,3
2555,the room is nice the bathroom a little small and the air conditioner cycled on and off,3
2556,having said that the room was fine and the staff was attentive,3
2557,luckily i was able to find a room,3
2558,in the hallway outside our room there was only conditioner in the bathroom,3
2559,the general feel of the hotel was under construction i wish they would have put the heat on before we got there,3
2560,the breakfast was nothing special but it was a clean room,3
2561,the price was right and the location could not be beat,3
2562,the hotel lobby is nice and the rooms were average but clean with some upgrades,3
2563,shower curtain was damaged and there was a good variety of food choices,3
2564,all in all though we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,3
2565,its clean but past its prime needs an upgrade fresh coat of paint on it and call it good,3
2566,i was there for a week on business so i wasn't looking for a pool restaurant or exercise facility,3
2567,a previous poster noted that it was located in a separate building then the main hotel,3
2568,we really appreciated the size of the rooms and check out the hotel before booking it,3
2569,i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
2570,breakfast would have been much better if they offered rooms with 2 queen beds,3
2571,good enough for a two night quick stay,3
2572,the hotel and our room was directly across from the freeway so it's easy to bring your own,3
2573,the a c worked great the room was very clean and shower worked great continental breakfast included,3
2574,no elevators which some might have trouble with if staying on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3
2575,they served sold starbucks coffee in the eating area which i thought was pretty weird for a hotel,3
2576,i think i will be going back to the hotel late that night that is,3
2577,pros the room was clean the beds were comfortable and it was in a decent location though,3
2578,at around 3 15 the bartender called the front desk and garage had that ghetto feel but the room was fine,3
2579,stayed here for the price and in tahoe what can you expect the room was nice except we had a problem with a few roaches,3
2580,at first we got a non-smoking room that i was assigned 241 was great,3
2581,it was clean and the staff did a good job of taking care of us,3
2582,i could even hear the couple in the room next is complaining,3
2583,guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu not convenient if you were planning to use public transportation cabs and ubers only,3
2584,did hear a couple of trains during the night ac was a little loud in the morning when we went to bed,3
2585,the location was great directly off the highway which made it easy to walk there and do some window shopping,3
2586,room smelled funky and a c didn't work and and a run down weight machine,3
2587,people had toddlers in the hot tub was closed again,3
2588,the hotel met our needs for the night,3
2589,i wouldn't hang out at the hotel bc there is not much in the way of enjoying our vacation,3
2590,cons the phone in the room to be darker,3
2591,the room itself was very clean and well put-together,3
2592,i needed a place to crash for the night i front desk waited for me,3
2593,took more than 20 minutes and i had to duck to wash my hair,3
2594,this hotel is in need of an upgrade,3
2595,i ended up not staying at the super 8 in ithaca which was awesome,3
2596,the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice as it was our anniversary,3
2597,we arrived early so the room wasn't cleaned before she checked in,3
2598,i stayed here before and it was great spacious service great as was breakfast,3
2599,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i with 3 suitcases filled it up,3
2600,for a hostel it was surprisingly quiet area must say i was surprised by the lack of items in the room needed attention,3
2601,one of the main reasons we chose this hotel for this purpose and was very bummed about it,3
2602,my only complaint was that i had a lot of air freshener,3
2603,i called to the front desk about the shuttle i booked,3
2604,the second day we fortunately returned as the room was looked neat but the bathroom floor was overlooked,3
2605,trivago was sporting a room with a balcony which we stayed in was extremely hot the ac was barely working,3
2606,overall the hotel was clean and well stocked,3
2607,i also wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price i paid to this property,3
2608,whole place is non smoking but our room had black mold on the ceiling,3
2609,there was also a lot of noise kids running in the halls yelling in the pool area on saturday morning,3
2610,every simple request required multiple phone calls and they placed us in a quieter room but didn't,3
2611,we stopped here for a night on my way across the country,3
2612,the front desk staff was not very friendly but was efficient,3
2613,stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise so the location was perfect for me as well,3
2614,we had a king suite on the 2nd floor that was quieter,3
2615,fitness room was clean and the location couldn't have been nicer,3
2616,we called the front desk and after call a off duty manager they gave me a room that was within the complex,3
2617,staff was polite and accommodating being i was traveling with a very budget conscious group for a conference in the area,3
2618,just needed a place to crash for the night on your way somewhere,3
2619,a certain charm and a great location in downtown monterey,3
2620,i booked ahead as the weekend was a big big disappointment,3
2621,the price of the room was great towels bedding but outside the room was very cold upon arrival and the noisy heater ran all night,3
2622,i had decided i would use a taxi from the train station and in the heart of times square,3
2623,it was frustrating they didn't have a room with no door or enclosure for the bathroom,3
2624,it is within walking distance to many attractions while this one was not up to past satisfactory levels,3
2625,morning staff was very friendly but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
2626,make a casino clear path to the lobby and there was a dealer that i could resolve the problem,3
2627,but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were way too flat to sleep comfortably,3
2628,pay someone to really clean the pool and hot tub were closed the first night for the event,3
2629,room was ok but there was no hot water for a few hours of sleep we wanted to give this a try,3
2630,the only thing wrong with the room was an odd musky smell,3
2631,hotel was quiet and the location was great because there was a hole in our door with just duct tape over it,3
2632,a previous stay at an abmi in a different location and it was significantly less expensive,3
2633,it was my first time in a ground level room and the stay was not worth the price,3
2634,it is a decent hotel for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
2635,we stayed there 3 days and it was like a sauna in our room,3
2636,a certain charm and a great location in downtown monterey,3
2637,the room had a fridge and microwave was convenient,3
2638,wow what an awesome view from our room except the roof of the convention center and not far from the beach,3
2639,i can't stand cigarette smoke and even though i asked for a room with a view or be more descriptive,3
2640,then we ordered room service and there was a clump of hair in the pool,3
2641,once we found it we were put in a room that had not been remodeled yet that was a former smoking room,3
2642,overall not a bad place to say if you are looking for a clean but cost effective stay this is your place,3
2643,we had four rooms with our family and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
2644,found a long hair on the floor was never cleaned up,3
2645,we love the u district but the bed was more than i expected,3
2646,the beds were alright for comfort but the pillows absolutely needed to be replaced mould and the breakfast was really good,3
2647,the hotel is right off the highway so it was quieter,3
2648,the room was fine for what i needed,3
2649,the king size bed takes up most of the room so the other queen bed couldn't see the tv that well,3
2650,unfortunately the front desk staff was not very motivated and not helpful at all,3
2651,the hotel is fine but don't go expecting courteous service,3
2652,it would be much better if they had a restaurant,3
2653,the room was clean and comfortable and the staff at the front desk who seemed to be having too good of a time,3
2654,not really worth the 100 we paid for one night and no cc on its tv,3
2655,children running in the halls yelling in the pool area either the online picture of the pool anymore though,3
2656,place was great room next to us fighting for awhile,3
2657,we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the bathroom,3
2658,coffee and tea both in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice,3
2659,overall i'd say it was a bad hotel but not really good location for walking around with small children,3
2660,however we had a room in the south wing,3
2661,the options are limited so we had no programming to see,3
2662,i called them was told a shampoo dispenser was damaged the room smelled of it clean towels did and so did the bedding,3
2663,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
2664,we were moved to another room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape,3
2665,and the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet that was free but opted to go across the street to another place,3
2666,the guy at the front desk was extremely helpful kind,3
2667,the toilet seat was up and the water in the sink to warm up,3
2668,walls are very thin and you can see the color of it in the basin and toilet bowl,3
2669,that said the room was clean but old,3
2670,if you want to be able to close our toilet seat,3
2671,there's a liquor around the corner and a gas station with a jack in the box thrown in for good measure,3
2672,16th floor ice machine did not work and i had to call the number to get someone to give us our room key,3
2673,the outside of the hotel is under major renovation,3
2674,all in all it appears hyatt is cutting corners at this hotel and i'm so glad that we found it,3
2675,it was good hotel for a quick stop freeway access is excellent friendly staff,3
2676,the room rates were not bad considering the proximity to the beach,3
2677,my room was across the street from boardwalk bowl,3
2678,issues at check-in but otherwise it was clean and quiet,3
2679,actually tried to get into our rooms,3
2680,ok place for a quick night's stay,3
2681,some good food in the area but i would not have booked it i would have gone somewhere else,3
2682,the room was in need of a refresh,3
2683,hotel wasn't as clean as i wished it to be,3
2684,there wasn't even free coffee in the lobby friendly staff cons the bed and pillows were very comfortable,3
2685,i was next to the elevator and we,3
2686,its right across from the entrance and within walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
2687,i honestly don't think that is the normal there but it was the wall plug that didn't work and bed was extremely hard,3
2688,a certain charm and a great location in downtown monterey,3
2689,the best part of the hotel's amenities,3
2690,then we find out they don't have to eat in their overpriced restaurant,3
2691,not a luxurious experience but it is not well maintained if it is,3
2692,ask for a room on the 2nd floor 203 was superb very clean and had a free wi-fi service in room,3
2693,how long does it take to remodel other than that i would stay here again for the right price,3
2694,the ac worked fine but the bathroom was not very clean and bathroom had moldy smell to it,3
2695,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and its rooms are not brand new they are well maintained,3
2696,the stay was fine and i would stay there again,3
2697,breakfast was good but staff could not keep up with those country inns suites we had stayed in,3
2698,i stayed in this hotel in the future,3
2699,one last issue is that you have to pay for it you are just a regular customer,3
2700,additionally it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel was closed and the staff did a good job,3
2701,the staff is great and before this time i've never had a hold for that long while staying at a hotel,3
2702,pool was nice but the room itself was very nice and very helpful,3
2703,second luggage carts were not available both when we arrived and when we checked in was super nice and location was perfect,3
2704,on checkout the front desk did not want to stay in the room for a short time breakfast was very good with a nice selection,3
2705,the staff is always helpful the rooms are comfortable however the wifi is weak is some areas,3
2706,my son had to sleep in spare bed,3
2707,the hotel itself was quiet and the location was convenient to the bay bridge si that's why we booked it,3
2708,we did have a problem with the hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait that long you might miss out,3
2709,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
2710,the maid kept coming by knocking on our door at about 8 30am to gain access to either of these machines,3
2711,unfortunately the curtains do not close in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing,3
2712,although i did find it a little expensive for microwaved sandwiches and there wasn't adequate salt sand on the ice,3
2713,there was some ants inside the room at last night and the staff is very friendly and accommodating within their means,3
2714,this is the second time we've stayed here and both times i was pleased with the stay,3
2715,the staff was wonderful and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property,3
2716,maybe choice 4 in the columbia area if you need a bed close to the airport,3
2717,it was nice to have an indoor pool but they don't,3
2718,i have stayed at this hotel as we do every year,3
2719,we stayed there 3 days and it was like a sauna in our room,3
2720,personnel were friendly and breakfast in the morning but i couldn't use the bathroom because the last guy laid a log in there,3
2721,unfortunately i was one of the best buffets for the price of the 2 bedroom condo i was expecting when i booked this trip,3
2722,the room itself was very clean and appeared to have been recently updated so no complaints with that,3
2723,this is one of the cheapest in the area but there's an extremely noisy bar directly next to the hotel,3
2724,water pressure in shower was good but the restroom had a mildew smell,3
2725,the overnight stay the room in very dirty and when we told the front desk but the phone wasn't working,3
2726,we stayed at best western mainly for the price and because it was not mold,3
2727,everything was okay except that the room smelled a little funny like burnt rubber breakfast left something to be desired big time,3
2728,the room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and fridge in the room,3
2729,they offered breakfast in the morning was different,3
2730,be sure to tack on add'l time if you have a car or are taking the metro,3
2731,a good somewhat dated 3-star hotel with clean spacious room and nice comfortable king bed,3
2732,bathroom was not as clean as it should have been,3
2733,we booked for a family with two small children 5 and 7 we did find that the pool was a nightmare,3
2734,we stayed here for the night and it was fine for what we needed,3
2735,staff were friendly the outside of the hotel is under renovation but we had an old room and it showed,3
2736,it seemed like with a little bit of travelling to reach is a must,3
2737,it was a non-smoking hotel absolutely reeked of smoke as you walked into and out of the,3
2738,room and breakfast were fine pretty much what you'd expect for 45,3
2739,probably the worst room i've ever slept on,3
2740,young woman at front desk when i checked in the desk clerk gave us directions to other hotels next tothis one,3
2741,also we were under impression we were getting a room with a queen since they just has a cancellation,3
2742,we only stayed because it was a cold night and the room was clean and large,3
2743,often we had to wait for the long line,3
2744,the bed is comfy front desk staff were quite nice but it really wasn't memory foam,3
2745,the hotel was very affordable for us as we were in town for a work event at ung,3
2746,when we stayed the first time we accessed the room,3
2747,the hotel admitted it was not a room to spend much time in the room,3
2748,the room needed some maintenance however the overall stay wasn't bad after room was accommodated,3
2749,lots of teens hanging around in the parking lot for an hour waiting just for that,3
2750,upon check in we were told we were calling direct,3
2751,looks like they are redoing a lot but the room smelled a little funny like burnt rubber breakfast left something to be desired big time,3
2752,we ended up in a room with two double beds,3
2753,obviously right at the fremont experience if that is what you are looking forward to at that time in the morning,3
2754,staff is very friendly and the room was big enough for 2,3
2755,i was so tired i didn't care for the attitude of the desk person,3
2756,place is very low cost and walking distance to the beach shops and dining,3
2757,the carpet needed replaced and i didn't know this till i checked in,3
2758,the reservation process for this hotel was excellent for our needs,3
2759,all the staff were very nice but the room,3
2760,i've stayed in worse happy i was only there for couple days for,3
2761,we stayed in april i can't imagine staying there during warmer summer months,3
2762,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section can't say about the service because i didn't ask for,3
2763,overall will stay there again any time i'm in alamosa the rooms are clean but the entrance can turn one off,3
2764,sounded like a brawl in the next room over all night long,3
2765,the room was very outdated and for the price i'd recommended this hotel,3
2766,the room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and fridge in the room,3
2767,the good great location restaurants nearby you can walk to ihop and a short drive to downtown napa,3
2768,my coworkers 30 plus guys and i stayed here before going on a cruise and one is arriving the day before the cruise ship departs,3
2769,i immediately called the office as soon as i told them i booked with hotels,3
2770,com website indicated that a complimentary breakfast was not included as written,3
2771,we found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor or near an elevator on floors 2 or 3,3
2772,pool area was beautiful and the breakfast was really good room was comfortable,3
2773,the room was clean for the most part were professional and respectful,3
2774,however i did hear a lot of traffic noise but i should have known that since it was a one way driveway,3
2775,booked room here due to most other rooms in the area were already full so i didn't complain,3
2776,however there was a big stain on one of the bed wasn't very comfy and needed 10 pillows to feel comfy,3
2777,rooms are small and the place could use a good thorough cleaning some painting and other minor repairs,3
2778,at 6 30 i gave up showered and went down to the front desk got it resolved but then it happened again the next morning,3
2779,it was so bad i felt like i was inconveniencing her,3
2780,this hotel is older and in need of updating food was extremely basic but the staff was very nice and helpful,3
2781,all in all it's good enough for a short one night stay on our way to florida,3
2782,well as i agree that things happen but it was the first week in september and the hotel was fine,3
2783,not my first time staying at a hostel so we were a bit disappointed after reading great reviews of nice hosts and yummy breakfasts,3
2784,bay was beautiful nice to sit in the parking lot at night was bit scary though,3
2785,inconveniently i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
2786,the best thing about the hotel was fine and staff were pleasant,3
2787,good place to stay if you don't have a problem with late check out,3
2788,no microwave pool was nice and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
2789,aside from that the room was clean and in a nice setting on the coast but had a bar next door that has amazing pizza,3
2790,my feet were blistered by the end of the day it's a pretty short drive to laguna beach and some shopping centers,3
2791,chill out with a cocktail at the pool bar was nice although they close at their own leisure,3
2792,the whirlpool jets were so terrible that it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal,3
2793,the hotel is lovely and the staff is great and the room is alright,3
2794,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
2795,breakfast was okay the rooms were clean and the bed was relatively comfortable,3
2796,i was quite surprised when we got into the second room it smelled like smoke,3
2797,the location and appearance of the hotel were pretty and breakfast was provided,3
2798,overall the cleanliness was acceptable but the flooring in the bathroom was pretty cool looked like original tile although unfortunately some were covered,3
2799,nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people,3
2800,the front desk staff were really nice and helped me to find another hotel in this town,3
2801,other than that it got the job done and that's about it,3
2802,i've stayed at a lot of hie throughout the u,3
2803,the elevator still doesn't work and they could not fix it,3
2804,fiesta inn centro historico is right next door to the room it looked nice and more importantly smelled clean,3
2805,if you have no other option then it's alright to spend a night at alamosa after visiting great sand dune,3
2806,what i liked best was the refrigerator and microwave in room was a nice size,3
2807,most of the floor was hardwood laminate which made the room have a weird smell to it,3
2808,in the morning there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee maker fridge or micro in the room,3
2809,the bed was comfy and the room was clean but furnishings were well-worn,3
2810,the air conditioner did not function properly in the room and there was no one at the front desk very polite and helpful,3
2811,when we checked in we were told there was a new manager,3
2812,one of the lamps next to the bed were not working at all on the 5th floor near the swimming pool,3
2813,i've stayed at extended stays before but this one was not up to past satisfactory levels,3
2814,just stayed here to sleep on a pull out couch to sleep 2 plus the king bed,3
2815,the pool area was ok however the hot tub was again dirty and cold,3
2816,although the room was clean and semi quiet,3
2817,the personnel were very nice but seemed understaffed,3
2818,one of the things i tend to rate when i stay in santa cruz because i want to walk everywhere,3
2819,the 70 per night rate worked great for my need as it was very close to a hospital so you could hear ambulances all night,3
2820,it is not in the greatest neighborhood and the rooms are not quiet but is an okay hotel to spend the night and feel good,3
2821,also they didn't have a microwave,3
2822,we've stayed at the plaza several times in the past so was surprised by the comfort,3
2823,i had decided i would use a taxi from the train station and in the heart of roanoke and right at the market center,3
2824,the gentleman placed us in a room with a queen since they just has a cancellation,3
2825,cedric went above and beyond calling around trying to find a pizza place that would deliver and the internet code,3
2826,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is that we were able to book our weekend trip last minute,3
2827,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
2828,nothing fancy by any stretch but it doesn't hold enough so we had to throw away some food,3
2829,just not worth what they charge for 24 hours of access,3
2830,the first morning there was a lot of noise in this hotel,3
2831,this place sufficed for an overnight stay after a wedding,3
2832,staff was very nice and helpful and the location was a short drive from st,3
2833,i would not use it again and would not recommend it for an extended beach vacation,3
2834,not the greatest hotel in the world but it was clean and the staff was nice,3
2835,spent a night here on a business trip and i travel often,3
2836,both the night staff and the morning staff were very friendly even though they had to field many complaints,3
2837,fitness room is too small and was packed and we had to call the number to get someone to give us our room key,3
2838,there are snacks and other food for purchase in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice,3
2839,staff very friendly and left a beautiful bday cake in my room for about 20 minutes due to the dead bolt not disengaging,3
2840,perhaps a little pricier than i was looking for every time i glanced at the selections,3
2841,i would stay here again for the right price,3
2842,the bathroom in our room which i thought was pretty weird for a hotel,3
2843,as drove into the circle that this hotel is targeted frequently or someone is tipping them off,3
2844,but the price of the room was great reception and fast,3
2845,after reading many reviews we decided to book this hotel for a stop during our move cross-country,3
2846,i will probably try another marriott in the area next time i will ask for a room with mini-fridge and microwave,3
2847,bathroom was clean and we did not feel safe in the elevator,3
2848,we have been staying at this hotel if you are in need of a deep clean,3
2849,it was hard to move around the parking lot and walkways were promptly cleared,3
2850,i am a non-smoker and i thought the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke esp by the door and bathroom,3
2851,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
2852,the lobby area is noisy don't stay in room 350 because you will have an extra guest,3
2853,the room was clean and comfortable and a good value,3
2854,tube hadn't been cleaned in a long time,3
2855,when we first got to the room there was water in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark,3
2856,usually we pay cash but i went ahead and prepaid on my debit card and was assured that there would not,3
2857,the hotel is centrally located close to shops and restaurants,3
2858,the room was large and very clean the upstairs ice machine did not work and this happened on a previous visit,3
2859,it took me 2 hours to air out the room before costomers are placed in them,3
2860,hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and son's birthday weekend,3
2861,i've stayed at extended stays before but this one was not up to what is expected for a monaco hotel,3
2862,there were times there was nobody at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
2863,poor quality thin towels but there were enough the bathroom was clean but all the piping old,3
2864,the location is okay great if you want to avoid noise stay away from there,3
2865,the parking lot is already full and you have to park in the adjacent city owned parking garage,3
2866,the attitude at the front desk did not want to trust cleanliness of complementary breakfast and so we went out to breakfast the following morning,3
2867,we were traveling through to nm and this was a convenient location in west monroe for dinning,3
2868,this is my second stay at this hotel was only 25,3
2869,the location is great if you need to hear your alarm,3
2870,this was my first stay at this motel and for one night it's ok no people when you go late night people nice,3
2871,pets are accepted but there is no rules regarding age limits for kids in the hot tub entitled behavior galore,3
2872,bed was hard pillows were small and not very fluffy,3
2873,i am from singapore so i am not concerned about it,3
2874,so much to see and do didn't use anything the charge would be reversed,3
2875,hotel and staff were excellent but the walls are so thin we heard every word and were awakened,3
2876,we stayed here because it was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel,3
2877,i told the girl at the desk was very nice and helpful,3
2878,it was the first week in september and the hotel was pretty the staff was very friendly and checked me in very quickly,3
2879,the hotel is in a good location close to a hubway bikeshare station and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
2880,i complained about my room to the front desk because they didn't open that early,3
2881,it was ok because there was a starbucks n stores right across the street is a lovely setting for a walk or run,3
2882,we were unable to get it fixed next day never done,3
2883,but it was 3 in the morning when people were leaving,3
2884,lady who checked us in was extremely friendly and the rooms were clean but the covers were reused,3
2885,the hotel was quiet and i slept well,3
2886,holiday inn has become one of the most unique setups i've ever experienced,3
2887,i had no cause for actual complaint but my room was very adequate for the price,3
2888,she was very nice about it and put us in a better room we had nothing to complain about,3
2889,i only had to wait a half hour for the drinks we ordered,3
2890,so i didn't eat breakfast but had,3
2891,this hotel has potential but as is i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone staying in the area,3
2892,not much to do or see in walden and many of the rooms were smoking,3
2893,if that was on the description i would not have stayed even the first night,3
2894,other than that it got the job done and that's about it,3
2895,it's an average stay for sleep but don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine,3
2896,the location is good the hotel was clean the staff were fine,3
2897,my biggest problem was just the fact that it is located on a busy road so noisy,3
2898,they helped me out at the front desk was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the areas attractions,3
2899,this is the reason i would not recommend anyone to stay there,3
2900,there is a gas station right across the street from the toll station but was relatively quiet considering,3
2901,close to southland gray hound park just a 2 minute walk to the beach and center of town its what we settled for,3
2902,the wifi never connected and we had to wait for 50 mins to get picked up at the airport,3
2903,several major tv stations missing coffee machine in room had not been cleaned so we were assigned a handicap room,3
2904,we recently stayed overnight here while passing through and were very happy with our room clean and comfortable,3
2905,bathroom is fairly newer but still could use an upgrade but they keep it clean,3
2906,i could even hear the guy snoring in the middle of the hallway not close to either entrance,3
2907,we asked the front desk to report and was told that it would be closed for the rest of the room,3
2908,my husband went down tot he front desk right away to let them know and they ended up moving us to a new room,3
2909,i am in this area several times a year for events in indianapolis you can't beat it for the price,3
2910,the price wasn't too bad but getting back to the interstate and resulted in a somewhat noisy room,3
2911,i was given replacement keys and they didn't have our reservation from when i booked 9 line at hotels,3
2912,hotel was very clean as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
2913,metered street parking is available but they don't tell you that parking costs 8 per night,3
2914,this hotel is no longer a country inn and suites that hasn't been updated since the late 90's,3
2915,i really needed to just get away for a night to attend an event in denver,3
2916,our family had a great time in dahlonega the hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful,3
2917,i was very pleased with the location of the hotel is under significant renovation in rooms and the lobby,3
2918,it had an old television and the remote did not work and i didn't know this till i checked in,3
2919,we were located on the second floor next to each other,3
2920,room was small which made running the a c it would be perfect,3
2921,the room was perfect for what i needed it was perfect cheap not far from the beach,3
2922,place is very low cost and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
2923,this time we got a 1-br unit and it was small but adequate and clean as was the en-suite bathroom,3
2924,we stayed at this hotel due to its proximity to that,3
2925,chose this hotel since it had a kitchen which was great i didn't know would become irritating while sleeping,3
2926,i was glad that our room did not smell of smoke,3
2927,the room was quite small but the bathroom was very nice just a little small,3
2928,staff was friendly just on checking in the individual check in did not know how nor have any instructions on hand to set it up,3
2929,the neighborhood was great and the rooms were tiny,3
2930,one exit up is a lot of construction being done to the hotel,3
2931,if you can get a room facing the courtyard it is very pleasant and helpful with this and the room was clean and comfortable,3
2932,i'd say my stay was so-so but coffee was good,3
2933,there was blood on the shower curtain on the inside,3
2934,all of the rooms and my daughter did not want to sit on it,3
2935,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i booked our room for local events,3
2936,its clean but past its prime needs an upgrade fresh coat of paint on it and call it good,3
2937,i really needed to just get away for a night to attend an event about 20 miles away,3
2938,overall a good stay but the room felt very very damp the whole time,3
2939,several friends and i stayed at the embassy and had a much better room,3
2940,we had booked the west-room which is on the opposite end of the room that is very oddly placed,3
2941,if you're just there for the night because you have to go up a long hill to find the hotel,3
2942,stayed over for a night on the road,3
2943,paint masking tape and concrete in front of our door which was great,3
2944,i booked a single room for one night while waiting for a flight from lax,3
2945,i was also not used to the water which seemed to have a renovated bathroom the walls desperately needed a coat of paint,3
2946,there was some hair on the floor and find anything leftover,3
2947,we stayed here twice the room was spacious and has a microwave and refridgerator,3
2948,shame because it's one of e best pools i've seen and the toilets were great for small children not for adults,3
2949,there was no fan in the bathrooms nasty,3
2950,room was clean and service was great the room could have also had a more pleasant smell,3
2951,no elevator so we stayed on the first floor since this hotel did not have any problem in our room,3
2952,if we were given the wrong information about the breakfast time and we were not told the pool was under construction,3
2953,said breakfast was included but they didnt have enough sheets to give us any for,3
2954,room itself was very nice and attentive and the food was very underwhelming,3
2955,price was very affordable and so we did not use it at all,3
2956,i can't tell you how the room was because when we arrived we walked into a room that smelled fine and enjoyed our stay,3
2957,the beach cove resort hotel is an older hotel that could use some updates,3
2958,when we got in the room i was in had a flat screen set,3
2959,they are in the middle of the night,3
2960,it was clean for the most part the hotel was very clean,3
2961,chairs in the room were very uncomfortable and on top of it already spending 113,3
2962,located almost equidistant between the airport and the cruise terminal,3
2963,when you are traveling on a budget not a lot to do around the hotel but the service was arrogant at best,3
2964,the staff was very accommodating and helpful considering there were no rooms available for all three nights,3
2965,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is that it's about 35-45 minutes from downtown austin,3
2966,the glass of wine available in the lobby in the morning but coffee was spot on,3
2967,i was told downtown had decent places to eat and we booked it because it was close to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
2968,only complaints are that the shower curtain needed to be replaced as there was nothing to them,3
2969,maybe ask for a room on the top floor just to avoid any noise disturbances,3
2970,we stayed her because we had an early flight and got zero sleep,3
2971,located on a busy street many shops and places to eat so is ideally placed for having a look round and eating,3
2972,as they didn't fix the lamp light issue in the room it was a good but not great hotel experience,3
2973,the check in procedure was a little inconvenient to have to trek across the parking lot in the back of the building,3
2974,room needed updating but for the price it was very accommodating,3
2975,the best part was the price 50 on a friday night with the option to pay or leave,3
2976,the toaster oven had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk gave you ice if needed,3
2977,my only complaint is that it was very clean with older amenities nothing fancy,3
2978,the room was a bit small but the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice,3
2979,yes we were on the second floor next to each other,3
2980,the lobby carpet on the other hand was a little disappointing,3
2981,the carpets are in need of a makeover,3
2982,we didn't realize until we got to the hotel at around 1 00am and was informed that the elevator was not working,3
2983,overall the stay was not worth the price in my opinion,3
2984,the hotel is fine but don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine,3
2985,not an attractive building and not an attractive location but rooms are large and it was quiet at night but some daytime remodeling noise,3
2986,the front desk clerk was friendly and speedy the room was somewhat clean could have been better food was cold breakfast and dinner,3
2987,comfort in the hotel was good for an over night stay,3
2988,the place is rundown but the rooms are not all that,3
2989,in general a lot of great things about this hotel was the location,3
2990,when i first checked in i just dropped my bags in the room and the channels on the tv and nothing for kids to watch,3
2991,the food at the restaurant was very good,3
2992,in general this hampton falls short in many areas and i do not recommend this to tourist good for needing somewhere to stay,3
2993,there was a roach in our room but unfortunately did not have one,3
2994,after spending one night there i realized the sliding glass door it did not go away,3
2995,my biggest problem was just the fact that it had an indoor pool,3
2996,the place could use a little help but i wasn't there to get a room service cart,3
2997,we stayed one night so if u just looking for one night you would think some sort of breakfast would be available,3
2998,everything was fine except when we went into the room it seems ok since it was really late and we were exhausted,3
2999,the rooms while clean were very plain and simple i dont think you can beat this place,3
3000,the ice machine was broken a towel from a previous guest on the ledge of the shower,3
3001,room was ok for an overnight stay but wouldn't want to stay longer than a night or two,3
3002,the bath towels were very rough and the bed had a big slope in the middle on one side,3
3003,just the bug bites i went home with were a bit of a tight squeeze if you over 240lbs,3
3004,the air only worked on 60 and the water was shut down but other than that great comfort,3
3005,we needed a place to sleep like us,3
3006,i didn't feel as if i was sleeping on rocks,3
3007,i don't know if all of the rooms face outside typical red roof,3
3008,the room was clean and the hotel was conveniently at a good rate,3
3009,still the room was clean and can't beat the location,3
3010,we were outside most of the time we were there,3
3011,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the room or anywhere else on dining activities attractions delivery in the area,3
3012,the hotel staff was friendly and the bed was very comfortable and the staff at the desk at check in,3
3013,place was adequate for the price but this last stay was very stressful,3
3014,com booking at check in but the hotel staff did not honor my reservations through expedia,3
3015,our room was on the second floor and no elevator,3
3016,being a last minute booking and on a friday night in july right on the boardwalk in santa cruz,3
3017,i was only staying for 2 nights and attempted to cancel the 3rd night and they said i had to wait until the following day,3
3018,we stayed here for one night before taking a carnival cruise,3
3019,refrigerator and free hot breakfast included in the room price so i didn't have the kids with us,3
3020,my first impression at check-in was quick but i had to ask for another room,3
3021,we did back up the truck a few stalls from the entrance and within walking distance to any attractions,3
3022,we did have to fight a wasp at midnight which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
3023,there are family restaurants within walking distance matter of fact there is nothing within walking distance of food shopping and a nature area,3
3024,the price was great and the views from the pool were beautiful but we had a good sleep,3
3025,i liked the location the staff were friendly but the front desk gave you ice if needed,3
3026,this should tell you a lot when we got into the second room it smelled like smoke,3
3027,we were there to visit universities in the area and with a clean room good bed and wifi to boot,3
3028,it was nice that there was a lot of noise,3
3029,bfast good they have a waffle maker and some muffins,3
3030,i'm a non smoker and i got a virus while i was their,3
3031,i had a tough time sleeping because we could hear the tv from the hallway,3
3032,daughter 7 was looking forward to swimming but the pool in the basement which is pretty dark,3
3033,this hotel has a large beautiful pool which is the reason i chose laquinta inns and suites,3
3034,i didn't expect much for the price and the staff was very rude,3
3035,it seemed like there were a lot of hotels cheap pricey,3
3036,the out side area had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk guy handled it well,3
3037,we had to travel to glasgow on a last minute boston getaway and found it clean spacious and very conveniently located,3
3038,breakfast was definitely not as good as a super 8,3
3039,on the way out i stopped at the front desk were rude if you called for information or asked for something,3
3040,there was a sign that said the printer wasn't working so every time we wanted to go back to campus,3
3041,breakfirst is very soso and rooms have not refrig and one of the best meals we've ever had very disappointed in the hotel condition,3
3042,stayed a night with my kiddo it was a good stay for my family,3
3043,there was only a tiny shelf in the shower and found a lot more,3
3044,the staff the was friendly and the room was extremely clean and welcoming,3
3045,at the time we arrived it was raining and the quality inn popped up,3
3046,on one occasion we asked for a new bedspread and we were given a room that wasn't ready,3
3047,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was easily seen from everywhere in the room,3
3048,didnt hear bell so i had to drag my luggage up a long flight of stairs,3
3049,stayed 2 nights in the hotel but didn't affect our stay,3
3050,the hotel lobby is nice and the rooms were average but clean with some upgrades,3
3051,overall for the price of the 2 bedroom condo that we reserved was small,3
3052,many fights broke out during the night that my room had no tv channel line up,3
3053,the location of this hotel is great for location to the convention center and the fridge was broken too,3
3054,good place to crash in between hanging out at the pool but surprisingly fri was quieter,3
3055,the room that we were given permission to use near the pool and we heard all of the late night swimmers,3
3056,number of people handling breakfast was very less and were not able to open the door to your room,3
3057,room was fine but the breakfast wasn't all that great,3
3058,the manager was very abrasive and did not make my husband and i would roll to the middle and you can feel the springs,3

3060,check out is at nooncons the door would not close unless i pushed it shut 140,3
3061,had to go to the airport and affordable,3

3064,the bathroom was musky and our room was on the sad side,3
3065,the ac worked fine but the bathroom was very nice just a little small,3
3066,i would stay here again for the price and location i would for sure stay here again if need be,3
3067,unfortunately no one told us that the hotel was in the first stages if a renovation,3
3068,the hotel is clean and the location is great,3
3069,stayed here in april 2016 for one night only and felt that it was very overpriced for what we got,3
3070,pool room was so cold that we didn't get the rooms that we were promised,3
3071,i will probably try another marriott in the area next time i will ask for a cc for incidentals even if you are prepaid,3
3072,not a big deal but i felt like a 5 star guest,3
3073,they served sold starbucks coffee in the eating area which i thought was bit much for the quality of the room,3
3074,have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its modest rates,3
3075,there is no daily housekeeping for us that wasn't a problem for us our concert is only a mile a half away,3
3076,at first we got a non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke,3
3077,the hj staff were very accommodating in that i asked for a wet towel to wash off the filthy breakfast tables,3
3078,my daughter and i found the room to be a bit more than ordinary,3
3079,the gardena terrace inn was just a one night before departing to utah for national parks,3
3080,make sure you confirm the type of room we reserved disappointing,3
3081,it was fine for a night but it's not fancy,3
3082,the hotel staff was friendly and helpful especially julio at the front desk are happy to help,3
3083,the only thing that made my latest stay at the hotel and had to send a family member back for it,3
3084,in their pool area there was no towels in the ben,3
3085,hotel lobby pool and staff were excellent but the only thing i asked for,3
3086,i was happy it had a microwave and refrigerator to make guests more comfortable,3
3087,the anglers inn is an older property but is nice,3
3088,we stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport so that was convenient,3
3089,but everything is close by so you can walk if you don't need much then it's a fine place to stay,3
3090,5 front desk staff was not very helpful,3
3091,there were fairly large cracks in the walls and didn't seem to be a factor,3
3092,there was a large group that didn't check out so i had to book this hotel for a wheelchair accessible one bedroom,3
3093,the second night i stayed i was in a room that had not been remodeled yet that was a former smoking room,3
3094,it worked since we didn't have time as we were to be at a higher overall level,3
3095,one of the things i tend to rate when i stay in dc i am now staying elsewhere,3
3096,make sure you get a courtyard room if you don't want to spend a lot of time and money into renovating the property,3
3097,overall it was a good value and an adequate breakfast,3
3098,maid service was poor we left the room in the lobby area was nice,3
3099,on several occasions there was no one at the front desk named jonathan,3
3100,the lobby and dining area for the price could have had a room away from the tracks,3
3101,we were visiting relatives and simply needed a place to stop passing through late,3
3102,in the morning there was a lot of people get sick,3
3103,staff was friendly one day our room was changed immediately and,3
3104,the hotel is great for a three star price and you won't be sorry,3
3105,she got on her computer and found a room that smelled fine and enjoyed our stay,3
3106,if noise bothers you request a room away from the street and the pool on the second level,3
3107,luckily i was able to find a room,3
3108,positives the location was good it was easy for me to make my own meals and sit comfortably and watch tv,3
3109,we had to travel to glasgow on a last minute boston getaway and found it clean so returned,3
3110,we enjoyed the indoor pool which was warm and inviting as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker and low-sugar syrup,3
3111,we arrived late as it was a particularly cold week,3
3112,room was nicer than expected but we were expecting a better room for the price,3
3113,however my courtyard view was little more than a view of the beautiful pool area so don't count on that,3
3114,i was a bit leery because there were several men in the parking lot it's a steep incline and there wasn't even toast,3
3115,this hotel is quite dated but is clean and quiet close to the lovely town market,3
3116,did hear a couple of trains during the night ac was a little loud with a lot of hall noise,3
3117,the distance from the elevator to the 2nd floor only and then had to check in,3
3118,but room was adequate although there was a tear in the comforter,3
3119,no fan in the bathroom may have attributed to the mold on the ceiling walls and the floor of the room,3
3120,granted this hotel is situated in the middle of everything,3
3121,parking lot was scary at night the hotel was exceptionally well located,3
3122,my west facing room did not have a shower curtain,3
3123,beware that although this is in a nice setting but so are many other hotels in orlando,3
3124,i may return if i'm in the area but the hotel was full late july,3
3125,the only soda and ice machines available were on the first floor the older male shook his head no,3
3126,i had room service once and it was taken care of,3
3127,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
3128,it as worth the money i saved over the weekend to stay there again if the price is right,3
3129,i think the price was a little high for what it was,3
3130,regardless the room was clean and staff was very helpful nice,3
3131,this was the first time i stayed at the holiday inn express branding i would suggest they use a little more care for personal items,3
3132,the location was perfect however the room we stayed in this hotel for one night before heading into st,3
3133,next time i go to ithaca i may have to stay there again at least until they renovate,3
3134,recommend you spend the money for a night i didn't need because my friends were getting ready to come pick me up,3
3135,the kitchenette was nice and clean as well however i was very disappointed that i had to relocate because they were having some water issues,3
3136,printer that was available for customer stay did not work the second evening i stayed here,3
3137,we were visiting family in callahan and the hotel was pretty quiet at night which was nice,3
3138,we didn't expect anything special and we didn't get robbed or sick but that is about it,3
3139,this comfort inn however must have been there for a long time with check in process with little thought to check out process,3
3140,the personnel were very nice but the hallways are dingy,3
3141,it needs renovations but the room was and smelled clean,3
3142,it could be better but it's an ok place to rest your head but kinda felt like you get what you pay for,3
3143,stayed here one night the bed was very comfortable but the rooms were dark and 70s looking,3
3144,it took the staff two adults an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet,3
3145,we weren't expecting anything amazing for the price but this last stay was worse than usual,3
3146,after checking in we went up to our room to find hair in the bathtub and all over the floor still,3
3147,there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room it's sweltering hot and the unit takes forever,3
3148,room was clean and in good shape very comfortable and the dcor reflective of the marriott,3
3149,i understand i am not a fan of was the dating of the hotel,3
3150,filter on air conditioner looked like it hadn't been cleaned bar of soap empty shampoo containers were still there,3
3151,the smoking area right outside the door with the door open,3
3152,we were there over the 4th of july we didn't want to be out walking after dark,3
3153,the lobby carpet on the other hand was quite pleasant and the staff was friendly,3
3154,just a 2 minute walk to the other end of the street and although there is a good size but a little old,3
3155,the rooms were clean but the bathroom floor wasn't as clean as i would like,3
3156,the housekeepers are lazy but the front desk guy handled it well,3
3157,we stopped here for one night on our way up to portland,3
3158,that said the rooms are fair at best,3
3159,the location of this hotel is its location,3
3160,dear valued guest thank you for taking the time to write a review and for choosing to stay with us,3
3161,i really needed to just get away for a night to attend an event about 20 miles away,3
3162,the location is not bad as it is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from venice,3
3163,i really needed to just get away for a night to attend an event in denver,3
3164,pets are accepted but there is no elevator in or near the lobby,3
3165,you can tell the hotel is a little outdated but clean,3
3166,it was ok but next time i'll spend another 10,3
3167,good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance,3
3168,there was no espn on the cable and there is a microwave and a refrigerator with a freezer,3
3169,the lobby area was clean and well appointed,3
3170,staff was pretty nice and the rooms were freezing and the heaters did not work very well in the room,3
3171,i am a non-smoker and i thought the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke but the room did not smell of smoke,3
3172,when she checked in we were told we were going to be super expensive for saturday night,3
3173,the hotel is very clean and staff friendly however the hotel is old and really needs attention,3
3174,hotel lobby pool and staff were excellent but the only thing i noticed was some ants and dirt in the bathtub,3
3175,the room was perfect for what i needed it was perfect cheap not far from the beach,3
3176,young woman at front desk when i checked in of 179,3
3177,received two extra charges from this hotel because i had an idea of what i was getting into,3
3178,bathroom again a little dated but still functional,3
3179,however i had an issue with elevator didn't work properly but i didn't care,3
3180,inconveniently i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
3181,doors to our room were quite thin so it was quite hot and stuffy in the hall,3
3182,but the air conditioner in our room did not work and tv channels did not have any problems,3
3183,what we thought was going to be a very mixed review,3
3184,was nice but jacuzzi tub in room was not swept on far side of 2nd bed from entrance,3
3185,when i went to check out there was a nasty odor in the lobby,3
3186,you can tell the hotel is a little run down and continental breakfast awful,3
3187,my wife and i was climbing the stairs to the ground floor to the 1st floor and the grounds,3
3188,the hotel is a little run down and continental breakfast awful,3
3189,additionally the location was walkable to a lot of nice restaurants and only 10 mins walk to galleries,3
3190,i may try it again next time i am back to the area,3
3191,i will have to continue to call about it to make sure it is reversed before you leave,3
3192,very basic hotel but i did think the beds were comfortable a c worked well and hotel was quiet,3
3193,it even seemed to have drifted up to our room to find it hadn't been cleaned in years,3
3194,the curtains do not close in the room and we had a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom,3
3195,i had to work in the area and at the hotel,3
3196,all in all it appears hyatt is cutting corners at this hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park,3
3197,upon arrival young lady who checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly,3
3198,that said the rooms are fair at best,3
3199,tv is in a really odd place and it's hard to walk to your destination in the heat,3
3200,room was pretty much what you would expect to get in motel,3
3201,would have been happier had they provided some sort of breakfast would be available,3
3202,i told her that the phone in my room was clean didn't smell and was comfortable,3
3203,we were told that we had a good time here but it wasn't the cleanest room,3
3204,new tv did not work and it was like a sauna in our room,3
3205,this hotel is not the best place for an extended stay would have expected a little more,3
3206,we had to ask for more at the front desk when i checked in,3
3207,the fitness area is laughably poor it is in a great location the room was small but adequate,3
3208,we reserved a queen but i think they put us in an ada room which was fine,3
3209,the hotel is easy to find and perfect for a short stay overnight only,3
3210,otherwise the room was fine but needs updating,3
3211,we were in town for march madness and were told that the orange juice was done for the day,3
3212,the only problem was that the hotel common areas were not as clean,3
3213,i'm a non smoker and requesting a non smoking room had a burn,3
3214,1 the rate is great for the facility and the staff is not really helpful and you don't mind the gangstas,3
3215,no ac too hot in the room when we first walked on which made the room seem more clean and modern,3
3216,however although the area was ok and the free breakfast was so-so,3
3217,if you are looking for a hotel to stay the night,3
3218,let's just say that wasn't the hotel's fault they say that they are in the process of being updated,3
3219,could easily fit a small family in there there was a mixup with our reservation and they took care of it,3
3220,the only thing they did not like was that it was very noisy and propped open,3
3221,the king bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean and spacious king sized bed flatscreen tv fridge microwave and a,3
3222,we only stayed for one night so it was good to use for then,3
3223,very run down rooms smell breakfast is the worst of any hotel i've stayed in there was no shower cap,3
3224,however there was one employee a woman at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in,3
3225,the room was small but adequate and clean as was the en-suite bathroom,3
3226,since you need a car to get there or have to pay for parking at the hotel so we parked at our son's restaurant,3
3227,overall my stay was okay and i'd be willing to give this hotel a 5 stars for their great customer service,3
3228,we arrived at midnight there was no one to help us at the desk,3
3229,overall my stay was fine but the breakfast was one of the worst hotels for shuttle service,3
3230,however if you're looking for a nice place to stay near worcester,3
3231,basic room with two large beds that took up most of the room so the other queen bed couldn't see the tv that well,3
3232,therefore we knew when we booked it what we would be getting in late so just needed a cheap place to stay,3
3233,i stayed at this hotel for decadence based on a recommendation and i'm glad that's all we stayed,3
3234,place is very low cost and walking distance to the beach shops and dining,3
3235,there was a damp smell in our room which i thought was late i was tired and wanted to get some sleep,3
3236,stayed here for business and it was good for a road trip stop,3
3237,motel was in a good location but there aren't a lot of choices in this area,3
3238,didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot doors opening closing all night people talking etc,3
3239,while i thoroughly concur with the ta advice i found that the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude,3
3240,the bed was comfortable and clean but room was very small without any place to tidy clothes,3
3241,clean and safe with a friendly staff but the rooms are small and rather cramped,3
3242,it was a bit noisy as the person people in the room next to ours and the one below us both had dogs in them,3
3243,the room is modern and comfortable but the service went from good to bad as soon as i entered the hotel it smelled of smoke,3
3244,when you check into your room be sure to check directly with the hotel from now on,3
3245,i did a search on tripadvisor for places nearby and the quality inn was in front of us,3
3246,i have stayed at this hotel for one night as we were going home to texas,3
3247,i thought that some of the staff were friendly but asked if i needed to check out of a room i already paid for,3
3248,it's location is good and the lobby is no exception,3
3249,i will say we were a bit put off when we checked in if we would need any of these things,3
3250,2 the hot breakfast was meh and the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups,3
3251,place was great room next to us barked for 7 hours,3
3252,they were doing construction remodeling when we went therefore it wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet,3
3253,additionally there were hardly any outlets in the room and the complimentary breakfast was really good but i didn't understand the water minimum,3
3254,saddest comfort suites i've stayed in a lot worse places,3
3255,visited here mainly because it was one of the best buffets for the price of 130 for the night this hotel will work,3
3256,i left my hat in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh,3
3257,the restaurant is too loud and without much of a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little,3
3258,but to get out of the way,3
3259,appeared to be somewhat recently renovated the room was clean had a nice tv and refrigerator,3
3260,we were looking for an overnight place to stay while in osage beach well i highly recommend this property,3
3261,this hotel is under new management again and many of the commerces appeared closed for good which is,3
3262,the only thing i didn't like the condition there,3
3263,room size was good bathroom could have been cleaner i felt our room floor wasn't very clean,3
3264,whenever there was a problem with the hotel was room size particularly bathroom size,3
3265,when we entered the initial room we were assigned had not been cleaned so we were assigned a handicap room,3
3266,decor was nice but the room itself was very clean,3
3267,climate control fan was extremely noisy as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker and low-sugar syrup,3
3268,hotel wasn't as clean as it could be,3
3269,not sure if i would recommend this hotel if you are to stay in irvine area,3
3270,also did not not like the charge for the safe in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
3271,only a one night stay but i don't think i'll be coming back anytime soon,3
3272,the desk clerk was extremely nice and the hotel was conveniently located near eateries and shopping malls and plazas,3
3273,stay was average for the time of year i was satisfied,3
3274,this hotel was reasonably priced and we had a comfortable stay as we traveled north to ontario,3
3275,overall ok not really sure it was worth the money paid but it was not a hotel it was a bed and breakfast,3
3276,the breakfast was certainly not the best hotel but the staff is exelente and probebly the best place to stay in the same room,3
3277,this place is close to a lot of restaurants boutiques and grocery,3
3278,every employee we encountered at this hotel seemed as though they were designed in the 40's,3
3279,we were not that happy at this hampton inn and found it very nice,3
3280,breakfast had a wide variety of food but it was free so what can you say,3
3281,however my bed was creaky and didn't appear to have been updated in 20 years and was covered in mildew,3
3282,no fridge no microwave swimming pool is located on the grounds with an outback steak house,3
3283,price was good but hotel didn't have a lot of choice for breakfast,3
3284,i may try it again next time i am in the area,3
3285,we stayed in the family tower the hotel wasn't great and it was clean everything,3
3286,although the heater in the room was only decaf,3
3287,right next to hon'l's beach and walking distance to many shops restaurants and prudential center,3
3288,there breakfast was nice but i would not stay there again,3
3289,the place is rundown but the rooms are a little small,3
3290,a used washcloth was still hanging from the shower curtain and just an overall negative feeling about the cleanliness of the hotel in either direction,3
3291,good accommodation and clean the only issue i had with the room was the smell musty moldy like the room had been cleaned well,3
3292,what we thought was going to be from the look of the hotel but the room was great,3
3293,overall the hotel was not the greatest but the customer service was great and the room was spacious,3
3294,we were located on the second floor next to each other,3
3295,no elevator to second floor would be a problem for larger or older people,3
3296,this is motel on the way to our final vacation destination,3
3297,check in was fast and friendly as well,3
3298,the hotel was fine but i would definitely try it again,3
3299,the room was very clean the bed was comfy and the staff courteous,3
3300,other than that we had a good experience but not this time,3
3301,having said that there are some drawbacks there is no coffee maker in room but motel coffee is in the breakfast room,3
3302,beds were comfortable and the pool was dirty and not running properly,3
3303,room smelled like smoke even worse when the ac was left off for too long,3
3304,the rooms were ok clean but out dated pillows were horrible,3
3305,the people were nice though and it was right across the street that becomes very loud in the evening,3
3306,i had high hopes for this hotel based on a review of ratings,3
3307,we were only staying 2 nights in the area on business,3
3308,the hotel was great for the price many other options for hotels in the same price range and see if it gets better,3
3309,it had a smell and though it was a smoke free room,3
3310,it's not real deluxe but it served its purpose for good rest and shower,3
3311,we did use the pool which was very nice but the hallways are dingy,3
3312,it could have been a much nicer stay,3
3313,but it does have a good location for the shakespeare festival,3
3314,was pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room as the hotel was booked full,3
3315,needless to say i didn't get much sleep here the walls were thin and i was woken by neighbors turning on water,3
3316,the carpets were pretty clean overall but there were patches in the ceiling and there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,3
3317,i would definitely stay here again if they paid me,3
3318,for the price i would have to say that the staff were friendly and accomodating,3
3319,the staff did give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was soft and the decor very old,3
3320,overpriced by 30 for what it is and what it offers,3
3321,the hotel was fine for the price and the breakfast was nothing to write home about,3
3322,it was super small we had a full bed instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault,3
3323,we couldn't stay in the first room was a little small,3
3324,you get what you pay for but i've had better food at low end hotels,3
3325,despite my scheduling a wake up call and the internet was free,3
3326,staff is pretty friendly and the rooms were average but clean with some upgrades,3
3327,not even sure why because it was not so far from casino del sol,3
3328,on a positive note the hotel is in dire need of improvements,3
3329,location was great very easy to walk into the old town,3
3330,clothes could be hung behind a drape next to the window was falling off the wall,3
3331,our only complaint is that it was very overpriced for what we got,3
3332,i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks and give this place a shot,3
3333,there were no extra blankets available in the room and the channels on the tv and nothing for kids to watch,3
3334,i ordered a burger from room service and it was good for a two night stay,3
3335,construction is the big issue with this hotel is the lack of children's programming on the tv,3
3336,no elevator so we had to sit in the adirondack chairs and relax,3
3337,the staff at this hotel are extremely nice and helpful need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry,3
3338,good place to stay for one night so it was all about location,3
3339,rooms weren't ready at check in and check out were great,3
3340,said breakfast was included but they didnt have enough sheets to give us any for,3
3341,that is the nicest thing i can say it's clean in the room but the clerk brought one up right away,3
3342,this trip was to visit daughter for parents weekend at luther college in decorah,3
3343,the kitchen area was great and it had a full kitchen to prepare meals and not always had to eat out,3
3344,i was there just a couple hours in the afternoon and again after 9 pm on food and drinks,3
3345,this hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and i just got back from a 3 day visit to this hotel,3
3346,negatives even though it is in maryland the price was good and the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was great,3
3347,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
3348,dear sandbar16 thank you so much for taking the time to complete an online review your feedback is important,3
3349,pool was locked after it was supposed to be ok if they did not have a good night sleep,3
3350,after complaining they moved us to another room for one night after leaving the cruise ship,3
3351,would like better brand coffee in the room and told her the beds had not been made either,3
3352,the two down falls were limited parking and there was no one at the front desk was extremely friendly helpful and courtliest high marks,3
3353,lots of wasted space in the room only 4 drawers,3
3354,the fridge plug was in-op warm fridge and the door to the room your were hit with it,3
3355,this is a nice place for the price,3
3356,could be cleaner and more updated for the price i would still stay there,3
3357,room was spacious and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay there and did not have family with,3
3358,wouldn't want to stay here if i were on a relaxing trip to the south,3
3359,average room for an average price just a stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
3360,daughter 7 was looking forward to swimming but the pool in the basement which is pretty dark,3
3361,there used to be a coffee maker in the room and do not disurb signs for the door,3
3362,this place looks like a prison so i thought it would be a bit of a disappointment,3
3363,room was clean and the bed comfortable but this was the 4th time i have stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend,3
3364,the only thing that was a problem was that there was no fridge or microwave and the internet is painfully slow,3
3365,the maid kept coming by knocking on our door at about 8 30am to gain access to either of these machines,3
3366,the staff goes out of their way to help us with information,3
3367,the things that made this a true 4 star service was great the room could have been cleaner but were ok,3
3368,the only real problem was that there was a lot of black mold on the ceiling,3
3369,i also was not impressed with the fact that the hotel doesn't have ac,3
3370,cleanliness is an issue from the dried food on the outside of the hotel appeared clean and well maintained,3
3371,got there and was told they didn't have a ground-story room available,3
3372,the staff were very pleasant and accommodating and a good value,3
3373,we could use the elevator to the 2nd floor were hard enough to do with luggage,3
3374,i would say it's a good location if you do not leave them,3
3375,this hotel isn't bad for the price i completely recommend this hotel,3
3376,stayed for a week choosing this hotel because of its close proximity to the racetrack,3
3377,our room upstairs was ok stayed for one night while on mlb tour of the u,3
3378,it wasn't quite the relaxing weekend i was hoping for when i had to sign to agree my pet would not do 6 of,3
3379,also my nephew told me the new waterpark had chilly water so i didn't need but other than that all was nice,3
3380,we stayed here one night on our way to kansas and were hoping for a better night,3
3381,we arrive at the hotel and liked it,3
3382,however on the night i stayed they were having a problem or not but the water was cold,3
3383,someone found my credit card and i had a good visit,3
3384,the views were really nice and the pool bar was terribly rude and should not be held against the hotel,3
3385,the hotel is in a great location and a decent breakfast,3
3386,the bathroom was a little dirty at least the mirror was but it was cleaned up but the dead ants were in the same room,3
3387,no elevator so i had to call to remind them,3
3388,staff are very nice and the breakfast wasn't worth eating,3
3389,we have been staying at this hotel if you're looking for a nice looking room go elsewhere,3
3390,with no early check-in and the staff were great especially during check in,3
3391,after paying 197 for the room for one night while waiting for a flight from lax,3
3392,unfortunately i was one of the best things about the hotel,3
3393,the fridge plug was in-op warm fridge and the door to the outside 20 degrees for a smoke break,3
3394,the old tube tv didn't work and bed was extremely hard,3
3395,the hotel did not have a shower curtain,3
3396,the bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and did not use the pool,3
3397,we were on the 6th floor had a very musty smell but seemed clean,3
3398,com was very reasonable so i am not a 5 star person by any any,3
3399,saw a couple too lazy to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
3400,we did mention all this at check out and never received a call back frim accounting,3
3401,i really appreciated not having to deal with all the security issues,3
3402,you can either walk if feeling energetic or it's easy to bring your own bowls plates etc,3
3403,even though the hotel has a restaurant inside,3
3404,other than that we had a good experience but not this time,3
3405,good for the price and breakfast was a scramble but the free breakfast was somewhat larger than other hotels i've stay at,3
3406,the carpet was not as clean as it should have been that bad,3
3407,the sheets and towels had holes in them but the room was clean but cover sheets were a bit smelly,3
3408,one disappointment was that a standard room does not have a microwave and fridge in the room,3
3409,we sat alongside the window and it was very convenient to the airport and price is good,3
3410,in the morning was disappointing as the quality of the rooms and check out the bathrooms,3
3411,no a c in the room was good but noise of room next door and people kept us up all night,3
3412,the price of the room was old and not very clean,3
3413,it was a bit loud thursday night with people walking back and forth and looking into my car and looking into the store,3
3414,room is a little snug but did the job as we were only staying one night so were looking for a fairly cheap hotel,3
3415,we have stayed at this hotel over a couple of days,3
3416,would stay here again for the price and close to the exit,3
3417,the only problem was that the room smelled musty or moldy,3
3418,i understand that the rooms need to be renovated to effectively block outside noise,3
3419,i can not say the same for the staff at the front desk was very rude about me being a kimpton member,3
3420,they provided earplugs which isn't helpful if you need to go downtown or to the waterfront to eat,3
3421,this was only a place to stay for a night,3
3422,let me start by saying i travel a lot and are used to 5 star hotels,3
3423,called the front desk and garage had that ghetto feel but the room was clean but had quite a funky smell,3
3424,it was a great room for staying the night and hanging out at the pool but surprisingly fri was quieter,3
3425,not quite a bb as the rooms are in drastic need of an overhaul,3
3426,other small issues included a stain on the carpet and the walls and doors were marked,3
3427,being there 2 nights having a refrigerator and microwave and a quiet air conditioner,3
3428,after a late flight i needed a place to crash for the night this was an average hotel experience,3
3429,the con is that the water pressure was poor and the shower had plenty of hot water and a nice tub shower,3
3430,because we were in town for a wedding venue we didnt have high expectations,3
3431,had three small pillows about the size of the rooms and the hotel itself are rather dated and could use a bit of sprucing up,3
3432,the room was okay but we were hoping for a better night,3
3433,the room was average and the bathroom was not impressive at all,3
3434,the front desk staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the stay but it is what it is,3
3435,the line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel,3
3436,i was too tired to deal with it when i checked in for 10 days but checked out after 2,3
3437,rather i think it would have been like in january,3
3438,not worth the money i saved over the weekend to stay there again if there are no other hotels within my budget,3
3439,every simple request required multiple phone calls and they placed us in a quieter room but didn't,3
3440,there are family restaurants within walking distance which have decent food,3
3441,motel was in a good location close to the interstate,3
3442,the included breakfast was okay and the staff tried to help but could not figure it out,3
3443,it is up on a hill and has a great view if you get a balcony room,3
3444,we stayed on thursday and it took a long time because i believe they were overbooked,3
3445,there also is a pool out front but it was closed because we just had to drain it and change the levels,3
3446,to catch an early flight in the morning and the lovely waitress working it,3
3447,during my last stay i had a individual walk in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be a little run down,3
3448,other than that we enjoyed our stay there and did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
3449,when we opened the door to the balcony did not lock,3
3450,i was the last one to check in for the day when we were there at 11,3
3451,room was nice though i would choose a room with a refrigerator i felt he profiled me was not pleased,3
3452,if that was on the description i would not have stayed there if it was 25 per night,3
3453,no issues got what i paid for in the first place,3
3454,we were on the second floor hallway could not keep up with those country inns suites we had stayed in,3
3455,i shouldn't have to unplug the things in the room and was moved at 3 am was moved to another room,3
3456,although the people who worked there were nice we will not be using this company any more,3
3457,i stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights but honestly for the money we paid 99 a night cheap for the keys,3
3458,the bed was comfortable and the room had a strong musty odor but appeared clean,3
3459,they are in the process of being updated,3
3460,i've stayed at other hotels in the area were already full so i didn't complain,3
3461,we have stayed there many times in the past and had no complaints,3
3462,a few friends and i stayed here before going on a cruise and one is arriving the day before the cruise ship departs,3
3463,the tv did not work and we did not feel comfortable walking back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
3464,although the hotel is in the back of a half run down industrial type building,3
3465,customer service in the morning was disappointing as the quality of the daily breakfasts,3
3466,we stayed on a lower floor and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo,3
3467,we stayed one night so if u just looking for one night you would think some sort of breakfast option,3
3468,the h c room 123 is in the middle of the night twice we were awoke by loud machine noises,3
3469,basic place good for a place to sleep so it served its purpose,3
3470,it isn't the easiest getting in to and out of due to its location and that's what i was after,3
3471,this time they were doing water line work in the hotel so there was no way that regular size luggage would have fit in it,3
3472,check out was 11 00 am and 8 24 am we were awoken by the housecleaning staff barging into our room,3
3473,it was what i expected but they did not give shampoo and the last day i found a cockroach in my room which is disgusting,3
3474,hotel has a no smoking policy as soon as we got into the room we noticed two sets of ear plugs yes ear plugs,3
3475,this hotel is near the freeway the room and bathroom are comfortable and clean,3
3476,one elevator was out of service for 4 days and 3 nights at cypress creek,3
3477,the pool was covered and had nowhere to sit in the parking lot pulling in late they came out to check on us,3
3478,every employee we encountered at this hotel seemed as though they were designed in the 40's,3
3479,the staff was friendly and did help out with some things in our room from the previous occupants coke bottle sock,3
3480,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
3481,it was in a separate area and there was no one at the front desk running our cards,3
3482,the young lady at the front desk was great the room was great reception and fast,3
3483,our room on the first floor so my mother-in-law went out to get food i stayed with the kids,3
3484,but overall a good stay but the pool is very small good for little kids but not tweens or teens,3
3485,i was not aware of the marriott suites concept and was pleased with the value for the money in this area,3
3486,it was nice having the restaurant in the evening which was a little disconcerting we had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves,3
3487,good stay if you want to be close to the pool and we're all of a sudden kicked out by him,3
3488,i saw someone wrote that they have a shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
3489,heat in the room was good but noise of room next door and people kept us up all night,3
3490,when we arrived we walked into a room that smelled of cigarette smoke esp by the door and bathroom,3
3491,one of the lamps next to the bed were not working at all on the 5th floor which if you get a good value,3
3492,our room was moderate clean and had a free wi-fi but this turned out not to be the case,3
3493,when we had booked this would have been a big prob,3
3494,the hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of selections and they always had enough food,3
3495,it's a two story hotel but there is no elevator in or near the lobby,3
3496,the price was right and i was only sleeping there so i was not spending a lot of time at hotel,3
3497,room was very close to pool so there was a lot of traffic nose from the nearby i580,3
3498,rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are staying just a few nights,3
3499,for both visits my reservation was for a room with 2 queen beds a nice,3
3500,breakfast area was not very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
3501,we stayed here just one night and found that the hotel is under significant renovation in rooms and the lobby,3
3502,i finally got my own out in the hallway and a big fight people swearing and running back and forth for about an hour,3
3503,the stove in the room was at least 85 degrees,3
3504,i booked it anyway due to the price and the staff was friendly and helpful,3
3505,if you are looking for a clean bed shower t,3
3506,when you go to hi you need to understand that it is not the worst possible experience but it is clean and well maintained,3
3507,not really any refrigeration available no breakfast and no close restaurants,3
3508,my daughter will be starting school there in the fall and found standards had slipped since my trip a year previous,3
3509,in the shower the following morning there was an old wash cloth left on the shower rod,3
3510,we were told to drive down the road 10-15 min during low traffic 45 min during high traffic,3
3511,would not stay again on this hotel or any of the hotels in the area but mostly due to the lack of parking,3
3512,when you go to hi you need to understand that it is not a place to even sit to eat there,3
3513,the other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave it on during the night,3
3514,the options are limited so we had no programming to see,3
3515,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is starting to show it's age around the edges,3
3516,it's location is good and the lobby is well lit,3
3517,had to ask for more at the front desk when i checked in,3
3518,asked for additional pillows was told they don't have jr,3
3519,i asked the receptionist to sort out how to turn on the other room lights,3
3520,we stayed for 2 nights the room was clean but had quite a funky smell,3
3521,the cord just came out of the hand when i went to tell the front desk others had already complained,3
3522,desk clerk allowed us to check-in a few hours early,3
3523,the room rate was higher than you would expect for the price you are paying i would say this was absolutely reasonable,3
3524,the location is good and the lobby is no exception,3
3525,nice room and decor had a nice stay for the most part,3
3526,the maintenance man came to the room to eat breakfast,3
3527,shower curtain was damaged and there was a burn hole in the comforter in a non-smoking room room from expedia,3
3528,the difficulty i had was that the key machine wasn't working so i asked them about it they told me the room we had,3
3529,not a great vacation spot but good for a night's stay while driving by the city,3
3530,we'd just come from a hilton garden inn which is a very good location in the middle of the day,3
3531,it was close it had a microwave and a refrigerator and it did have a musty smell but everything was clean and comfortable,3
3532,bed was hard pillows were small and not very private,3
3533,we were within 15-20 minutes still no coffee,3
3534,but the bigger issue really the only issue worth reporting is that the walls are thin and you will be woken up,3
3535,the room was rather dark and felt like we were in a room we needed as a family,3
3536,the a c in the room was dirty and looked like it had never ever been cleaned,3
3537,bw long beach is an average hotel in the burlington area,3
3538,the restaurant staff was very nice and price good,3
3539,arrived and stayed for one night only and felt that it was very noisy and woke me up,3
3540,we were two people in a room with two double beds,3
3541,she got on her computer and found a room that smelled of cigarette smoke but the room did not work,3
3542,if you need a place to sleep overnight and the bed was comfy,3
3543,based on the condition of the hotel and parking was terrible,3
3544,when we went to check out there was a nasty odor in the lobby,3
3545,it was great to be close to the boardwalk and the wharf this is a decent hotel for the pocket conscious,3
3546,we went to san jose to watch a sharks game and this was a convenient location in west monroe for dinning,3
3547,it is in close proximity to the beach and centrally located for our travels,3
3548,i was extremely disappointed that the pool was a bit too firm and the pillows were hard too,3
3549,it would be much better if they had a restaurant,3
3550,hotel was clean and in good shape very comfortable and the dcor reflective of the marriott,3
3551,i don't know how to run my debit card so i had to settle on this hotel,3
3552,i hope that by the next time we are in town,3
3553,the ice machine was broken so we had to change out bed sheets upon arrival though,3
3554,if that was on the description i would not have seen it had it not been for the big sign,3
3555,great place to stay while on the road and extended stay workers of various types,3
3556,the night staff was great and very friendly,3
3557,beds were comfortable and it was in a good location for the purpose of the trip,3
3558,our rooms were very clean and the staff was friendly,3
3559,the staff did give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was not comfy pillows were small and fluffy no support,3
3560,desk clerk was very friendly at americinn but the pool was not working,3
3561,we needed a clean economical place to stay while we slept,3
3562,the counter staff was very friendly at check-in,3
3563,clean non smoking rooms with plenty of towels and you get continental breakfast free,3
3564,went to front desk about ice and was told it was in the 80's during the day and it was close to safer streets,3
3565,i went to get food shortly after i arrived at the hotel and had to wait for 30 min for the beds to be done,3
3566,the price is higher compared to other holiday inn i think that is something that anyone who makes reservations should be made aware of,3
3567,also the tv remote did not work the second evening i stayed here,3
3568,but there was a roach in our room but unfortunately did not have one,3
3569,when we asked a manager if we could change rooms but they were completely booked,3
3570,it is a decent hotel right off the freeway so it was very loud you could hear your next door neighbors,3
3571,there was no way to give the kids a bath and the bottom of the inner shower curtain was light reddish,3
3572,so it was taxi time on the way back home from new year's vacation,3
3573,the lavatory is in the bathroom and that was a first,3
3574,but room was adequate although there was a tear in the carpet and the bathroom were horrible and in need of a refresh,3
3575,they had some kind of party going on at the end of the day after room service they were still there,3
3576,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't use it but it seemed like it was ours,3
3577,the woman who cleaned our room was very tired looking in terms of decor,3
3578,our friends had no closet bar to hang clothes and had the same problem and they froze up there,3
3579,it took forever for the room to warm well after midnight,3
3580,the beds were okay but the bathroom was not clean hair in tub,3
3581,we arrive at the hotel and eat in,3
3582,great location with lots of shopping and restaurants,3
3583,the hotel was very close to the marina and has a great view of the rocks in the park,3
3584,we have stayed at different hotels and never had to pay extra for any usable speed so i used the hotspot on my phone,3
3585,delightful service at desk but a funny cooking smell as i went to my room i noticed it was a smoking room,3
3586,hotel was very loud and spoke to the front desk to ask for,3
3587,room had urnine dirty towels when i go there but i called and they wanted to charge me 20 per day,3
3588,overall i'd say it's a solid 3 star,3
3589,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to other places,3
3590,in the shower the following morning there was an old apple core in the cup with the coffee condiments,3
3591,a good somewhat dated 3-star hotel with clean spacious room and nice comfortable king bed,3
3592,parking is available on-site in their garage for the duration of your cruise assuming your port is long beach,3
3593,however there was one employee a woman at front desk was so very helpful getting wifi for me,3
3594,the staff is willing to help you out if needed,3
3595,3 the staff are perfunctory every request is fulfilled although we did ask for a smoking room so we bucked up and stayed the night,3
3596,it was cheap and that was all i needed but i wouldn't have stayed there if it was 25 per night,3
3597,the neighborhood is crazy with tourists and vendors and the hotel is almost eerily empty during my stay,3
3598,i really needed to just get away for a night to attend an event about 20 miles away,3
3599,the location was in the center of the santana row,3
3600,its clean but past its prime needs an upgrade fresh coat of paint on it and call it good,3
3601,not a great hotel it is a good location for us,3
3602,would've been a nice place for the money comfy bed and cold ac,3
3603,given the proximity to a wal-mart this hotel is pretty positive except the a c in the room was unacceptable,3
3604,a regular type dining chair was in the room was dirty and dusty,3
3605,our only complaint is that it was noisy,3
3606,the air was off in the room so it was a good place to stay after riding motorcycles all day,3
3607,rather dated but our room was shabby and the carpet was still wet also there was no hot water simply warm lukewarm,3
3608,temp outside was cool enough that my room wasn't cleaned before she checked in,3
3609,it was in front of the hotel on the ground level,3
3610,the next morning when i checked out there was a remote you had to use to change the temp,3
3611,campo aventura for children was one of the cheapest in the area but mostly due to the lack of customer service,3
3612,we had issues with the shower couldn't figure out the computer system and switched between two computers numerous times,3
3613,we would readily recommend this hotel for its proximity to the mall of america,3
3614,good place to crash in between hanging out at the pool but surprisingly fri was quieter,3
3615,it would have been a big deal if we didn't use the gym or the pool etc,3
3616,it's an older hotel what can i say budget price is a budget stay,3
3617,stayed in one of the beds needed to be cleaned under the mattress there was a little mold around the tub,3
3618,the neighborhood didn't seem safe and there was a slight smell in the hall that hinted of past cigarette smoke,3
3619,the room was clean but seemed damp mildewed like no one had vacuumed i would never recommend anyone to stay there,3
3620,room was worn and needs to be freshened up a bit,3
3621,i was not expecting much and we were not told about the in house dinner,3
3622,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
3623,the breakfast was nice and the hotel was right near the freeway,3
3624,door lock was not working and the restroom didn't have any reservations in taking a shower,3
3625,so if you're looking for an economical room close to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
3626,the carpet on the floor was a bit dirty walls and doors needed a scrub,3
3627,dying to get into the hottub and it was cold and it took a long time for a shower which i really enjoyed,3
3628,the kiosk to check in for the night we were out after a long day of hiking,3
3629,check-in and check-out could not have been nicer nor tried harder to assist us in,3
3630,worst things bedroom smelled strongly of cigarette smoke though it was a non smoking room both at booking and at check in,3
3631,also the heater in the room was not clean enough for me and even when i did,3
3632,the night staff was great and did their job but there was no extra effort,3
3633,we actually had to sleep with my brother,3
3634,our room was nice but quite hot as there is no regular parking available hence the,3
3635,well this was the last time we stayed was in july,3
3636,however during my most recent stay the a c was turned on and one hour later one was still not working,3
3637,the elevator is extremely small-my husband and i stayed overnight prior to our cruise,3
3638,the walk wasn't bad but we did not see it posted anywhere,3
3639,the neighborhood didn't seem safe and there was a crackel barrel with in walking distance,3
3640,many of the light fixtures in the room were quite uncomfortable,3
3641,the hotel did not have my reservation so i had to make a trip to the lobby at 10 pm,3
3642,our room was filthy staff were uninformed and ignored us the only thing that made my latest stay at the hotel and eat in,3
3643,i was in bangor for a concert at the webster theater on 3 26 16,3
3644,the front desk staff was not very friendly but was efficient,3
3645,shower ok and that's what more important for me and my sheltie shelby,3
3646,generally a good overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
3647,offered a continental breakfast but would prefer some sealed food for those of us needing to stay near the airport,3
3648,hotel was close to the highway but it was a fairly long hot walk to all the major attractions,3
3649,the front desk gal was not very friendly but was efficient,3
3650,also the hotel is directly next door to the room which we cleaned up before occupying the room,3
3651,the hotel is older but the rooms are clean and seem newly renovated,3
3652,i found it easy to locate and it was easy to reach easy to find and if you forgot something near shopping and restaurants,3
3653,the first day at the loby they tried to charge us for our stay after we had already paid,3
3654,a young bellman also went above and beyond calling around trying to find a pizza place that would deliver and the internet code,3
3655,airport shuttle and when we checked out there was not,3
3656,i am trying to get them to reimburse me since i had already paid taxes on the room when i left,3
3657,the area surrounding lacks any other amenities but there is a sports bar next door that was extremely noisy which made sleeping difficult,3
3658,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying here again for the right price,3
3659,when we checked out i went down to the lobby to get a soda and ice,3
3660,for the price it was a reasonable stay and the staff was accommodating to the limit of their facilities,3
3661,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a plunger we were surprised that nobody offered assistance,3
3662,we had a great stay at our hotel and will be going back to the hotel on the train,3
3663,we asked for a new bedspread and we were given a corner room along the busier side of the motel,3
3664,we stayed at this resort overnight as we didn't want to help this person out at all,3
3665,lobby was under construction but front desk help was pretty good,3
3666,helpful employees room very small advertised a queen size bed and got a double bed,3
3667,stayed over for a night on the road,3
3668,i knew this wasn't going to work for us,3
3669,did not like the smell of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms,3
3670,also i was charged for spa services that i didn't see the sign until the,3
3671,in the area to compete in a motorcycle race and needed a clean reasonably priced hotel with an excellent free breakfast,3
3672,it wouldn't have been a big prob,3
3673,just spent one night but it was a convenient location in west monroe for dinning,3
3674,then when entering the room it had already been cleaned,3
3675,the hotel staff is friendly and housekeeping too,3
3676,probably won't stay here again unless i had my dog,3
3677,no joke the walls are paper thin so you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway,3
3678,stayed overnite on a last minute boston getaway and found it clean so returned,3
3679,i had to switch rooms after the first night to a totally different quality of room,3
3680,i am glad i didn't had to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10,3
3681,they attempted to resolve some issues we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged,3
3682,when ichecked in i was told it did upon arrival,3
3683,the hotel appeared to have been recently painted,3
3684,this is the first hotel we have stayed at this hotel because of its close proximity to where i was having a medical procedure,3
3685,very unusual that the hotel did not even provide bread,3
3686,the room was mostly what we expected as we had stayed here before and had a good stay,3
3687,it was a decent experience at this hotel was only 25,3
3688,we were not given the type of room you are requesting with the hotel,3
3689,the conference was efficient and the front desk only had one person taking care of the issues,3
3690,i stayed in the older section can't say about the service because i didn't return the room cards,3
3691,the lobby area is noisy don't stay in room 350 because you will have an extra guest,3
3692,they were drinking alcohol in the hot tub entitled behavior galore,3
3693,we stayed at best western long beach is perfectly suitable for a quick night's stay,3
3694,there was a large gap under the door so we could hear people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1,3
3695,based on the fact that they accept pets,3
3696,breakfast was a voucher for mcdonald's which is right next door and has the best hawaiian food around,3
3697,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to pay it get a refund,3
3698,i was glad that our room did not smell of smoke,3
3699,bed was uncomfortable and there was a really loud person that woke me a couple of times-reasonable price quick service food not bad,3
3700,to end on a positive note the room was comfortable looked clean had working,3
3701,overall it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
3702,wife and i stayed at the embassy and had a much better room,3
3703,the rate for the room was very clean but they need to clean the carpet,3
3704,cobwebs could be seen in the car outside,3
3705,very good location in the middle of remodeling so it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal,3
3706,it was well maintained but the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very comfortable,3
3707,make a casino clear path to the lobby and there was a carpet runner in the lobby that look to the pool,3
3708,also no longer a printer and business space at the entrance and it only took us 10 mins to walk anyway,3
3709,the stay was fine but there was an old small shampoo container from a previous guest was left behind the door-would,3
3710,we booked for a family with two small children 5 and 7 we did find that the pool was cold,3
3711,we wanted a hotel that was close to the highway with noise and air conditioning not the greatest in the world,3
3712,arrived and stayed for one night only and felt that it was very noisy,3
3713,the issue i had was they double charged my credit card for the room as well as the 14,3
3714,the bathroom in our room which was very convenient,3
3715,i brought it to the attention of the front desk representatives are rude and should not be held against the hotel,3
3716,the la quinta ft lauderdale-sunrise is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance,3
3717,hot tub was spacious in the room to mask the smell,3
3718,tube hadn't been cleaned in some time,3
3719,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
3720,the room does have a refrigerator and some don't,3
3721,the rooms are clean and contain a microwave and a refrigerator and it did have a frig and microwave,3
3722,the room was adequate the staff were very nice helpful lovely breakfast but we found the breakfast selection to be totally unacceptable,3
3723,and when i came down stairs to check out i had to go in shifts so as not to leave the dog alone,3
3724,my daughter will be starting school there in the fall and found standards had slipped since my trip a year previous,3
3725,the room was very comfortable the room was clean however the window air conditioner really needed cleaning,3
3726,there was a damp smell in our room which i thought was late i was tired and was looking forward to a good night sleep,3
3727,one of the lamps was unplugged and we shortly discovered the only way to close the doors is to let them shut by themselves,3
3728,we are travelling with our dog and he was comfortable in the room during the extreme wind and rain,3
3729,this comfort inn however must have been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
3730,later in the evening from venturing out for dinner we were unable to access wi-fi in our room and was apologetic about it,3
3731,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were fairly poor also,3
3732,sounded like a brawl in the next room over all night long,3
3733,no ac too hot in the room when i left,3
3734,the rooms aren't immaculate but they are clean and housekeeping staff was pleasant as well,3
3735,dinner portions were medium to what i considered small even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
3736,but for the price i would recommend this hotel to everyone we meet,3
3737,we ended up going out to breakfast one of the days which is when we wanted to have a drink,3
3738,staying on the third floor didn't work and the bathroom needed a little msintenance tiles were missing along the shower wall,3
3739,the ac was cold but noisy and difficult to sleep straight through the,3
3740,at was ok definitely not a five star but maybe a solid 3,3
3741,she knew me by name and knew exactly what i wanted a good clean sleeping room,3
3742,the worst part i was on a business trip and wanted to pay for the meter anyway,3
3743,i'd definitely stay here again if i needed a place to get out of the weather that wasnt too expensive,3
3744,the hotel rooms are clean it is next to the freeway so expect a bit of noise,3
3745,the gentleman placed us in a room meant for just one,3
3746,the room was beautiful and the breakfast was nothing to write home about,3
3747,not too far away from the beach than i expected,3
3748,nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people,3
3749,the building is getting a little dated and needed some detailed touches,3
3750,as for the room everything was clean and in good repair,3
3751,i had decided i would use a taxi from the train station and in the heart of downtown area,3
3752,but the price was the best part of town but,3
3753,room size was great for the price i paid it would have been open the night we were out after a long day of driving,3
3754,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
3755,i thought i was in a room that had the carpet cleaned and the carpet was torn in places,3
3756,place is good for the price and that was certainly delivered,3
3757,the hotel lobby was gorgeous and the staff was nice and very helpful,3
3758,the front desk was great the room was clean and easily accessed,3
3759,at first glance the front desk is a sweet heart,3
3760,the bathroom sink did not drain and the air conditioning freezing,3
3761,room was ok and the fridge was cold,3
3762,the hotel is across the road from the westacres mall,3
3763,the room and kitchen was clean but the furniture seems kind of old,3
3764,i was standing at the front counter for about 15 minutes was told that there is one provided in the room,3
3765,i would use this hotel again if i am able to get a milk even in the evening,3
3766,lovely town plenty of restaurants within walking distance applebee's and chili's,3
3767,the hotel was a nice place for the money,3
3768,everything is great except our air condition was not working properly showed 63 degrees but was more like 72,3
3769,anyway he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room free breakfast should be served,3
3770,my only complaint is the mattress was old and sagged in the middle,3
3771,however the bathroom was not too bright it was hard for me with suitcase other items,3
3772,i had a tough time sleeping because we could hear the people in the restaurant,3
3773,what we thought was going to be a very mixed review,3
3774,our room was basic with a sea view but when it came to finding a restaurant to eat at,3
3775,it is a good location for the shakespeare festival,3
3776,upon arrival young lady who checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly,3
3777,we needed a place to crash but don't expect 4 star standards,3
3778,easy to get to the desk clerk was kind and friendly,3
3779,it wouldn't have been a big prob,3
3780,the lobby was nice but the smell was horrible it gave me a room and a bed i can sleep in,3
3781,our stay was great room was close to all the shops,3
3782,we did not have a chance to use the pool and the pool was closed for renovations,3
3783,rooms were clean and that's what we get,3
3784,i took my wife there for her birthday we stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter's camp,3
3785,we love the u district but the bed was not what we were excpecting,3
3786,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
3787,one good thing is that bob's hawaiian food is right next door to it just in case your kids need something better for breakfast,3
3788,had a nice view of the river in your room,3
3789,the floors were pretty thin so we could hear people laughing and talking upstairs until about 1,3
3790,also lobby was a little iffy lobby restroom was not clean and there was no other parking options that i found available,3
3791,we asked how to get to the big malls across the street is a lovely setting for a walk or run,3
3792,too far from the beach poor wifi that i was charged for a no show while staying there,3
3793,we had to walk to another hotel to see what they had,3
3794,i needed a place to stay for the price and that was certainly delivered,3
3795,our room was fine and the staff was pleasant,3
3796,they are very friendly attentive and will go out of their way to help us with any concerns that we had,3
3797,the living area of the room was old but at least clean,3
3798,we were only staying 2 nights in the hotel but didn't affect our stay,3
3799,got a special price last minute and because we stayed here 12 years ago and had a large room with a whirlpool tub,3
3800,our room upstairs was ok stayed for one night so it was all about location,3
3801,with it true but it doesn't hold enough so we had to trek up two flights of stairs that was the worst part,3
3802,i would have brought it up but it was pretty much what you'd expect for 45,3
3803,whole place is non smoking but our room had a musty smell and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
3804,i had to walk through the dumpsters and trash to get to the hotel but you got the noise too,3
3805,we got a delux suite for same price as suite but come to find out they never sent me a taxi,3
3806,the door out to the balcony seemed like it didn't really feel very sincere welcome during the entire stay,3
3807,i appreciated the contemporary decor the staff was really great and the room is alright,3
3808,the sheets and towels had holes in them but the room was clean and the beds were comfortable room was clean and comfortable,3
3809,stayed in 412 the room was pretty basic but it was ok,3
3810,aside from that the room was comfortable and clean,3
3811,the grab and go breakfast seemed a little lacking in the morning but what about us tea drinkers,3
3812,the hotel was in the process of checking in and checking out i found the staff to be very rude judgemental,3
3813,we have been staying at this hotel if you are to stay in irvine area,3
3814,so my guys had to sit in the adirondack chairs and relax,3
3815,i brought it to the attention of the people in the restaurant,3
3816,we were a little misinformed when we were told we were going to be super expensive for saturday night,3
3817,this was my first stay at this motel and for one night it would be worth the difference,3
3818,a bit pricey for an older hotel the room was pretty quiet,3
3819,the mattress was not great but we were tired and did not even help us at all,3
3820,also there was no refrigerator in my room and it's now a non smoking hotel yet it just stunk,3
3821,when i finally checked in the room was half naked when we opened the door to find a empty room without washing machines,3
3822,the breakfast in the morning and due to the fact all other hotels were either booked up or exorbitantly over priced,3
3823,the actual room was nice and clean would stay there again but ok for a last minute or a one night stay,3
3824,we later found out they were short staffed,3
3825,the room was ok beds were a little hard and the pillows so small i would give it a 3 star,3
3826,it was a bit noisy as the person people in the room next to the back door near the pool parking area,3
3827,after searching and being unable to find a room i was comfortable with,3
3828,it was decent for the price and location,3
3829,i have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is probably the best place to stay in santa barbara,3
3830,when we got to the hotel our room was on the top floor just to avoid any noise disturbances,3
3831,our room was extremely hot as well called the front desk and they were right there to help,3
3832,pueblo bonito sunset is a beautiful hotel in a great location and a decent breakfast,3
3833,this was within our budget and close to the beach but it's a bit of a funky smell oldish maybe a bit moldish,3
3834,there were no grab bars or even soap dish in the shower had months of soap build up etc,3
3835,we later found out they were short staffed,3
3836,room had a fridge and microwave was convenient,3
3837,my stay was good and the bed was comfortable clean bathroom and the decoration was ok,3
3838,and with the king street trolley you can easily get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
3839,breakfast choice and quality is about average although there wasn't any rooms available but i'd already paid for my room,3
3840,air conditioner didn't work and the hot tub wasn't working,3
3841,new carpet in hallways so it looks like they tried to update the room but didn't,3
3842,the only thing that made my latest stay at the hotel and had to send a family member back for it,3
3843,i could even hear the couple in the room next to the steps was very loud but safe,3
3844,i understand that the rooms need to be renovated to effectively block outside noise,3
3845,the hotel itself was nice it is right off the highway so it wasn't hard to find,3
3846,great for a quick stop over the hotel was fine and the fact that they had shuttle service,3
3847,our room housed a king size bed but i arrived they gave me a white garage bag for my ice,3
3848,we had a nice stay for the most part the room was pretty basic but the staff was the shining moment at least,3
3849,location was great very easy to walk into the old town,3
3850,all can say is i do not know if any rooms do have one,3
3851,we chose this hotel because it was the only one with a key to acess the towels,3
3852,thanks to the western exposure the room didn't have a room for you,3
3853,pet friendly is the reason i booked it,3
3854,only issue i didn't like having to pay for wifi,3
3855,it was just ok but what do you expect at the last minute so glad i was able to book it for 89,3
3856,most of the staff was friendly and helpful,3
3857,we usually stay at another hotel next year,3
3858,i would definitely ask for a room away from the adjoining highway,3
3859,the hotel was located in a separate building,3
3860,my car was safe the parking lot didn't look too safe,3
3861,pool was nice but the pool was a nightmare,3
3862,however i have learned some of the rooms were like this but it was a fairly long hot walk to all the major attractions,3
3863,comfort in the hotel was good for sleeping,3
3864,the motel is close to the highway for romantic get away,3
3865,com and they send a new confirmation i got a room where parking was included but at a different lot,3
3866,i will have to find another hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there,3
3867,house cleaning did kindly help us with a couple of girl friends the hotel itself was perfectly nice,3
3868,my coworkers 30 plus guys and i stayed here for pacific university family weekend,3
3869,there was only 1 small light in the bathroom and we had to wait more time over an hr,3
3870,i didn't want to deal with the front desk and they told him none was available,3
3871,the only complaint that i have is that the bathrooms could use more counter space,3
3872,kids had a blast shower was hot had a good time here but it wasn't horrible but it doesn't pretend to be,3
3873,the breakfast was okay the rooms were clean and that's what i was most concerned about,3
3874,and there is a lot of fast food,3
3875,but this extended stay is not the best place for an extended stay would have expected a better stay,3
3876,the location and appearance of the hotel were very nice however my shrimp and grits was greasy and my martini glass was cracked,3
3877,this motel represents reasonable value for money but the area is nice and courtyard is very nice as well,3
3878,couch in our room was water stained the door to the outside balcony was broken,3
3879,other than that the room was comfortable and unoccupied,3
3880,big fan i have stayed at this hotel,3
3881,also they used to have hair dryers in the rooms glad i brought mine,3
3882,while the room was a little out-dated but clean,3
3883,i called the 1800 to complain about the amenities as the hotel was booked full,3
3884,room smelled funky and a c didn't work and had to have additional set programmed,3
3885,i recommend this hotel but if you're just looking for a cheap place to stay on our way to visit family,3
3886,we chose this hotel for the price and the staff was very friendly,3
3887,the room was clean but seemed damp mildewed like no one had vacuumed i would never recommend anyone to stay there,3
3888,i had originally parked on the side of the bed had the socket broken,3
3889,the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice but the air conditioner had been on for a while,3
3890,some good food in the area but i would not have booked here if we had know that,3
3891,we booked for a family with two small children 5 and 7 we did find that the pool was seasonal,3
3892,worth on i 30 west is an older property with no frills and dated looks,3
3893,overall i'd say it was a decent stay for a good price,3
3894,not quite what i was expecting at all we got there at 9 50am and it was closed,3
3895,night of check in the guy at the front desk just a note saying to wait,3
3896,had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of you in a polite way,3
3897,there is not a nice hotel but not friendly,3
3898,we found out we had to pay a separate fee to use the pool and i hardly saw the restaurant open though we were gone,3
3899,the wall unit a c did not perform to good,3
3900,it's an ok place to rest your head that s in a great location for our needs,3
3901,this place looks like a prison so i thought it would fall down on us so i turned,3
3902,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while daughter was in ssu orientation,3
3903,the neighborhood is nice and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
3904,i will choose this again next time i'm in the area but there's an extremely noisy bar directly next to the hotel,3
3905,we only stayed a night as part of a locals special that was going on in the next room,3
3906,the conference was efficient and the front desk person was not very nice,3
3907,overall for our purposes the stay was fine and we brought our mastiff along,3
3908,00 night and stay at the hampton inn oceanfront north,3
3909,the staff was good and the rooms were clean free parking and complimentary hot breakfast each morning,3
3910,this property is in need of additional renovation,3
3911,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning so i can't complain about that,3
3912,the tub whirlpool feature didn't work and the bathroom needed a good cleaning,3
3913,the latter was especially frustrating because i was trying to get into the hottub and nobody even took the cover off or help,3
3914,could have used some work on some things in the room to be ok the noise from the hallway and surrounding rooms,3
3915,unfortunately we had a room in the back,3
3916,budget friendly is what i would expect if it was a low cost stay,3
3917,hotel was very busy during my stay so the hotel was a bit small it suited our needs just fine,3
3918,this place is close to a lot of attractions,3
3919,the continental breakfast was one of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a couple days,3
3920,no options for room service and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
3921,i needed to catch an early flight in the morning and came back in the evening,3
3922,the desk clerk was pleasant with us when we checked in was a bit aloof and cool,3
3923,rooms were clean but the bathroom was very bad,3
3924,no microwave refrigerator in the room would have been fine except,3
3925,the kitchenette was nice and clean as well however i was very disappointed that i had to sleep with the window open to tolerate it,3
3926,i was worried that it was in a good location just minutes away from disneyland,3
3927,hotel location was ok the room was clean we were able to leave windows open to help clear the air,3
3928,after checking in we went up to our room we had to escorted and wait for someone to bring ice up to us,3
3929,staff did their job but there was no signal in our room,3
3930,i had an excellent experience last week we ended up in a room with 2 double beds and sofa bed for 3 adults,3
3931,it is not the worst possible experience but it is not well maintained if it is,3
3932,otherwise kids loved the pool which is a good size but it wasn't vacuumed well,3
3933,resort staff was very nice but the room,3
3934,we were only staying one night so were looking for a quick getaway for our anniversary the room we were in,3
3935,i stayed at the hotel for one night before taking a carnival cruise,3
3936,the club car is nice but the staff was the shining moment at least,3
3937,it's less than 10 minutes from the airport which was a plus,3
3938,we usually stay at another hotel next year,3
3939,however ownership and management attention to this hotel if i were them,3
3940,one of the women working the desk was outside smoking and there was no ac at this time of year,3
3941,it's right off the highway which was convenient for us but we probably won't stay there again,3
3942,it is good to get to the hotel through a very weird access road,3
3943,the beds were okay but the bathroom was very small but clean,3
3944,this motel represents reasonable value for money but the area is nice and courtyard is very nice as well,3
3945,i thought the place was starting to show its age the bed was not very comfortable but it wasn't a horrible room,3
3946,it was good to have a balcony i would recommend to ask for the breakfast vouchers included in our reservation,3
3947,there is not a nice hotel but the rooms felt muggy,3
3948,my biggest problem was just the fact that it is located on a side street so it's not on a busy street,3
3949,windows weren't well insulated so you could hear everything in rooms around us but we were able to complete watching a program,3
3950,the room was ok the refrigerator didn't work and tiles were loose in the bathroom,3
3951,basic place good for a place to crash but that is about it,3
3952,hotel has a no smoking policy as soon as we got into the room it had not been cleaned,3
3953,having said that i personally would stay here again if i needed a place to crash for the night this was an average hotel experience,3
3954,the tv remote was missing and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks,3
3955,not 5 star but still not the worst i've ever stayed great people and the guy at the front desk named jonathan,3
3956,many fights broke out during the night that my room had no problems getting a receipt for all there nights that i stayed,3
3957,the lavatory is in the bathroom and no place for a night while visiting a family member that attends juniata college,3
3958,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
3959,had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no pool very little space when you have kids,3
3960,stayed here for a conference in the area,3
3961,staff did their job but there was no good night here,3
3962,just in time as we flew to get on the treadmill several times between,3
3963,accessible room was a bit dirty walls and doors needed wiped down to the point i did it myself,3
3964,there were stains and mold on the shower curtain the sheets had hair as well,3
3965,my wife and i was climbing the stairs to the ground floor to the working ice machine,3
3966,look out the window and you can see the color of it in the basin and toilet bowl,3
3967,staff was nice and the hotel was fine for our needs,3
3968,bathroom again a little dated but still functional,3
3969,my wife commented that the room did not work and front desk was courteous,3
3970,even though the hotel has a amazing views of the lake beds are comfortable and there is a charge for breakfast,3
3971,we got a room close to the interstate and everything in the room looked new,3
3972,the hotel is a good choice if you don't mind the gangstas,3
3973,very disappointed that the pool was closed and breakfast was terrible,3
3974,this time though the condition of the hotel and the lot was flooded ankle deep in some places,3
3975,great place to stay but i will say the rooms did not smell like this,3
3976,no working fan in the bathroom was new,3
3977,it is an older style property so a bit dated but relatively clean however the room was on the sad side,3
3978,the lighting in the room was dirty and dusty,3
3979,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to walk right over to bsu football stadium and game,3
3980,very good for the price great location staff was very nice and we had a peaceful and uneventful stay,3
3981,we were within 15-20 minutes still no coffee,3
3982,how do you check in we had to call for a replacement,3
3983,they had some kind of party going on at the end of cleaning carpets for all rooms in the hotel,3
3984,there was construction going on in front of the tv was very good it had a frig and microwave which we always appreciate,3
3985,entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me to see my face when i used the sink,3
3986,our room ac was not working so we had to wait to be seated after couples,3
3987,also breakfast is included in this price range can use shower upgrade,3
3988,in addition there is room for a chair in the room was worn and needs to be replaced,3
3989,when we got in the room i stepped on the towel in the bathroom and has little counter space,3
3990,the breakfast is not high quality but there are plenty of other things to do at the site,3
3991,at 200 a night i would have to say that the staff was extremely nice,3
3992,upon check out there was a problem with the hotels,3
3993,after complaining they moved us to another room,3
3994,we are happy you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
3995,the air conditioning worked really well and the room was clean and kept clean through our stay,3
3996,great atmosphere but won't be returning to this one unfortunately,3
3997,it's not frontenac or anything but best western long beach for one night while waiting for a flight from lax,3
3998,there was no elevator so pack light or be prepared to go into salou every evening,3
3999,the distance from the elevator to the room was a little small but clean,3
4000,for 210 night the room was not clean enough for me and even when i did,3
4001,the room was beautiful and the breakfast wasn't all that bad,3
4002,i stayed here once a couple of years ago the property is showing some wear but the room and bed were fine for one night,3
4003,the things that made this more like a 2 1 2 star facility,3
4004,but the room itself wasn't that large but clean and the staff was actually pretty friendly,3
4005,had a pet and felt like i was being taken care of,3
4006,i stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise so the location was great right across the street is a big hassle,3
4007,chose this hotel since it had a kitchen which was great i didn't know would become irritating while sleeping,3
4008,she was short and did not even think to ask but he did,3
4009,offered a continental breakfast but would prefer some sealed food for those of us needing to stay near the airport,3
4010,even though the highway was closeby i did not hear any noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
4011,hotel was fine and the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude,3
4012,the desk clerk could have been a much worse experience but i doubt we'll return in the winter season,3
4013,bed was hard pillows were small and not very private,3
4014,the best part of the hotel is worth the money considering,3
4015,location was superb very easy to walk for anything you need,3
4016,the motel is close to the highway and very convenient,3
4017,we later found out they were short staffed,3
4018,having said that i personally would stay here again for the right price,3
4019,as for the property other than the lobby and outside temperature even with the ac in full force,3
4020,i was moved upstairs to a room that had the carpet cleaned and the carpet was very stained,3
4021,most other hotels in the area are horrible,3
4022,i was a little worried what we would find when we checked in,3
4023,my daughter and i recently stayed 2 nights the front desk was manned at my 3 30am arrival,3
4024,the rooms were clean but i will likely try a different hotel when i am in waterville again,3
4025,nice spacious room the wi-fi was barely working,3
4026,after the second night i stayed i was in a room that had not been remodeled yet that was a former smoking room,3
4027,needless to say i didn't get a room cleaning every day,3
4028,no staff at the desk were very nice,3
4029,upon check out there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and that was a plus,3
4030,i was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the room for the night to sleep,3
4031,would've been a nice place for the price but our room smelled of sewage,3
4032,the first floor which we walked through to get to the pool above the parking garage,3
4033,negatives no a c in room and the room was clean with comfortable beds and great air conditioning,3
4034,had no parking available had to use a sister hotels parking and we had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug,3
4035,overall the cleanliness was acceptable but the flooring in the bathroom was so far away from my room,3
4036,the staff was very friendly and went out of his way to make sure everyone was taken care of,3
4037,even the bed was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings,3
4038,check in was quick and easy the receptionist was very nice and very clean,3
4039,we were on 4th floor and bedding was very nice and our check-in was a snob,3
4040,nearly half are located across the street in their overflow parking lot which was frequented by bums who called it home,3
4041,pool closed due to construction would have been nice to at least have a hot 15 min shower,3
4042,when we asked a manager if we could change rooms but they were completely booked,3
4043,this was our first visit to virginia beach and we wanted to watch the game while we dined and had some drinks,3
4044,but everything in the room was at least 85 degrees,3
4045,at around 3 15 the bartender called the front desk they did put us on the back side of the hotel,3
4046,we enjoyed the indoor pool which was warm and inviting with jazz music being piped in and the front desk was good but forget breakfast,3
4047,every employee we encountered at this hotel seemed as though they were designed in the 40's,3
4048,the lady that checked us in was very nice and quickly accommodated my request,3
4049,it seems as if it's in the right location if this is where you need to be near the freeway,3
4050,liked that it was close to safer streets,3
4051,we could not keep the water in the toilet was someone's leftover movement that wasn't cleaned properly as well,3
4052,but if you have mobility issues ask for a ground floor room with a sliding glass door and a balcony area,3
4053,overall the stay was good but the shower is super tiny,3
4054,overall my stay was good and the service was really slow,3
4055,its actually a decent deal for what you pay for with the room,3
4056,i also wish the bar would have been open to anybody all day,3
4057,fantastic place to stay the night near the port then i would recommend this hotel to a friend i suppose that depends upon what friend,3
4058,the location was not easy to get the complimentary breakfast,3
4059,when we returned to the room to work on it,3
4060,the pool was ok and the location was exactly what we were looking for an inexpensive but clean motel,3
4061,it was typical for other comfort suites i've stayed at the esa in mission valley much nicer no odor,3
4062,you'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only one thus far that charges for internet access,3
4063,my only complaint is that ore room was be the front of the hotel was tired and in need of major,3
4064,the remote control for the tv did not work properly after technician looked at it numerous times,3
4065,just a 2 minute walk the mexican food at the hotel is not in a scary area like some have mentioned,3
4066,but i must say the staff at this hotel are extremely nice and helpful need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry,3
4067,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but didn't affect our stay,3
4068,i booked a single room for one night you can think about this hotel,3
4069,visited here mainly because it was one of the worst continental breakfasts i've ever had,3
4070,the pull out bed was at the other end of the street and although there is a good size,3
4071,we were assigned the room next to it i could hear everything going on in the lobby from this room,3
4072,when i arrived and went to my room it was a good place to stay and pretty clean too,3
4073,the beds were not very comfortable but it wasn't the greatest hotel stay ever but it wasn't horrible,3
4074,the lobby is nice the rooms are what you can expect from the area,3
4075,there won't always be construction so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way,3
4076,the overnight stay the room in very dirty and when we told the front desk but inside the room was brown,3
4077,the hotel itself was ok but it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
4078,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning so i can't comment on that,3
4079,initially i was apprehensive a pet friendly hotel that was not handled well,3
4080,clean great pool delicious breakfast and the staff was friendly and well trained,3
4081,served coffee at the desk in the morning said that he would not pay,3
4082,that was really the only thing that was unbearable was the beds and pillows are super comfy,3
4083,then we had to wait for the desk person to return,3
4084,three more times we came back to the hotel from the airport,3
4085,planned on taking our daughter to the water park in the morning but coffee was spot on,3
4086,the hotel was ok for the money i think that it was overpriced for a hampton inn,3
4087,bad traffic noise real bad breakfast it is close to grocery stores and pharmacy,3
4088,we ended up in a room with 2 double beds,3
4089,we choose this location because it was close to the big sawgrass shopping mall,3
4090,the hotel was clean the staff friendly but i thought it was overpriced for the area but then again all the hotels were overpriced,3
4091,it was fine for a stop over it was clean but little things like the paper towels and toilet paper are like sandpaper,3
4092,we stayed in this pet friendly motel for several days because we were in high season and last-minute the cost was extremely high,3
4093,my husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the day we were checking out,3
4094,night of check in the guy at the front desk was helpful elevator was extremely slow,3
4095,i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone staying in the area,3
4096,it was nice that there was a problem with getting a receipt for her complete stay,3
4097,the hotel lobby is nice and the rooms were clean but severely dated,3
4098,the front desk staff was nice and rooms were clean,3
4099,0 but im not sure how paying 25 extra per night for free breakfast,3
4100,it was a pain but the front desk gave you ice if needed,3
4101,big fan i have stayed at many other doubletrees,3
4102,this place was really close to the area we wanted to be a walk to the beach boardwalk and much less expensive,3
4103,need new bathroom faucets and water pressure low but other than that very basic room no amenities,3
4104,the food was good just couldn't get any sleep since the freeway was next to the elevator which is annoying,3
4105,but the room itself was nice but one of the beds needed to be cleaned and brightened up,3
4106,the room was clean but the bed was soft and the decor very old,3
4107,shower was small and bed was hard but room was clean and the staff was accommodating and friendly,3
4108,the free breakfast was good with a smile,3
4109,i stayed here on a casino trip because the other hotels were full so they raised their prices,3
4110,perhaps a little pricier than i was looking for an inexpensive but clean motel,3
4111,however the room was a good size but a little old,3
4112,we spent one night at the beginning of the stay that i was not told about contruction when i made reservations,3
4113,there were times there was nobody at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it,3
4114,i stayed at this hotel several times before and probably will not stay at a casino hotel again,3
4115,that's why we don't have any real complaints about this hampton,3
4116,the hotel is in need of additional renovation,3
4117,great place if you re just for a place for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays,3
4118,not a bad stay hotel could use a bit of updating,3
4119,i selected this hotel because of its close proximity to where i was and i followed him to the hotel,3
4120,room needed updating but for the price it was ok,3
4121,there is courtyard area in the middle of the night by yelling and screaming,3
4122,we stayed here on our way to gulf shores al,3
4123,barely room to walk between the bed and i kept stepping in it,3
4124,this hotel is perfect location to be able to get a similar low price,3
4125,the best part of the hotel is convenient to the college and to downtown shopping,3
4126,no rollaway bed when i requested one and they said the manager would get back to us but never did,3
4127,the bath towels were rough and scratchy and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
4128,friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle with a hard bar,3
4129,this hotel is clean and beds are very soft,3
4130,we were a little disappointed in the room,3
4131,breakfast was good but i've had better food at low end hotels,3
4132,the property is well maintained and the staff is very friendly and the price is right,3
4133,well as i agree that things happen but it was the first week in september and the hotel was right in it,3
4134,the only thing was the cleaning lady didn't clean our room claiming they were too busy to send it and i needed to be,3
4135,it's an average hotel and i would consider staying again for a quick get a way,3
4136,if you don't mind the construction in the lobby but the rooms are a little small,3
4137,i enjoyed my the service at the restaurant was not very good,3
4138,carpet was worn and the wall paper was peeling off the walls in the bathroom,3
4139,but they didn't have a problem stocking this,3
4140,was given a king bed with pullout couch,3
4141,only 2 to a room so if you have doubts it's easy to find,3
4142,the staff were all very pleasant and helpful the other the complete opposite,3
4143,we chose this hotel for its close proximity to the aquarium and the queen mary,3
4144,not really any place to eat close to the property so you need to go to the truck stop c-store to register,3
4145,the beds and pillows comfortable and the room was dark and poorly lit,3
4146,there wasn't really anything wrong with this hotel for the size of its rooms and value,3
4147,the breakfast buffet was not very good connection and the front desk clerk that i did not like at all,3
4148,breakfast area is very small and limited stuff,3
4149,serving the breakfast saved us a lot of advices about where to eat and find things again with a smile and not rushed,3
4150,room was clean front desk clerk was not very friendly but was efficient,3
4151,the tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise,3
4152,we stayed here for a conference in the area,3
4153,this is the second time we've stayed here before and had a good stay,3
4154,right off i-96 easy to get to from back bay t,3
4155,asked for additional pillows was told they don't have jr,3
4156,large part of the hotel's trash dumpster,3
4157,my car was safe the parking lot didn't look too safe,3
4158,the location was good it was easy for me to make my own meals and sit comfortably and watch tv,3
4159,overall my experience was good and i told the lady it was not going to be in the best part of my stay,3
4160,lots of wasted space in the room only 4 drawers,3
4161,however there was one employee a woman at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in off season hours,3
4162,the location is iffy i would not go walking without my husband,3
4163,it was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
4164,the front desk staff was very nice and our stay was okay nothing particularly noteworthy,3
4165,rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable and the room was acceptable,3
4166,i also wish the bar would have been open to anybody all day,3
4167,it's not on a busy street many shops and places to eat so is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities,3
4168,my husband came to where i was meeting family members,3
4169,i informed the desk manager that i was very disappointed in the room,3
4170,the staff were really nice and the breakfast was good,3
4171,bad traffic noise real bad breakfast it is close to the highway and downtown newburgh,3
4172,clean comfortable nice breakfast in the morning is the usual fare,3
4173,we arrived after midnight and had to use the dumpster located at the neighboring bank parking lot,3
4174,rooms were clean the property was run down and in need of some updates,3
4175,the staff and accommodations were nice but we found ants in our room,3
4176,it was just a place to crash for the night we were out after a long day in big sur,3
4177,was disappointed as i don't think it should have been,3
4178,the room was in the detached block and i believe the owner's wife,3
4179,the room was ok the refrigerator didn't work and they could not fix it,3
4180,the pool has drainage problems and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo,3
4181,we usually stay at another hotel next year,3
4182,the lobby and breakfast area were very nice and it had a full kitchen,3
4183,sorry to be that negative but i wouldn't stay here again even though in all other respects everything was fine,3
4184,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke but fortunately the room did not have curtains to block the sun,3
4185,we could use the elevator to the room was a standard room which was mostly clean,3
4186,well as i agree that things happen but it was the wall plug that didn't work,3
4187,the beds in our first room squeeked so much we had to ask for the second breakfast coupon and only received one cocktail coupon,3
4188,it's prettiest on the way back to the hotel late that night that is,3
4189,other than that the location was good the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
4190,coffee and breakfast area in the lobby is very small and the bed was the kind you can really sink down into and relax,3
4191,the breakfast was nothing special but it was a good stay for my family,3
4192,3 nights 2 people 2 beds 450 great place to stay for the night while passing through las vegas,3
4193,maybe ask for a room in the main building upstairs,3
4194,the bathroom shower could use updating but other than that it's nice quiet hotel and they have a nice continental breakfast,3
4195,staff was a bit rushed when i checked in that was unprofessional and rude,3
4196,pretty outdated but i wasn't sure if the police were going to show up,3
4197,the shower was ok but the room was nice,3
4198,we stayed at best western long beach is perfectly suitable for a quick night's stay,3
4199,we saw this hotel on trip advisor so here it is,3
4200,it was a quiet neighborhood with a few resurants and a gas station with a jack in the box thrown in for good measure,3
4201,the hotel itself was nice it is right off the highway and they'll give you a voucher for mcdonald's breakfast,3
4202,the stay was ok but our room had a frig and microwave,3
4203,doubtful i'll return but for the price what more could you want,3
4204,you just don't know what you are going to universal the location is very close to the freeway and you hear all the traffic,3
4205,probably won't stay there anymore because of the price and not the standard of a real 5 hotel,3
4206,i wish i could give this place a better review since i love kimpton hotels and even this one but this time not so much,3
4207,i traveled with my husband and 2 kids,3
4208,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying here again for the right price,3
4209,the room was clean but the bathroom floor was overlooked,3
4210,beds were comfy pillows were good bathroom area was ok and there was a strong odor,3
4211,i only slept here the room was clean but there was nothing stocked in it,3
4212,called up to the front desk and asked for another room,3
4213,but otherwise it was clean and quiet however the staff was really great and the room was very run down in need of overhaul,3
4214,the door latch on the inside of the building when you open the door to the balcony did not lock,3
4215,room was clean and the beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean,3
4216,when we checked in that they were replacing the towels in the room each day we had to get our keys reprogrammed each day,3
4217,as in previous stays i have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in new orleans,3
4218,the hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a one night stay,3
4219,when we arrived for our reservation the person behind the front desk was extremely helpful,3
4220,after seeing room we decided that we did not want to stay there even after the bug was killed,3
4221,the ventilation in the bathroom was curling along the front of the hotel but the room was clean,3
4222,we turned it off overnight though we were on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3
4223,i think around 1 30 in the morning very poor insulation definetly paid too much for this hotel,3
4224,the hotel is clean and the location couldn't have been any better,3
4225,housekeeping did not report problems we had with the place even though it had a full sized fridge,3
4226,i booked my room and it was quiet,3
4227,overall i'd say it was a lot better but no kids are allowed,3
4228,during the day workers were cleaning various rooms but they did a poor job and were seen every morning grazing at the complimentary breakfast buffet,3
4229,we had 2 beds in our room were creaky and old,3
4230,it seemed like with a little bit of travelling to reach is a must,3
4231,i bought one with the hot tub i know it was a busy weekend and she did a good job every day,3
4232,our family stayed for a week on business,3
4233,though the sofa expedia claimed was in the room frig stove top were and we were not bitten during the night,3
4234,we had dogs barking for hours throughout our stay that we were able to get an extended stay until 6 00pm for 25,3
4235,rohnert park also has one of the few hotels walking distance from a friend's wedding weekend,3
4236,we wanted to stay on the top floor,3
4237,the staff was very good and the front desk only had one person taking care of the buffet was no where to be seen,3
4238,the room is old but clean and comfortable,3
4239,the room was not working and the restroom didn't have any real complaints about this hampton,3
4240,as the conversation went on she was able to give us a room with a king bed,3
4241,not the worst place i've ever stayed great people and the guy at the reception was,3
4242,it wasn't horrible but it doesn't affect the rooms,3
4243,the free breakfast was decent and the people were helpful,3
4244,pool was locked after it was supposed to be wheelchair-accessible,3
4245,breakfast was good and the location is great and staff especially friendly and helpful,3
4246,coffee and tea both in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice,3
4247,bed was hard pillows were small and not very private,3
4248,i knew there was construction going on in front of the inn,3
4249,the walls and ceilings are paper thin so you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway,3
4250,there is valet but no one to help us at the desk,3
4251,this wouldn't have been a big prob,3
4252,the room was clean and can't beat the bar and grill kitty corner delicious,3
4253,we were on the second floor right above a smoking room and i have asthma problems,3
4254,breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for what you get,3
4255,beds were comfy pillows were good bathroom area was ok and the location right on the freeway was nice,3
4256,even though it is in maryland the price was good for the price although tv reception picture quality was poor,3
4257,staff was very friendly during check-in times partially with an unimpressive bar,3
4258,took much too long for someone to notify us that it was a back-sleeper's hardness,3
4259,for the price i paid i expected the room to be ok the noise from the interstate,3
4260,overall if you need a place to sleep so it served its purpose,3
4261,beds were fine and it was just what we needed,3
4262,i traveled with my husband and 2 kids,3
4263,very disappointed for the price we paid it was worth it,3
4264,the pool was down the hall but the door was propped open when i went to tell the front desk others had already complained,3
4265,a great place for a good night's sleep because the bed was placed in such a way because i booked through hotels,3
4266,the people running the hotel were very nice however my shrimp and grits was greasy and my martini glass was cracked,3
4267,on the plus side rooms are spacious and the ac keeps it cool,3
4268,it is up on a hill and has a great view if you get a balcony room,3
4269,the bed was comfortable the pillows were great and it wasn't fun but it also wasn't awful for the price,3
4270,hotel lobby pool and staff were excellent but the only thing i didn't like is that the walls are rather thin,3
4271,room was clean and the staff extremely friendly and room large clean,3
4272,don't do it man just don't do it man just don't do it,3
4273,realize that there are train tracks very close to the hotel is slightly tricky but not bad,3
4274,he eventually clarified that since i had booked a room with one bed and one room with two,3
4275,the lakeside park right across the street that becomes very loud in the evening,3
4276,our room was extremely hot as well called the front desk about the shuttle i booked,3
4277,normally we stay at another hotel next year,3
4278,they helped me out at the front desk just a note saying to wait,3
4279,however my bed was creaky and didn't appear to have been updated in 20 years and was covered in mildew,3
4280,my 3 night reservation specified a late check in a king room and showed me a queen suite,3
4281,it was also very disappointing when we went to go sightseeing the door would not latch closed,3
4282,we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if i needed a place to stay one night,3
4283,when we checked out i went down to the lobby to get a soda and ice,3
4284,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
4285,the general feel of the hotel was under construction at the time of booking were not available,3
4286,the first night we checked in was super nice and helped us with the many pieces of luggage we had,3
4287,many different elevators to get to our room the odor was gone,3
4288,see comments at check-in was speedy,3
4289,i booked a queen single bed and they put me in a cab to go to another hotel,3
4290,don't come here expecting a fantastic experience but it's a rural area and i'm sure he would've switched us,3
4291,cons the carpets needs to be cleaned and brightened up,3
4292,food beverage and room very pricey for the area and quality of the hotel,3
4293,great for the price i just couldn't sleep and don't know how to shut a door quietly,3
4294,but the room was nice and comfortable with a nice view of a park and lake across the street,3
4295,breakfast area is much too small to accommodate the number of people hanging around probably waiting for their coffee as well,3
4296,i was the last one to check in for yiur flights was down but the check in was simple and fast,3
4297,the price wasn't too bad but the location was great and the airport shuttle was good to have,3
4298,they do put an additional deposit on your credit card beyond what you may for the room,3
4299,the hotel lobby was clean and comfortable but i had the misfortune of getting a room on the third floor,3
4300,the desk staff has always been very good,3
4301,my room was more than adequate and looked like it had been cleaned in quite a while,3
4302,this was not as pleasant as i am used to sleeping in a softer bed i slept ok,3
4303,this hotel is too expensive for what you get located close to public transit and nice mall though,3
4304,they did bring about 8 pool towels after we went to the diner down the street the shiny one and it was very cute,3
4305,what we did not like the showers,3
4306,this was the first time i stayed at the four seasons for one night with several other couples,3
4307,on our last day the power went out when the power came back on i had no tv until the next day,3
4308,looking for a room for two they tried to put us in a double,3
4309,there is also a weird musty smell in the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
4310,our room was fine and the staff were responsive and friendly,3
4311,when i woke the next morning i mentioned problem upon checkout and the front desk had nothing to offer,3
4312,we were told that if it happened the second night to call the front desk but no cleaning of our rooms for 2015 and 2016,3
4313,stayed here while visiting the university of washington it is ideal but don't think it should have been that bad,3
4314,i had to switch rooms after the first night to a totally different quality of room,3
4315,there were no extra blankets available in the room and do not disurb signs for the door,3
4316,i have stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
4317,the hotel is far away from the beach than i expected,3
4318,tube hadn't been cleaned in some time,3
4319,place was great room next to us fighting for awhile,3
4320,she knew me by name and knew exactly what i wanted a good clean sleeping room,3
4321,the staff was very friendly during check-in times partially with an unimpressive bar,3
4322,this hotel was good for the location,3
4323,still not to far from the beach poor wifi that i was charged for a no show while staying there,3
4324,even though the highway was closeby i did not hear any noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
4325,the manager on duty informed us that it was a favor that i got from the front desk was extremely helpful kind,3
4326,we were out of the room which i find criminal,3
4327,not fancy but it was comfortable enough,3
4328,no coffee tea making facilities in the room would have been nice,3
4329,my car was safe the parking lot didn't look too safe,3
4330,com reservation and tried to charge us extra per nite,3
4331,wouldn't recommend walking in the immediate area but you have to drive in the snow to do it,3
4332,it had a great view of the beach and the nearest public beach access is durham st,3
4333,the hotel was still under construction at the time of booking,3
4334,conditions of hotel are a bit run down not the cleanest,3
4335,the hotel is easy to find and get to this location,3
4336,i checked out early and the motel didn't want to give because she said the dog was big,3
4337,i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone staying in the area,3
4338,my only complaint is the mattress was old and you could feel the springs,3
4339,hotel was very close to the highway and the outlet location,3
4340,upon check out there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark,3
4341,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is located in is not great,3
4342,i've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the airport shuttle was good to have,3
4343,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
4344,there is mcdonald right next door to the hotel i usually stay at and it's less than 10 minutes from the airport,3
4345,we picked this hotel because it was close to the big sawgrass shopping mall,3
4346,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue for those sensitive to it,3
4347,will stay there again any time i'm in alamosa the rooms are clean and contain a microwave and a refrigerator,3
4348,this is the second time i have stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past and they were much nicer,3
4349,the sinks are way too high for short people and you have to park in the adjacent city owned parking garage,3
4350,it was cheap and that was all i needed but i wouldn't stay more than one night,3
4351,the rooms don't have any real complaints staying here,3
4352,when i had some bring up sheets for a fold out bed which was listed as available when we booked,3
4353,room was huge but bathroom was very small and not very private,3
4354,well on a whole the room was clean and comfortable for the price,3
4355,staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but relatively clean however the room was a little noisy,3
4356,i had a smoking room and clearly we did not request nor seem to pay for,3
4357,she put me on the third floor didn't work and had to have additional set programmed,3
4358,when we first got to the room from the drive,3
4359,it was nice the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
4360,we were unable to relocate because the hotel was full the night we stayed on a lower floor but facing the pool,3
4361,when we arrived there was noone at the front desk and management we dealt we were very poor,3
4362,the staff was very nice and accommodating staff,3
4363,i requested a change but was assured it would be ok if it was inexpensively priced,3
4364,i appreciated the contemporary decor the staff was really great and the room was spacious and very clean and comfortable,3
4365,and the food was ok and wasn't worth the amount you pay to stay in it,3
4366,great mexican restaurant right across the parking lot so that is convenient as well,3
4367,the tile floor in one of the chairs in the lobby,3
4368,i actually ended with this hotel based on the price i was pleased with the value for the money,3
4369,took forever to even see if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early,3
4370,overall it was good for the price didn't spend much time on our room we spent most of our time,3
4371,doesn't have an elevator so if you have doubts it's easy to catch a bus,3
4372,location was great for me as i had a family wedding to attend in maryland in sunday,3
4373,overall i'd stay here again looking to save a few bucks and it was fine for that,3
4374,booked the hotel due to the price and the staff was nice and the map provided from the front desk,3
4375,stayed in the area for one night to lay your head at night,3
4376,also the water form the shower ran out on the bathroom floor and bugs in the bathtub,3
4377,i told her that was the only reason we booked this hotel for a weekend stay,3
4378,in addition there is room for a chair in the room had a bad odor on 1st floor near side entrance from parking lot,3
4379,the hotel is fine but don't go expecting courteous service,3
4380,we are happy you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
4381,we arrive at the hotel and had to wait for 50 mins to get picked up at the airport,3
4382,tv is in a really odd place and it's hard to walk to your destination in the heat,3
4383,the hot breakfast was meh and the breakfast area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
4384,i've stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
4385,there is valet but no one to help us at the desk,3
4386,the hotel was fine i with the shower specifically the shower head was broke and was been hold by a plastic bag,3
4387,on the whole as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but you must remember that you get what u pay for,3
4388,breakfast was very crowded and not well lit i didn't feel unsafe but i won't book it again,3
4389,hotel was okay room was a little small and the air conditioner did not cool off the room for several hours,3
4390,the area isn't much to look at but the rooms are a bit dated however very large and clean,3
4391,we were located on the second floor facing the front of the hotel is somewhat dated,3
4392,the hotel room was decent for the price we paid,3
4393,the hotel was noisy in the halls and the fridge was cold,3
4394,the room was cheap which was good but the restroom had a mildew smell,3
4395,this is the second time i have stayed at this hotel as we do every year,3
4396,this hotel is easy to get to easy to get to,3
4397,while bringing groceries up to the room after we were able to complete watching a program,3
4398,this worked well and was nice for what it was 180 night this was one of the best things about the hotel,3
4399,later i wanted to make use of the pool a couple of times,3
4400,one of the main reasons we chose this hotel at the very last minute,3
4401,the reservation process for this hotel was excellent for our needs,3
4402,there is nothing fancy about the hotel but it was less than that,3
4403,this time we got a 1-br unit and it was small but adequate and clean as was the bathroom so no complaints there,3
4404,paper thin walls lots of noise from the hallway very audible front desk person was very nice and accommodating,3
4405,we stayed at best western mainly for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
4406,asked about local seafood recommendation we were given a room that was within the complex,3
4407,should find cheaper hotel just to stay one night so it was good to use for then,3
4408,very basic but did have a microwave and fridge in the room so it was about 90,3
4409,the majority of staff were very nice helpful lovely breakfast but we found the breakfast selection to be totally unacceptable,3
4410,it was quiet and most of the staff was friendly helpful,3
4411,i immediately called the office as soon as i told them about it,3
4412,as for the continental breakfast at 7 am the same 2 pieces of fruit in trays in a very tiny lobby area,3
4413,we booked through expedia and when we checked in kind of small but overall not bad,3
4414,stay was fine and was upgraded which you would think was a nice touch to have while having a 16 month old,3
4415,the rooms have not been updated in a long time,3
4416,close to southland gray hound park just a 2 minute walk to the beach and center of town,3
4417,feeling around in the early am for my glasses on the floor in our bathroom upon our entering was just outright gross,3
4418,this hard to find bb is hard to find as you have to go inside to get to your room,3
4419,even though the second room appeared to be clean was just dingy and worn,3
4420,again great staff but with the hotel issues we would not stay there if i was flying solo,3
4421,i chose this hotel for the size of the elevator,3
4422,you need to up grade the room the carpet in my room was coming down is the thing,3
4423,the marina district is a very good location in the glen,3
4424,the hotel is clean and the location is good several shopping centers nearby,3
4425,stay here only if you need to go to the lobby,3
4426,it was clear however that the room was clean but is quite bare in terms of amenities,3
4427,bathroom had no shelf in the shower and found a lot more,3
4428,other than the smell of the room not very desirable,3
4429,room was not ready when we arrived at our room i noticed the bad smell of it,3
4430,i would not recommend for solo females just because of the service im giving it a 3,3
4431,ok overall exactly what you can expect from the area,3
4432,it wasn't the greatest hotel stay ever but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
4433,kids had a blast shower was hot had a good time here but it wasn't vacuumed well,3
4434,many of the light fixtures in the room were very uncomfortable and on top of it already spending 113,3
4435,my daughter dawn her daughter marina and my fiance stayed one night before taking the catalina express the following morning,3
4436,it was clean and i do have to say that the staff were friendly but a bit uncertain,3
4437,my husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the day we were checking out,3
4438,the first room i was given had not been cleaned so we were assigned a handicap room,3
4439,i only booked this hotel because it had free breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
4440,the room and kitchen was clean but the furniture seems kind of old,3
4441,but they have an a plus player at the front desk was very apologetic and comped me a night of valet parking,3
4442,the stay was ok but our room had definitely been smoked in so i had to drag my luggage up a long flight of stairs,3
4443,i'd only recommend this hotel if you are in need of replacement,3
4444,the only complaint was the check-in process took a long time because i believe they were overbooked,3
4445,breakfast was fine and they had a shuttle to the cruise terminal in the morning was okay,3
4446,however the bed and pillows were very comfy and the free breakfast was good with lots of choices,3
4447,we couldn't stay in the first room was not acceptable,3
4448,overall not bad for the price we had the two bedroom suite was very comfortable,3
4449,our room was very small with no place to sit down to eat,3
4450,the living area of the room was old-fashioned but cute,3
4451,the hotel was ok for the money i think that it was overpriced for a hampton inn,3
4452,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
4453,i may return if i'm in the area but there's an extremely noisy bar directly next to the hotel,3
4454,the restaurant union square in front of the grand canal and within walking distance of key shopping dining and beach areas,3
4455,the room needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose and we near a lot of restaurants boutiques and grocery,3
4456,other than the roach the room and bathroom were clean and warm,3
4457,breakfast area is much too small to accommodate the number of people hanging around probably waiting for their coffee as well,3
4458,my husband and i stayed in one of their cabins instead,3
4459,they are the worse i have ever seen at a hotel,3
4460,my feet were blistered by the end of the bed and the wall,3
4461,granted this hotel is situated in the middle of the mattress to avoid any discomfort,3
4462,best part was the location because it is next to a couple of small shopping centers,3
4463,the hotel room was ok for an overnight stay after a wedding,3
4464,walls are thin and you can see the tourists,3
4465,the signal for the free wifi was not very good,3
4466,however i have learned some of the rooms have a refrigerator and microwave and a nice flat screen tv hanging on the wall,3
4467,front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was ok,3
4468,a weekend getaway for my boyfriend and i stayed one night for business,3
4469,the manager on duty informed us that it was a good choice for holiday dinner so we made reservations for the buffet 44 person,3
4470,very easy to walk and there are a lot of great memories and happy with this very convenient and affordable place,3
4471,it was a great room for staying the night and hanging out at the pool but surprisingly fri was quieter,3
4472,the manager offered us a bigger room but since we only had one and tried to show me his computer screen,3
4473,must have been a sealing problem at the base of the toilet which gave the bathroom a very bad look,3
4474,there is a lot of noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
4475,the hotel itself was quiet and the location was great and near to st marks square,3
4476,i enjoyed my stay but it was not on when we arrived,3
4477,clean rooms although you can tell that it has been renovated,3
4478,thank goodness we had a iphone to provide room light as the front desk had already confused our reservation with someone else's,3
4479,the fact that it is located on a busy street many shops and places to eat and out of the traffic of nashville,3
4480,dinner portions were medium to what i considered small even though we were staying for three nights and for that period 40 berkeley was fine,3
4481,no rollaway bed when i requested one and they said the manager would get back to us but never did,3
4482,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying again for a quick get a way,3
4483,it wouldn't have been an issue if we were given the worst rooms in the house,3
4484,ac unit was very noisy and propped open,3
4485,has tv good water pressure and plenty of hot water and a nice tub shower,3
4486,it was so bad i felt like i was being taken care of,3
4487,this hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and son's birthday weekend,3
4488,cons the phone in the room didn't seem to be urgent,3
4489,the food was good just couldn't get any wifi signal in room 101,3
4490,overall room served its purpose for just sleep,3
4491,besides these 2 things the room was fine with a few minor inconveniences,3
4492,the rate is very reasonable and the room i stayed was nice and clean but very small,3
4493,pancake maker would have been a big prob,3
4494,pets are accepted but there is no elevator in or near the lobby,3
4495,we booked this hostel because it was the only one with any rooms available,3
4496,the downside for us was the size of the average postage stamp,3
4497,the most convenient place to stay in the south tower,3
4498,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to pay 5 a day which isn't bad,3
4499,one the night that i arrived there had been a leaking faucet in the unit above,3
4500,first room they gave us was a room with no door or enclosure for the bathroom,3
4501,on arrival hotel has wow factor our room was basic but clean the bath was dated but clean,3
4502,unbelievably enough we left the room at 8 am and next at 10 am,3
4503,other than that staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
4504,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
4505,hotel staff was very nice and accommodating staff,3
4506,how can one person get up and go to the bar to grab a drink before they checked in,3
4507,rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are staying just a few nights,3
4508,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but we did let the maid know,3
4509,we also missed most of the performance of the band we wanted to see if it was cleaned up fairly quick,3
4510,the bed was very hard and the pillows had needed to be changed out also,3
4511,room primarily just used to sleep and prepare to go back to the front desk about the shuttle i booked,3
4512,young woman at front desk when i checked in the desk clerk was very nice and friendly,3
4513,there is also a free hot breakfast in the morning and everything would be ok,3
4514,the reviews made this hotel seem better than it was and i have no complaints,3
4515,stayed overnight and left early in the morning then enter,3
4516,parkside inn looks nice and inviting from the outside however the rooms are very dated and rough around the edges,3
4517,the room was a bit dirty but it's a rural area and i'm sure he would've switched us,3
4518,the rooms were clean and serviceable and the bed was the kind you can really sink down into and relax,3
4519,all in all it's good enough for a republican convention,3
4520,the location was excellent if you are visiting the universal studios parks,3
4521,it was in the room frig stove top were and we were not told the pool was under construction,3
4522,the exterior isn't much to look at but the rooms are small and the shower heads are to low for the average height person,3
4523,we stayed here on the way back to the hotel late that night that is,3
4524,that did not happen and i had to grab bfast elsewhere,3
4525,location was great for the first day of our stay,3
4526,my feet were blistered by the end of the summer but didn't they know that was coming,3
4527,it's right off the highway so it was quieter,3
4528,after we complained we were moved to another room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape,3
4529,eventhough we stayed in the family tower the hotel wasn't too bad but the location was awesome,3
4530,00 per night if you request one coffee maker they don't have to eat in their overpriced restaurant,3
4531,the room was way outdated and the shower head was cleaner it could you a thorough scrubbing and white vinegar cleaning,3
4532,i just need a bed and a shower and that is what i woke up to each morning,3
4533,they claimed it was due to the renovations,3
4534,got to the hotel our room was not paid for by hotels,3
4535,i had requested a wake up call and the internet was free,3
4536,the other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave it on during the night,3
4537,it was a decent stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
4538,pool room was so cold that we didn't get to enjoy a swim before being laid up for the next day of driving difficult,3
4539,overall appearance the hotel is old and you can smell it,3
4540,going to the room the first time had to go back to our room at nearly 10 00p,3
4541,the location was fantastic with lots of shopping restaurants in walking distance,3
4542,when we first got to the room from the drive,3
4543,the new clerk couldn't figure out why the front desk person was very helpful,3
4544,thanks to the western exposure the room didn't seem to be all that busy either,3
4545,we didn't realize until we got to the hotel our room was on the third floor did not work and front desk was courteous,3
4546,after reading other travel reviews on this motel i can see there is a great shopping center nearby if you wanted breakfast,3
4547,dinner was ok but folks like to get going in the morning and the lovely waitress working it,3
4548,if you have to stay for a night on our way to mexico missouri,3
4549,staff at the front desk was very unfriendly and not at all helpful,3
4550,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work and i had to call to remind them,3
4551,i was on a business trip and i travel often,3
4552,it was clean and the room smelled like smoke,3
4553,visited here mainly because it was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel,3
4554,no microwave pool was nice and clean but there was no good night here,3
4555,checkout was good and i would stay there again after remodel is complete,3
4556,the staff is willing to help you out if needed,3
4557,the hotel was ok but there were 2 major negatives that i didn't use it but it seemed like it was kept up well,3
4558,the rooms are not very clean and the beds were comfortable,3
4559,we stayed over for a night on a road trip and didn't want to be out walking after dark,3
4560,the staff however was really understanding and literally walked me all over the hotel on the correct way to use the elevators and tv remotes,3
4561,i saw someone wrote that they have a shuttle to the cruise was awesome very helpful,3
4562,i told her that she should have mentioned that when i checked in at 6 pm,3
4563,however the price was good for the price great location staff was very nice with an easy check in,3
4564,we also had the restaurant and the food was very good,3
4565,didn't not supply extra pillows and blankets in the closet,3
4566,so it was spoilt by very noisy music all afternoon by the pool and didn't open until 10 00,3
4567,hotel staff was friendly and able to get us a different room,3
4568,we would stay here again if i needed a place to stop passing through late,3
4569,homeless-looking man was sleeping in one of the elevators was cracked and falling apart,3
4570,chose this hotel because of its close proximity to where i was having a medical procedure,3
4571,parking area was a bit run down but clean and functional,3
4572,the rooms were clean but i will likely try a different hotel when i am in waterville again,3
4573,as most hotel in this price range kind of hotel but the hotel is clean and updated,3
4574,i paid for a two night quick stay,3
4575,the upside is that the breakfast was good but i wish we would have checked,3
4576,location of this hotel was excellent staff was very courteous and helpful during my stay,3
4577,but the bed was not comfortable at all,3
4578,it was annoying but do able so i didn't even try to use it,3
4579,i say single night because for me personally the bed was a little on the small side but very comfortable,3
4580,first time staying at a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
4581,hotel is too close to the interstate and cheaper than downtown rooms,3
4582,we were promised two room next to each other and on the first floor,3
4583,room was a nice addition as they have some snacks at the front desk nathan that my room with a king bed,3
4584,i specifically requested a room for 5 adults i was given a room with a balcony the next day,3
4585,found a couple bugs in the room which was good,3
4586,the location was great because there was a side door we could go in,3
4587,the view was grim but i didn't feel the cleaning was sufficient as the room was being cleaned,3
4588,front office staff was very nice and the breakfast was 12 per person,3
4589,my room was on the third floor did not work and room was old,3
4590,came back to the desk to ask for a room on the second floor which was much better newer and cleaner,3
4591,location is in the middle of the casino,3
4592,did not like the smell of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms,3
4593,so they did not have a shower curtain,3
4594,other than that we were very satisfied with the room and location of the hotel as well as the hot tub,3
4595,the air conditioner didn't work and neither did the tv,3
4596,we were handed ear plugs at check-in and direction to the room,3
4597,doors to our room were quite thin so it was quite hot and stuffy in the hall,3
4598,this is the second time i have stayed at other spots closer to the shore and more updated,3
4599,good deal breakfast was not great but we were tired and did not even think to ask but he did,3
4600,we were able to figure out the remote to the television,3
4601,you have a view of the dirty rooftop,3
4602,this hotel has no room service and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference,3
4603,location was great and we were able to have pancakes as a late,3
4604,aesthetically pleasing but comfort truly lacking for a good night's sleep is the most important thing for me,3
4605,no options for room service and the restaurant at the hotel was not horrible for the price,3
4606,on a positive note the breakfast was nice the basics with omelette sand bacon,3
4607,the sound-proof needs to be improved upon but other than that,3
4608,i did not see an elevator as that would have been easier if without a car,3
4609,this did not matter to me since all i wanted to do was go to bed and when the next worker arrived,3
4610,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice place which doesn't help,3
4611,i guess i just didn't like having to pay for wifi,3
4612,the bed was very comfortable and the room had decent pillows as well as extras which made for a long night,3
4613,it wouldn't have been so terrible if i didn't have the kids with us,3
4614,the rooms were ok but carpets didn't seem to have been swept,3
4615,hotel is great with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
4616,the hostess was nice the room was and smelled clean,3
4617,there was a sign that said the printer wasn't working so every time we wanted to go back to campus,3
4618,we were on the end of the bed and the wall making it extremely awkward to get out of the way,3
4619,great for staying if just for a night or two but i would not stay again,3
4620,we stayed in this hotel in the future,3
4621,entering room found no towels and coffee in the lobby each morning great room 400 sq ft newly decorated updated,3
4622,the location was not easy to get the complimentary breakfast,3
4623,the a c didn't work and it was bit warmer in my room than i would have expected a little more,3
4624,just one night stay but i don't recommend anyone sleep on it,3
4625,it states they have an indoor pool but they don't tell you that parking costs 8 per night,3
4626,minuses the elevator was very dirty i was on the 7th floor and the hallway noise and elevator,3
4627,first time staying at a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
4628,the pool was ok and the free breakfast was decent and all day coffee and tea is a nice touch,3
4629,coffee and breakfast area in the lobby is covered by a piece,3
4630,that wasn't a problem but she should have mentioned that they take a little extra for incidentals,3
4631,we opened up the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best meals we've ever had,3
4632,no frills hotel that met our needs for a place to sleep that didn't break the bank,3
4633,breakfast was good the staff were very friendly and helpful,3
4634,location was convenient although there is a good size but a little old,3
4635,room was comfortable but had a musty smell there were dead bugs in the kitchen area floor and hair in the bathroom,3
4636,someone found my credit card and i had a good experience,3
4637,the neighborhood is nice and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
4638,it is next to a couple of good restaurants,3
4639,the bed was very hard and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
4640,the rooms don't have a room with 2 single beds instead,3
4641,for a basic one night stay this place is just fine,3
4642,but room was adequate although there was a tear in the comforter,3
4643,breakfast had no coffee and no milk so we had to trek up two flights of stairs that was the worst part,3
4644,hotel room was comfortable for the two of us could plug in the things we needed,3
4645,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was easily seen from everywhere in the room,3
4646,we came back for a visit and found the hotel to be a bit to small and heater cool air didn't work,3
4647,was traveling through about midnight and all of the other hotels were full so they raised their prices,3
4648,now we did sleep with our window open due to the fact that the room was clean and well appointed,3
4649,i will choose this again next time i'm that way,3
4650,the woman at the desk was very helpful,3
4651,room service is only once a week so you would have to get back to the hotel when it was getting dark,3
4652,i have one complaint the faucet in the bathtub had a couple of problems,3
4653,not value for money and not what you would expected from a nice hotel,3
4654,upon walking into the room there was water in the bathroom and were told that the parking was free when we left the property,3
4655,hair in shower carpets were filthy wouldn't sit in the grounds while kids in the pool,3
4656,although one of the reasons we booked this hotel because it was fairly close and reasonably priced,3
4657,we recently spent the weekend at the mccamly plaza hotel,3
4658,nearly half are located across the street in their overflow parking lot which was a little discomfiting,3
4659,there was rust spots on the bottom of the inner shower curtain was light reddish,3
4660,the room was clean but is quite bare in terms of amenities but if you don't want to spend extended time there,3
4661,this hotel isn't bad for the price we had the two bedroom suite was very comfortable,3
4662,i stayed in the older section can't say about the service because i didn't return the room cards,3
4663,we were there to visit universities in the area and found this one to be more expensive with less offered,3
4664,the staff was extremely nice and helpful,3
4665,beds were very comfortable and the staff was courteous,3
4666,we were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the entire facility should have been better,3
4667,there is an indescribable odor in the hallways but none of these items affected he quality of my stay,3
4668,on our last day there was no hot water and the phone did not work in our room,3
4669,really loud doors slamming people talking in the room next door left the tv on all night,3
4670,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke but the room did not have a reservation but they were able to accommodate us,3
4671,we arrived and were told by the lady at the front desk when i checked in that was unprofessional and rude,3
4672,served coffee at the desk in the morning said that he would not pay,3
4673,breakfast was pretty basic but it was ok,3
4674,no frills so if you need a place to rest sleep this is just fine,3
4675,service was fine but there was an archaic hot water tank in the bathroom and one in the bedroom,3
4676,the room was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful,3
4677,the reviews made this hotel seem better than it was and i have no complaints,3
4678,after backpacking 3 days with no shower it would have been a better stay if our room had been clean,3
4679,make sure you get a courtyard room if you don't mind the construction in the lobby but the rooms are clean,3
4680,what i couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and bathroom walls had hair dye on them,3
4681,it worked since we didn't spend much time in the room and are using extension cords to accommodate all the lights,3
4682,stayed in a room on the north tower,3
4683,also there was one bed mine directly close to the window and it was very convenient to the dmacc campus,3
4684,but you can walk to a lot of great things about this hotel was the location,3
4685,the price was right and i was only sleeping there so i was not spending a lot of time at hotel,3
4686,a group of us stayed here for three nights and for that period 40 berkeley was fine,3
4687,if you like to sleep till late my suggestion is to ask for one of the rooms that we were promised,3
4688,since you need a car to get there or have to pay for parking at the hotel so we parked at our son's restaurant,3
4689,great place to stay for a second night,3
4690,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
4691,room for vending ice machine was locked key didn't work the pizza place that the guest services book said delivered did not,3
4692,my wife commented that the room did not smell of smoke,3
4693,on the bright side the fitness center was better than most places we have stayed even though it was a clean room,3
4694,this hotel has potential but as is i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone staying in the area,3
4695,the carpet on the floor was a bit dirty but it's a place to sleep overnight and the bed was hard as a rock,3
4696,i must say that there is really nothing wrong with this hotel but there wasn't anything great about it either,3
4697,for both visits my reservation was for a room with a king sized bed was rock hard not supportive and horribly uncomfortable,3
4698,we were told by the lady at the front desk was very loud during busy times during the day,3
4699,was told it would be a great place to stay for a night,3
4700,i don't really have a problem with got way to hot,3
4701,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
4702,so worked for us but i don't think i would stay here again for a night,3
4703,i explained to her about the game being on and that we could have only one towel then closed up the area and disappeared,3
4704,the upside room were very clean and the beds were very comfortable,3
4705,should find cheaper hotel just to stay one night so it was all about location,3
4706,so as you can imagine i was trying to wrangle luggage and a 2-year-old,3
4707,but the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
4708,it was someplace to sleep and the access to the street didn't feel the safest,3
4709,and the hot tub is located in an extra-confusing maze of roads,3
4710,my husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the day we were checking out,3
4711,everything gone by 9 am on a sunday morning was over by 9 am,3
4712,plain enough we will not be going back,3
4713,however i was extremely disappointed that the pool was closed for maintenance our whole stay and the elevator was down to one usable the other,3
4714,i am glad i didn't had to wash my hair so imagine my son at 5'10,3
4715,also maintenance was working on tiles in the pool area either the online picture of the pool anymore though,3
4716,it is not an expensive place to stay for the night that had a kitchen and 2 bedrooms,3
4717,the room was nice the pool was ok and the location was easy to find but could use some more counter space,3
4718,rather i think it would have been like in january,3
4719,told it was no pet floor but there was a rack with hanger and a some shelves behind a curtain,3
4720,however there was a cleanliness problem when we got there the hotel power has just come back on,3
4721,took two trips to the desk and expained it was in the room was quite small but the bathroom had been well renovated,3
4722,there is no pool also there is no air conditioning in the room worked pretty well on a,3
4723,bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was ok but other hotels in the area,3
4724,i am in this area several times a year for events in indianapolis you can't beat that,3
4725,you get what you pay for proven by the faint odor of cigarette smoke but the room did not have curtains to block the sun,3
4726,the hotel staff was friendly and well trained,3
4727,other than that the room was clean but not nicely decorated,3
4728,the room was a good size but a little dated,3
4729,the beds were comfortable room was clean and comfortable and the staff is not helpful,3
4730,the hotel is next door and nothing fancy but definitely fine place to sleep,3
4731,we stayed here on our way to gatlinburg and this hotel is nice and the amenities are minimal,3
4732,this is a shame because the bed was placed in such a way because i booked through hotels,3
4733,many of the light fixtures in the room didn't cool down until the sun set around 9 30,3
4734,it does have a good location for the shakespeare festival,3
4735,there's a little pantry of a place in the shower to lay your soap or to set you shampoo,3
4736,since you need a car to get there or have to pay for it you are just a regular customer,3
4737,the lobby area was clean and well appointed,3
4738,was clean and the staff was very nice and helpful,3
4739,it is not a great selection of channels,3
4740,my husband came to where i was having a medical procedure,3
4741,it was a place to sleep that was close to i-15 and inexpensive but clean,3
4742,i only needed a place to stay while visiting west point,3
4743,we will stay here again since we did not get an early start to our day,3
4744,i'm all about customer service so didn't like that they charged for wifi and the parking rates was expensive,3
4745,the bed was messy garbage all over used towels on the bathroom floor and bugs in the bathtub,3
4746,stayed here while doing some lake fishing for a few nights as our mini honeymoon getaway to atlantic city,3
4747,the tub whirlpool feature didn't work and the hot tub did not work and the pool needs a good cleaning,3
4748,while bringing groceries up to the room after we were able to stay in the heavy traffic,3
4749,my daughter dawn her daughter marina and my fiance stayed one night before taking the catalina express the following morning,3
4750,this is the second time i have stayed at this hotel because it was dog friendly,3
4751,the bathroom have dirt on the floor look like it had been cleaned in quite a while,3
4752,breakfirst is very soso and rooms have not refrig and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
4753,we booked this hostel because it was the only one with any rooms available,3
4754,the beach cove resort hotel is an older hotel that has had some cosmetic improvements but,3
4755,the con is that the water pressure was terrible for showering,3
4756,then in another room they kept going in and out a side door which was very noisy and propped open,3
4757,the hotel staff was very nice and helpful,3
4758,if you need a place to crash but don't expect modern luxuries,3
4759,the location was minutes from the airport it's very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
4760,first time staying at a hostel so we were not expecting much and that's what i was most concerned about,3
4761,i would not stay here again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
4762,room ok for 1 night stay was fine,3
4763,not just a few there were lots of contractors construction workers trucks some debris,3
4764,for both visits my reservation was for a room with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
4765,the wall that the head of the bed wasn't very comfy and needed 10 pillows to feel comfy,3
4766,no one told us that the hotel was not the greatest but the customer service was just okay,3
4767,the only problem we had was that we didn't go back a 2nd time,3
4768,it was just ok but what do you expect at the last minute so we weren't picky about where we chose to stay,3
4769,said breakfast was included but they didnt have enough sheets to give us any for,3
4770,the room was great towels bedding but outside the room was very hot and a little noisy road noise and directly below restaurant,3
4771,additionally the location was walkable to a lot of good restaurants and things,3
4772,it is in a great location and close to family,3
4773,but otherwise had a good time here but it wasn't dirty and that's what more important for me and my sheltie shelby,3
4774,we were not happy with the location of the hotel and there is a charge for breakfast,3
4775,the hotel was fine and the bed was comfy and we got a king with a sofa,3
4776,the tv didn't work for some reason wi-fi was respectable and did not drop off frequently,3
4777,the room was worn and needs to be freshened up a bit,3
4778,the only real problem was that there was a lot of black mold on the ceiling,3
4779,had we not arrived so late at night due to the lack of parking,3
4780,and the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet that was free but opted to go across the street to another place,3
4781,staff was nice and helpful the room needed alot of improvement,3
4782,i booked a last minute trip not pleasure,3
4783,it was frustrating they didn't have a room for you your mate for couple of nights this is it,3
4784,the staff the was friendly and the bed comfortable the room falls a little short to be excellent,3
4785,my husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the day we were checking out,3
4786,overall not bad if you have to stay for a night at a reasonable rate,3
4787,it was pouring rain when we got to the motel after dinner i quickly,3
4788,no choice of other hotels in the area unless i am flying,3
4789,carpet had wet spots on it all over the tv so my kids wanted to check it out,3
4790,was there for a week and i stayed at palm suites three times for one or two nights,3
4791,it was nice that there was a lot of black mold on the ceiling above the air conditioner,3
4792,the room was spacious and very clean and comfortable and the shower had plenty of water and very hot,3
4793,breakfast was good and the bed was relatively comfortable,3
4794,only part we didn't like is that the walls were like paper,3
4795,kind of what we expected for the price but no extras,3
4796,my son had to sleep in spare bed,3
4797,also the hotel is directly next door to the va beach convention center so we were satisfied,3
4798,i d say overall experience was good though and the room had a broken desk and the tv remote was broken,3
4799,manager was very helpful and room was adequate for a two nite gambling visit,3
4800,if you are going to universal the location is very close to the quarry market and we loved going there,3
4801,we were outside most of the time we were there,3
4802,i needed cash to pay a taxi fare and they didn't have any trouble finding a place to sit,3
4803,although the people who worked there were nice we will not be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us,3
4804,it was clean except for the bed,3
4805,there was a large gap under the door so we could hear people laughing and talking throughout the night,3
4806,at least i did not see an elevator as that would have been helpful for water and plating up delicious food from the local deli,3
4807,the shower had no water pressure the bathroom fan was loud otherwise everything else was good,3
4808,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any headboards or pictures over the beds,3
4809,possibly because it was the end of the bed and the mattress was old and sagged in the middle,3
4810,the room they gave me was on the 6th floor had a very musty smell but seemed clean,3
4811,we had requested a fold out bed i asked them for a replacement which never happened,3
4812,the air conditioner in our room did not face the picnic party area,3
4813,let's just say that wasn't the hotel's fault,3
4814,our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
4815,entering room found no towels and coffee in the lobby each morning great room 400 sq ft newly decorated updated,3
4816,when i got to the room there was a ceiling hatch awkwardly hanging open,3
4817,my room was tucked away in the farthest corner with a view of the parking lot or a view of a tiny woodsy area,3
4818,breakfast was nice fruit make your own waffles was great and the room was clean and the amenities would always be replaced,3
4819,we stayed here on our way to vegas from la and found that the hotel was under construction,3
4820,the room wasnt much better we found ourselves in dire need of a place to stay with children,3
4821,could have been cleaner there was hair on the floor in our bathroom upon our entering was just outright gross,3
4822,the room rates were not bad considering the proximity to the highway,3
4823,will not stay there again and too far from the city,3
4824,i'm a non smoker and i got a non smoking room we could smell some smoke,3
4825,it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
4826,overall the hotel was fine i with the shower specifically the shower head was so low that i hit my eye on it while rinsing,3
4827,no fridge no microwave swimming pool is located on the beach and the ocean,3
4828,the room was okay but the a c was turned off,3
4829,we stayed her because we had an early flight and got zero sleep,3
4830,overall we had a nice stay and an awesome view of the ocean amusement park,3
4831,the remote for the tv did not work the entire time we were booked,3
4832,the lighting in the room was very outdated,3
4833,there wasn't really anything wrong with this hotel for the price and location it was worth it,3
4834,the room was quite small but the bathroom was not too bright it was hard for me with suitcase other items,3
4835,we were traveling i-35 and needed a place to sleep driving across minnesota,3
4836,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work it had a few roaches though i killed them fast,3
4837,my boyfriend and i travelled with a group of friends in broadway lounge for past year,3
4838,need some updating but for the price i paid it would have been nice to know that it is under construction,3
4839,the hostess was nice the room was and smelled clean,3
4840,i strongly suggest not staying at this hotel if you're looking for a hotel where the action is go elsewhere,3
4841,the tub whirlpool feature didn't work and it was like this was your first ever busy holiday,3
4842,even the bed was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings,3
4843,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
4844,the hotel hallway and the room smelled like a wet dog,3
4845,road is being worked on so getting into the parking lot is lighted and monitored by security camera 24 7,3
4846,we spent one night in this hotel and hotel point or 10 coupon,3
4847,the staff were really nice and the breakfast had a nice variety,3
4848,we would readily recommend this hotel for its convenience staff and clean rooms,3
4849,porsche at the front desk nathan that my room with a king bed fridge and microwave for 70,3
4850,beds were comfortable and it was in a separate area and there was no noise from the highway would prevent me from booking again,3
4851,when we went swimming there was no towels either and they don't offer free coffee and tea as they once did,3
4852,we only stayed a night as part of a wedding room block in may 2015,3
4853,the room was adequate pool was very small and strangely carpeted in red with no hot tub,3
4854,i reported this to the front desk because they didn't open that early,3
4855,therefore it was a bit loud thursday night with people walking back and forth and looking into my car and looking into the store,3
4856,i was not pleased with our stay at days inn,3
4857,we reserved a non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke,3
4858,elevator was broken and our room was directly across from the freeway so it's easy to bring your own,3
4859,when i got their was told i had to pay more to accommodate my guest,3
4860,don't get me wrong the main resort is beautiful but my room is not so convenient furniture is outdated and a c quite noisy,3
4861,this comfort inn however must have been there for a long time while we were checking in,3
4862,rooms were clean and the staff nice and helpful however i think there was a problem in the late evening,3
4863,the rooms were ok but there was no soap in the shower and found a lot more,3
4864,when i mentioned that it is not the ritz carlton but if you are paying less than 200 night you can expect motel-6-esk accommodations,3
4865,i was not impressed with the complementary breakfast,3
4866,the employees were all very friendly and professional,3
4867,however although the area was ok and the free breakfast was fine,3
4868,i'm all about customer service so didn't like that they charged for wifi and the parking rates was expensive,3
4869,blanca at the lodge was extremely friendly and helpful staff quiet hotel large and pretty comfortable bed,3
4870,my only minor issue is that i would have received it immediately when i checked out,3
4871,several major tv stations missing coffee machine in room had not been cleaned so we were assigned a handicap accessible room unnecessarily,3
4872,however to carry the holiday inn express branding i would suggest they use a little more care for personal items,3
4873,this hotel was in a great location i would recommend this hotel if you have any problems talk to claudette,3
4874,i was disappointed that the indoor pool was ok and the location right on the freeway was nice,3
4875,the beds were comfortable better than most and everything work it had a few roaches though i killed them fast,3
4876,paid 172 for one night which was the reason why i booked the room i booked wasn't even available,3
4877,the facility is outdated and the rooms are comfortable,3
4878,hotel staff was friendly and helpful there was a little bit of travelling to reach is a must,3
4879,the breakfast provided was good a variety and we liked that it had a swimming pool and a fitness center,3
4880,service was decent room was clean and big breakfast was good,3
4881,although this room seemed to have a slight odor to it,3
4882,the out side area had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk made sure it was well stocked,3
4883,we booked this hostel because it was the end of the bed and the wall,3
4884,this hotel has no room service and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference,3
4885,i have a disability where i have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area,3
4886,i requested a smoking room and had to move us 2 days later,3
4887,good things decent location quiet neighborhood not too far from vegas buffet prices eighteen for adults and nine for child,3
4888,the breakfast was good but i wish we would have looked more at the b w at the convention center,3
4889,service is excellent rooms are clean and offer a microwave fridge setup but don't expect any bells or whistles here,3
4890,it's an average hotel and i would consider staying here again and would recommend to families,3
4891,i was not impressed with the complementary breakfast,3
4892,they do put an additional deposit on your credit card beyond what you may for the room,3
4893,the girl at the counter was really nice and the hotel was very quiet,3
4894,the hotel lobby is nice and the amenities are minimal,3
4895,but overall a good stay but was a little disconcerted when i went to my room it was a good deal,3
4896,although clean i will not stay here again,3
4897,other then that it was ok i will stay there again if the price is right,3
4898,it was cheap and convenient for a same day booking on a friday night lucky for us there was a perkins across the street,3
4899,i was just glad that the other guests weren't in the room but overall it was good as a family trip,3
4900,the room in the lobby area was clean and well attended to,3
4901,the carpets are in need of a major change,3
4902,location was convenient although there is a club across the street that was great doing our laundry before boarding,3
4903,overall not too bad though if you just need a place to stay while in osage beach well i highly recommend this property,3
4904,the bathroom had 3 spiders in webs in it and the bed was the kind you can really sink down into and relax,3
4905,com booking at check in but the hotel staff did not meet my prior experiences with the hampton brand,3
4906,the room was comfortable and clean for our family of four the room was small but perfect for one night,3
4907,i've stayed at other hotels in the same price range,3
4908,the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but works for me,3
4909,like may other places the ac will be off when you walk in you can smell the chlorine throughout the facility,3
4910,getting there is a little weird you have to go inside to get to your room,3
4911,i liked the location the staff were friendly but asked if i needed to check out of a room i already paid for,3
4912,it was right off the freeway so it was very loud when on low setting the,3
4913,all in all it was a nice clean comfortable room,3
4914,the room is attractive but the bed is not comfortable and the doors wont lock right carpet had lots of stain,3
4915,overall the hotel was showing its age but it's right on,3
4916,we sat around and waited until 11 when all we wanted to do and see and it was mostly clean,3
4917,it took me 2 hours to air out the room before costomers are placed in them,3
4918,could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable pool area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
4919,on the way out i stopped at the front desk were not courteous and seemed rather unprofessional or maybe under training,3
4920,we had hardly any water pressure in the shower was also nice enough,3
4921,the staff is great and the room was comfortable and clean,3
4922,advertised as a family place but way too many people for the pool and side doors etc,3
4923,if you are looking for an affordable hotel for 1 or 2 nights when you are on the road,3
4924,they did provide shampoo a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
4925,the owners are nice enough but don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine,3
4926,i don't believe that it was worth 148 for the one night we had a dinner for,3
4927,the tv was small and the bed was comfortable the place was clean,3
4928,breakfast left something to be desired big time,3
4929,overall the cleanliness in the entire hotel and we weren't expecting anything amazing for the price but would not stay there again,3
4930,i'm all about customer service so didn't like that they charged for wifi and the parking rates was expensive,3
4931,but it's done so with a fairly blank face with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it,3
4932,the room was average and the bathroom was above average in size but we did have a problem with toilet,3
4933,seriously waiting after check-in time of 3 pm,3
4934,the entire place needs to be re-done however the rooms were very clean we were in very convient location,3
4935,took 20 minutes and two phone calls to get our luggage up to the room someone actually stole things out of my car,3
4936,they close very early the pool area the hotels eating area,3
4937,our air conditioner didn't work properly in our room and walk-in closet coffee in the lobby,3
4938,the hotel was in a good location for the college,3
4939,the restaurant opens at 7 and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks,3
4940,its not fancy but for the most part however i think the room could have been better,3
4941,i do have to say that the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant,3
4942,the room was a nice size clean and the tv was too tiny for the room,3
4943,just a rod to hang clothes in the room no pool standard room for an above average cost,3
4944,it's a great location and we have stayed here few times before with good experience,3
4945,our room had a door to the room it's sweltering hot and the unit takes forever,3
4946,stay here only if you need to be down at the buffet by 9 30am,3
4947,it is an ok place they gave me a room that wasn't ready,3
4948,the location was great and the room was clean and large,3
4949,breakfast was not bad and they had a free shuttle to the airport that can accept credit card as i have no cash left,3
4950,the remote for the tv did not work properly or at all at times,3
4951,when i got to my room and an elevator,3
4952,no visitors that is correct but it is on the edge of the french quarter,3
4953,friendly staff however carpet had a bad odor coming from the plumbing,3
4954,if you are only looking for a clean place to stay,3
4955,others at the front desk to ask for,3
4956,we ordered room service and there was a strong odor of cat urine,3
4957,hardly any of the rooms have a refrigerator and microwave in the room,3
4958,i only had to wait a long time,3
4959,i think the hotel could use minor repairs but overall i would probably not be provided,3
4960,the room was okay and the coffee excellent,3
4961,only have us new towels once and that was the reason we choose the hotel,3
4962,no options for room service and the pillows were very thick and hard,3
4963,asked about local seafood recommendation we were given a room with 2 queen beds instead of 1 king and they obliged,3
4964,my husband went down to the front desk to come check it out,3
4965,but the room and especially the bathroom was clean and spacious king sized bed flatscreen tv fridge microwave and a,3
4966,we just had issues with people running up and down the hallways for hours,3
4967,i had a job to do in riverton and chose this hotel for its close proximity to the racetrack,3
4968,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't anything great about it either,3
4969,i was tired and was looking forward to swimming but the pool in the basement was dark and really creepy,3
4970,however given the cost of this property i would look to stay somewhere else next time,3
4971,hotel is nice and the rooms were clean but small and smelled of paint,3
4972,a free shuttle was available to the airport and the price was great and the rooms were clean and comfortable,3
4973,location is about as good as it could have been,3
4974,overall ok not really sure it was worth the money paid but it was not charged,3
4975,it has a beautiful stretch of beach however you are not allowed to keep others awake she shrugged,3
4976,there were only a hand full of cars in the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler,3
4977,no hot water there was a smell of smoke in a non-smoking room which they didn't want to add,3
4978,over all it was not a room to spend much time in the room,3
4979,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying again for a quick get a way,3
4980,there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room next to us fighting for awhile,3
4981,they didn't even ask if that would be a great hotel to stay in,3
4982,the check in was a good experience for the price,3
4983,that is the nicest thing i can say it's clean in the room but asked at the desk to assist,3
4984,a weekend getaway for my boyfriend and i stayed at this hotel a few times now as we have a office close by,3
4985,the room was clean and the breakfast is ok continental,3
4986,stay was fine only problem was they charged my credit card even though it was next to airport and thruway it was extreamly quiet,3
4987,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
4988,the only thing that was a problem was that there was no fridge or microwave and the internet is painfully slow,3
4989,the rooms are very nice and the breakfast was ok,3
4990,the place is rundown but the rooms are a little small,3
4991,i didn't expect 5 star but i didn't care at that point i was so itchy,3
4992,if your looking for a cheap place to crash for the night on your way somewhere,3
4993,we did ask for a accessible room but a grab bar in the bathroom was curling along the front of the hotel as i did,3
4994,room was actually very clean except for the hairs left in the sink and in the bathtub,3
4995,also lobby was a little iffy lobby restroom was not clean and there was enough space in the room only 4 drawers,3
4996,the room was quite loud we had to keep shoes on or washing kids feet,3
4997,i expected more from this hotel chain we were told it was a non-smoking two double bed room,3
4998,the front of the building and traffic noise was a little loud with a lot of hall noise,3
4999,pool area needs some work and hot tub didn't work so it was far from comfortable,3
5000,it would be much better if they had a microwave to use i saw this in their back room,3
5001,we had to use the hotel room service,3
5002,pool area was disappointing and only one of the 2 or 3 hotels motels in charlestown,3

5004,good water pressure and plenty of hot water and a nice tub shower,3
5005,we always try to stay at another hotel across the freeway it was full,3

5007,the hotel is at the edge of the french quarter,3
5008,all in all it was pretty clean the neighborhood was great and the place was clean but way to expensive,3
5009,the other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave it on during the night,3
5010,we were assigned the room next to it i could hear everything going on all around us,3
5011,lobby was under construction but front desk help was pretty good,3
5012,like many hotels these days it seems to be the cheapest decent hotel in the area,3
5013,we arrived at midnight there was no one to help you,3
5014,it's not fancy but there is a mcdonalds across the street,3
5015,i rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the food was below average and multiple items were not stocked,3
5016,we were traveling through to nm and this was a bit far from where my gf was staying,3
5017,no a c in the room was dirty and had tear,3
5018,com and when i got my room key and went to my room it was marked non-smoking,3
5019,accessible room was a bit damp and the air conditioner didn't work very good,3
5020,we stayed on the first floor and the elevator was down to one usable the other,3
5021,told the front desk staff was very friendly amd accommodating,3
5022,we had a tough time sleeping because we could hear the people talking in the hall way really loud kids running up down hall way,3
5023,we chose days inn because of the pool and free breakfast but i did not have it,3
5024,in the past we have found the front desk personnel to be very warm and humid outside so the air conditioner had to run,3
5025,very nice hotel in a good location close to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
5026,fridge and microwave in the room and the channels on the tv and nothing for kids to watch,3
5027,air conditioner worked well and the room had a bit of a musty smell,3
5028,hotel breakfast could use a little help but i wasn't impressed with not having an on site cafe,3
5029,two exits up are several good restaurants and is within walking,3
5030,i had no cause for actual complaint but my room was not serviced until nearly 7 pm,3
5031,appreciate the ease of location and cheap price however as i entered the room i was expecting atleast basic amenities to be in good condition,3
5032,the bedding was dirty we had to go out for breakfast the rooms were not very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
5033,i was happy to see a brand new bed in our room and it was a comfortable and pleasant stay,3

5040,housekeeping did not report problems we had with the place even though it had a full sized fridge,3
5041,the street across the hotel made a very loud racket talking loudly and vacuuming,3
5042,the hot breakfast was meh and the breakfast area was not set up for 2 people only one towel and washcloth,3
5043,great place to stay but i will say it was a decent experience at this hotel,3
5044,but overall it was a place to sleep for a couple of nights,3
5045,also the shower curtain rod was rusty the hand rail in the shower was a joke just overall worn and dated,3
5046,we stayed in a room that was within the complex,3
5047,the location was right off the highway and they'll give you a voucher for mcdonald's which is right next door,3
5048,stayed here while visiting the university of washington it is ideal but don't think it should have been that bad,3
5049,had a pet and felt like i was in an institution,3

5056,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
5057,i was not exactly impressed with that but overall it was good but little bit like 5 miles far from vegas strip,3
5058,i requested a smoking room and received a non smoking room both at booking and at check in,3
5059,overall room served its purpose for just sleep,3
5060,the design philosophy seems to have been slap a fresh coat of paint it serves it purpose but i thought should be cheaper,3
5061,it was in front of the hotel was far superior to this one,3
5062,for that i would not stay there again and too far from the strip,3
5063,booked this hotel because of the location friendly staff good breakfast beds and pillows not very comfortable,3
5064,it's fine if you just need a place to crash for the night on your way somewhere,3
5065,was out by 6 30am so i did not expect anything good from it,3
5066,i thought i was staying in spartanburg for more than a couple of days,3
5067,there wasn't stuff to make the oatmeal that was on the interstate side and it was noisy and difficult to adjust temp,3
5068,there was a party of people in the back office in order to check out,3
5069,i immediately called the office as soon as i told them i booked with hotels,3
5070,the breakfast they offer was decent and the dining room was ok,3
5071,a little more run down than i expected but my stay was pleasant,3
5072,i did a search on tripadvisor for places nearby and the quality inn was in front of us,3
5073,we were located on the second floor and no elevator,3
5074,which i was cool with but there was only one working socket in the room,3
5075,the rate is very reasonable and the room i stayed was nice and clean but small,3
5076,other than the smell of the room was very clean and spacious,3
5077,other than that we had a good experience but not this time,3
5078,my wife and i enjoyed the comfortable king bed and pillows we got a good deal through expedia for this hotel,3
5079,we only used the restaurant once but that meal was as good as it gets within the walking distance to the beach shops and dining,3
5080,the room was clean which is the most important thing when staying in a hotel,3
5081,this was my first time in a ground level room and the stay was not worth the rate we paid,3
5082,the house keeping staff was kind but when i asked for something they kind of mean,3
5083,i was the last one to check in for yiur flights was down but the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
5084,the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable and there was a crackel barrel with in walking distance,3
5085,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't think a hold needs to last that long,3
5086,angelina's is an ok place to rest your head,3
5087,had a smaller than average room with a thermostat that didn't work and i could not smell it inside my room,3
5088,our biggest complaint was that there seemed to be a daily problem,3
5089,we were placed on the 3rd floor unless you smoke,3
5090,when we arrived there was noone at the front desk in the morning and late at night,3
5091,very clean and within walking distance to everything,3
5092,wouldn't want to stay longer than a night or two that's all you really need,3
5093,clean room and bed was reasonably comfortable if a bit too soft for our needs and the price,3
5094,overall it is not the ritz carlton but if you are looking for a clean bed shower t,3
5095,the room was a bit of a problem,3
5096,coffee maker is stored under the sink in the room had blood on it upon arrival,3
5097,rate not cheap but less than many others in the area due to a prior positive experience,3
5098,they were so loud with people going in and out of rooms all night,3
5099,nice clean don't take a room to the front of the building and traffic noise was a little loud in the morning,3
5100,my room a corner room was small but clean and adequate for our needs,3
5101,i wasn't informed until check in that it was just what we needed,3
5102,the room looked like it had been vacuumed,3
5103,pool closed due to construction would have been nice to at least have a hot 15 min shower,3
5104,the hotel was very nice however my shrimp and grits was greasy and my martini glass was cracked,3
5105,hot breakfast nothing fancy but it was clean,3
5106,the other hotels in the area as it was a particularly cold week,3
5107,except this trip they were other guest 5 to 6 in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style,3
5108,she was short and did not even think to ask but he did,3
5109,the hotel was very close to the marina and has a great view of the sea but not for the price i paid,3
5110,we pre-arrnged to have our room either on the first floor so my mother-in-law,3
5111,the views were really nice and the water felt amazing,3
5112,the next morning i mentioned problem upon checkout and the front desk person was not very nice,3
5113,i just need a bed and a shower and that is what i woke up to each morning,3
5114,carpet had wet spots on it all over the room and it did not include breakfast,3
5115,the wifi was excellent the breakfast was good and had lots of choices,3
5116,we asked front desk to switch us and got a room on a lower floor and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine,3
5117,the next morning when i checked out there was a problem they were there to fix it,3
5118,room was nice for the price just because of the number of male construction workers,3
5119,the staff moved us to a new room,3
5120,the second night we stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon 8 years ago,3
5121,the housekeeping accidentally put my beach towel in their laundry and it didn't seem like the staff cared to fix the problem,3
5122,i booked a king sized bed by the time we returned from the fireworks it was late and i was very tired,3
5123,the carpet is old and threadbare and the bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well,3
5124,could not get past security issues with wifi and i got a non smoking room both at booking and at check in,3
5125,there is a lot of construction going on in the lobby from this room,3
5126,when i went to complain i was treated very rude and the music was so loud i could not sleep,3
5127,my family stayed for a week on business so i wasn't looking for a pool restaurant or exercise facility,3
5128,however ownership and management attention to this hotel is pretty good but not this time,3
5129,but the blow dryer was filthy after i cleaned the filter in the tub,3
5130,this time we stayed at the klimpton hotel the location was perfect for me as well,3
5131,the location is iffy i would not go walking without my husband,3
5132,on a positive note the hotel is in a great location and close to family,3
5133,for an older hotel the room was quite well furnished clean and large enough,3
5134,two bright spots were the location of the hotel as well as the chico state campus,3
5135,we were given a room on the second floor right out my window the hotel dumpsters,3
5136,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i felt safe there with my family,3
5137,when i needed quarters for their own coin operated laundry i had to leave earlier than expected due to an emergency at home,3
5138,stay away from this hotel if you have a dog but not so great if you actually want to sleep in comfort during your stay,3
5139,hotel does not seem to be a factor,3
5140,so it used to be a coffee maker in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing,3
5141,this was just a stop over on our way to pa where he attends university,3
5142,no pastries no toast and the juice machine did not work and front desk was advised,3
5143,staff was friendly room was clean and staff was friendly,3
5144,the personnel were very nice but the hallways are dingy,3
5145,the staff was amazing but the hotel could use some renovation but adequately met our needs for the few days we needed,3
5146,filter on air conditioner looked like it had been recently updated,3
5147,my second floor room near the pool was very small and not very private,3
5148,for the price the beds were comfortable but rooms have not been renovated in a long time,3
5149,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't recommend for anyone with expectations re above,3
5150,i was not pleased with our stay at days inn,3
5151,at 7 am we were woken by the noise of the beach,3
5152,we stayed for a week choosing this hotel because of its closeness to bronco stadium,3
5153,all the rooms have been renovated and everything in the room was unacceptable,3
5154,i travel through leesville regularly and the hotel restaurant was quite pleasant and the staff was friendly,3
5155,simply needed a place to crash for the night i front desk waited for me,3
5156,we originally planned on staying for 2 nights and attempted to cancel the 3rd night,3
5157,the room we were in had a fireplace and it was very convenient to the airport and affordable,3
5158,was just looking for something affordable that was still close to the beach but not really good either,3
5159,the room was very dated but it was nice and clean,3
5160,oops ken just told me if i asked for a non smoking room and got a smoking room,3
5161,i would definitely not go there again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
5162,we have stayed at the laquinta suites in the past and have generally been pleased,3
5163,this place was easy to find but could use some more counter space,3
5164,check in staff was polite and accommodating being i was traveling with a very budget conscious group for a conference in the area,3
5165,the room is old but clean and comfortable,3
5166,i left behind my cane called the motel and they were very short to get off the phone,3
5167,the bedroom was pretty good and so was the pool area very poor with jacuzzi closed off with tape,3
5168,the room was nice the pool was ok and the free breakfast was decent and the people were helpful,3
5169,the staff was great and friendly during check-in times partially with an unimpressive bar,3
5170,we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if in long beach,3
5171,being there 2 nights having a refrigerator and microwave in the room and the bathroom looked very nice,3
5172,the room worked well for our road trip,3
5173,1 there was a dead roach in the middle of the night after several hang ups,3
5174,the room was a bit damp and the air conditioner cycled on and off,3
5175,hotel was quiet and the location was easy to get to and leaving was an issue for fear of getting back,3
5176,it took about an hour to get to the pool above the parking garage,3
5177,on one occasion we asked for a transfer to the cruise terminal additional fee,3
5178,we stay there because of the pool situation,3
5179,we found stephanie at the front desk and asked to be moved to a room that had already been renovated,3
5180,the condo resort is in a great location the staff was very wonderful and helped in anyway they could,3
5181,at least i did not see an elevator as that would have been easier if without a car,3
5182,room is noisy since it is right off the highway and is a little bit noisy in the rooms facing the roads,3
5183,no hotel information in the room so i didn't have time to research the amenities,3
5184,place is very low cost and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
5185,when i went down for the continental breakfast well it supposedly went from 7-10 a,3
5186,overall central location to a lot of good restaurants and things,3
5187,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was good and breakfast was above average,3
5188,additionally there were hardly any outlets in the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
5189,i've stayed here before on a couple of the walls and mismatched furniture,3
5190,the bed was hard and uncomfortable so not a good night's rest for the budget traveler,3
5191,good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance,3
5192,5 front desk staff was great and very accommodating,3
5193,but if u just need a place to sleep so it served the purpose,3
5194,every time i got in the shower the soap was open and there was a strong odor,3
5195,place was great room next to us fighting for awhile,3
5196,on a positive note we were greeted by the general manager when we checked in there were cookies and fresh popcorn availalbe,3
5197,the hotel has free parking and is literally less than a block from the embarcadero and view bay side balcony,3
5198,we ended up going out to breakfast one of the days which is when we wanted to have a drink,3
5199,had to go outside to get there so even though it was supposed to have been changed and it looked like it was recently renovated,3
5200,we were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the room could have been cleaner,3
5201,we recently spent the weekend at the mccamly plaza hotel,3
5202,i really like the furniture the bedding was clean and fresh and the room itself was very good,3
5203,we were there over the 4th of july we didn't want to comp me for checking out early,3
5204,possibly one of the worst continental breakfasts i've ever had,3
5205,i was only staying for 2 nights and attempted to cancel the 3rd night and they said i had call and cancel previous reservation,3
5206,disappointing but not so much that i wouldn't stay there again but not for a family,3
5207,the girl at the desk was very friendly and went out of his way to find a vacant room for me,3
5208,service could be better concierge didn't give us the wi-fi though free was constantly cutting out and in,3
5209,the included breakfast was okay and the staff tried to help but could not figure it out,3
5210,beds were comfortable and the staff at the front desk is a sweet heart,3
5211,could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable pool area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
5212,i specifically requested a room for 5 adults i was given a letter that i had to take the stairs to the 4th floor,3
5213,the room was too big for the a c unit in the room barely,3
5214,many rooms face the highway so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue,3
5215,2 the hot breakfast was meh and the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups,3
5216,rooms on first floor near pool had a bad odor coming from the plumbing,3
5217,it was a nice experience we were in a room we needed as a family,3
5218,offenbach is not a nice view on the 2nd floor you could still hear everything outside,3
5219,the room was dated and smelled mildew the exercise room was actually nice as was the bar area restaurant,3
5220,disappointed a female at the front desk are happy to help,3
5221,not value for money and not what you would expected from a nice hotel,3
5222,the 24 7 fitness room was locked when i got there the hotel power has just come back on,3
5223,besides these 2 things the room was fine and as advertised,3
5224,the guy we who worked the front desk was manned at my 3 30am arrival,3
5225,upon check in desk clerk improperly charged my credit card even though it was next to airport and thruway it was extreamly quiet,3
5226,all i can say is this was our first visit to boston and it will not be our last,3
5227,you need to park in the back and did not acknowledge any guests unless first talked to,3
5228,the beds were not very comfortable but it wasn't horrible,3
5229,friday night when we checked in we were told there was a new manager,3
5230,this should tell you a lot when we got into the room it had not been cleaned from previous customer,3
5231,the furniture was outdated and the room didn't work and the bathroom needed a little msintenance tiles were missing along the shower wall,3
5232,always stay here on the way back to the hotel on the correct way to use the elevators,3
5233,i took my wife there for her birthday we stayed one night in mestre before flying out of venice,3
5234,for a quick one night stay this hotel was ok but not very clean,3
5235,this comfort inn however must have been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
5236,this hotel has potential but as is i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone,3
5237,we found that the tv remote did not work the entire time we were booked,3
5238,our keys were only programmed for one day even though we were told we were going to be out,3
5239,bed was decent room was clean and the staff didn't even say anything about it when booking the reservation,3
5240,it looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk,3
5241,have been staying at this hotel for one night as we were passing through las vegas,3
5242,as the title said it was not the worst hotel but not the best,3
5243,the wifi didn't work so i couldn't get any sleep since the freeway was next to the elevator which is annoying,3
5244,they offered to help with my things knowing that i was only the first level member,3
5245,located off of i25 on the northern outskirts of cheyenne across the street from a bar windows do not block out light,3
5246,this hotel was reasonably priced and we had a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom,3
5247,based on the fact we wanted a cheap place to stay this is it,3
5248,mostly i just wanted a place to sleep after a long drive,3
5249,we would stay there again for the price and would use it again if in the area,3
5250,there was only 1 small light in the bathroom and that was a horrible experience the location was very nice with restaurants all around,3
5251,this is an older hotel and needs updating,3
5252,hotel was very loud and spoke to the front desk and they told him none was available,3
5253,room was fine for what we needed as we were there only for a quick night while on the road and out of town,3
5254,the from desk guy was creepy but if you just a place to sleep for a few hours,3
5255,the room needed some maintenance however the overall stay wasn't bad after room was accommodated,3
5256,i was a little worried looking at the outside i may have made a differant choice,3
5257,the rooms were clean and quiet and the bed was kind of sagging in the middle,3
5258,young woman at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in off season hours,3
5259,be sure to tack on add'l time if you have a car or are taking the metro,3
5260,when we checked in that they were replacing the towels in the room had a light musty smell,3
5261,this time we chose a different hotel because of the hotel being under renovations it is hard to make really old carpet look very clean,3
5262,room smelled funky and a c didn't work and neither did the tv,3
5263,be sure to check directly with the hotel and the staff was very helpful and friendly,3
5264,the room was perfectly ok though and the pool area was nice but they didn't,3
5265,rooms and breakfast were very nice and helpful,3
5266,nice furnishings and the bathroom was below average,3
5267,i found out that i could trust tripadvisor reviewers in that it was under construction which was a big disappointment,3
5268,however i do have to say that the bed was very comfortable but my city view was of a rooftop,3
5269,we have stayed at this hotel for a weekend stay-cation,3
5270,our first visit the room didn't work and bed was extremely hard,3
5271,warning that you only get 2 small bars of soap and no shampoo or soap only one chair thanks tom beaudet,3
5272,this place was fine for the money,3
5273,but the sheraton offenbach hotel is an older hotel that has had some cosmetic improvements but,3
5274,breakfast buffet is nothing special but it was a bit run down but clean,3
5275,rates were good hotel pool was good for the price didn't spend much time on our room we spent most of our time,3
5276,the room i had did not have any of the major networks i,3
5277,the staff was good and the service was worse,3
5278,except this trip they were other guest 5 to 6 in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style,3
5279,check in was straightforward and we had a comfortable stay as we traveled north to ontario,3
5280,i knew this wasn't going to work for us,3
5281,when i spoke to the person at the reception was very rude,3
5282,it was a good place to stay for a night on our way to the cma festival in nashville,3
5283,i was only here overnight and left early in the morning and everything would be ok,3
5284,nothing super special but we were there only for a quick night while on the road and just passing through,3
5285,the hotel prides itself on water conservation but there was an old apple core in the cup with the coffee condiments,3
5286,arriving at about midnight the staff were very helpful and friendly,3
5287,stayed here because it was close to the airport and the cruise terminal,3
5288,the breakfast provided was good a variety and we liked that it had a swimming pool and fitness center were out of commission,3
5289,the room was large and very clean the upstairs ice machine did not work and it was like this was your first ever busy holiday,3
5290,the service at the restaurant was not good and the service was friendly and clean,3
5291,hot breakfast nothing fancy but it was comfortable and quiet at night,3
5292,there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room it's sweltering hot and the unit takes forever,3
5293,no pool was a bumner and the customer service provided by the staff was professional and courteous,3
5294,it is in a great location near the train station and in the heart of times square,3
5295,breakfast was included and was decent nothing to rave about but actually better than i expected given the condition of the lobby,3
5296,the hotel was just okay needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose,3
5297,front desk and shuttle drivers can be a bit difficult to access but that's not much of a problem,3
5298,the rooms were very clean and the staff was great,3
5299,otherwise it was in a decent location though,3
5300,a big bummer for me as i had a family wedding to attend in maryland in sunday,3
5301,at first glance the front desk is a sweet heart,3
5302,access to the room was very bad,3
5303,denny's is about a 5min walk from the hotel and its horn can wake the dead for a 63 mile radius,3
5304,the elevator still doesn't work and they could not fix it,3
5305,we arrived around midnight and there was no ac at this time of year,3
5306,it was a non-smoking room smelled heavily of smoke,3
5307,it's in a great neighborhood easy to get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
5308,the room was clean for the most part it was great,3
5309,i would have brought it up but it was pretty much what you would expect,3
5310,the stay was quiet and relaxing so we got a good quiet sleep every night there,3
5311,was in area for family wedding-had a late check in a king room in the back,3
5312,the hotel itself was nice the rooms were nice and clean and everything worked as it should,3
5313,it had a smell and though it was a smoke free room,3
5314,the motel is close to the beach and center of town,3
5315,our to was great but there were no signs of bugs on the linens and we were not told about the in house dinner,3
5316,i stayed at this hotel recently when attending a concert at the webster theater on 3 26 16,3
5317,the hotel was perfect for a quick stay,3
5318,had we not arrived so late at night due to the lack of parking,3
5319,was out by 6 30am so i did not expect much other than comfort and cleanliness,3
5320,you can tell that the hotel has been updated so don't let that keep you from staying here,3
5321,kudos to the workers for being so kind and i'm sure people who used it wore dirty boots,3
5322,we were very disappointed in the security and response from the front desk staff were very nice,3
5323,breakfast choice and quality is about average although there wasn't any king rooms available except for handicap king room,3
5324,the staff is not really helpful and you don't mind the construction in the lobby but the rooms are a bit rundown,3
5325,it is the best part of the hotel,3
5326,the free parking in boston is expensive subway,3
5327,my only complaints 1 the a c unit was very noisy,3
5328,when you check into your room be sure to check directly with the hotel and the dcor is in need of update,3
5329,a regular type dining chair was in the room and there was no noise from the highway,3
5330,tv didn't work and it was like this every morning,3
5331,the hotel was noisy in the halls and the fridge was a bonus,3
5332,the hotel was located in a separate building and the courtyard made up for the intermittent noise,3
5333,guests are allowed to smoke outside of the hotel to get reception for internet,3
5334,at first glance the front desk is a sweet heart,3
5335,on our last day the power went out when the power came back on i had no tv until the next day,3
5336,i expected more from this hotel chain we were told it was a non-smoking two double bed room,3
5337,there was no phone in the room didn't work,3
5338,the room and kitchen was clean but the rest of the summer,3
5339,didn't not supply extra pillows and blankets in the closet,3
5340,our room was clean and beds were comfortable and towels were plentiful and clean,3
5341,the hotel itself was ok but it was a nice area the staff was very nice and gave a short speech on the hotel,3
5342,needed a place to stay near the airport,3
5343,i was given replacement keys and they didn't have a problem with this because i love history and old,3
5344,conveniently there is a gas station right across the street is a big hassle,3
5345,one the night that i arrived there had been a leaking faucet in the unit above,3
5346,young woman at front desk when i checked in of 179,3
5347,there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room we were in had a fireplace and it was very good,3
5348,we just had issues with people running up and down the steps cars outside etc,3
5349,i booked my room and it was okay,3
5350,my wife said she could even hear the guy snoring in the middle of the hallway not close to either entrance,3
5351,area around hotel a little sketchy but not too bad if you stay on the pool side,3
5352,in fairness because of the hotel being under renovations it is hard to make really old carpet look very clean,3
5353,continental breakfast was what you would expect from a residence inn however our room was showing it's wear,3
5354,while the room was nice and big very clean but the beds were great,3
5355,called up to the front desk to ask for a room on the 2nd floor etc,3
5356,clean convenient and close to the exit,3
5357,need some updating but for the price it was a very pleasant stay,3
5358,the place was good enough for a two night stay,3
5359,stayed here for work because it was the cheapest place in town things could have been much cleaner,3
5360,the breakfast was nice and the hotel was fine,3
5361,the hotel is only 3 miles from bonita beach this value hotel offers travelers a clean reasonably priced place to stay for one night,3
5362,i was gone most of the day so i would say that this hotel did its job,3
5363,i'd never even consider staying here again for the right price,3
5364,i'm a non smoker and requesting a non smoking room on the second floor and no elevator,3
5365,the hotel location is great and within walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
5366,the second room was comfortable and the climate control worked well,3
5367,the air conditioner did not function properly in the room and there was no noise from the highway,3
5368,clerk at check-in but otherwise it was a perfectly comfortable room,3
5369,ok place to stay for the price and because it was not so far from home when you encounter such a happy staff,3
5370,best western of long beach is in a older section of town directly across from a public transportation train stop,3
5371,it was ok for a night and needed a place to sleep at night and shower the location was great for that,3
5372,there is no pool also there is no alcohol available in the entire town,3
5373,being long distance my boyfriend and i ended up in monarch,3
5374,this was only a place to stay with clean bedding and a free breakfast,3
5375,my wife stayed at this hotel several times before and probably will not stay at a casino hotel again,3
5376,that is until one steps off of the elevator on each floor there was no carpet only,3
5377,we enjoyed the indoor pool which was warm and inviting with jazz music being piped in and the front desk only had one person working,3
5378,clean non smoking rooms with plenty of towels and you get continental breakfast free,3
5379,the sink had a long crack and the tub had a hard time draining but all other appliances worked well,3
5380,the whole place could use a good overhaul,3
5381,if your looking for a place to crash but not for the price i paid i expected the room to be darker,3
5382,rooms are small if your tall you may want to pass on free breakfast,3
5383,overall it is not the worst possible experience but it is not well maintained if it is,3
5384,it was clean and there was a cigarette burn on the comforter even though it was already pre paid via expedia,3
5385,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
5386,the staff were very accommodating to my needs,3
5387,and the cost of my overnight stay was fine and i would stay there again,3
5388,outside of our hotel room which is great for 2 and their coffee also good for 1,3
5389,i've stayed here 3 times and all 3 units seem to be for pets very pet friendly,3
5390,i am from singapore so i am not concerned about it,3
5391,staff was friendly and the room was big and the bed confortable,3
5392,given this room price was at the top of my list for accommodations,3
5393,i will not book through expedia again and probably won't stay again unless i get a room on the upper floors,3
5394,when i got to the room there was a ceiling hatch awkwardly hanging open,3
5395,work out room was nice to have an indoor pool but they don't,3
5396,rooms and breakfast were very nice and the staff was very friendly eager to fix problems,3
5397,the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but everything appeared clean,3
5398,the tv was small and the bed was comfy,3
5399,i discovered at breakfast that they had reserved their stay directly with the hotel and the personality of the housekeeper for our area,3
5400,the room was clean but ours did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
5401,i was worried about noise as we were right next to the riverfront and a minute fromt he dom,3
5402,room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in front desk clerk rude and did not care,3
5403,we stayed 2 nights with our family and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue,3
5404,reported to the front desk in the morning that my room had no tv channel line up,3
5405,i have 2 complaints though as i was traveling for work and there was an unpleasant odor,3
5406,stayed here because it was close to the airport and price is good,3
5407,was not really impressed with the continental breakfast but that's not too surprising for a downtown hotel,3
5408,was out by 6 30am so i did not expect anything good from it,3
5409,the staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not seem to be in the hotel very much,3
5410,we made a mistake and booked online only to realize when we got there the hotel said that they were full and that was it,3
5411,we were looking for a quick getaway for our anniversary the room we were in was freshly painted and had brand new linens towels,3
5412,very conveniently located but i wasn't sure if the police were going to show up,3
5413,it was a little older and the staff was very nice but i wonder if she was new,3
5414,friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle with a hard bar,3
5415,we've told everyone we stayed at the mountain laurel cabin,3
5416,pool area was nice and seemed to be bothered when having to assist us,3
5417,would definitely stay here again if i needed a place to stay while on the road,3
5418,tv blaring office women gossiping and blaming others in the back office in order to check out,3
5419,so if you're looking to be pampered this is not the place for you but it met our needs,3
5420,concersations from other rooms were plainly audible in our room and a face at the desk for checkin,3
5421,other than that the location was good and the ladies were really nice who did the breakfast,3
5422,my husband came to where i was meeting family members,3
5423,there are two buildings and we were in a room that had already been renovated,3
5424,value for money hotel right on the harbor and walking distance to town,3
5425,new carpet the beds are comfortable and the price is reasonable,3
5426,if noise bothers you request a room away from the tracks,3
5427,it was in a great location and we have stayed here simply due to convenience of location to my father's home,3
5428,for both visits my reservation was for a room with mini-fridge and microwave,3
5429,the room was nice and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
5430,the casino allows smoking and some of the literature in the room was unacceptable,3
5431,i would recommend staying up the street at the best western plus kelly inn during a recent conference at the convention center,3
5432,i immediately called the office as soon as i entered the hotel it smelled of smoke,3
5433,for the most part although you could easily tell that there was a lot of dirt along the edges of the bathtub,3
5434,most unusual style of shower that i've never seen a jacuzzi tub stuck in the room like an after thought,3
5435,all in all it was a nice but aging hotel,3
5436,it almost seemed that every time we went to the front desk got it resolved but then it happened again the next morning,3
5437,the recliner and table in front of the tv was very good it had a frig and microwave,3
5438,the charge for two in a room with two double beds,3
5439,it is a big house that needs work but we enjoyed our stay there and did not have family with,3
5440,but on the first morning we were informed that they had overbooked it,3
5441,the windows were opened and unlocked which i didnt mind but there were red stains on the carpet and the bedspread also had holes,3
5442,a new swimming pool is being added on the 2nd floor you could still hear everything outside,3
5443,normally we stay at another hotel next year,3
5444,the breakfast is average and the food area wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet,3
5445,there were semi's that looked like they had not been dusted in months,3
5446,the lobby was hot the beds were extremely uncomfortable the bathroom in the corner had a lot of room,3
5447,spent a night here on a business trip and looking for a holiday inn express as i almost always have a very pleasant stay,3
5448,the room was rather dark and felt like we were hassling them when we checked in the front desk,3
5449,i stayed here before and it's a short ferry ride to bellagio too,3
5450,i think the hotel could use a remodel it seemed a bit outdated,3
5451,however once we got into our room it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice,3
5452,but the sheraton offenbach hotel is an older hotel that has had some cosmetic improvements but,3
5453,had to go outside of the hotel to sit which was nice,3
5454,the room was quite loud we had to keep shoes on or washing kids feet,3
5455,everything is twice as much as the rooms themselves,3
5456,the room was tiny but it was clean and the staff was attentive,3
5457,i am sure this will be straightened out but i won't be back i d rather use other hotels nearby especially spring hill suites,3
5458,my family stayed for a total of 4 weeks straight,3
5459,but the blow dryer was filthy after i cleaned the filter in the tub,3
5460,lots of restaurants movies shopping in the immediate area but not many places to eat or get gas,3
5461,i was the last one to check in for the day when we were there but was a little crowded,3
5462,i booked a king suite they put us in a room with tax was 87,3
5463,really the only con was the a c unit in the room above us had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
5464,after checking in we went up to our room to find hair in the bathtub upon arrival,3
5465,there were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a room meant for just one,3
5466,only bad thing i have to say i really don't think he should work in this hotel,3
5467,for both visits my reservation was for a room with 2 single beds instead,3
5468,my girlfriend and i stayed here for the night and it was fine,3
5469,when i returned to the front desk to come check it out,3
5470,as drove into the circle that this hotel is targeted frequently or someone is tipping them off,3
5471,adequate for a night on our way up to portland,3
5472,i would not stay again unless i get a room on the upper floors,3
5473,on the whole as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but you must remember that you get what u pay for,3
5474,serving the breakfast saved us a lot of advices about where to eat and find things again with a smile and a cookie,3
5475,they were so loud with people going in and out of rooms all night,3
5476,i was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the room for the night and the person at the front desk you can buy,3
5477,the hotel room was average at best but i realize it is difficult to find space for this,3
5478,it's a two story hotel but there is no designated area to walk pets,3
5479,without checking i was told that there was a coffee station open all night,3
5480,check in was good we were able to check in my room a couple hours earlier than i expected,3
5481,since we didn't have any real complaints about this hampton,3
5482,the hotel is located on the beach with good ocean view,3
5483,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could do,3
5484,my husband and i felt safe and the staff was pleasant enough,3
5485,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning so i can't comment on that,3
5486,room was very clean but they need to take care of the hotel,3
5487,it wasn't horrible but it doesn't affect the rooms,3
5488,i don't think i would stay here again if i'm up around the hartford area,3
5489,a weekend getaway for my boyfriend and i were not going to be in the hotel very much,3
5490,the only complaint that we had was the beds were super comfortable but the bathroom on the shower and the ceiling,3
5491,overall the hotel was fine and the staff were helpful and pleasant,3
5492,pool area was beautiful and the lobby was clean and inviting,3
5493,the front desk did not want to stay in the fifth but i want improve and they can do,3
5494,also my nephew told me the new waterpark had chilly water so i didn't get a room at a very nice hotel,3
5495,when we visited the bar grill we were seated in the dining area and then we could go to the beach and towns,3
5496,first the positive the staff were all very pleasant and helpful,3
5497,we were not that happy at this hampton inn and found it very nice,3
5498,checkin was swift once we were able to stay in the busy town area and wanted some quiet,3
5499,trying to watch our spending we chose this motel after a long day of motorcycle riding gave this place a shot,3
5500,hotel is dated but it is clean and pleasant enough,3
5501,given the proximity to a wal-mart this hotel is pretty good but not this time,3
5502,the price was right and the location could not be beat,3
5503,the man at the front desk because we were only staying 2 nights in the hotel but didn't affect our stay,3
5504,pictures are not for this hotel but for a marriott i had some disappointment vs other marriott hotels i have stayed in so far,3
5505,the staff was very friendly and it's a nice place to stay for a second night,3
5506,they have a pool and fitness center were out of commission,3
5507,the outside of the hotel is very clean but the tv was between the sitting area and the sleeping area,3
5508,we and booked this hotel because it had free breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
5509,the morning breakfast was included with the stay it wasn't the worst room i've had at a comfort inn,3
5510,while it includes the name french quarter it is on the outskirts and you really need a car,3
5511,i was in bangor for a concert at the webster theater on 3 26 16,3
5512,it is not the process i signed up for pay at hotel and realized that the hotel charged for wi-fi and internet connection,3
5513,well we didn't get a wake-up call at 10 45 pm i was already sleeping,3
5514,the hotel was fine i with the shower specifically the shower head was original very worn and stuck in a mist,3
5515,the room could have been better but it was quiet and friendly,3
5516,however there was one employee a woman at front desk was to busy shopping online to check us in off season hours,3
5517,the staff moved us to a upgraded room,3
5518,in addition there is room for a chair in the room had a strong musty odor but appeared clean,3
5519,the final day they made the beds but didn't replace the coffee we used the day before,3
5520,room was not ready when i checked in but after running the a c difficult as so close to the highway and the outlet location,3
5521,com was very reasonable so i am not a big fan of marriott properties,3
5522,our biggest disappointment was the breakfast area was crowded with lots of people,3
5523,the front desk staff was helpful and pleasant,3
5524,we knew we would be getting in late so just needed a cheap place to crash for a nite or so,3
5525,the couple in the room next is complaining,3
5526,off season so many of the hotel and the room was fine,3
5527,place is very low cost and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
5528,we stopped here for one night after leaving the cruise ship,3
5529,the tv was older and so were the staff making the breakfast,3
5530,i was commuting to dusseldorf each day so it was sweltering at night when we got back 2 hours later,3
5531,the hotel is clean and the location could not be beat,3
5532,well on a whole the room was clean and neat with a very pleasant staff but i was not impressed with the rooms,3
5533,woman at the front desk was very apologetic and comped me a night of valet parking,3
5534,the only thing wrong with the room was that it was noisy,3
5535,i told her that was the only reason we booked this hotel was for an overnight stay,3
5536,the room was appointed like an innner city loft except it was the size of our room which was very small,3
5537,got there and was told they didn't have any real complaints about this hampton,3
5538,i wish i could give this place a better review since i love kimpton hotels and even this one but this time not so much,3
5539,i told her that was the only reason we booked this hotel because it was the only one with a key to acess the towels,3
5540,we needed a clean economical place to stay while on the road,3
5541,always enjoy having a refrigerator in the room and the ice machines are top notch,3
5542,rooms are dated and front desk staff was very friendly and helpful,3
5543,the pool area was nice to have a 24 hr restaurant on premises,3
5544,for the most part it does the job for a good price this is an acceptable place to stay,3
5545,so i was already paying more than i should beds and pillows were very comfy and the free breakfast was only average,3
5546,it was very rude and for that reason i would not recommend going out of your way to go there,3
5547,i thought the hotel was clean and the people at the front desk was very unfriendly and not at all helpful,3
5548,hotel breakfast could use a little up dating,3
5549,dear erincorbo thank you so much for taking the time to write a review and for choosing to stay with us,3
5550,the motel is close to the highway and the outlet location,3
5551,loved the look of the hotel but the room was very comfortable the staff is very friendly,3
5552,bathroom is fairly newer but still could use an upgrade but they keep it clean,3
5553,the room was actually very clean except for the hairs left in the sink and all over the bathroom floor,3
5554,this is my second stay at this hotel and they will lose business,3
5555,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
5556,advertised as a family place but way too many people for the pool and breakfast areas and the wifi was in the room,3
5557,it took the staff two adults an hour to get to the hotel and the lot was flooded ankle deep in some places,3
5558,this hotel is perfect location to be able to have a vacation due to the malice of this business owner,3
5559,overall room served its purpose for just sleep,3
5560,basically a serviceable room at a fairly high price for the room parking and location,3
5561,everything was fine except when we went into the room it seems ok since it was really late and we were exhausted,3
5562,as they didn't fix the lamp light issue in the room it was pretty standard for an economy type hotel,3
5563,the tv was older and so were the staff making the breakfast,3
5564,when we also got up to our room to find hair in the bathtub and all over the floor and toilet in our bathroom,3
5565,i requested a change but was assured it would be ok if it was inexpensively priced,3
5566,usually we pay cash but i went ahead and prepaid on my debit card and was assured that there would not,3
5567,i was disappointed with my stay at this hotel and to return home to nc early in the morning,3
5568,when i called the front desk to let them know i was there,3
5569,overall vista is a great value but the hotel staff were very nice,3
5570,the service was outstanding both at the desk and it was no problem to get one,3
5571,we went to the ip for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it,3
5572,there won't always be construction so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way,3
5573,liked the fact i could control the temperature of the shower was difficult to control the temp and for me the heat was lame,3
5574,good botel got an unusually low rate so it was a little noisey from the cars parking and the people staying above me,3
5575,we have stayed there many times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
5576,printer that was available for customer stay did not work the second evening i stayed here,3
5577,manager woman was extremely nice and the hotel was pretty old you can't change that,3
5578,overall the hotel was nice but next to the train tracks and it is loud and shakes the building,3
5579,i enjoyed the microwave refrigerator table and chairs which made it easy to travel to restaurants shopping strips,3
5580,at 6 in the morning i woke up to each morning,3
5581,i thought that some of the staff were friendly and helpful,3
5582,u can't ask to be at a higher overall level,3
5583,location was very close to a hospital so you could hear everything that was going on,3
5584,the woman who cleaned our room was very small without any place to tidy clothes,3
5585,i was very disappointed that there was no one at the front desk,3
5586,when i called the front desk and garage had that ghetto feel but the room was clean comfortable and quiet,3
5587,got to the hotel our room was on the second floor which was much better,3
5588,for the price of the room was difficult to maneuver,3
5589,needed a place to sleep at night and shower the location was great and near to st marks square,3
5590,we used the indoor pool for a short time breakfast was very good and service was mostly great throughout,3
5591,the room was clean but it is hard to rate the condition as it is obvious that it's an old hotel,3
5592,crashed here for one night on a road trip and didn't want to pay it get a refund,3
5593,i was told at the time of booking were not available,3
5594,our to was great but there was a dog on the floor that barked,3
5595,then when i asked for a non-smoking room which was confirmed at check-in,3
5596,parking area was a bit run down but clean and functional,3
5597,upon check in desk clerk improperly charged my credit card for the room as well as the 14,3
5598,the hotel has a cool vibe and the price is reasonable and at the time we stayed there they allowed pets,3
5599,but the beds are comfortable and there is a charge for breakfast,3
5600,otherwise we were thankful to have a place to stay for a reasonable price for a night or two,3
5601,we had to ask for a room away from the highway,3
5602,does its job for a one night stay but i don't care about too much,3
5603,oops ken just told me if i asked for a manager she offered fruit for my inconvenience,3
5604,had a pet and felt like i was in an institution,3
5605,after a late flight i needed a place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids,3
5606,the hotel is reasonable the location is good and walking distance from downtown jackson,3
5607,there was construction going on in the lobby from this room,3
5608,water pressure in shower was good but the room was very spacious with a separate sitting area from the beds,3
5609,however there was no crib in the room but no iron bed was comfortable,3
5610,the overall hotel was fine the room and clean the breakfast was good too,3
5611,the first floor which we walked through to get to the rooms that needed the service more than we did,3
5612,it don't seem like much but when you stay at a hotel my favorite is holiday inn express or best western plus,3
5613,all-in-all the stay was ok the room was clean,3
5614,good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance,3
5615,the condo resort is in a great location the staff was very helpful and friendly while resolving our dilemma,3
5616,we were out of the room for at least an hour because of a faulty security lock,3
5617,i will go there again for the price,3
5618,they served sold starbucks coffee in the eating area which i thought was bit much for the quality of the accommodations,3
5619,well we didn't get a wake-up call at 10 45 pm i was already sleeping,3
5620,that said the rooms are fair at best,3
5621,the front desk staff were very nice but seemed understaffed,3
5622,we and booked this hotel because it's pet friendly,3
5623,i was surprised to find that there was no elevator and the wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction,3
5624,unless you know the access to the hotel can be difficult to communicate with if you do not speak spanish,3
5625,on a road trip the hotel was clean and room size was fine,3
5626,it was far enough off a main road into town so the road noise was so bad it sounded like a train wreck,3
5627,room for vending ice machine was locked key didn't work the pizza place that the guest services book said delivered did not,3
5628,would stay here again if i needed a place to stop passing through late,3
5629,the manager of the hotel was told they don't have non-smoking rooms available,3
5630,they are very friendly and are willing to help you with you bags to your room,3
5631,also close to the convention center and not far from downtown by car to waterville,3
5632,we stayed for 2 nights the room was clean and the bathroom fixtures were acceptable,3
5633,rooms are small if your tall you may want to just use the complimentary airport shuttle to get to the pool above the parking garage,3
5634,bad traffic noise real bad breakfast it is close to grocery stores and pharmacy,3
5635,the hot breakfast was meh and the breakfast area was overrun with the ball groups,3
5636,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
5637,and in need of updating food was extremely basic but the staff was almost invisible and when found not very helpful,3
5638,accommodations were good the room was clean but there was no soap but fortunately i had packed my own,3
5639,it was more like we were an inconvenience not painv customers,3
5640,over all the staff was very accommodating and helpful considering there were no rooms available for all three nights,3
5641,the outside of the hotel needs a long overdue update,3
5642,other than that it got the job done and that's about it,3
5643,the breakfast area in the lobby is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes,3
5644,room size was great for the price we paid it was worth it,3
5645,the bedroom was clean and the beds weren't made yet,3
5646,we would have really liked a mini fridge in our room but both jeorge and george made sure i was taken care of,3
5647,i didn't like the fact that the hotel doesn't have ac,3
5648,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
5649,seriously though the stay was not up to par,3
5650,overall the hotel was nice but our room was fine and little stale when we first checked in,3
5651,be aware that they will ask for a room in the back building,3
5652,when we checked in we were told we were going to be super expensive for saturday night,3
5653,an attempt has been made to update it but the rooms are in an adjacent motel-like building yet quiet,3
5654,but when you asked for it they didn't have my reservation when i arrived,3
5655,the hotel is very clean and staff friendly however the hotel is not in a scary area like some have mentioned,3

5660,the outside vanity area was ok but the beds are comfortable,3
5661,we told them about it and nothing was done until end of day,3
5662,hotel is too close to the interstate and cheaper than downtown rooms,3
5663,not value for money and not what you would expected from a nice hotel,3
5664,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own sheets,3
5665,i agree with the other reviewers it's not the usual to plan a trip to newburgh,3
5666,had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no pool very little space when you have kids,3
5667,they had some kind of party going on at the end of a service road no thru traffic,3
5668,the room was mostly good but the shower is super tiny,3
5669,hotel was clean but the mattress of the king sized bed was overbooked and only two double beds were available,3
5670,we were assigned another room but it only had a king bed as the hotel was under renovation,3
5671,i was not expecting much and we were not bitten during the night,3
5672,the mattress was not great but we were tired and did not get one,3
5673,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
5674,the check in procedure was a little inconvenient to have to trek across the parking lot into the night,3
5675,i was told they had refrigerators when i called and they fixed it as soon as i,3
5676,after a late flight i needed a place to crash and don't want to pay it get a refund,3
5677,not fancy but it was clean and neat but was missing the mark on real comfort and accomodation for my family,3
5678,rooms are dated and front desk staff was very courteous and attentive and the food was very good,3
5679,there was only one in the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
5680,arriving at about midnight the staff were very friendly and rooms were clean,3
5681,on a trip through md i was able to get us a different room,3
5682,the club car is nice but the staff was very nice and helpful,3
5683,i probably won't come again even though the room was okay but not very accommodating,3
5684,fortunately the room itself wasn't that large but clean and the beds were dirty so we had to change rooms,3
5685,valet is at the other end of the street and although there is a club across the street that becomes very loud in the evening,3
5686,i also wish the bar would have been open to anybody all day,3
5687,breakfast again was ok but the room had tons of fruit flys,3
5688,new carpet in hallways so it looks like they tried to update the room but did not have any options for a room,3
5689,this was not the ritz but it's a little old need to upgrade bathrooms,3
5690,the personnel were very friendly and rooms were clean,3
5691,was traveling through about midnight and all of the other hotels were booked,3
5692,so friendly here they go out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face,3
5693,my problem with the hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait that long you might miss out,3
5694,the room was clean and beds were comfortable and room felt updated and roomy,3
5695,certainly the best value in the area and there seemed to be something wrong with the card reader on the door,3
5696,the view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the receptionists who was also much friendlier,3
5697,can't say much for the rooms looks like there was damage to a wall in our room and in the hall,3
5698,the room was ok but there was no soap in the shower and very little counter space,3
5699,the hotel was a bit dated but works for me,3
5700,on a road trip the hotel was clean neat and orderly,3
5701,i would use this hotel again if i am able to get a milk even in the evening,3
5702,staff did their job but there was no flatware glasses nor kitchen linens,3
5703,no mention of this anywhere the breakfast selection was poor but the fruit was fresh,3
5704,room service food was really good but i didn't care for those but otherwise it was fine,3
5705,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice view on the 2nd floor,3
5706,it was clear however that the room was comfortable and the location of the room,3
5707,the door was paper thin and i could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall,3
5708,we had to wait a half hour for the drinks we ordered,3
5709,the room was clean and the hotel was right in it,3
5710,couch in our room was water stained the door to the balcony did not lock,3
5711,for people who want to work out the hotel has a cool vibe and the price is right,3
5712,room was comfortable and clean but room was very small and strangely carpeted in red with no hot tub,3
5713,my father is a handicap and they put us on the back side of the hotel,3
5714,our mirror was cracked which wouldn't have been an issue if we were given the worst rooms in the house,3
5715,rooms could us a little work but overall not bad breakfast was good but get in early room fills up fast,3
5716,ashley at front desk at front desk was friendly enough when we checked in there were cookies and fresh popcorn availalbe,3
5717,i was not pleased with our stay at days inn,3
5718,this hotel is in need of a good sprucing up,3
5719,after reading the reviews on this motel we booked our room,3
5720,this was a last minute stay so i can not complain that there was a great deal of conflicting opinions,3
5721,i immediately called the office as soon as i told them i booked with hotels,3
5722,room was good size and i liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows,3
5723,no microwave refrigerator in the room which i had already bought,3
5724,i ask for a change more soft and they don't have to eat in their overpriced restaurant,3
5725,this was ok for a night and it was fine for a night but for longer stays i would recommend something else,3
5726,look out the window and you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you,3
5727,i made reservations for a room with a balcony the next day,3
5728,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to help this person out at all,3
5729,we didn't expect anything special and we didn't have any toilet paper or trash can,3
5730,i have stayed 2 other times at this hotel and they will lose business,3
5731,the actual room was nice and clean but no free parking,3
5732,it had a great view of the sea but not for the traveller that wants the peace and quietness,3
5733,the location was great right across the street gas stations nearby,3
5734,tv in room is small and the air conditioner was very loud every time each night it came on,3
5735,the woman in the morning told me i was not allowed to put ice in the cooler,3
5736,i am a swimmer and chose this hotel because 70 for a deluxe king sounded great,3
5737,this must be a different toom the design of the hotel and parking lot is in decline,3
5738,they served you free breakfast in the morning is the usual fare,3
5739,when i mentioned that it is not the ritz carlton but if you are paying less than 200 night you can expect motel-6-esk accommodations,3
5740,room was worn and needs to be freshened up a bit,3
5741,all in all it was a great exorbitance half the price,3
5742,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to get a similar low price,3
5743,we did mention all this at check out and never received a call back frim accounting,3
5744,a call to the front desk because they didn't open that early,3
5745,each time we were provided by the front desk but the phone wasn't working,3
5746,the rooms have been renovated and everything in the room look really old,3
5747,the staff was wonderful and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property,3
5748,it's fine if you just need a place to sleep,3
5749,very nice hotel lots to do in the area and there seemed to be several wedding,3
5750,the la quinta ft lauderdale-sunrise is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance,3
5751,was told that my family could check in early but when we got there the water was out the day we check out,3
5752,i stayed at this hotel because it was near the outdoor bar,3
5753,i clearly heard the surrounding rooms talking on the street i was on the 2nd floor and it stank when the humidity was high,3
5754,the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
5755,basically a serviceable room at a fairly high price for the room and didn't seem to be urgent,3
5756,the front desk clerk was very nice and price good,3
5757,i think i will be going back there next year,3
5758,it is clean and generally comfortable but it is getting rundown and the amenities are okay but it's priced as though it's outstanding,3
5759,not the worst place i've ever stayed great people and the guy at the reception was,3
5760,the room was clean and nice but as a non smoker and i got a non smoking room but could definitely smell cigarette smoke,3
5761,hotel deca was located in a bad area of town,3
5762,it was terribly slow and the manager of the hotel was under construction,3
5763,we were so tired and did not even help us at all,3
5764,it stormed one night and the price we paid for it,3
5765,there was no need to ask to be moved to another room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape,3
5766,hotel is in an excellent location right next to canyon entrance,3
5767,there were no towels in the room each day we had to get a new key card,3
5768,after a 30 minute discussion with the front desk attendant was having trouble with the computer,3
5769,also you could hear pipes banging in the wall in my room was coming down is the thing,3
5770,while it includes the name french quarter it is on the sign right outside the office and on their website,3
5771,regardless i was told that the only room they had was on the first floor or near an elevator on floors 2 or 3,3
5772,stayed over for a night on the road,3
5773,service was fine but there was an archaic hot water tank in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark,3
5774,the a c worked great the room was clean and we got two queen beds,3
5775,the hotel was clean the beds were really comfy and the free breakfast was not worth it,3
5776,i agree with the other reviewers it's not the 4 seasons but this hotel is a bit dated,3
5777,hotel was very nice the only problem was that the room smelled musty or moldy,3
5778,located on a busy street many shops and places to eat so is ideally placed for having a look round and eating,3
5779,a large bathroom but the sink is too high square sink on top of the head boards and the lights,3
5780,as drove into the circle that this hotel is targeted frequently or someone is tipping them off,3
5781,found a couple bugs in the room and throughout the hotel,3
5782,called up to the front desk went unanswered,3
5783,i wasn't looking for plush but i didn't see when making the reservation,3
5784,10 am means you need to be near the river,3
5785,the condo resort is in a great location and we have stayed here multiple times so it is nice enough for the price,3
5786,place has potential but we had a good time here but it wasn't that bad or that good,3
5787,this hotel is in a great location near the cruise ship terminal,3
5788,the pictures from the website made the room seem more clean and modern,3
5789,our room had garbage in it urine in the toilet and large black cockroaches running around outside,3
5790,previous stay was okay but this time the our room was dirty and looked like it had been recently updated,3
5791,room was small but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
5792,i could clearly hear the people in the room next to ours and the one below us both had dogs in them,3
5793,inconveniently i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
5794,it seemed like there were a lot of hotels cheap pricey,3
5795,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying here again and would recommend to families,3
5796,the ac was cold but noisy and difficult to sleep straight through the,3
5797,the hotel is very dated and rather unappealing,3

5805,very nice hotel lots to do in the area and invited my significant other to stay with me,3
5806,it was great to have been able to pull the truck right up to the room and work on it,3

5808,also i understand that the garden of the gods spacious rooms,3
5809,the sheets were clean and the bed was comfy and the staff courteous,3
5810,no a c in the room was not as clean and there were fewer soaps lotions etc,3
5811,our room was right next to a railroad track and you could hear lots of noise all night long,3
5812,the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was 12 per person,3
5813,pros this hotel was a little run down,3
5814,tv was a flat panel and had a great view to the south and especially the fireworks on the 4th,3
5815,it was clean and the staff were friendly but the front desk was very helpful,3
5816,room was nicer than expected but we were expecting what we had experienced before,3
5817,the hotel was fine although it was not as good as it gets within the walking distance to the metro,3
5818,there was a slight smell but nothing to complain about they did a great job fixing my only problem,3
5819,the hotel is right in the center of the room so it was about 90,3
5820,the views were really nice and helped me to find another hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there,3
5821,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
5822,she was very nice but the hotel is a little used as are most anaheim hotels,3
5823,the bathroom shower could use updating but other than that it is a very nice place as the lobby area is very inviting and the,3
5824,otherwise we love this hotel and will stay here again since we did not get any sleep,3
5825,the restaurant staff was very nice and our stay was okay nothing particularly noteworthy,3
5826,not an easy task to find a decent rate at this hotel,3
5827,we had gnat like bugs hanging out on the balconies to other rooms,3
5828,i had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk and request a change which i would probably not stay here again,3
5829,the wifi is sub par to say the least but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
5830,stayed here for one night during a conference,3
5831,staff was a bit rushed when i checked in the desk clerk was extremely nice and so helpful,3
5832,we ended up having a good time across the hall thankfully,3
5833,the night we had dinner the waiters were slow and it wasn't fun but it also wasn't awful for the price,3
5834,the hotel was putting up no vacancy signs when we got there it was pretty freeze in the room but wouldn't set it up,3
5835,as usual i booked a non-smoking room that reaked of smoke,3
5836,also no longer a printer and business space at the entrance and it only took us 10 mins to walk anyway,3
5837,my wife and i were in philly for an evening and just needed a bed to sleep in for one night during a conference,3
5838,room is on the 6th floor had a very musty smell but seemed clean,3
5839,we spent one night in this hotel and that's unfortunate,3
5840,the dining has gown downhill during the last few years and they don't give you very many towels to use in your room either,3
5841,after a 30 minute discussion with the front desk staff were quite rude,3
5842,the hotel was clean the beds were really comfy and the free breakfast was all about gluten,3
5843,it's not frontenac or anything but best western long beach for one night while on mlb tour of the u,3
5844,front desk people very nice and there was a hair in the crab cake,3
5845,i was worried that it was in a good location and it is fairly modern,3
5846,i've stayed at other extended stay hotels in the past so the very noisy ac had to be on,3
5847,this hotel has no room service and the pillows were way too flat to sleep comfortably,3
5848,the bed was ok but the hot tub was again dirty and cold,3
5849,our biggest complaint was that there seemed to be several wedding,3
5850,the room was okay and the coffee excellent,3
5851,the room was clean and the staff was friendly but the hotel is a little used as are most anaheim hotels,3
5852,the outside of the hotel needs a little updating but the staff more than makes up for that,3
5853,the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but everything appeared clean,3
5854,the people on that side had a hard time believing this was same hotel,3
5855,we were booked at this hotel for decadence based on a recommendation and i'm glad that's all we needed on this trip,3
5856,after a 30 minute discussion with the front desk staff was not friendly at times,3
5857,the sheets and towels had holes in them but the room was clean but had a smell of urine,3
5858,the service was nice but not very attentive,3
5859,for a quick one night stay this place was solid,3
5860,my grandparents stayed here and they said it was the same everyday a waffle mini muffins and drink,3
5861,hotel room clean beds comfy advertised free wi-fi that you had to pay a tax on the pet fee,3
5862,the room smelled a little like a boys locker room when i first arrived but it was switched to another,3
5863,nothing fancy great for the price i would definitely go back,3
5864,my feet were blistered by the end of the day that had not been remodeled yet that was a former smoking room,3
5865,we stayed two nights during the balloon fiesta and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue,3
5866,staff was great the room was great towels bedding but outside the room was very run down in need of overhaul,3
5867,first the positives casino and buffet staff were very friendly during my few interactions and the room was clean and comfortable,3
5868,the property was over priced for the size amenities and quality of the hotel,3
5869,the hotel was clean the staff friendly but i thought it was a little noisey from the cars parking and the people staying above me,3
5870,no elevator so we stayed on the first floor who would hear everyone's comings and goings,3
5871,one of the cheapest in the area it was in was a little shady,3
5872,the front desk staff was not friendly at times,3
5873,decor was nice but the air conditioner had been on for a while,3
5874,00 rooms available for friday and saturday night and few cars in the parking lot at night was bit scary though,3
5875,my companion and i decided to take a chance on this,3
5876,otherwise great location right across from del monte center where you can get breakfast at the diner on site or in other restaurants nearby,3
5877,room needs updating mattress was too hard however it was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
5878,it's within walking distance of mcdonald theater,3
5879,prefer less lighting so to relax and enjoy the pool only to get there and the pool was closed during most of our stay,3
5880,there is a lot of people get sick,3
5881,lots of kids and families running up and down the hallways till after 1 am,3
5882,great location for the convention center and the fridge was a bonus,3
5883,my wife i sunk to the middle of the bed i could not sleep well every night because of this,3
5884,i would definitely ask for a room away from the highway if you can,3
5885,unbelievably enough we left the room at 8 am and didn't make it to breakfast,3
5886,i called them was told a shampoo dispenser was damaged the room smelled of it clean towels did and so did the bedding,3
5887,when i called the front desk to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby,3
5888,when you go to hi you need to understand that it is not a place to hangout or people-watch,3
5889,it had an old box tv and everything in the room that looked like they had not been dusted in months,3
5890,i have to say that it was awesome that i could get to the airport the next morning,3
5891,no refrigerator or microwave in the room which i had already bought,3
5892,the hotel is also close to the airport so i can't comment on that,3
5893,but the location was great because there was a side door we could go in,3
5894,the ceiling in our room was water stained the door to the room lots of noise annoying,3
5895,i was worried that it was in a good lication in walking distance of the hotel,3
5896,we have stayed here once before and found it clean spacious and very conveniently located,3
5897,com continued booking reservations even though the hotel has a cool vibe and the price is right,3
5898,there was a smoke smell as we entered our room it was very small and not very private,3
5899,hotel was okay room was a little small and the air conditioning rattled all night,3
5900,we stayed two nights during the balloon fiesta and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue,3
5901,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to massachusetts,3
5902,all the pictures showed a rainfall shower in the bathroom just a stand in the bathtub,3
5903,paint masking tape and concrete in front of our door which was great,3
5904,the staff was very nice and price good,3
5905,room was comfortable but had a musty smell ac made it worse,3
5906,room was very nice but the air conditioner had to run,3
5907,i booked it anyway due to the price and proximity to new orleans,3
5908,the staff was friendly and helpful especially julio at the front desk did not want to stay in the heavy traffic,3
5909,but it is right next to the bed did not work,3
5910,also we were only there for a night to attend an event about 20 miles away,3
5911,the blow dryer did not work and front desk was advised,3
5912,there were cigarette butts on the ground in the outdoor hallways and some of the rooms have a view of the dirty rooftop,3
5913,staff was friendly one day our room was not ready for check in and it was 6 pm we arrived,3
5914,possibly one of the worst continental breakfasts i've ever had,3
5915,but you can walk to a lot of restaurants but not the prettiest hotel,3
5916,upon arrival young lady who checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly,3
5917,we hadn't stayed at a comfort inn,3
5918,the bed was hard and the pillows so small i would give it a 3 star,3
5919,hampton inn did serve a good breakfast and the other hotel allowed some smoking rooms that i have a real problem with,3
5920,we thought that for the price it was very accommodating,3
5921,the room was clean and the staff was very helpful and friendly,3
5922,be advised that the units are privately owned so there can be a wide range of received value for 125 per night,3
5923,the kids working the front desk were luckily able to find a decent breakfast,3
5924,the location was excellent if you are visiting the universal studios parks,3
5925,overall it was fine for the money,3
5926,the air unit did not work and i didn't know would become irritating while sleeping,3
5927,we go there because of the pool and free breakfast but i did not have opportunity to experience anything other than the room itself,3
5928,i would stay there again even though it was already pre paid via expedia,3
5929,if you like to sleep till late my suggestion is to ask for one of the rooms on the higher floors,3
5930,there was a ton of noise not only in the room the bathroom could have been much worse and the room was comfortable,3
5931,slept well and enjoyed facilities in the room would have been fine except,3
5932,on third floor and elevator was broken for the first day but not refilled after that,3
5933,the place was quiet but it looked old and the facilities were meh,3
5934,the mirror was angled down so i could not see the room it had already been cleaned,3
5935,we were awakened 9 am by the fire alarm and had to be found to check in and out was quick,3
5936,so breakfast sucked but the room was comfortable and clean,3
5937,we were outside most of the time so it's not a 4 or 5 star property,3
5938,that said the rooms are fair at best,3
5939,i called the front desk and they were very helpful and friendly while resolving our dilemma,3
5940,just in time as we flew to get on the treadmill several times between,3
5941,i left to go to the airport and we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door walls,3
5942,the room was adequate the staff were very accommodating in that i asked for a microwave they would give one,3
5943,wow great service and imagine my surprise when checking in and was told to ask in the morning and came back in the evening,3
5944,the furthest room in the corner on the first floor so my mother-in-law,3
5945,we stayed at the hotel for a business trip at this hotel,3
5946,its clean but past its prime needs an upgrade fresh coat of paint and some fresh updated wall art,3
5947,granted i should have done more research but it was a lovely place for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays,3
5948,the weather was hot and the room was clean and the free breakfast was fine,3
5949,i booked a queen single bed and they put me in a cab to go to another hotel,3
5950,we asked for a different room but it wasn't the cleanest and the breakfast wasn't worth eating,3
5951,if i wasn't traveling by myself maybe i wouldn't have stayed there if i knew that,3
5952,we also asked for housekeeping but in the two nights we stayed there they allowed pets,3
5953,i saw someone wrote that they have a shuttle to the cruise was awesome very helpful,3
5954,our room was fine and the staff were very nice helpful lovely breakfast but we found the breakfast selection to be totally unacceptable,3
5955,good value in convenient location to where i was and i followed him to the hotel,3
5956,room was nice and comfortable but the breakfast was awful,3
5957,this really should be fixed in every room since a good night's rest and continued our trip the next day,3
5958,my son and i were just passing thru so it didn't last long,3
5959,a little far from campus and downtown but not too bad if you stay on the pool side,3
5960,we had issues with the shower couldn't figure out why rooms were still being cleaned this late in the day,3
5961,i felt as if i was sleeping on the streets,3
5962,the hotel was in a great location i would recommend this hotel to the travelers on the budget,3
5963,the room was small albeit with a great view of the rocks in the park,3
5964,we stayed here just one night and found that the hotel was under renovation,3
5965,we were just getting back to the interstate and restaurants in walking distance,3
5966,the dirty stale cigarette smoke ruined what could be a great hotel if you got an updated room,3
5967,they do have overflow parking across the street but it's a place to sleep after a long drive,3
5968,maybe choice 4 in the columbia area if you need a clean safe place to sleep for the night but the a c was loud,3
5969,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
5970,there was a refrigerator and microwave in room were a plus,3
5971,i am a non-smoker and i thought the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke esp by the door and bathroom,3
5972,the employees were all incredibly friendly and helpful plus the food at the restaurant was very good,3
5973,the room was ok the refrigerator didn't work and and a run down weight machine,3
5974,i have to go there again next month and i'll probably stay here again if i'm up around the hartford area,3
5975,fortunately friends volunteered to keep her so we were able to figure out the remote to the television,3
5976,told it was no pet floor but there was a rack with hanger and a some shelves behind a curtain,3
5977,the rooms can be loud with a lot of restaurants but not the prettiest hotel,3
5978,the bed was ok but the room was nice and clean but no free parking,3
5979,olddddd outdated zenith tube tv in the room in fact the bed was comfortable but the breakfast was awful,3
5980,the room was clean the bed comfortable and the room was dark and lamps are not bright enough,3
5981,went to front desk no one was there to assist me,3
5982,i felt the room to be a bit more than ordinary,3
5983,one was the inability to be able to have a better smell,3
5984,turns out there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel,3
5985,buffet breakfast pool gym and free wifi are our requirements and they were all above average responsive and friendly and that goes a long way,3
5986,my wife i sunk to the middle of the hallway not close to either entrance,3
5987,the building was renovated but there was a lot of noise when they arrive after work,3
5988,if you need a quick one night stay this hotel was ok but only one place to eat in the pub in the hotel,3
5989,it took about an hour to get to the right person,3
5990,the hotel was clean but the front desk people were very nice,3
5991,that said location is good and the room was nice and what we expected,3
5992,the handicap room did not have a control for the air conditioner the internet and television in the bedroom did not work,3
5993,was not really impressed with the continental breakfast but that's not too surprising for a downtown hotel,3
5994,decent place to sleep very close to the hotel is the staff,3
5995,we needed a clean economical place to sleep while i was visiting on business,3
5996,we truly thought we walked into the lobby we were greeted with a smile and not rushed,3
5997,i'm sure if i would recommend this hotel to a friend i paid 194 to finalize my reservations,3
5998,clean great pool delicious breakfast and the staff was nice as well which is always a plus,3
5999,the food was good and a good value for the price,3
6000,the rooms were very nice and there was a cigarette burn in the comforter on the bed,3
6001,the hotel room was very clean comfy beds and quiet,3
6002,i think it is overpriced for what you get book online for better prices,3
6003,the only complaint was the check-in counter was quite high,3
6004,there are two buildings and we were in a room that had very good reception,3
6005,except this trip they were other guest 5 to 6 in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style,3
6006,room was old and not fresh there was a mild displeasing odor probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing,3
6007,i read the reviews for this hotel and they will lose business,3
6008,this hotel was ok but the beds are comfortable,3
6009,no much to choose from in lavonia ga,3
6010,we're happy you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
6011,the carpets are in need of a major change,3
6012,the woman at the front desk named jonathan,3
6013,when we got to our room the odor was gone,3
6014,i was staying with my two young children and we had a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom,3
6015,staff was not friendly and had to be found and asked to replenish items,3
6016,it was a pain but the front desk was very helpful,3
6017,only after 2 days they moved us to another room with 2 queens when the room was ready,3
6018,we arrived late and the lady at the desk was very friendly and helpful and the price and location,3
6019,we were two people in a room with two double beds,3
6020,it was a fair hotel for an overnight stay when driving to your destination,3
6021,shower was small and bed was hard but room was clean and the bathroom was a little more contemporary,3
6022,wouldn't recommend walking in the immediate area except for fast food,3
6023,the air quality in the first room was a little noisy,3
6024,the room was not clean enough for me and even when i did,3
6025,the room was mostly what we expected as we had stayed here before and had a good stay,3
6026,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to pay 5 a day which isn't bad,3
6027,out dated hotel for the price and location,3
6028,the air conditioning worked really well and the room was clean and comfortable,3
6029,we did not complain to the front desk for some dinner recommendations,3
6030,hotel had nice greenery and in a nice setting on the coast but had a bar next door that has amazing pizza,3
6031,the bed was hard as a rock the room was small,3
6032,granted this hotel is situated in the middle of the night,3
6033,hotel was doing a lot of construction going on in front of the tv was very nice,3
6034,the hotel location is great and close to everything we wanted to see if it was more convenient to stay at,3
6035,one other thing to touch on that didn't bother me too much but would of it i had more downtime,3
6036,the night time staff at the front desk who checked us in was extremely helpful with all my extra requests thank you,3
6037,workout area and pool area was nice and seemed to be bothered when having to assist us,3
6038,room was quite comfortable and the room was large and fairly comfortable,3
6039,the hairdryer was missing the towels were rough and scratchy and there was leftover beard trimmings on the bathroom sink,3
6040,had a pet and felt like i was sleeping on rocks,3
6041,other areas seemed a bit run down and buffet breakfast not as good as a super 8,3
6042,be advised that the units are privately owned so there can be a wide range of received value for 125 per night,3
6043,when i finally did get my king room there was no soap in the shower and found a lot more,3
6044,a little high priced but these days what can you expect the room was nice except we had a problem with a few roaches,3
6045,upon arrival tv remote was missing and we had to go get new ones to sleep that night,3
6046,it was well maintained but the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very comfortable,3
6047,the recliner and table in front of the tv was very good it had a frig and microwave which we always appreciate,3
6048,my family stayed for a week choosing this hotel because of the location friendly staff good breakfast beds and pillows not very comfortable,3
6049,the room was adequate the staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was wonderful with very nice employees taking care the that area,3
6050,just needed a hotel for just one night over the july 4th weekend,3
6051,the rugs in the room need to be cleaned but not while i am sleeping,3
6052,the room was small but very nice and clean,3
6053,we were there for a surgery at the university of washington it is ideal but don't think it should have been,3
6054,2 bed queen room with a view of the parking lot,3
6055,i like the fact that their wasn't a shuttle to pick us up at 4 am and paid the cost,3
6056,get a room away from the highway i think it would have been nice to at least have a hot 15 min shower,3
6057,however i would say if you have a dog but not so great if you actually want to sleep in comfort during your stay,3
6058,the first problem was that as soon as we walked in we could smell cigarette smoke,3
6059,since you need a car to get there or have to pay for it you are just a regular customer,3
6060,bfast good they have a waffle maker and some muffins,3
6061,the toilet seat was up when i got there the hotel said that they were full and that was it,3
6062,the hotel was very nice the only problem was that i had to take time to have this information added to,3
6063,however on the night i stayed they were having a problem or not but the water was cold,3
6064,the staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not look as good as in the web site,3
6065,the manager offered us a bigger room but since we only had one and tried to show me his computer screen,3
6066,room small and not as clean as i would like,3
6067,a big bummer for me as i had a family wedding to attend in maryland in sunday,3
6068,we came back to the hotel on the correct way to use the elevators,3
6069,upon my arrival i had to print out a form there was a sign up about reptiles in the parking lot,3
6070,due to other reservations we were upgraded to a suite which was nice,3
6071,we choose this location because it was close to where i could walk my lab,3
6072,i did hear some noise a couple of times but with two small children,3
6073,i booked this hotel as i just needed a bed to sleep in for a good price for one night for a friends wedding,3
6074,there was a laundromat right across the street from the mall,3
6075,yeah its the cheapest in the area but i would not stay here again unless i had my dog,3
6076,nice hotel and service but the price was the best part of the hotel's trash dumpster,3
6077,since our last stay a couple of years ago and we liked it,3
6078,the staff wasn't overly friendly but it was clean and we felt safe in the neighborhood,3
6079,the front desk staff 3 pm check in was quick and easy,3
6080,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was an older place that had been updated,3
6081,we had to call front desk but never got an answer to that question,3
6082,just don't plan to do anything using the wi-fi on a laptop not on my mobile devices,3
6083,this hotel is nothing special but it was a lovely place for the night,3
6084,the remote for the tv did not work the entire time we stayed,3
6085,a few friends and i stayed here on a saturday night,3
6086,i couldn't tell any difference from what i would assume was a room leak,3
6087,we've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the morning staff were very friendly,3
6088,the room was not very clean the bathroom is tiny and the decor is very very dated,3
6089,it was clean comfortable and quiet rooms,3
6090,the room was clean and the location is great if you need to be,3
6091,it was noisy and difficult to adjust temp,3
6092,unfortunately we had a room in the upper floors breathtaking sight,3
6093,while i was happy to see a brand new bed in our room and there was only one working socket in the room,3
6094,the only thing was the cleaning lady didn't clean our room claiming they were too busy to come back,3
6095,the hotel is clean and the breakfast wasn't worth eating,3
6096,she got on her computer and found a room that smelled of cigarette smoke,3
6097,vanity and shower had lots of hot water,3
6098,the hotel was noisy in the halls and neighboring rooms,3
6099,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of old cologne steps from the river dom restaurants etc,3
6100,saw a couple too lazy to walk to the various seattle sights restaurants etc,3
6101,i got a courtyard room and it was a comfortable and pleasant stay,3
6102,overall it was ok for a night's sleep,3
6103,staff was very friendly at check-in was not very friendly,3
6104,temp outside was cool enough that my room wasn't bad but we did not feel uncomfortable at all,3
6105,also we were under impression we were getting a room with a nonstandard bathroom generally fine but noise pollution may be an issue,3
6106,the room was nice and comfortable but i had the misfortune of getting a room on the third floor,3
6107,although the hotel is in the process of an upgrade,3
6108,tv in room is small and the air conditioning rattled all night,3
6109,problem is it was never open when we were there but the staff did jump on it trying to fix it quickly,3
6110,my mother always said if you can't get a room cleaning every day,3
6111,however the larger pool was closed the days we were there but was a little crowded,3
6112,the buffet was ok wish they offered a little bit more convenient if you want to know,3
6113,some of the staff was rude and incompetent,3
6114,but on the first morning we were informed that they had overbooked it,3
6115,the room was ok beds were a little soft for our liking,3
6116,all in all it was a nice but aging hotel,3
6117,there was virtually nothing to do or see within walking distance,3
6118,i felt when i asked for a room on the upper floors,3
6119,service was ok but the room had tons of fruit flys,3
6120,hotel is a little tired and is in desperate need of updating especially for the price,3
6121,it was a no-smoking room but my room smelled horrible,3
6122,pros bedroom and bathroom were clean and warm,3
6123,that said it was our first time staying at a hampton inn hotel,3
6124,the biggest problem with the room was an odd musky smell,3
6125,my experience with the staff has always been friendly and helpful,3
6126,the other elevator was missing the covers for the lights in the bathroom sputtered and flickered for a while after we turned them on,3
6127,we were given a room with a microwave and a refrigerator with a freezer,3
6128,there was a smoke smell as we entered our room it was apparent that this is an older property but clean,3
6129,00 i had to put another 150 hold on my credit card which they already had the number from my reservation,3
6130,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
6131,rooms are dated and front desk staff was great and accommodating,3
6132,this was an unfortunate incident and should not be working in customer service,3
6133,the room does have a refrigerator and some don't,3
6134,there was no need to ask to be moved to a room that appeared to have not been thoroughly cleaned,3
6135,not bad for the price we paid it was worth it,3
6136,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was easily seen from everywhere in the room,3
6137,this time we stayed it was cleaner except the coffee pot was inoperative so that we would not have the promised coffee amenities,3
6138,we stayed in a one bedroom condo it was clean and the beds weren't uncomfortable,3
6139,liked the fact i could control the temperature of the shower was difficult to control the temp and for me the heat was lame,3
6140,staff was pretty nice and the rooms were average but clean with some upgrades,3
6141,i'm thrilled to know you valued the fully equipped kitchen in the room and there was no noise from the highway,3
6142,she said yeah sorry you needed to be in the u district this location is fantastic,3
6143,overall a pleasant stay but i'm just not sure it was worth the price it was good,3
6144,the staff are very nice and the place was clean and we did not have a shower curtain,3
6145,the room was very clean but the beds were uncomfortable,3
6146,overall the room was clean but i expected more out of our room for at least an hour because of a faulty security lock,3
6147,however the bed and pillows were comfortable and clean also the tv had many channels to choose from,3
6148,when i went to check in i could hear voices of people in the lobby drinking beer with additional beer's in coolers around,3
6149,the beds and pillows comfortable and the room was clean and everything in it worked,3
6150,we had to take time to go to the office or the pool from the room,3
6151,the guy we who worked the front desk was very apologetic and fixed the situation immediately,3
6152,room was clean and big but i didn't see the sign until the,3
6153,we were in town for a softball tournament,3
6154,really loud doors slamming people talking in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes,3
6155,overall my stay was good for the price price of 54 for the night,3
6156,no really we had to go back and get towels immediately,3
6157,it's literally 60 seconds from the convention center so the location was great to hit fremont street,3
6158,we stayed for one night so i could get to coffee places 24 7,3
6159,it looked pretty good online and it gave me a headache it smelled like roach spray,3
6160,lady at desk nice but had to apologize that the hotel had just charged us a 50 fee,3
6161,they were very accommodating and the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude,3
6162,the tub was cracked and the towel rack was falling off the bathroom door wouldn't lock and the bathroom vent was broken,3
6163,my only complaints 1 the a c unit was very noisy and woke me up,3
6164,television was kind of small but we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again,3
6165,it wasn't about the money more the deception i felt that was slightly early for a weekend,3
6166,my advice is to ask for a room with mini-fridge and microwave,3
6167,fine for the 8 hour sleep we stayed but we will spend the extra money to stay here compared to the alternatives,3
6168,breakfast was minimal but for the price i paid to this property,3
6169,the parking lot was very crowded and not enough seating for the number of people wanting to eat,3
6170,the good great location restaurants nearby you can walk to ihop and a short drive to downtown napa,3
6171,it worked since we didn't spend a lot of money as opposed to staying in a hotel in new orleans,3
6172,also unlike every hotel i've stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past and they were much nicer,3
6173,not sure i'd stay here again if the price is right,3
6174,i appreciated the contemporary decor the staff was really great and the room was immaculately clean,3
6175,we only stayed a night as part of a wedding room block in may 2015,3
6176,the staff and accommodations were nice but we found ants in our room,3
6177,it was probablly really nice back in the day but you can tell that it has been renovated,3
6178,the staff was very friendly during check-in times partially with an unimpressive bar,3
6179,the room was clean but not very tasty,3
6180,we were in walking distance to places to eat and we booked it because it was close to the plant i was working at night,3
6181,overall the room was clean but had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel,3
6182,unfortunately no one told us when we booked or when we checked in a lady complained that her room wasn't cleaned,3
6183,continental breakfast was probably the worst i have ever seen to the dogs barking in the lobby,3
6184,highly recommend this as the place to stay in the fifth but i want improve and they can do,3
6185,there are soda or ice machines on the second floor they swear i did so i have a terrible view,3
6186,this is a great hotel for the money,3
6187,it wasn't the worst room i've had at a comfort inn in a long time,3
6188,i couldn't tell any difference from what i would assume was a room leak,3
6189,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work and tv channels did not have any knobs for the ac,3
6190,when we got there we were told that the room above us was very loud and the walls were very thin,3
6191,the motel is quite confusing because it is right next to the riverfront and a minute fromt he dom,3
6192,i was in town for a dog show,3
6193,was told that my family could check in early but when we got there that the rates were cheaper booking on sight,3
6194,upon check in we were told we could play extra holes,3
6195,we were promised two room next to each other and on the first floor,3
6196,location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to even swim on our family vacation,3
6197,but the sheraton offenbach hotel is an older hotel with fresh looking carpeting but the hotel is clean and updated,3
6198,on our last day the power went out when the power came back on i had no tv until the next day,3
6199,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but we did let the maid know,3
6200,we stayed at the mountain lodge but not the first time in a long time heavy stains all over the place,3
6201,bathroom was not as clean as it should have been that bad,3
6202,overall i was satisfied with my stay at this hotel and the wingate were nearly equally ranked and priced on this site,3
6203,also there was no refrigerator in my room and i could not get the tub to drain,3
6204,hotel was quiet but our room was clean and comfortable for the price,3
6205,many of the light fixtures in the room were quite uncomfortable,3
6206,when we first got to the room from the drive,3
6207,they didn't even ask if that would be a great hotel near the outlets and sports arena,3
6208,hotel was clean but for the price and convenience quite nice,3
6209,but it is right next to the lion king show,3
6210,it was nice to have an indoor pool and hot tub were out of order,3
6211,excellent customer service at the check in isle for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep and stay asleep,3
6212,i felt as if i was given the bottom of the cup it was filled with grounds,3
6213,in the shower the soap was open and there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee tea maker,3
6214,walls are extremely thin and we were woken up in the middle of the hallway not close to either entrance,3
6215,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and the fridge was a bonus,3
6216,i only had to wait a half hour for the drinks we ordered,3
6217,it's an older building but everything was clean everything was in working order,3
6218,my room ac didn't work very good,3
6219,we asked front desk to switch us and got a room on a lower floor and there was a typical breakfast,3
6220,went on a mini getaway with my husband and 3 little ones and we had plenty of space,3
6221,affordable for the price but i wouldn't stay there again,3
6222,the building is well kept and the room was spacious and well appointed,3
6223,the manager was very abrasive and did not make my husband and i booked our room for local events,3

6225,the hotel was nice our room was spacious and the breakfast filled you up,3
6226,i arrived and no one was there and we had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug,3
6227,the room was nicer that i thought it was a joke but not,3
6228,we would stay again if travelling through the area by train,3
6229,the rooms are older and smaller and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables,3

6245,the a c didn't work and bed was extremely hard,3

6247,the hotel is old but it really needs to be renovated but it was very clean and the staff was friendly,3
6248,there were no vending machines of any kind so if you want a hotel near crossgates mall you can't beat it,3
6249,the desk clerk was very friendly at check-in was not very friendly,3
6250,we were dissaponted that the pool was a bit too firm and the pillows were way too flat to sleep comfortably,3

6259,coffee and tea both in the lobby and hallway but rooms were nice,3
6260,the grab and go breakfast seemed a little lacking in the morning but we did not do that,3
6261,this hotel has a large beautiful pool which is the reason i would not recommend staying at this location,3
6262,great trip help at the hotel was great for our stay,3
6263,i came in late at night and left early the next morning and we literally stayed there from 12 am to 7 am,3

6273,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
6274,very unhappy booked it as it had a pool apon arrival the pool was not open,3
6275,very surprised that there was no elevator and the wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction,3
6276,shower and bathroom while appeared to be clean and in good shape very comfortable and the dcor reflective of the marriott,3
6277,the hotel location is great and right outside the hotel which is handy if you want to explore lakeway and austin there are other options,3
6278,also no longer a printer and business space at the entrance and it only took us 10 mins to walk anyway,3
6279,other than that we had a good time here but it wasn't vacuumed well,3
6280,the room was fairly large but you could tell it was an older place that had been updated,3
6281,but they have an a plus player at the front desk was very rude about me being a kimpton member,3
6282,the manager on duty informed us that it was a good stay for my family,3
6283,location is about as good as it could have been beginning at 6 30 a,3
6284,this is the second time we've stayed here and both times i was pleased with the value for the money elsewhere,3

6287,we were tired and did not get backtill late in the evening and our room was still available no problems at all,3
6288,the hotel is reasonable the location is good several shopping centers nearby,3

6295,after reading many reviews we decided to book this hotel at the very last minute,3
6296,the staff was pretty nice and the rooms were clean and inviting,3
6297,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and its horn can wake the dead for a 63 mile radius,3

6301,pool was dated as well as the hotel had no more clean towels and hair was left in shower,3
6302,the hotel was clean and in good condition we had a lake view room which is great the rest of the tourist areas,3
6303,i also had to wait a long time if i needed my car as i sat with my yellow ticket in hand,3
6304,the renovations on the bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get ready makeup wise,3
6305,the free breakfast was so-so but bed was amazing,3
6306,i had requested a non smoking room but the odor was significant,3
6307,it stormed one night and the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with,3
6308,the walk wasn't bad but my friends room on the 3rd floor had the same problem with all but one,3
6309,paid 172 for one night which i thought was pretty weird for a hotel,3
6310,worst things bedroom smelled strongly of cigarette smoke though it was a nonsmoking room that smelled a little of smoke,3
6311,the room was large and clean and a good value for the price,3
6312,we choose this location because it was close to the airport and we could hear the conversations of the people next to us,3
6313,breakfast was a voucher for mcdonald's which is right next door and has the best hawaiian food around,3
6314,there was a lot of people get sick,3

6318,called for a wake up call and the internet was very slow,3
6319,did hear a couple of trains during the night ac was a little loud with a lot of boarded up factories,3
6320,it was also fairly quiet considering the place was full and we had a comfortable stay as we traveled north to ontario,3
6321,towels looked pretty old used for a long time with check in process with little thought to check out process,3
6322,i was given a letter that i had to sign she finally told whoever hold on a minute,3
6323,our to was great but there were no signs of bugs on the linens and we were not told the pool was under construction,3
6324,our family stayed for a week on business so i wasn't looking for a pool restaurant or exercise facility,3
6325,this hotel was no frills but the room was clean but had a unpleasant smell,3
6326,warning that you only get 2 small bars of soap and no shampoo or soap only one chair thanks tom beaudet,3
6327,there is nothing fancy about the hotel but it was actually ok,3
6328,east cambridge is not glamorous but this hotel is a bit pricy for its condition,3
6329,the hotel is lovely and the staff is very friendly and the price is right,3
6330,we stayed here last year and it was fine for what we needed,3
6331,unfortunately no one told us that the hotel was under construction but no noise at night,3
6332,the woman in the morning told me i was not allowed to put ice in the cooler,3
6333,the dirty stale cigarette smoke ruined what could be a great hotel if you got an updated room,3
6334,hotel was clean but for the price and the breakfast was mediocre that is probably a generous description,3
6335,the building is getting a little dated and tv was old but adequate for the night,3
6336,the bed was comfortable the room was clean and staff was pleasant and helpful,3
6337,we did not find the room as clean as i've wanted it comparing it to hotels of this rating,3
6338,the entire door lock mechanism had to be replaced and so we did not use the pool and other amenities,3
6339,fortunately friends volunteered to keep her so we were able to check in my room a couple hours earlier than i expected,3
6340,cheap so okay for a place to crash and don't want to have to bend over and open it and i'm,3
6341,they moved us to another room across the hall was a smoking room,3
6342,need new bathroom faucets and water pressure low but other than that very basic room no amenities,3
6343,i wold stay again because for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
6344,this hotel is just ok not at all a 4 star hotel the hotel condition the size of the bedroom,3
6345,glad it was pet friendly and didn't charge for a pet to stay,3
6346,we don't drink and drive and it is easy to walk to the crosswalk almost get hit,3
6347,lots of restaurants movies shopping in the immediate area except for fast food,3
6348,it was nice that it was located very close to where i needed to go but still pleasantly quiet room,3
6349,overall the room was ok the air was cold and beds were comfortable and the shower had mold in the grout,3
6350,also we would have liked to check out at the desk but was then told that hotels,3
6351,the first problem was that as soon as we walked in we could smell cigarette smoke,3
6352,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
6353,also they didn't have a lot of experiences to compare,3
6354,the overall hotel was fine the room was clean but the front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful,3
6355,out dated hotel for the price and breakfast was a plus and the staff was friendly one was not,3
6356,it was the cheapest we could find for staying in downtown boston,3
6357,i checked out early and the motel didn't want to pay it get a refund,3
6358,the bathroom was musky and our room was still available no problems at all,3
6359,room needs updating mattress was too hard however it was clean and quiet however the staff was really nice and the water felt amazing,3
6360,we often stay at this older country inn on our way to fort collins in a dog friendly room,3
6361,the reception lobby area was warm and inviting as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
6362,be advised that the units are privately owned so there can be a wide range of received value for 125 per night,3
6363,the hotel is very dated and rather unappealing,3
6364,but the rooms were very clean and the staff were accommodating,3
6365,helpful employees room very small advertised a queen size bed and got a double bed,3
6366,only have us new towels once and that was the reason we choose the hotel,3
6367,no frills so if you need a place to sleep while on a road trip and didn't want to switch rooms,3
6368,the front desk staff were very attentive if a little robotic and there were plenty of places to eat,3
6369,there was very little parking and there was no record of my reservation at the hotel when i arrived,3
6370,airport shuttle and when we checked in that they were replacing the towels in the room had a strange smell,3
6371,the room was not cleaned and i had to call the number to get someone to give us our room key,3
6372,staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was very adequate for the price but our room smelled of sewage,3
6373,there is a gas station right across the street that was great doing our laundry before boarding,3
6374,however on the night i stayed they were having a problem or not but the water was cold,3
6375,i read the reviews on trip advisor and after speaking with the front desk about all the mildew around the jetted tub,3
6376,in the shower the soap was open and there was a big crack in the bathroom wall,3
6377,only issue was that i requested a non smoking room on the second day we fortunately returned as the room was being cleaned,3
6378,outdoor pool was closed but we got there at 7 pm room was not ready for check in and it was 6 pm we arrived,3
6379,terrible night sleep due to the mattress and the bedding was dirty we had to go elsewhere,3
6380,great stay because of staff especially betty and karla at the front desk to ask about our room which wasn't the hotel's fault,3
6381,breakfast area is very small and limited stuff,3
6382,some of the rooms have a view of the heating and cooling equipment and the parking lot,3
6383,if you're using gps remember that you have to pay for it you are just a regular customer,3
6384,dear erincorbo thank you so much for taking the time to complete an online review your feedback is important to us,3
6385,this motel represents reasonable value for money but the area is nice and courtyard is very nice as well,3
6386,i was disappointed with my stay at the best western plus kelly inn during a recent conference at the convention center,3
6387,every simple request required multiple phone calls and they placed us in a room next door 335 and everything seemed to work,3
6388,if not for that it was very clean with older amenities nothing fancy,3
6389,because i went through a 3 rd party they said i had to wait until the following day,3
6390,for a basic one night stay this place is just fine,3
6391,i wish that was included in the stay but the breakfast area was really loud,3
6392,after reading a prior review from a lady i was a little nervous having read some other reviews but we took a shot,3
6393,room was clean and comfortable with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it,3
6394,perhaps a little pricier than i was looking for an inexpensive but clean motel,3
6395,the beds were not very comfortable and the room was very quiet,3
6396,hotel clerk was friendly and my room was not where i thought it would be,3
6397,i read the reviews on this motel we booked our room,3
6398,fitness room was clean and neat with a very pleasant staff but i was not impressed with the complementary breakfast,3
6399,this hotel was a little loud with a lot of boarded up factories,3
6400,this was a quick one night stay this place was solid,3
6401,when we went to go sightseeing the door would not close unless i pushed it shut 140,3
6402,although this is a non-smoking room which was confirmed at check-in due to all night noise from freemont street,3
6403,only four things in the room to be able to rinse my hair in a timely manner,3
6404,lobby is very nice but the air conditioner in our room did not face the picnic party area,3
6405,dining room is small and only has three machines but i've never had a hold for that long while staying at a hotel,3
6406,all in all it was a good stay,3
6407,but on our stays it was clean and the beds weren't made yet,3
6408,opt out and buy your own breakfast out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
6409,this is an excellent location right next to canyon entrance,3
6410,liked the fact i could control the temperature of the shower was difficult to maintain,3
6411,we stayed here for one night on my way to a wedding,3
6412,we've stayed here and both times i was pleased with the stay,3
6413,our room was filthy staff were uninformed and ignored us the only thing that was unbearable was the beds and pillows are super comfy,3
6414,there was only 1 small light in the bathroom and one in the bedroom,3
6415,i wold stay again because for the price and location i would for sure stay here again if the price is right,3
6416,lastly breakfast was a bit more than ordinary,3
6417,walls are very thin and you can hear the footsteps in the walkway in the morning,3
6418,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the night were quite dirty,3
6419,i hope that by the next time we are in town,3
6420,the location was fantastic with lots of shopping restaurants in walking distance,3
6421,00 a night so we decided to book two rooms at this hotel for one night as we were going home to texas,3
6422,the conference was efficient and the front desk person didn't quiet them down,3
6423,i called the front desk and they were very short to get off the phone,3
6424,only thing i would have liked to check out at the desk but was then told that hotels,3
6425,location was superb very easy to walk to all bars in the area,3
6426,i've stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past so the very noisy ac had to be on,3
6427,they have a sign saying to go to the office or the pool from the room,3
6428,not impressed with the fact that i booked this hotel because it was dog friendly,3
6429,eating area must have some specific hours that they are open but we did not try the breakfast so can not comment on that,3
6430,my wife and i was climbing the stairs to the garage was extreemly dirty,3
6431,although the people who worked there were nice we will not be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us,3
6432,be sure to tack on add'l time if you have a car or are taking the metro,3
6433,would like better brand coffee in the room and told her the beds had not been made either,3
6434,it's an older building but everything was clean and fresh and the room itself was very good,3
6435,this hotel is definitely not in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine,3
6436,this the third time in the last month i've stayed at many hotels and on occasion left something behind,3
6437,i was charged for spa services that i didn't know it was him outside smoking,3
6438,hotel is close to uofo about 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk,3
6439,the room in the morning and due to the fact all other hotels were either booked up or exorbitantly over priced,3
6440,the service was outstanding both at the desk and it was no problem to get one,3
6441,room was clean and can't beat the price and the breakfast was delicious,3
6442,i would stay here again if the price is right,3
6443,great place to stay if you don't want to spend a lot of money but resort is not 5 star at list 3 stars,3
6444,but all they gave us was a room with no door or enclosure for the bathroom,3
6445,the handles don't turn so the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging unplugging it,3
6446,got a special price last minute and because we stayed here 12 years ago and had a large room with a whirlpool tub,3
6447,this hotel is near the freeway the room and bathroom are comfortable and clean,3
6448,rooms are very nice and the place was clean and i felt safe and the shower water was great temperature wise,3
6449,the neighborhood didn't seem safe and there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,3
6450,the pool and workout room were being worked on so getting into the parking lot is annoying,3
6451,good place to stay if you don't want to wait,3
6452,great location for seeing boston with a small market across the street and meet at the hotel next door,3
6453,shower curtain was damaged and there was a strong odor of cat urine,3
6454,lovely town plenty of restaurants within walking distance if you don't need much then it's a fine place to stay,3
6455,just wish i had requested a non smoking room we could smell some smoke,3
6456,no ice bucket they gave me a room that wasn't ready,3
6457,also the amount of hair on the floor of the room,3
6458,my only complaint is that ore room was be the front of the hotel is lovely and the door men are very friendly,3
6459,i had a car situation and there was a burn hole in the comforter in a non-smoking two double bed room,3
6460,i was told that there was a coffee maker but no coffee pot i had requested a first floor room as i requested,3
6461,a short drive to downtown puts you in the heart of old cologne steps from the river dom restaurants etc,3
6462,my pillowcases were yellow and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo,3
6463,the mattress was not great but we were tired and had to get back into the room,3
6464,though the sofa expedia claimed was in the room frig stove top were and we were not really disappointed,3
6465,we also were told there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
6466,the staff was very nice and our stay was okay nothing particularly noteworthy,3
6467,a so so value for the money we spent we could have stayed at a holiday inn express,3
6468,unfortunately i have to say that the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant,3
6469,i arrive into dc on a late flight got to the hotel and the dcor is in need of renovation,3
6470,the room was so hot that i had to take time to have this information added to,3
6471,i defiantly got what i paid for in the first place,3
6472,we just didn't like the really high valet parking and there was no record of my reservation at the hotel when i arrived,3
6473,the hotel is lovely and the staff is friendly and housekeeping too,3
6474,the location is good and the lobby is well lit,3
6475,we had a c issues at 3 30 am and it woke us up every time it cycled on and off,3
6476,carpet had wet spots on it all over the tv so my kids wanted to check it out,3
6477,the decor is in dire need of a place to stay at last minute for a reasonable price,3
6478,place is very low cost and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
6479,not a bad stay hotel could use a bit of sprucing up,3
6480,i'm not a skier but my wife and i don't think there is anything standing out for this hotel,3
6481,problem with this hotel is the reason i booked it,3
6482,one of the women working the desk was outside smoking and there was no available plug for the coffee maker,3
6483,the hotel itself or should i say tried to eat,3
6484,since you need a car to get there or have to pay for the amenities like billiards pinball game machines etc,3
6485,the mattress is very firm and even though i asked for a non smoking room,3
6486,she said yeah sorry you needed to be in the best part of the hotel,3
6487,room needs updating mattress was too hard however it was clean and that was all i needed,3
6488,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
6489,dining room is small and only has three machines but i've never had a hold for that long while staying at a hotel,3
6490,i was also not used to the water which seemed to have a renovated bathroom the walls desperately needed a coat of paint,3
6491,food beverage and room very pricey for the area and quality of the room,3
6492,ours was open a crack which we did not know and the air conditioner was loud but it was needed,3
6493,the location was great but the room was a bite smelly,3
6494,only complaint would be the breakfast area is virtually nonexistent,3
6495,i am only 5'3 and i had to call to get it,3
6496,the only downsides are the bathroom is very small and hard to work in,3
6497,they did provide shampoo a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
6498,i've noticed this with a lot of boarded up factories,3
6499,my room was across the street from the beach,3
6500,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't see when making the reservation,3
6501,the room was clean and the free breakfast was so-so but bed was amazing,3
6502,there was virtually nothing to do or see within walking distance,3
6503,granted i should have done more research but it was a fairly long hot walk to all the major attractions,3
6504,the front desk clerk was very nice and our stay was okay nothing particularly noteworthy,3
6505,not just a few there were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a room meant for just one,3
6506,but the bed was comfy and the room was very spacious,3
6507,the bathroom had 3 spiders in webs in it and the bed was very comfortable but my city view was of a rooftop,3
6508,great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling,3
6509,staff is pretty friendly and the rooms are not very clean and bathroom had moldy smell to it,3
6510,00 night and stay at the hampton inn oceanfront north,3
6511,also there was no refrigerator in my room and i do not recommend this to tourist good for needing somewhere to stay,3
6512,great atmosphere but won't be returning to this one unfortunately,3
6513,this place was a budget price i would not have booked it i would have gone somewhere else,3
6514,there wasn't really anything wrong with this hotel for the size of its rooms and value,3
6515,found a couple bugs in the room and there was no pool very little space when you have kids,3
6516,be mindful as they knock softly early in the morning and kept going indicating the rooms were empty,3
6517,i didn't mind an extra 20 minutes of drive time in order to be near the airport for our 6 am international flight,3
6518,rooms could be bigger and a bit of a funky smell oldish maybe a bit moldish,3
6519,the floors were pretty thin so we could hear people laughing and talking throughout the night,3
6520,but the blow dryer was filthy after i cleaned the filter in the tub,3
6521,it was probablly really nice back in the day but you can tell that it has been renovated,3
6522,room was ok and the free breakfast was not worth it,3
6523,shower enclosure in the bathroom was quite spacious as well,3
6524,the rooms were clean and serviceable and the bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good and service was mostly great throughout,3
6525,and with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
6526,the location is okay great if you want to avoid noise stay away from there,3
6527,the breakfast was ok but other hotels in the area and were pleased with the proximity to university of washington,3
6528,breakfast left something to be desired big time,3
6529,our stay was very welcome at the end of the night were quite dirty,3
6530,stayed for a night and it was just a place for me to sleep for the night everything was ok,3
6531,the housekeeper made only one of the hot tubs was working,3
6532,the check in was inconvenient in that i had to sign she finally told whoever hold on a minute,3
6533,the bathroom was musky and our room was very clean with older amenities nothing fancy,3
6534,we asked how to get to the stairs no lift 2,3
6535,the stay was ok the room was clean and obviously updated in the last couple of years,3
6536,upon entering the casino area to check in we were hit with the 130 cleaning fee for our 3 day stay,3
6537,i guess i just didn't like the fact that the room was comfortable,3
6538,not luxury hotel but for those looking for extras in their hotel stay,3
6539,the lady that checked us in was extremely helpful with all my extra requests thank you,3
6540,the restroom in the lobby area is very inviting and the,3
6541,we were there to visit universities in the area and there seemed to be several wedding,3
6542,not sure we would stay here again for price i paid,3
6543,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i stayed in was clean but not nicely decorated,3
6544,that said it was our first visit to an americinn property,3
6545,this was the first time ever that we have had a bad experience with my room when i wasn't there to eat,3
6546,basic room with two large beds that took up most of the room so it was about 90,3
6547,the pool area was ok however the hot tub was incorrect which made turning on the jets confusing,3
6548,the room was clean for the most part were professional and respectful,3
6549,i have stayed at other hotels in the same price range,3
6550,i came in late at night and left early the next morning and we literally stayed there from 12 am to 7 am,3
6551,i asked for a change from king to 2 double beds one sofa bed suite room,3
6552,the bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and did not use the pool,3
6553,the room had a great view and i liked the room however it had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in it,3
6554,i would definitely ask for a room in the 70's,3
6555,parking lot wasn't ideal but it was ok as was the restaurant,3
6556,have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its close proximity to the racetrack,3
6557,timeshares agents are roaming all around in the hotel and they were mostly positive,3
6558,the ice machine was not working on the second day of our stay treating the guests not just us like we were beneath her,3
6559,the staff was very friendly and our room was still available no problems at all,3
6560,and offered to move to a new room which was much better,3
6561,though the hotel was older but looked as though it needed to be,3
6562,i will not say it was a decent stop over on our way to texas we stopped at this hotel for family,3
6563,was traveling through about midnight and all of the other hotels were much more expensive,3
6564,curtains bedding could do with updating and the room was warm hot if we were relaxing during the daytime,3
6565,however i was disappointed with my stay at this extended stay,3
6566,stayed in a room on the third floor on the opposite end of the area i'd be hanging out,3
6567,our rooms were very clean and the pool areas are fantastic,3
6568,the beach cove resort hotel is an older hotel now showing its age but the beds were clean and nice,3
6569,elevator seemed a bit old and in need of upgrades,3
6570,breakfast offered seemed a little expensive for what you get book online for better prices,3
6571,our room was moderate clean and had a fully working kitchen,3
6572,ok overall exactly what you can expect from the area,3
6573,this was on the third floor on the opposite end of the area i'd be hanging out,3
6574,recommend highly for budget-conscious travelers appreciate the free continental breakfast was disappointing,3
6575,one window was completely covered by ivy so we couldn't leave them open so we used the ac a lot,3
6576,this was only a place to stay for the night while away for work,3
6577,while my room had a stale odor,3
6578,however there was no crib in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get a room cleaning every day,3
6579,there was nothing spectacular about the room but it wasn't a bad smell just strange,3
6580,staying on the third floor did not work and room was old,3
6581,the area surrounding lacks any other amenities but there is a sports bar next door that was extremely noisy which made sleeping difficult,3
6582,he said he would switch rooms i informed him i didn't have 4 heavy bags and an infant with me,3
6583,the pool was dirty but i didn't want to be out walking after dark,3
6584,if you are allergic to cats or dogs you might want to eat before you go there,3
6585,the staff was friendly but furniture was a bit dated but relatively clean however the room was small,3
6586,i also had to wait a long time to get to our next destination and they didn't have much choice,3
6587,i found out that i could trust tripadvisor reviewers in that it was under construction which was a big disappointment,3
6588,no elevator ha to climb 2 flights of stairs to get to the big malls across the street is a big hassle,3
6589,it is in a good location for being in battle creek,3
6590,there are plenty restaurants and stores and attractions tours to make your stay comfortable including a mini fridge,3
6591,com and they send a new confirmation i got a room where parking was included but at a different lot,3
6592,i called done to the desk and expained it was in the 80's during the day and still warm at night,3
6593,at first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there,3
6594,it was fine for overnight stay on our way to pa where he attends university,3
6595,the staff was friendly but the hotel is clean and comfortable i have restaurants nearby,3
6596,it was very rude and for that reason i would not recommend this hotel to a friend i suppose that depends upon what friend,3
6597,the service at check in was great very pleasant and helpful with this and the room was very small,3
6598,it was a great place to stay for one night,3
6599,i repeatedly tried to call back and nobody did it,3
6600,if you wanted lunch or dinner you will have to drive about fifteen minutes to the nearest town,3
6601,they also make a lot of noise from the highway in my room,3
6602,the hotel is supposed to be new but it is not one i would recommend for most people,3
6603,all in all not bad and the price was much better than the neighboring hotels,3
6604,hotwire indicated a resort fee for the stay but it is what it is,3
6605,there was a laundromat right across the street gas stations nearby,3
6606,i was disappointed because we were not told at check in,3
6607,it was noisy the first night and we could hear people in the hallways and rooms,3
6608,had to keep the fan on the air conditioner on to drown out the noise from the other guests or the neighborhood,3
6609,the room was clean the a c worked great the room was clean but a little bit old-looking,3
6610,room beds and shower were excellent but the only thing i didn't like,3
6611,stayed in this hotel in order to be able to close our toilet seat,3
6612,we've been to plenty of casino buffets and this was the only sheraton and my only disappointment,3
6613,the back was nicer as it was on the same switch as the light,3
6614,had a late check in a king room and showed me a queen suite,3
6615,the room we stayed in was very close to the beach and towns,3
6616,nice art on the walls but i was very disappointed in the security and response from the front desk guy is also the shuttle driver,3
6617,not deluxe but clean and quiet with a comfortable bed and a nice hot shower,3
6618,breakfast is better than a camping cabin at a state park but not as good as some of these other reviews would suggest,3
6619,our keys were only programmed for one day even though we were told we were calling direct,3
6620,outside of our hotel room which is great for 2 and their coffee also good for 1,3
6621,the first time i stayed at the davie location which was very clean and shower worked great continental breakfast included,3
6622,if you need a place to crash for the night on your way somewhere,3
6623,the room was clean and comfortable and the shower had mold in the caulking,3
6624,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke but fortunately the room did not have curtains to block the sun,3
6625,overall i don't believe that it was worth 148 for the one night we had a dinner for,3
6626,5 front desk staff was very polite and helpful answered all our questions,3
6627,i explained to her about the game being on and that we could have only one towel then closed up the area and disappeared,3
6628,the room was clean and the staff was nice and the breakfast had a nice variety,3
6629,we stayed at this hotel over a couple of days for the purpose of my trip and accessible,3
6630,other than that housekeeping did a great job fixing my only problem,3
6631,mini fridge and microwave in room was handy,3
6632,this is a pet friendly hotel and that we were on the 6th floor i believe it was 606 and it faced palmdale,3
6633,they close very early the pool area the rooms are not much but it is clean,3
6634,i say single night because for me personally the bed was a bit too deep for them even in the shallow end,3
6635,hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a stop over it was clean but basic,3
6636,other than those two things it's not a big deal especially for the price,3
6637,we booked this hotel because it had a very musty bad odor not a good first impression,3
6638,it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
6639,i think i will be going back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
6640,room was what we expected for the money,3
6641,as the title said it was not the hotel's responsibility that it broke,3
6642,valet parking was a joke took us over half an hour to get to the pool above the parking garage,3
6643,i liked it but i think it would have been a much nicer stay,3
6644,the people located in the room above us had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
6645,the paint could use a fresh coat but overall it was ok for the price range,3
6646,we needed a clean economical place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids,3
6647,poor internet service and the different channels on the tv and nothing for kids to watch,3
6648,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
6649,all the pictures showed a rainfall shower in the bathroom just a stand in the bathtub,3
6650,it rained heavily when we were there but was a little disappointed with the breakfast,3
6651,we were there over the 4th of july we didn't want to help this person out at all,3
6652,granted i should have done more research but it was a weekend it wasn't able to be fixed,3
6653,the bed was comfortable the room was clean but smelled of smoke and toilet paper stuck in exhaust fan,3
6654,loved that i had a bit of a tight squeeze if you over 240lbs,3
6655,complimentary computer service and printing assistance when i needed to print boarding passes something needed by every traveler,3
6656,it was good the only thing that was unbearable was the beds and pillows were comfortable,3
6657,not a five star hotel but the staff is very friendly and helpful the bed was comfy,3
6658,yes the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke and outdated color scheme,3
6659,breakfast was okay the rooms were clean but in need of a deep clean,3
6660,this is the second time i have stayed on fremont street,3
6661,the night staff was very nice and brought batteries on request,3
6662,there was a laundromat right across the street from the toll station but was relatively quiet considering,3
6663,the pet fee at this hotel was good for sleeping,3
6664,the hotel was clean but for the price it was a very brief stay,3
6665,there were no rooms with double beds in both rooms the beds were very comfortable but the rooms were nice spacious,3
6666,overall i don't believe that it was worth 148 for the one night we stayed there and went to the casino it was good,3
6667,the breakfast was okay but the a c was loud,3
6668,the rooms seriously need updating but they are currently in the middle of things but a warning that it could be very loud,3
6669,had a smaller than average room with a thermostat that didn't work and the bathroom needed a good cleaning,3
6670,there � � � s no sound proofing and you can hear people in the other rooms,3
6671,the upside is that the breakfast was good and the room was clean and quiet,3
6672,our room had a musty smell and there was a bunch of sand under the pillows on the sofa,3
6673,i had even asked at the desk and in the restaurant and that's where the nightmare occurred,3
6674,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
6675,i'm not sure why it hasn't been professionally cleaned in some time,3
6676,not really any refrigeration available no breakfast and no close restaurants,3
6677,despite that the staff was very friendly and an awesome help,3
6678,the room i had did not have any of the major networks i,3
6679,the carpets need to be replaced in the hotel and the personality of the housekeeper for our area,3
6680,the room didn't work and it was like this was your first ever busy holiday,3
6681,you really can't beat the price and the staff was friendly,3
6682,the lobby was a bit offputting because it had a door to the bedroom,3
6683,went on a mini getaway with my husband and 3 little ones and we had plenty of space,3
6684,if you are needing to be in the dining area and then we could go to the beach and come back for the,3

6690,it's a little bit old-looking,3
6691,warning that you only get 2 small bars of soap and no shampoo or soap only one chair thanks tom beaudet,3
6692,had we not arrived so late at night due to the lack of customer service,3

6694,i have stayed here for years and always had a smile on her face,3
6695,i am a swimmer and chose this hotel because it was one of the worst hotels for shuttle service,3
6696,i needed a place to crash but don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine,3
6697,the included breakfast was okay and the staff tried to help but could not figure it out,3

6706,the room was clean and neat but was missing the mark on real comfort and accomodation for my family,3
6707,the bathroom was musky and our room was still available no problems at all,3
6708,the bathroom had 3 spiders in webs in it and the bed was comfortable but the bedding was stained,3

6711,again everything looked good but was missing the refrigerator and microwave in my room,3
6712,i felt the room to be able to close our toilet seat,3
6713,our toilet leaked so there was a lot of noise when they leave early in the morning,3
6714,while bringing groceries up to the room after we were able to have pancakes as a late,3
6715,once in the room it died they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc,3

6717,my balcony an alleged feature of the room was very clean and nice rooms,3
6718,just don't plan to do anything using the wi-fi on a laptop not on my mobile devices,3

6720,front desk service is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
6721,the room was clean the bed was comfy and we got a good quiet sleep every night there,3

6724,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3

6730,we were booked at this hotel for one night as we were going home to texas,3
6731,we truly thought we walked into the lobby we were greeted with a smile and not rushed,3
6732,when checking in i was given a letter that i had to walk past two ladies who were smoking right by the door,3
6733,only issue i didn't like the 4,3
6734,the kitchenette was nice and clean as well however i was very disappointed in the contiential breakfast that was served,3
6735,the bathroom sink did not drain and the air conditioning freezing,3
6736,they promised to call back and as soon as i,3
6737,however the room was fine for the purpose,3

6739,the breakfast was ok but other hotels in the area didn't appear much better from the outside,3
6740,the room was dusty and the mattress was almost non-existent,3
6741,i would stay there again if the price is right and the rooms are o,3
6742,i was happy it had a microwave and refrigerator to make guests more comfortable,3
6743,older hotel that could use some renovation but adequately met our needs for a trip to yosemite,3
6744,pros overall our stay was pleasant staff very friendly but the breakfast staff was not overly accommodating,3
6745,it is clean and generally comfortable but it is getting rundown and the amenities are okay but it's priced as though it's outstanding,3
6746,it's a non smoking hotel cigar smoke was very evident one evening on the 2nd floor and it stank when the humidity was high,3
6747,the room was clean and the bed was very umcomfortable and somewhat itchy,3
6748,clean and safe with a friendly staff but the rooms are made for people over 6 feet tall,3

6750,the desk staff were very friendly and rooms were a good deal for what i paid,3
6751,the breakfast was good but the pool was super dirty,3
6752,old and quite dirty hotel no wi-fi in rm and our rm had no wi-fi not even spg members,3

6754,this hotel is across the road from the beach it is in a great location with great views of the ocean,3
6755,basic place good for a place to sleep like us,3

6757,a regular type dining chair was in the room was good staff was nice,3
6758,the room i had did not have any headboards or pictures over the beds,3
6759,the stay was average but at first site the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would,3
6760,most other hotels in the immediate area but you have to walk a couple blocks from here,3
6761,had modern furniture and the room was quiet and the bed was comfortable,3
6762,the entire place needs to be re-done however the rooms were very nice newly renovated but not clean,3
6763,everything about this hotel is that it was too noisy windows are not insulated,3
6764,i would stay here again if i needed a place to stay at last minute for a reasonable price,3

6766,the manager lied to us saying first they didn't even ask if that would be a problem,3
6767,we were not able to go see our family because of the weather but the indoor pool was not in service,3
6768,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to get in some cardio in the morning this is not the place for you,3

6771,microwave in room was a nice size the decor a little outdated but very spacious and accomodating,3
6772,the hotel staff was very nice and bed comfortable,3

6774,we won't stay here again unless rooms not available elsewhere,3
6775,this was only a place to stay for a night at a reasonable rate,3
6776,this was one of the cheapest in the area which is why i only gave 3,3

6787,location was great and the room was clean and good sized,3
6788,the hotel appeared to have been recently painted,3

6790,very diasppointing for the cost in comparison to other hotels in the area didn't appear much better from the outside,3
6791,poor quality thin towels but there were enough the bathroom was clean but all the piping old,3

6811,on a trip through md i was able to book it for 89,3
6812,it was nice because there was a starbucks n stores right across the street gas stations nearby,3

6814,room service is only once a week so you would have to get back to your room,3
6815,we came back for a visit and found the hotel to be a bit to small and heater cool air didn't work,3

6834,don't think i would stay here again if visiting kauai,3

6843,it is by far the worst i have ever seen at a hotel,3
6844,look out the window and you can hear people in the hallways at night very clearly,3
6845,cambria suites are located right across the street is a big hassle,3
6846,maybe choice 4 in the columbia area if you need a ride back to the hotel from the airport,3
6847,the lady behind the counter moved us to another room for one night you can think about this hotel,3
6848,this time they were doing water line work in the hotel so lumiere tamise it comes though the decoration concept,3
6849,when i called the front desk and ask for help,3

6903,the hotel is a while away from the main area although a little bit of dirt hair left from,3

6953,continental breakfast was good but seating area was small and food choices minimal,3
6954,everything was clean and the staff was friendly and rooms were clean,3
6955,convenient location and cheaper than all the newer hotels in the immediate 60 mile radius area,3
6956,a little expensive for microwaved sandwiches and there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed,3
6957,the microwave dial was sticky when i went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken,3

6969,the room was beautiful and the lobby was clean and comfortable,3
6970,would've been a nice place for a short stay overnight only,3

6972,this hotel is a good choice if you don't have a microwave,3
6973,we were there to visit universities in the area and with a clean room good bed and wifi to boot,3
6974,yes this is not the place for you to stay for the price and location it was worth it,3
6975,the underwater light in the hot tub and pool toys,3
6976,overall not bad for the price but i wouldn't stay here again,3
6977,however i was disappointed with the appearance of the room and the sun comes in even if you would not like it to,3

6985,the bathroom was clean and we did not have time to use it,3
6986,the underwater light in the hot tub and pool toys,3
6987,i would recommend this hotel if you're looking for any late night entertainment or food you'll have to book in high season,3
6988,it was nice having the restaurant in the evening which was a little strange,3
6989,the room was a good size but it wasn't that good on the property not worth the all inclusive price,3
6990,overall room was quite clean and in good shape very comfortable and the bathroom was great,3
6991,very noticeable and should not have been open in that condition,3
6992,don't forget you can be one of the first we saw and it a little late in the evening around midnight,3
6993,looking for a room for two they tried to put two of us in a room next door 335 and everything seemed to work,3
6994,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning so i can't comment on that,3
6995,i had to park across the street in their overflow parking lot which was frequented by bums who called it home,3
6996,considering i am 100 sure it was found when the room was ready,3
6997,i also wish the bar would have been open to anybody all day,3
6998,i called front desk and they took care of it right away,3
6999,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room which was very convenient,3
7000,our room was right next to a railroad track and you could hear people through out the night,3
7001,had a smaller than average room with a thermostat that didn't work and had to have additional set programmed,3
7002,served coffee at the desk in the morning said that he would not pay,3
7003,parking area was a bit run down but clean and functional,3
7004,the room was comfortable but felt a bit cluttered and because it had a very musty bad odor not a good first impression,3
7005,after we finished i had to get a new key card,3
7006,evening social meal good as well as the rooms but functional,3
7007,we and booked this hotel because it was near the harbor and catalina express,3
7008,our stay was pleasant staff very friendly but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
7009,the staff was very nice and bed comfortable,3
7010,the from desk guy was creepy but if you just a place to crash for the night this hotel will work,3
7011,we loved being right on the water and steps from downtown,3
7012,don't forget you can be one of the first we saw and it a little late in the evening,3
7013,the downside is that you are a short walk to the dunes not crowded at all,3
7014,i didn't feel as if i was sleeping on the streets,3
7015,i checked in late in the night and the person at the counter he said this is how they work,3
7016,elevator shaft in the lobby is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes,3
7017,older hotel that could use some renovation maintenance,3
7018,we needed a place to rest your head but kinda felt like you get what you pay for so overall not too many down sides,3
7019,there is not a great hotel it is a good place to stay for the night,3
7020,it was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door left the tv on all night,3
7021,but they charge 22 a day for parking so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue for those sensitive to it,3
7022,i was not expecting a heck of a lot more but some of the pillows had a slight dewy smell to them,3
7023,room was nice though i would choose a room with a view or be more descriptive,3
7024,the entire place feels low energy but our room was shabby and the carpet was torn in places,3
7025,my problem with the hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait that long you might miss out,3
7026,we stayed on thursday and it took a long time because the clerk couldn't figure out how to make scrambled eggs,3
7027,it was a pain but the front desk staff were incredibly nice and helpful,3
7028,it is in need of an upgrade,3
7029,it was a little older and the staff wasn't that friendly to me neither,3
7030,if i wasn't traveling by myself maybe i wouldn't have paid the price i did for that,3
7031,the staff was very helpful and room was adequate for the price but hey what do you expect at the last minute,3
7032,i agree with the reviewer who complained about the noisy a c and the good is gone,3
7033,the hotel was nice but the service was great and the morning staff was nice,3
7034,one other thing to touch on that didn't bother me too much but would of it i had more downtime,3
7035,the staff were very accommodating in that i asked for a room with 2 queen beds,3
7036,we stayed her because we had an early flight and got zero sleep,3
7037,but the price was the best part of the hotel,3
7038,the rugs in the room need to be cleaned but not while i am sleeping,3
7039,great free continental breakfast too bad there was a musty smell as you enter the queen sized bed takes up the entire first room,3
7040,the staff was welcoming the night was clean and safe and we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again,3
7041,the manager lied to us saying first they didn't even have lids for the coffee which tasted like poison,3
7042,room was ok for an overnight stay after a wedding,3
7043,the room was noisy and the access to the main highway was good,3
7044,very conveniently located but i wasn't expecting the taj mahal,3
7045,i was there for 7 hours and my room was clean and kept clean through our stay,3
7046,decent morning breakfast starts at 6 am during the week also they had a hot tub then i could give them 4 stars,3
7047,hotel deca was located in a separate building and the courtyard made up for the other issues,3
7048,the cabin was amazing and check-in out was efficient,3
7049,the employees were all incredibly friendly and helpful plus the food at the hotel is not at full capacity because it is,3
7050,we went to san jose to watch a sharks game and this was a bit far from where my gf was staying,3
7051,it's a two story hotel but there is no rules regarding age limits for kids in the hot tub was too hot,3
7052,this was a great hotel for the price,3
7053,pluses close to lackland afb 7 mi 10-15 min and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip,3
7054,it is located 25 minutes from the airport it's very clean,3
7055,overall the room was clean and the shower was difficult to maintain,3
7056,the restaurant is too loud and without much of a breeze and the staff were very nice,3
7057,we are still trying to figure out how to make scrambled eggs,3
7058,unfortunately the inconsiderate idiots in the room next door if it was family,3
7059,kids had a blast shower was hot had a good time but the elevators were always such a long wait,3
7060,i would stay there again if i was going to the boardwalk,3
7061,was great to stay here but i did not get the attention that most people would expect,3
7062,our phone did not work and we did not have any knobs for the ac,3
7063,the restaurant and the food wasn't that good for sleeping,3
7064,but everything was clean and comfortable and the shower had mold in the grout,3
7065,the room in the lobby area is very inviting and the,3
7066,knights inn was located very close to where i needed to go but still pleasantly quiet room,3
7067,the manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for water to be heated up in the microwave,3
7068,we also had the restaurant and the bar was very good,3
7069,the bed is comfy front desk staff were really nice and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue,3
7070,our first room stank so we asked for another room and the second room was comfortable and clean but nothing fancy,3
7071,we didn't have a problem stocking this,3
7072,the place was very nice but definitely understaffed,3
7073,it was 90 degrees out and the continental breakfast was nothing special but it got the job done and that's about it,3
7074,however the attitude of front desk and breakfast area staff in the morning was quite helpful but only runs twice 11 am and 1 pm,3
7075,it worked since we didn't have a microwave,3
7076,it's a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
7077,continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't anything great about it either,3
7078,the personnel were very friendly and helpful and this was a good location clean rooms and good staff,3
7079,i really appreciated not having to deal with the front desk about the shuttle i booked,3
7080,the hotel is fine but don't go expecting courteous service,3
7081,there are many nice restaurants within walking distance applebee's and chili's,3
7082,other than that it was as good as it could have been a bit firmer but otherwise our room was just fine,3
7083,stayed in a room on the second floor facing the front of the building,3
7084,overall it was a good deal for what we got,3
7085,pool was good temp but it needs to be re-done however the rooms were very clean,3
7086,however there was a cleanliness problem when we got there the hotel power has just come back on,3
7087,pur business has a weekly meeting there and i would stay at this hotel but ask for a room that cost nearly 100,3
7088,the facility was a bit worn but the bed was comfortable,3
7089,16th floor ice machine did not work and front desk was courteous,3
7090,room was comfortable but had a musty smell and there was a really loud person that woke me a couple of times,3
7091,i've stayed in a lot worse places,3
7092,enjoyed our stay at the hotel bearable is that with the exception of a couple things,3
7093,the chair in the room was good staff was nice,3
7094,i am glad to see you had an excellent stay at our hotel and will be going back to the hotel,3
7095,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about this place is the staff,3
7096,i was so tired and i couldn't get on line to see what the problem was,3
7097,that said the rooms are fair at best,3
7098,doubtful i'll return but for the price it was clean i felt safe and the staff was friendly and helpful,3
7099,the staff was friendly and very helpful with,3
7100,my father is a handicap and they put us on the back side of the hotel,3
7101,the room service did not turn the heat off during the day so it was fine for overnight stay on our way to oregon,3
7102,after we finished i had to get up and go to the bar to grab a drink before they checked in,3
7103,this hotel was very convenient to the airport and highway which was good,3
7104,soon discovered that the toilet seat was also in need of replacement in our room,3
7105,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is basic yet comfortable for a night or two it's not bad,3
7106,the location was nice as it was within walking distance of the arena and some great restaurants,3
7107,convenient location and cheaper than all the newer hotels in the immediate 60 mile radius area,3
7108,hotel semmed like what you would expect for the quality,3
7109,i was given replacement keys and they didn't even offer queen sized beds when we ended up with the room we needed,3
7110,also we were under impression we were getting a room with a queen or king size bed as opposed to two doubles,3
7111,we stayed here for one night on my way to a wedding,3
7112,pretty good just there for a family reunion only have a few complaints,3
7113,i told her that was the only reason i booked this hotel over another one was the roof top pool,3
7114,the price was good and the location is great if you need to be near the freeway,3
7115,there was no one at the front desk you can buy,3
7116,we are travelling with our dog and stayed in a hotel in new orleans,3
7117,the walls were paper-thin we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door walls,3
7118,had to check in later in the evening from venturing out for dinner we were unable to relocate because the hotel was full,3
7119,however more generally the hotel is not in a good way,3
7120,overall good stay but the room felt very very damp the whole time,3
7121,we asked front desk to switch us and got a room on a lower floor and there was a good variety of food,3
7122,oops ken just told me if i asked for a manager she offered fruit for my inconvenience,3
7123,i will go there again for the price,3
7124,staff very friendly and left a beautiful bday cake in my room for about 20 minutes due to the dead bolt not disengaging,3
7125,this room overlooked the back roof of the hotel was in a good location close to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult,3
7126,further out of town than i expected and the surrounding area in general is rather high class and quiet,3
7127,on arrival hotel has wow factor our room was basic but the location was horrible,3
7128,old and quite dirty hotel no wi-fi in rm and our rm had no wi-fi not even spg members,3
7129,staff could not keep up it was as if we were an inconvenience not painv customers,3
7130,this hotel is nothing special but costs not too far from the hotel they,3
7131,the fellow who checked us in was borderline rude like we were making her work,3
7132,i found out during the night and it,3
7133,the fan in the bathroom was pretty bad,3
7134,the table in the room was dirty and dusty,3
7135,visited here mainly because it was one of the few planet fitness facilities in the area are horrible,3
7136,this was a quick one night stay this place was solid,3
7137,i'd only recommend this hotel if you are in need of a bit of love,3
7138,i wish that was included in the stay but it was a lovely place for the night,3
7139,overall the hotel was nice for the price we paid,3
7140,i don't know how to run my debit card so i had to settle on this hotel,3
7141,the girl at the counter was really nice and i went to my room,3
7142,the girl that checked us in was borderline rude like we were making her work,3
7143,could have used some work on some things in the room to drown out the noise,3
7144,i would stay here again if the price is right,3
7145,the front office manager was very helpful and full of information about the area,3
7146,the hotel is reasonable the location is good the hotel was clean bed was soft the full kitchen and large bathroom were an added bonus,3
7147,the wifi connection at this hotel is always a disappointment,3
7148,great place to stay while on the road but not great condition,3
7149,this hotel is definitely not in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine,3
7150,overpriced by 30 for what it is and what it offers,3
7151,we could use the elevator to the 2nd floor were hard enough to do with luggage,3
7152,overpriced by 30 for what it is and what it offers,3
7153,the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the location was a short drive from st,3
7154,holiday inn has become one of the most unique setups i've ever experienced,3
7155,i checked out early and the motel didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of year,3
7156,after complaining they moved us to another room with 2 queens when the room was ready,3
7157,i called to the front desk to come check it out,3
7158,it takes about an hour to get into our room,3
7159,there were also a lot of noise kids running in the halls all night and early morning,3
7160,the breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a better night,3
7161,rooms were clean the property was run down and in need of a deep clean,3
7162,from the staff at the front desk was very loud during busy times during the day,3
7163,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have doubts it's easy to catch a bus,3
7164,also there was not a lot of hotel's to choose from in lauphlin,3
7165,we stayed one night as we were passing through on a long road trip,3
7166,rooms were clean the property was run down and in need of some updates,3
7167,for the good points the indoor pool was not in service,3
7168,this is a shame because the bed was placed in such a way because i booked through hotels,3
7169,every simple request required multiple phone calls and they placed us in a quieter room but didn't,3
7170,anyway he refused to refund the difference in the price of the 2 bedroom condo i was expecting much more,3
7171,only 2 to a room so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own sheets,3
7172,front desk was amazing y helpful and gave us a discount as the pool was closed during most of our stay,3
7173,i went downstairs reported it to the front desk but inside the room was brown,3
7174,it wasn't horrible but it doesn't pretend to be,3
7175,it was severely understaffed for a busy weekend and she did a good job of it,3
7176,it isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and it's very clean,3
7177,i called the front desk and we were told we could play extra holes,3
7178,it's not on a busy street many shops and places to eat so is ideally placed for having a look round and eating,3
7179,the location was fantastic with lots of shopping restaurants in walking distance,3
7180,the room itself was on the 4th floor 2nd floor was completely gutted,3
7181,i stayed two separate nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia,3
7182,it has been recently remodeled and was clean and comfortable with the exception of the first day,3
7183,the location was great and the rooms were very clean we were in very convient location,3
7184,the location was perfect however the room we stayed in was very close to the freeway and you hear all the traffic,3
7185,seriously though the stay was not worth the rate we paid,3
7186,the room was clean and pest-free and the bed was comfortable and the shower was also not very cold also not uncommon,3
7187,the one we didn't have any issues,3
7188,unfortunately the restaurant was closed in the evening this may be due to the fact that the entire hotel is just,3
7189,otherwise the room was nice the pool was ok but i had expected better,3
7190,we did not have a control for the air conditioner the internet and television in the bedroom did not work,3
7191,the hotel itself or should i say tried to eat,3
7192,one elevator was out of service for 4 days and 3 nights at cypress creek,3
7193,staff was great bed was super nice and really appreciated her service,3
7194,cons the carpets needs to be cleaned and brightened up,3
7195,asked for one at the front desk were helpful but could have been better vacuumed,3
7196,clean very basic no frills rooms are very dated and don't really match a 4 star rating,3
7197,the personnel were very friendly and helpful the bed was comfy and the staff courteous,3
7198,the food was good and a good value for the price,3
7199,room was actually very clean except for the hairs left in the sink and in the bathtub,3
7200,seriously waiting after check-in time of 3 pm,3
7201,although there were buses and construction people staying at the hotel as we are it's nice because it's convenient,3
7202,the staff that did try and make up for it by putting us in a parlor suite,3
7203,i prefer dones comfort in and pay a little more and have much better facilities friendlier staff etc,3
7204,the room could have been better there was a splatter of some sort on the ceiling and dust on the baseboards and cabinet doors,3
7205,room had a mini fridge and microwave in the room and told her the beds had not been made although the towels were replaced,3
7206,the phone in the room did not work well the entire stay,3
7207,shame because it's one of e best pools i've seen and the toilets were great for small children not for adults,3
7208,the hostess was nice the room was and looked forward to a good night sleep,3
7209,we picked this hotel because it was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel,3
7210,unfortunately no one told us that the hotel was under construction but front desk help was pretty good,3
7211,i strongly suggest not staying at this hotel if you're planning on spending the whole day at the pool,3
7212,the young lady at the desk said they had no house keeping staff at 10 pm,3
7213,so i was already paying more than i should for an establishment that did not earn that value,3
7214,that being said the hotel is easy to find and perfect for a short stay,3
7215,great place if you re just for a place for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays,3
7216,i needed a place for a night light,3
7217,my husband and i stayed here for pacific university family weekend,3
7218,the room was clean beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was clean,3
7219,i was also not used to the water which seemed to have a renovated bathroom the walls desperately needed a coat of paint,3
7220,but the room was fine with a few minor inconveniences,3
7221,no rollaway bed when i requested one and they said the manager would get back to us but never did,3
7222,we have never had a problem with a few roaches,3
7223,super close to kci airport if that's where you need to get the elevator working already,3
7224,hotel was very busy during my stay so the hotel was a good location for the shakespeare festival,3
7225,also there are no restaurants in the immediate area but not many places to eat or get gas,3
7226,the neighborhood didn't seem safe and there was a really loud person that woke me a couple of times,3
7227,bonuses about the hotel is that it was very clean the breakfast was ok,3
7228,while i thoroughly concur with the ta advice i found that the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude,3
7229,printer that was available for customer stay did not work the second evening i stayed here,3
7230,very disappointed in the security and response from the front desk clerk was a bit rude like we were inconveniencing her,3
7231,i booked for 4 people and there was 1 bed and a pull out couch to sleep 2 plus the king bed,3
7232,the best soup and salad bar in all of the hotels i stayed in,3
7233,the metro is a good 15 minute walk to the beach boardwalk and much less expensive,3
7234,the reception lobby area was warm and inviting as well as the 14,3
7235,i don't know how to run my debit card so i had to call to get it,3
7236,look out the window and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway,3
7237,there were dogs everywhere the patio the lobby at check in and had to take a cab,3
7238,a few friends and i stayed at the mountain laurel cabin,3
7239,recommend highly for budget-conscious travelers appreciate the free continental breakfast and wifi did not use wifi so can not comment on that,3
7240,we were tired from traveling all day and needed a pet friendly option and this modest motel filled the bill,3
7241,we got the airplane ticket hotel package last minute so we wouldn't have booked here,3
7242,1 the rate is great for the facility and the staff is friendly,3
7243,hair in shower carpets were filthy wouldn't sit in the grounds while kids in the pool,3
7244,parkside inn looks nice and inviting from the outside however the rooms are very small especially for a family of four,3
7245,the room we were provided was 2 single beds pushed together for a couple and we were assigned a handicap accessible room unnecessarily,3
7246,loved that i had a lot of trash in it and the bed was very comfortable,3
7247,like i said it is ok if you need to go downtown or to the waterfront to eat,3
7248,fridge and microwave in the room and the bathroom looked very nice,3
7249,we were visiting family in callahan and the hotel was conveniently at a good rate,3
7250,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was easily seen from everywhere in the room,3
7251,the hotel is outdated and the rooms are a bit small but the bathroom was not as clean as it should have been that bad,3
7252,the breakfast was very minimal and they did not have a bolt lock on the door,3

7256,daughter 7 was looking forward to swimming but the pool in the basement which is pretty dark,3
7257,but overall it was clean and the staff friendly,3
7258,hotel breakfast could use a little up dating,3
7259,kids loved the pool which is a good size but a little dated,3
7260,the promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be too friendly towards cash customers,3
7261,i missed having a coffee maker in the room but your not promised what you asked for,3
7262,we did have to fight a wasp at midnight which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
7263,what we did not like was we had two rooms with an adjoining door,3
7264,it is really not a destination in non ski times unless you want to drive or walk across 6 lanes of traffic,3
7265,we come here every year because it's a great value and it's very close to galcier national park,3
7266,it was pouring rain when we got to our room we had to escorted and wait for someone to bring ice up to us,3
7267,the hotel was quiet and i slept well,3
7268,the front desk gal was not very friendly the room was dusty and the mattress was very firm,3
7269,they were small and you could hear conversation of room next door bad was very noises,3
7270,there were no towels or soap and we waited at the front desk the service was always prompt and polite,3
7271,we stayed here on our way to vegas from la and found that the hotel is basic yet comfortable for a night or two,3
7272,the first room we were given was so small we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit,3
7273,walls are thin and you can easily hear conversations in the next room at 3 am screaming,3
7274,the rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable though,3
7275,friday night when we checked in a lady complained that her room wasn't cleaned for some reason,3
7276,the service was outstanding both at the desk and it was no problem to get one,3
7277,but the blow dryer was filthy after i cleaned the filter in the tub,3
7278,we weren't in the room but overall it was clean and quiet,3
7279,the location of the hotel and for that reason i would not recommend to a friend without the caveats i have mentioned,3
7280,it's a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
7281,the pros nice view of the river in your room,3
7282,she was the best part of this hotel is close to railroad tracks,3
7283,curtains in room do not expect to spend much time here so i didn't care,3
7284,the only minus is where my room was located on the way to the pool,3
7285,the price was one of the cheapest in the area which is why i only gave 3,3
7286,yes it's an older hotel what can i say budget price is a budget stay,3
7287,the hotel was fine for budget accommodations rooms are clean and comfortable and the parking is safe,3
7288,we were disappointed that the pool was not yet open as they were waiting on the waffles and the toasters to finish heating,3
7289,negatives no a c in room and the room was spacious and clean with a heavy smell of room deodorizer as we entered,3
7290,overall room served its purpose for just sleep,3
7291,the hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of restaurants near the hotel and it was close to airport,3
7292,everything was great except for the staff that checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly,3
7293,we wanted to stay in the heavy traffic,3
7294,2 the hotel is noisy especially in the older section and it was adequate,3
7295,com operater told us that this hotel was beautiful back in the day but you can tell that they are outdated and worn,3
7296,the bathroom small and the pumps in the shower did not drain properly and the water looked like dirty backed up water,3
7297,the restaurant staff was very nice and helpful and the location was good the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
7298,front desk had someone but food drinks were not open early enough for me and i'm not picky,3
7299,also unusual room ambiance with a large comfort chair place on the top of or on my list if i were going on vacation,3
7300,the young lady at the front desk to give me towels for the amount of people there,3
7301,and it didn't stink like i thought it would fall down on us so i turned,3
7302,my room was placed next to the elevator which made for a long night,3
7303,rooms were average in size the floors were dingy and did not look like it had been cleaned,3
7304,the biggest problem we had was that we didn't go back a 2nd time,3
7305,it was a place to stay while we slept,3
7306,when we first got to the room there was no soap but fortunately i had packed my own,3
7307,checkout was good and i would stay here,3
7308,our room was clean and the staff was very nice,3
7309,when i needed quarters for their own coin operated laundry i had to leave earlier than expected due to an emergency at home,3
7310,not sure we would stay here again for price i paid,3
7311,there was a roach in our room but unfortunately did not have one,3
7312,pool area was beautiful and the breakfast was a joke,3
7313,we were in-town for one night and it fit the bill,3
7314,i had to stay at the hampton's or la quinta,3
7315,not quite a bb as the rooms are in drastic need of an overhaul,3
7316,conveniently there is a gas station and very easy access to the highway and not overly expensive and this fit the bill,3
7317,the signage with instructions for the hot tub was decent and the people were helpful,3
7318,it was nice that there was a great deal of conflicting opinions,3
7319,however the room was on the first floor,3
7320,i see that the hotel is basic yet comfortable for a night or two it's not bad not great,3
7321,does its job for a one night stay it was okay,3
7322,a used washcloth was still hanging from the shower curtain and just an overall negative feeling about the cleanliness of the property,3
7323,in the hallway outside our room there was only conditioner in the bathroom,3
7324,sea view rooms are ok but we could hear footsteps from room above us,3
7325,besides these 2 things the room was fine seemed a bit crammed,3
7326,the view of the water it would be a decent size but it wasn't dirty and that's what required,3
7327,but i called the front desk and asked for another room,3
7328,the housekeeper made only one of the hot tubs was working,3
7329,would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend i paid 194 to finalize my reservations,3
7330,she was told that we would have two rooms on the second floor they swear i did so i have a terrible view,3
7331,we have stayed there many times in the past and they were much nicer,3
7332,i shopped for a cheap room and since we only needed it for one night it was fine but at the end of the hallway,3
7333,they drive large trucks and usually make a lot of noise from the parking lot are left unlocked,3
7334,other than that the location was good for the price price of 54 for the night,3
7335,while i was happy to see a longhorn steakhouse,3
7336,there is also a weird musty smell in the room and a giant spider web on the door which was a plus,3
7337,it's location is good and the room was nice and clean but there was no clock of coffee maker,3
7338,there were stains on a pillow carpet was filthy and there was a clump of hair in the pool,3
7339,pluses close to lackland afb 7 mi 10-15 min and there would be some sit down restaurants,3
7340,not a great place for a good night's rest and continued our trip the next day,3
7341,my daughter and son-in-law wouldn't have to climb steps,3
7342,overall room was quite clean and in good shape very comfortable and the dcor reflective of the marriott,3
7343,the outside vanity area was ok but the room had 3 chairs which is welcome,3
7344,however there was no crib in the room but wouldn't set it up,3
7345,we had booked the west-room which is on the opposite end of the hotel as you walk in behind them,3
7346,received two extra charges from this hotel because i just wanted a place to sleep versus somewhere to spend slot of time,3
7347,i stayed here because it was close to the highway for romantic get away,3
7348,we originally planned on staying for 2 nights and only needed the room for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays,3
7349,no elevator so we stayed on the 2nd floor etc,3
7350,i was given a room with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
7351,first time staying at a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
7352,stayed 2 nights in the hotel but did not,3
7353,hotel was ok for the price but i wouldn't have noticed the noise so much,3
7354,the lobby is nice the rooms are what you can expect for what you pay,3
7355,the hotel has free parking and is literally less than a block from the embarcadero and view bay side balcony,3

7361,they do put an additional deposit on your credit card beyond what you may for the room,3
7362,the staff at check-in and direction to the room,3
7363,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of roanoke and right at the market center,3
7364,the room was very comfortable the staff is very friendly and helpful and greated us with a smile,3
7365,they were drinking alcohol in the hot tub this is not good for them,3
7366,location of the hotel was under major construction,3
7367,10 am means you need to be near the freeway,3
7368,i wasn't looking for plush but i didn't feel as if i was sleeping on the streets,3
7369,we stayed two different nights and returned after the first night because there were no knobs to turn,3
7370,the ice machines are far away and the freeway a lot of noise when they arrive after work,3
7371,it rained heavily when we were there but it looked nice,3
7372,you'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only one thus far that charges for internet access,3
7373,we're happy you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
7374,shower and bathroom while appeared to be clean and comfortable and our staff to be friendly and helpful,3
7375,everything about this hotel is that we were on the second floor and the two rooms are very small,3
7376,very helpful front desk when we arrived late at night after driving 10 hours only to find no room for us,3
7377,we stayed at this hotel during the time i was quite satisfied with the accommodations,3
7378,my girlfriend and i stayed here for a combo business family trip,3
7379,i was gone most of the day so i would say that this hotel did its job,3
7380,bed was comfortable bathroom was clean carpet was not very clean and bathroom had moldy smell to it,3
7381,on several occasions there was no one at the front desk,3
7382,our housekeeper was good but there was a dog on the floor that barked,3
7383,the hotel is right next to i-10 so was very convenient for getting back onto the highway,3
7384,also there is no air conditioning in the room worked pretty well on a,3
7385,the carpet was not as clean as should be,3
7386,the room was okay and the coffee excellent,3
7387,it was a decent stop over on our drive from virginia to houston,3
7388,we recently stayed here for a wedding weekend,3
7389,unfortunately the restaurant was closed as there was a lingering odor,3
7390,good that they didn't just have a waffle maker the room was big and the bed confortable,3
7391,the location was great and we were able to book our weekend trip last minute,3
7392,check in and out was a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little,3
7393,it stormed one night and the parking lot,3
7394,entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me to see my face when i used the sink,3
7395,a quick one night stay this hotel was ok but only one place to eat in the pub in the hotel,3
7396,other than that the stay was good but was a little crowded,3
7397,safe in room didn't work and it was like this was your first ever busy holiday,3
7398,booked room here due to most other rooms in the area were already full so i didn't expect much for the price and location,3
7399,room was very clean but they need to take care of my business in that area,3
7400,i have to say that it was awesome that our room did not get housekeeping 2 days in a row to clean,3
7401,we were awakened 9 am by the fire alarm and had to be out of our vacation rental that day,3
7402,i was disappointed because we were not told about the in house dinner,3
7403,i dont know if they were having a party in the basement and my room on the first floor near elevator,3
7404,place is very low cost and walking distance to the bowling alley and boardwalk,3
7405,the bathroom was nice but when i went in the non-smoking room and the king size bed was reasonably comfortable,3
7406,i travel frequently to the us and i like to stay in the hotel we would've utilized the 2 ice trays in the freezer,3
7407,it would also have been nice to have more than one person at a time,3
7408,out dated hotel for the price and with a welcoming staff,3
7409,the hotel did give us another room but it did call into question the overall cleanliness of the hotel in a separate building,3
7410,loved that i had a bit of a problem if you have big luggages,3
7411,no working fan in the bathroom was not impressive at all,3
7412,front desk clerk was really nice and the breakfast was very basic but it was ok,3
7413,the area surrounding lacks any other amenities but there is a sports bar next door that was extremely noisy which made sleeping difficult,3
7414,this hotel had a clean room it was very small and not very private,3
7415,breakfast was lack luster but for what we stayed there for one night so overall this hotel for fine for our needs,3
7416,how can one person get up and go to the bar to grab a drink before they checked in,3
7417,the one thing i want to say about this hotel is that we were on the second floor and no elevator,3
7418,the location was good for what i needed,3
7419,the rooms were sparsely decorated the shower leaked everywhere and the tv was easily seen from everywhere in the room,3
7420,this really should be fixed in every room since a good night's rest and continued our trip the next day,3
7421,room was nice though i would choose a room with a queen since they just has a cancellation,3
7422,however fortunately the room itself was very clean and housekeeping staff was pleasant as well,3
7423,this hotel is no longer a country inn and suites that hasn't been updated since the late 90's,3
7424,the room worked well for our road trip,3
7425,to end on a positive note the room was comfortable looked clean had working,3
7426,its clean but past its prime needs an upgrade fresh coat of paint on it and call it good,3
7427,the night we had dinner the waiters were slow and it wasn't fun but it also wasn't awful for the price,3
7428,the beds and pillows were comfortable and clean,3
7429,after spending one night there i realized the sliding glass door it did not go away,3
7430,i have a disability where i have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area,3
7431,whole place is non smoking but our room had black mold on the ceiling above the air conditioner,3
7432,the room itself was a good size for a family of 4,3
7433,the motel was no frills but the room was nice but not exceptional,3
7434,walking distance to beach and almost right next door to it just in case your kids need something better for breakfast,3
7435,the location is great and close to everything we wanted to see,3
7436,the rooms aren't bad but the hallways get loud in the morning when it was close to i40 and the front desk was fantastic,3
7437,didn't sleep at all due to the noise of people coming and going at all hours,3
7438,for the good points the indoor pool was ok and the location was a short drive from st,3
7439,the staff was nice and the hotel was conveniently at a good rate,3
7440,the breakfast was ok make your own waffles was great and the wifi was in the room,3
7441,just don't plan to do anything using the wi-fi log in at check in we had to wait for the long line,3
7442,00 hold on my debit card and as of monday it was still there when we checked out there was not,3
7443,the buffet was ok wish they offered a little bit more convenient if you want to sleep in that is not going to happen,3
7444,they also make a lot of noise near the hotel,3
7445,it was freezing in the room but overall it was a pleasant surprise it was clean friendly and comfortable,3
7446,the hotel is very close to downtown monterey and so very convenient for walking down to beach and you can't beat the location,3
7447,very unusual that the hotel did not even provide bread,3
7448,room 3 and 4 which my parents and i stayed in one of the beds needed to be cleaned,3
7449,it was nice the staff was very friendly and an awesome help,3
7450,if we were passing through las vegas again and needed a place to stay passing through it works,3
7451,i stayed here for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel deca on a deal through jetsetter,3
7452,first off this is a great location if you are doing uw activities,3
7453,but front desk was very apologetic and moved us to a new room which was much better newer and cleaner,3
7454,the bathroom was musky and our room was cleaned every day of our stay,3
7455,breakfast buffet is nothing special but it got the job done and that's about it,3
7456,i stayed at this hotel for decadence based on a recommendation and i'm glad that's all we stayed,3
7457,they attempted to resolve some issues we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged,3
7458,you can hear people in the hallways and rooms were dirty,3
7459,we also had the restaurant and the bar was very good,3
7460,have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its convenience staff and clean rooms,3
7461,the room was nice but quite hot as there is no regular parking available hence the,3
7462,there are no directions for proper use settings for the coffee maker it had to be moved in order to open,3
7463,we stayed at the bates motel and didn't have to cut it as it was already in the room,3
7464,room was clean and service was great the hotel looked pretty,3
7465,so josh offered to print for me then asked if i wanted an accesible bathroom upon arrival,3
7466,coffee and breakfast area in the lobby is very small and the breakfast buffet only has waffles as a hot item,3
7467,when i spoke to the person at the front desk very polite and helpful,3
7468,we stayed in april i can't imagine anyone sitting in it,3
7469,there is also a free hot breakfast in the morning is the usual fare,3
7470,all in all though we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again,3
7471,there is valet but no one to help us at the desk,3
7472,the carpet on the floor was a bit dirty walls and doors needed a scrub,3
7473,this would be a good location but there aren't many restaurants within walking distance if you don't want to spend waterfront money,3
7474,i knew this wasn't going to be amazing simply because of the price and not the standard of a real 5 hotel,3
7475,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work it had a few roaches though i killed them fast,3
7476,i wouldn't say don't visit the hotel but some of the pillows had a slight dewy smell to them,3
7477,fitness room was clean and the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the areas attractions,3
7478,also the water form the shower ran out on the bathroom floor i will not choose this hotel without looking into other options available,3
7479,i think that this hotel was rated 4,3
7480,but was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the bathroom,3
7481,i immediately called the office as soon as i told them about it,3
7482,i took the drink to the desk and asked them for a new remote never heard back from,3
7483,i ended up leaving my car at the check in isle for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep,3
7484,breakfast was good and the rooms were very outdated,3
7485,rugs need to be replaced in the hotel and they were mostly positive,3
7486,wasn't expecting much for breakfast but it was pretty much what you would expect from a comfort inn,3
7487,visited here mainly because it was one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
7488,when it poured rain the carpet just inside the entry door to the room which we cleaned up before occupying the room,3
7489,management was nice and helpful the room however was quite small and cramped for the price we paid,3
7490,it was a good deal for the price,3
7491,we just needed a place to sleep on a pull out couch,3
7492,it is the best part of this hotel is close to railroad tracks,3
7493,then we find out they don't have a problem stocking this,3
7494,it was not the hotel's fault is that we were on the 3rd floor unless you smoke,3
7495,this hard to find bb is hard to find as you have to go through the effort to sell me another night stay,3
7496,my daughter will be starting school there in the fall and the hotel is just above the water taxi stands creating noise at all times,3
7497,hotel was fine and the fact that it is located on a side street so it's not a bad hotel would probably stay,3
7498,asked about local seafood recommendation we were given a room that was more in the area of 300,3
7499,then when entering the room it had not been vacuumed thoroughly for some time,3
7500,the room was quite small but the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice as it was within walking distance of the hotel,3
7501,the rooms don't have any amenities we had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug,3
7502,number of people handling breakfast was very less and were not able to open the door to the bathroom,3
7503,pros compared to other places this is a good choice if you don't mind it being a little,3
7504,most unusual style of shower that i've never seen alcohol-free wine before i ate at the restaurant there,3
7505,our room was clean and spacious the hotel restaurant was one of my favorite stops when in the area,3
7506,the lady at at the front desk and nothing was done to fix it,3
7507,it was clean except for the bed,3
7508,the valet service was a bit of a problem if you have big luggages,3
7509,i called the front desk to ask for more at the front desk in the morning that my room had not been cleaned,3
7510,staff was a bit rushed when i checked in that was unprofessional and rude,3
7511,there was no elevator so we stayed on the 2nd floor you could still hear everything outside,3
7512,bed was not very comfortable but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
7513,our room was ok but for the price which is one of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a couple days,3
7514,the exterior was uninviting but we were tired and did not get one,3
7515,i'm a non smoker and requesting a non smoking room had a burn,3
7516,it was noisy the first night and we could hear the system cycling on and off in the adjacent room as well,3
7517,carpet in the room needs to be renovated but it was very dark,3
7518,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
7519,chose this hotel since it had a kitchen which was great i didn't know would become irritating while sleeping,3
7520,my balcony an alleged feature of the room was comfortable but carpeting needs to be cleaned or replaced,3
7521,nice clean don't take a room to the front of the hotel is under significant renovation in rooms and the lobby,3
7522,i was disappointed that the hotel charged by card in the middle of everything,3
7523,additionally there were hardly any outlets in the room which was a pleasant surprise it was clean friendly and comfortable,3
7524,the tile floor in one of the chairs in the lobby,3
7525,room was clean and the shower was difficult to maintain,3
7526,so on a whim we checked in and was told the same,3
7527,glad this was a quick one night stay this place was solid,3
7528,stayed here for business and it was good could have more cable chanels,3
7529,very nice hotel lots to do in the area and there seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things,3
7530,a nightmare to say the least but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
7531,room was ok and the fridge was noisy,3
7532,just the bug bites i went home with were a bit of a funky smell oldish maybe a bit moldish,3
7533,room smelled a little like a boys locker room when i first arrived but it was switched to another,3
7534,the shower was ok but the beds are not very comfortable,3
7535,the la quinta ft lauderdale-sunrise is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance,3
7536,for that i would not stay here again,3
7537,excellent customer service at the front desk was manned at my 3 30am arrival,3
7538,but it was clean and neat but there was a tear in the carpet and the bathroom were horrible and in need of some upgrades,3
7539,there was a ton of noise not only in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
7540,if you are going to stay at the hotel and eat in,3
7541,they had no information in the room so every question required,3
7542,hotel room clean beds comfy advertised free wi-fi but this turned out not to be the case,3
7543,the front desk staff was fine room was big and the bed confortable,3
7544,overall the hotel was fine i with the shower specifically the shower head was original very worn and stuck in a mist,3
7545,i think they could step it up just a bit considering the price you pay you would expect a little more,3
7546,this hotel is just ok not at all a 4 star hotel the hotel condition the size of the elevator,3
7547,the staff was very friendly but the breakfast service was great,3
7548,a call to the front desk but when i went in the non-smoking room but my room smelled horrible,3
7549,and diane went out of her way to make sure we were alright,3
7550,then there was the shuttle to the airport running every hour,3
7551,our stay was great room was close to all the shops,3
7552,that said it was our first time at lobby,3
7553,after we complained we were moved to another room w o incident,3
7554,because of the room being so tiny i won't stay there anymore because of the price and previous reviews,3
7555,we slept 6 hours and were back on the road and out of town,3
7556,the room was not as clean as i would have liked to know that prior to booking,3
7557,when the temperature is below freezing and it's snowing outside it would have been a better stay if our room had been clean,3
7558,the counter staff was very friendly and our room was very small without any place to tidy clothes,3
7559,with it true but it doesn't pretend to be,3
7560,but if u just need a place to sleep after a long drive,3
7561,i was there just a couple hours in the afternoon and again after 9 pm on food and drinks,3
7562,unfortunately no one told us when we booked or when we checked in they were under construction pool was closed and breakfast was terrible,3
7563,i don't think it is anyplace close to the city center where we spent most of our time,3
7564,also on the internet page they said there is a wifi but there was no mention of this in the reservation confirmation,3
7565,the lights were a bit confusing as there is a nice run along the bay,3
7566,the website stated that the room had a nice big refrigerator which was nice,3
7567,the woman at the front desk could have been warmer but the room was clean well maintained,3
7568,this hotel is hard to find as you have to go through the effort to sell me another night stay,3
7569,when we got there the water was out the day we check out,3
7570,i guess it should be priced at 39,3
7571,got there 1 hour after check in they was sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra,3
7572,good restaurant lounge you can walk to a lot of restaurants shops and a supermarket in the surrendings and metro very close,3
7573,i wold stay again because for the price and close to the expressway,3
7574,perfect my girlfriend and i stayed here on a saturday night,3
7575,we had to walk to another hotel to see what they had,3
7576,the hotel location is great and close to everything we wanted to see,3
7577,on the negative breakfast is not included with this hotel and they will lose business,3
7578,our expectations for this hotel were to find a cheap room to get some sleep,3
7579,our room was filthy staff were uninformed and ignored us the only thing that was unbearable was the beds and pillows,3
7580,the la quinta ft lauderdale-sunrise is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance,3
7581,i liked that it was close to i40 and the front desk had already confused our reservation with someone else's,3
7582,very noticeable and should not have been open in that condition,3
7583,iconic theatre in the middle of the night,3
7584,the hotel is on the lido which is about a 10 min walk to the t,3
7585,the young lady at the front desk take all the questions,3
7586,i think i will be going back there next year,3
7587,the hotel itself was very nice and we had a 6 am international flight,3
7588,it is not in a good way,3
7589,we did not complain to the front desk and garage had that ghetto feel but the room was great,3
7590,overall it works room was clean and the bed was comfy,3
7591,other than that the room was fine and the bed was comfortable and the room was clean and the staff was attentive,3
7592,bug big was found in one of the rooms on the higher floors,3
7593,the only complaint that i have is that the bathrooms could use more counter space,3
7594,room was good size and i liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows,3
7595,since my wife and i stayed one night 8 2 before spending the next day at 5 p,3
7596,com was very reasonable so i am not a fan of was the dating of the hotel,3
7597,works for a night but it's not a 4 or 5 star property,3
7598,got over 100 a night wasn't all that impressed with the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness,3
7599,the sheets had a hole and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms,3
7600,but they do take a 50 deposit upon check-in and made suggestions of things to do while we were in towns,3
7601,ok place for a quick night's stay,3
7602,the floors could have been better there was a splatter of some sort on the ceiling and dust on the baseboards and cabinet doors,3
7603,okay to sleep for the night but the a c was cranking when we got to the destination,3
7604,this hotel was very convenient to the airport and a paid shuttle to the port,3
7605,other than my feet hanging off the bed the room was nice and big very clean but the beds were comfortable,3
7606,the mattress was very hard and the pillows were way too flat to sleep comfortably,3
7607,not fancy but it was clean and the location couldn't have been nicer,3
7608,room was clean and comfortable with the exception of the railroad tracks that run directly behind it,3
7609,the hot tub didn't work so we had to throw away some food,3
7610,we had a room with a king bed,3
7611,the staff were very friendly during my few interactions and the room was comfortable but carpeting needs to be cleaned or replaced,3
7612,the continental breakfast was nice and the breakfast had a nice variety,3
7613,he allowed us to check-in a few hours early,3
7614,there was only a tiny shelf in the shower and found a lot more,3
7615,it does have a good location for the shakespeare festival,3
7616,at least the bed was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings,3
7617,i was concerned about the proximity to the beach and towns,3
7618,the room was clean and the bathroom was a bit dated and breakfast was limited but served our needs just fine,3
7619,there was no phone in the room didn't have a double left,3
7620,the room was very reasonable and the location is very nice-just 3 blocks from bourbon street,3
7621,when we checked in that they were replacing the towels in the room,3
7622,although the room was clean and bed was,3
7623,ask for a room on the third floor did not work and we did not feel uncomfortable at all,3
7624,room was ok for an overnight stay after a wedding,3
7625,the anglers inn is an older property but clean and friendly,3
7626,paper thin walls lots of noise from the parking lot are left unlocked,3
7627,the staff and accommodations were nice but we found ants in our room,3
7628,tv was a flat panel and had a great view and i liked the inside corridors,3
7629,took two days and we had to call the front desk but when i went to check out no one was in the lower class,3
7630,there were so many mirrors so there was no water in the front lobby like most resorts have,3
7631,as the title said it was not the hotel's responsibility that it broke,3
7632,fortunately friends volunteered to keep her so we were able to leave windows open to help clear the air,3
7633,rooms have all amenities but really need to be updated but for the price and that was certainly delivered,3
7634,there were also a lot of noise from the hallway and surrounding rooms,3
7635,close to the strip you can walk to some others down the strip,3
7636,i was happy it had a microwave and a refrigerator and it did have a very nice pool and they keep it very clean,3
7637,i may return if i'm in the area but i would not stay here again,3
7638,the biggest surprise was when we were hit with a very pungent odor,3
7639,stayed 2 nights in the hotel but did not,3
7640,room 115 was also at the beginning of the smoking rooms unless you're a smoker,3
7641,so worked for us but i don't recommend anyone sleep on it,3
7642,i had to call and wait an hour to get into our room,3
7643,on a positive note the breakfast was nice and they are pet friendly,3
7644,the roof top garden gives you magnificent views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
7645,the room pillows were dirty the shower faucet was out of the money for a better hotel,3
7646,will stay there again if there are no rooms on the street side,3
7647,cons my room wasn't cleaned the best during my 4 night stay and the lady could not find our reservation,3
7648,the room was ok the refrigerator didn't work and tiles were loose in the bathroom,3
7649,she said she would make sure it was cleaned up by morning but it wasn't quite as luxurious as we had hoped,3
7650,i ordered a burger from room service and it was good for a two night stay,3
7651,the breakfast was nice and they are pet friendly up to 85 pounds i believe,3
7652,there was not enough room in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
7653,have to call for it after got out of the deal was free breakfast,3
7654,the desk is frequently unmanned so prepare to wait for the same bus to come back,3
7655,came up for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel deca on a deal through jetsetter,3
7656,the facility is outdated and the rooms are not all that,3
7657,one window was completely covered by ivy so we couldn't leave them open so we used the ac a lot,3
7658,there was mold on the shower curtain in room 106,3
7659,the location is iffy i would not go walking without my husband,3
7660,it will do in a pinch but nothing to write home about but it is an ok place to grab a bite to eat,3
7661,my stay was ok but we wouldn't stay there again,3
7662,a nice place for the price but our room smelled of smoke,3
7663,the manager on duty informed us that it was a favor that i got from the front desk the service,3
7664,this place is cute but we expected more out of the name than what i got,3
7665,entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me to see my face when i used the sink,3
7666,possibly because it was the end of the freemont street experience,3
7667,the brunette waitress in the restaurant was better than most,3
7668,we stayed in griffin for a memorial service and needed an inexpensive place to stay for a night big pool that the kids like,3
7669,one of the things i tend to rate when i stay in santa cruz because i want to walk everywhere,3
7670,the hotel was pretty quite even though it's next to the train tracks and it is loud and shakes the building,3
7671,i didn't like was the cleanliness of the room could have been claner,3
7672,my husband went down tot he front desk right away to let them know and they ended up moving us to a suite,3
7673,there were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a room next door 335 and everything seemed to work,3
7674,my room was not where i thought it would fall down on us so i turned,3
7675,since you need a car to get there or have to pay for it you are just a regular customer,3
7676,he said there was no way to give the kids a bath and the bottom of the barrel in room accommodations,3
7677,they have done some up grades but on the second floor which was much better newer and cleaner,3
7678,the baseboards were plain wood pulling away from the walls in the room and there was no ac at this time of year,3
7679,finally i was disappointed that the hotel charged by card in the middle of the action swimming pool well room established motel,3
7680,the service is good and they didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1,3
7681,upon check in we were told we could play extra holes,3
7682,staff at the hotel restaurant was quite pleasant and the staff was friendly and helpful,3
7683,i expected more from a best western but i'd suggest you drop the grand from the name,3
7684,we just needed a decent place to sleep very close to the train station,3
7685,however the rooms are very nice and comfortable and the staff was quiet,3
7686,pools were nice but if you have mobility issues ask for a ground floor room with a sliding glass door and a balcony area,3
7687,when i first walked in it was very well decorated and i was just looking to take a shower,3
7688,upon arrival spare blanket was soiled and we had to wait more than 45 minutes for shuttle service,3
7689,the housekeeping staff did not properly service the room on the other hand the interior design of the rooms could be better e,3
7690,the place is ok a little old but it was clean and smelled good,3
7691,the hotel staff was friendly and well trained,3
7692,staff not very friendly except sam which was very helpful and full of information about the area,3
7693,continental breakfast was great room was close to all the shops,3
7694,the carpet on the floor was a bit dirty walls and doors needed a scrub,3
7695,its clean but past its prime needs an upgrade fresh coat of paint on it and call it good,3
7696,on a road trip and didn't want to bring him out and spook him with the fireworks,3
7697,as the title said it was not the hotel's fault is that we were on the 17th floor that stops almost every floor,3
7698,the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard and the beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean,3
7699,i chose this location due to the lack of parking,3
7700,think this is one of the cheapest in the area which is why i only gave 3,3
7701,the only complaint was that there was a problem with getting a receipt for her complete stay,3
7702,very nice hotel in a good location close to the interstate,3
7703,loved the fact that the walls are rather thin,3
7704,while my room had a very strong odor,3
7705,overall fine place for a stop over it was clean but little things like the paper towels and toilet paper are like sandpaper,3
7706,there was a ton of noise not only in the room for us and our luggage,3
7707,the hotel was clean and very comfortable,3
7708,we recently stayed here for a wedding weekend,3
7709,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
7710,continental breakfast was better than i expected given the condition of the room as the hotel was booked full,3
7711,the location was perfect however the room we stayed in needed to be updated,3
7712,i have stayed in a lot of hotels in the vicinity,3
7713,the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard and the beds were comfortable and internet was fast,3
7714,i stay at this hotel but ask for a room that already smelled like smoke,3
7715,there were so many mirrors so there was no water pressure in the shower was sometimes close to cold what is not nice too,3
7716,as for the continental breakfast at 7 am the same 2 pieces of fruit in trays in a very tiny lobby area,3
7717,also there was not a place to stay when visiting yosemite,3
7718,finally i was disappointed that a complimentary breakfast would available but that was not totally unexpected,3
7719,it took quite a while to find a room that had very recently been smoked in,3
7720,hotel is older and in need of a deep clean,3
7721,i have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its modest rates,3
7722,did not like the smell of the room and ensuring the remainder of my stay was comfortable,3
7723,then upon asking for a microwave to use and was told no we don't have any amenities we had to call to remind them,3
7724,room was nice though i would choose a room with a great view of the rocks in the park,3
7725,i neglected to note there was no elevator so we had to sit in the breakfast area,3
7726,floors were beyond disgusting wear shoes at all times and the bed linens were clean as were the bathroom and towels,3
7727,the hotel can be difficult to communicate with if you do not care that you are not staying by the beach,3
7728,i guess this place suits people looking for a cheap place to stay,3
7729,the handles don't turn so the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging unplugging it,3
7730,the room was okay and the coffee excellent,3
7731,the parking garage has its own elevator that you must use which is on the back of the hotel so it didn't last long,3
7732,upon entering my room i got a smell of damp and the room was spacious and the breakfast filled you up,3
7733,on chatting with the house keeper as cleaned the room next to us barked for 7 hours,3
7734,clean rustic place with a weird heated pool in the basement was dark and really creepy,3
7735,when they get ac units i think this hotel needs some advice on a healthy breakfast,3
7736,also there was not a lot of choice for breakfast,3
7737,the room rates were not bad considering the proximity to the beach and shops and in this respect we were pleased,3
7738,the beds and pillows comfortable and the room was clean and nicely furnished,3
7739,said breakfast was included but they didnt have enough sheets to give us any for,3
7740,we ended up having a good time across the hall thankfully,3
7741,we just needed a clean quiet room and we got that,3
7742,our room was ok but for the price which is one of the better off property hotels ive stayed at,3
7743,that usually would have been no problem but my husband and i had the king bed room with hot tub,3
7744,then we had to wait for 15minutes to get to my final destination,3
7745,room was not cleaned and i had to call and wait an hour to get the person in front of me,3
7746,just don't plan to do anything using the wi-fi on a laptop not on my mobile devices,3
7747,however the rooms were very noisy and you could hear some noise,3
7748,the floors were disgusting rarely vacuumed and i don't think a hold needs to last that long,3
7749,i totally lower my expectations when i stay in dc i am now staying elsewhere,3
7750,the room is old but clean and comfortable,3
7751,our room ac was only an old window unit and the room was large and clean and a good value for the money,3
7752,just be prepared to help the staff if you need a bathroom and bed it's a fine place to stay,3
7753,the room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable,3
7754,i was there just a couple hours in the afternoon and again after 9 pm on food and drinks,3
7755,not 5 star but still not the worst i've ever stayed in but left a lot to be desired,3
7756,however there were stains on a pillow carpet was filthy and there was a dealer that i could resolve the problem,3
7757,they say they offer room service however when i went to the front desk to ask for,3
7758,they were doing construction and when i called the front desk and ask for help,3
7759,the location was right off the freeway so it's easy to catch a bus,3
7760,i don't like to see debris behind desks and i think they could make better signs if that was really a problem,3
7761,the best soup and salad bar in all of the hotels i stayed in,3
7762,i think the rooms need to be renovated to effectively block outside noise,3
7763,i'm in a room in the upper floors breathtaking sight,3
7764,despite that the staff was very friendly and got us checked in quickly,3
7765,for the price 140 night per room we felt that the hotel was not the greatest but the customer service was great,3
7766,there was a full size refrigerator in the room although that's pretty standard for holiday inn express,3
7767,there was also a lot of naked old men hanging out on the ceiling of the bathroom all weekend also,3
7768,the prices was good but hotel didn't have a lot of selection or gluten free selections,3
7769,bonuses about the hotel is that it was too noisy windows are not insulated,3
7770,the options are limited so we had no programming to see,3
7771,2 bed queen room with a view or be more descriptive,3
7772,while i thoroughly concur with the ta advice i found that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful,3
7773,the carpet on the floor was a bit dirty walls and doors needed a scrub,3
7774,the mattress was good and the service was really slow,3
7775,although the location is good and the lobby is well lit,3
7776,the first room i was given had not been cleaned ants were crawling in the windows and the service was friendly and pleasant,3
7777,hotel was doing a lot of construction around so it made it hard to find a seat on the weekend,3
7778,we were looking for an overnight place to stay while in osage beach well i highly recommend this property,3
7779,kids loved the pool which is a good size but a little dated,3
7780,the hostess was nice the room was and smelled clean,3
7781,having said that there are some drawbacks there is no coffee maker in the room but your not promised what you asked for,3
7782,but otherwise it was fine for our needs and the facility itself quiet and comfortable,3
7783,the lobby was a bit offputting because it had a door to the bedroom,3
7784,there is a pool area but that is an extra charge and it didn't have an atm in the hotel,3
7785,dog in the room next to it i could hear everything going on all around us,3
7786,we stayed her because we had an early flight and got zero sleep,3
7787,its actually a decent deal for what you pay but if you get a good value,3
7788,nice furnishings and the bathroom was not very clean but i always wear shoes in hotels anyway,3
7789,it wasn't in the room when we first walked on which made the room seem more clean and modern,3
7790,overall the cleanliness was acceptable but the flooring in the bathroom was the thing making the room accessible,3
7791,coffee and breakfast area in the lobby is covered by a piece,3
7792,the adult pool was a lot better than in person,3
7793,my issues with this place are that there was no kitchen plates cups etc in the room nor a coffee pot,3
7794,it was awesome that i could get to the airport the next morning,3
7795,it was not a room to spend much time in the room and told her the beds had not been made either,3
7796,the free breakfast had a pathetic selection and was cold so we ate out most of the time we were there,3
7797,the owner is very nice and helpful staff,3
7798,we were charged a smoking fee for a room that was on the counter either,3
7799,when you check into your room be sure to check directly with the hotel were not recognised,3
7800,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and the fridge was a bonus,3
7801,eventhough we stayed in the junior suite with a small living room with fireplace kitchenette small bath and a bedroom s,3
7802,hotel personnel knows of disparity but that's the best thing about this hotel,3
7803,no elevator ha to climb 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located,3
7804,upon checking in the lady at the desk was very nice and friendly,3
7805,nice hotel and service but the price was the best part,3
7806,the room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in was super nice,3
7807,parking is tight and some is located on a busy road so noisy,3
7808,nobody in the lobby i used this hotel because the room looked nice and the other hotel workers were courteous and customer friendly,3
7809,on several occasions there was no one to help you,3
7810,since we had a bad experience with my room when i wasn't there to eat,3
7811,not even sure why because it was not so far from casino del sol,3
7812,our to was great but there were no signs of bugs on the linens and we were not told the pool was under construction,3
7813,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work and it was like a sauna in our room,3
7814,complimentary computer service and printing assistance when i needed to print boarding passes something needed by every traveler,3
7815,the weather was hot and the room was clean and comfortable,3
7816,a young bellman also went above and beyond calling around trying to find a pizza place that would deliver and the internet code,3
7817,there was also a lot of naked old men hanging out on the ceiling of the bathroom all weekend also,3
7818,breakfast was fine and they had a free shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
7819,the room was nice but i would not recommend staying at this location,3
7820,it took about an hour to get to the hotel through a very weird access road,3
7821,as we checked out we were asked about our stay when i checked out,3
7822,this hotel had a clean room it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice,3
7823,my husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the day we were checking out,3
7824,the room was cheap and clean but my room was not serviced until nearly 7 pm,3
7825,rooms were ok but carpets didn't seem to know where anything in town was,3
7826,i enjoyed my stay but it was a convenient location for our needs,3
7827,the restaurant is too loud and without much of a breeze and the ceiling fan helped very little,3
7828,right off of freeway easy to get to and close to good resturants,3
7829,i was glad that our room did not smell like this,3
7830,it looks like they tried to update the room but didn't do a good job of taking care of us,3
7831,other than that the location was good for what i needed,3
7832,it was awesome that our room did not work well at all,3
7833,turns out there was a bus stop at the entrance and no more fresh fruit there either just tacky,3
7834,i was only here one night so the small tv didn't bother me so much but it might some others,3
7835,how do you check in we had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug,3
7836,but the hotel makes up in customer service and conduct dress befitting a representative of the motel chain,3
7837,kudos to the workers for being so kind and i'm sure he would've switched us,3
7838,the plumbing was old and it had a full kitchen to prepare meals and not always had to eat out,3
7839,was a good place to stay for the weekend 4th of july festivities,3
7840,i left to go to the airport and affordable,3
7841,when we arrived there were several people outside in the parking lot who seemed to be having too good of a time,3
7842,customer service in front desk was non existent but i don't recommend anyone sleep on it,3
7843,the breakfast was nice for continental fair and it was a good value and an adequate breakfast,3
7844,i'd say my stay was so-so but bed was amazing,3
7845,i will not say it was a bad hotel but not really good location for walking around with small children,3
7846,the room does have a refrigerator and some don't,3
7847,got to the hotel at around 1 00am and was informed that there were no king rooms available house keeping wasn't done,3
7848,we chose this hotel because it was close to the big sawgrass shopping mall,3
7849,the hotel is not close to restaurants or activities it stands in the middle of the action swimming pool well room established motel,3
7850,the room was adequate pool was very small and strangely carpeted in red with no hot tub,3
7851,i also wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price i paid to this property,3
7852,bed is what you would expect 2 queen beds a big tall guy had to sleep on a drive from florida to ohio,3
7853,it is clean and generally comfortable but it is getting rundown and the amenities are okay but it's priced as though it's outstanding,3
7854,and with the king street trolley you can easily get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
7855,might have been much better if they had a microwave to use i saw this in their back room,3
7856,i needed cash to pay a taxi fare and they didn't even have lids for the coffee which tasted like poison,3
7857,based on the fact we wanted a cheap place to stay this is it,3
7858,the front desk staff both of them were not welcoming and did not acknowledge us even when we wanted to have a drink,3
7859,there were no extra blankets available in the room and there was no available parking i had to create a spot,3
7860,oops ken just told me if i asked for a room on the north tower,3
7861,great trip help at the hotel was great and the location was convenient to highways and restaurants however the hallways and rooms,3
7862,i stayed in a superior room with a king bed fridge and microwave for 70,3
7863,one other thing to touch on that didn't bother me too much but would of it i had more downtime,3
7864,it was just a place for me to sleep for the night but the a c was loud,3
7865,it was a place to stay for one night so i could get a replacement phone,3
7866,this is a great hotel for the price and because it was not so far from home when you encounter such a happy staff,3
7867,the bathroom did not get the room i booked wasn't even available,3
7868,the room was nicer that i thought it was a little annoying so i called the front office and told them of the situation,3
7869,the employees were all very friendly and helpful at check in,3
7870,the metro is a good 15 minute walk to the beach boardwalk and much less expensive,3
7871,the chair in the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it's dust cigarette smoke or mildew,3
7872,carpet had wet spots on it all over the tv so my kids wanted to check it out,3
7873,i enjoyed the price rates i had more money it would not be my choice,3
7874,i enjoyed the price rates i had more money it would not be my choice,3
7875,i just need a bed and a shower and that is what i woke up to each morning,3
7876,only complaint would be the breakfast area is much too small,3
7877,the lady in the room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in they were under construction pool was closed and not working,3
7878,i was commuting to dusseldorf each day so it was sweltering at night when we got back,3
7879,hotel is older and in need of replacement in our room,3
7880,as a traveling technician i spend over 100 nights a year in a hotel room was decent cleanliness could have been better,3
7881,what i liked best was the refrigerator and microwave in room were a plus,3
7882,the price was right and the location could not be beat,3
7883,one exit up is a lot of construction being done to the hotel,3
7884,i booked it anyway due to the price and the breakfast was good but seating area was small and crowded,3
7885,need new bathroom faucets and water pressure low but other than that i would stay here again,3
7886,our room was comfortable and clean for our family of 4 found the room very crowded,3
7887,free breakfast was good with a smile,3
7888,they were doing construction remodeling when we went therefore it wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet,3
7889,for 210 night the room was not very clean but i always wear shoes in hotels anyway,3
7890,will stay there again any time i'm in the area but i would not have stayed even the first night,3
7891,the maid was really nice and the hotel was right in it,3
7892,i guess it should be priced at 39,3
7893,it looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and the pictures are not reliable,3
7894,i stayed here for work because it was the only one with a key to acess the towels,3
7895,would've been a nice place for a nice price,3
7896,the staff at check-in but otherwise it was fine for overnight stay on our way to florida,3
7897,i really felt like i was inconveniencing her,3
7898,the room was clean and pristine aside from the musty smell and room service was always happy to deliver more pillows with a smile,3
7899,the front desk staff was very friendly at check-in was quick and easy,3
7900,the service was nice but not very big,3
7901,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
7902,it took forever for the room to warm well after midnight,3
7903,the room was mostly what we expected as we had stayed here before and had a good experience,3
7904,generally a good overnight stay for a football game in tuscaloosa,3
7905,things that made this more like a 2 1 2 star facility,3
7906,it's not the best hotel breakfast i've had juice machine was out of order so stuff had to be carried upstairs,3
7907,it was ok for the price but would not stay there again,3
7908,i didn't like the fact that the front desk person was very nice and our check-in,3
7909,the sink had a long crack and the tub had a hard time getting hot tub time because of kids running in and out,3
7910,the sheets are clean and the bathroom was very small but clean,3
7911,only a one night stay for golf tournament,3
7912,however we had a room with a view of the beautiful pool area so don't count on internet access from your room,3
7913,i only had one issue with my stay which was one day my room wasn't cleaned before she checked in,3
7914,we weren't in the hotel very long so i didn't care at that point i was so itchy,3
7915,it's less than 10 minutes from the airport it's very clean and the ac worked well but a bit noisy,3
7916,but the bigger issue really the only issue worth reporting is that the walls are so thin we heard every word and were awakened,3
7917,loved the garden and it was very convenient to the dmacc campus,3
7918,had to run a c to drown out the noise from the other guests or the neighborhood,3
7919,my husband and i stayed in one of the rooms that we had booked was not available,3
7920,staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was good and the staff seem overwhelmed,3
7921,it was very hard to breath as if mold was in the room was very clean and well put-together,3
7922,the buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit eggs and sausage as well as the lodge's close proximity to the aquarium and the queen mary,3
7923,the beds were a little hard and the pillows so small i would give it a 3,3
7924,a small refrigerator in the room which was a pleasant surprise it was clean friendly and comfortable,3
7925,enjoyed stay wish i would have known ahead of time that the hot tub was incorrect which made turning on the jets confusing,3
7926,the room was adequate pool was very small and not very fluffy,3
7927,the hotel was clean but in bad condition,3
7928,i signed up for pay at hotel and realized that the hotel charged for wi-fi and internet connection,3
7929,there was a lot a late night parting going on in hotel but it was late and we needed to get some sleep,3
7930,this caused a major problem for us as we simply needed a place to sllep,3
7931,hotel was okay room was a little small and the air conditioner was loud but kept room comfortable on super hot day,3
7932,ashley at front desk at front desk was friendly enough when we checked in,3
7933,the rooms seriously need updating but they are currently in the middle of the bed i could not sleep,3
7934,i would not come back to the hotel late that night that is,3
7935,very nice hotel lots to do in the area and there seemed to be a daily problem,3
7936,the hotel was nice enough its been taken over by choice i had wanted to stay at the hotel and liked it,3
7937,the staff and accommodations were nice but we found ants in our room,3
7938,the only thing i didn't like that there wasn't a reservation even though i gave the confirmation number,3
7939,the cold water wasn't working as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker and low-sugar syrup,3
7940,if a person needs just a place to sleep shower and check the internet,3
7941,an attempt has been made to update it but the rooms are in drastic need of an overhaul,3
7942,the hotel staff was very friendly but the breakfast staff was very friendly and an awesome help,3
7943,location is great of course the room was clean but not nicely decorated,3
7944,my balcony an alleged feature of the room was comfortable and clean but nothing fancy,3
7945,the website for this hotel said they opened but when we arrived we were informed that they had overbooked it,3
7946,our to was great but there was a roach in our room,3
7947,we just needed a clean quiet room and we got it,3
7948,the location is good and the room was very clean and the service staff person on our floors was very friendly too,3
7949,other than this small the room was and smelled clean,3
7950,the location is very close to the noisy street,3
7951,hampton inn did serve a good breakfast and the other hotel allowed some smoking rooms that i have a real problem with,3
7952,the hotel is reasonable the location is good and the room was clean however the window air conditioner really needed cleaning,3
7953,dealt with several of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel,3
7954,helpful employees room very small advertised a queen size bed and got a queen,3
7955,i was there for one night which i thought was a plus,3
7956,bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was good but i wish we would have checked,3
7957,but way to over priced for the size amenities and quality of the hotel,3
7958,they have a microwave and fridge in the room is tiny and doesn't keep anything coke,3
7959,had an issue with elevator didn't work properly in our room and the bathroom looked very nice,3
7960,everybody was very friendly for the most part clean however just very old reminded me more of a small older condo,3
7961,our room was right next to a railroad track and you could hear everything that was going on in the lobby from this room,3
7962,but like i said the staff was great and very accommodating,3
7963,when they complained to the manager he got hostile and did not make my husband and i booked our room for local events,3
7964,i think the hotel could use a bit of updating,3
7965,refrigerator and free hot breakfast included in the stay but the breakfast area was not very clean but i always wear shoes in hotels anyway,3
7966,the service was outstanding both at the desk and it was no problem to get one,3
7967,doors to our room were quite thin so it was quite hot and stuffy in the hall,3
7968,it was annoying but do able so i didn't have the kids with us,3
7969,bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar but the breakfast service was horribly slow both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food,3
7970,when checked into the room there was no coffee or wash cloths in the room,3
7971,but that's the best thing about the hotel is the han original turkish restaurant alemdar cad,3
7972,the lobby was clean and comfortable and the staff at the front desk who seemed to be having too good of a time,3
7973,however we had a room with a king bed,3
7974,it's close to the airport so i can't comment on it,3
7975,if you are going to pay dearly and wait a long time to get to our room or come down for breakfast,3
7976,there were no vending machines of any kind so if you want a location next to the gondola and center of town,3
7977,i may return if i'm in the area but i would not stay here,3
7978,ok hotel old for price not what expected but in all it was a great hotel for the price,3
7979,only stood for one night but not for a long vacation,3
7980,they claimed it was due to the renovations,3
7981,the room was dusty on the furniture as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
7982,we travel a lot and have come to realize that there can be a considerable difference in their furnishings and amenities,3
7983,therefore before i could officially check out i had to go into the key room and find my keys,3
7984,they printed directions for us as we simply needed a place to sleep that was close to i-15 and inexpensive but clean,3
7985,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying here again for the price,3
7986,hotel and staff were excellent but the only thing i didn't like was the cleanliness of the,3
7987,tv was old and in need of replacement in our room,3
7988,picked it because it was close to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult,3
7989,the biggest problem with the room was an odd musky smell,3
7990,however once we got back to the hotel as many one way streets,3
7991,stayed a night with my kiddo it was a good choice for us because it was close to the big sawgrass shopping mall,3
7992,yet the manager was very abrasive and did not make my husband and i bought the romance package for our anniversary,3
7993,stayed in the area for one night to lay your head at night,3
7994,i agree with the reviewer who complained about the noisy a c and the good is gone,3
7995,people do smoke in the room that looked like they had been washed and dried and were small squares,3
7996,the front desk staff was nice and very helpful,3
7997,if that was on the description i would not have stayed there if i knew that,3
7998,the rooms are very nice for the price we paid for it,3
7999,not bad for the price but no extras,3
8000,i replied with the fact that i booked this hotel mainly for a continental breakfast and even a pool,3
8001,i requested a change but was assured it would be ok if it was inexpensively priced,3
8002,staff was very friendly and our room was on first floor with king bed,3
8003,the hotel price was good but the 2nd stay was not,3
8004,after talking to the front desk to ask for a few things and it felt like air-conditioning,3
8005,clean very basic no frills rooms are very dated and don't really match a 4 star rating,3
8006,bathroom is fairly newer but still could use an upgrade but they keep it clean,3
8007,i was in bangor for a concert at the webster theater on 3 26 16,3
8008,so i was already paying more than i should for an establishment that did not earn that value,3
8009,overall not too bad though if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills,3
8010,very nice hotel lots to do in the area and with a clean room good bed and wifi to boot,3
8011,i was very surprised that there was not a lot of healthy food for breakfast either,3
8012,it was nice having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the lodge's close proximity to the aquarium and the queen mary,3
8013,but it's done so with a fairly blank face with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
8014,wouldn't want to stay longer than a night or two that's all you need,3
8015,the walls are thin and you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you,3
8016,quick check in they are remodeling but my room was not cleaned or towels replaced but we found out they were short staffed,3
8017,the bathroom was clean but there was nothing stocked in it,3
8018,as for the continental breakfast at 7 am the same 2 pieces of fruit in trays in a very tiny lobby area,3
8019,not fancy but it was clean and the staff was courteous,3
8020,over all the staff is great as usual,3
8021,perhaps a little pricier than i was looking for food items that would have,3
8022,for the price 140 night per room we felt that the hotel was sold after i booked my room on hotels,3
8023,the only complaint was the check-in line for 30 minutes,3
8024,we stayed there 3 days and it was like this was your first ever busy holiday,3
8025,there are soda or ice machines on the second floor which was much better newer and cleaner,3
8026,ask for a room with 2 double beds,3
8027,nevertheless the price was right and the location could not be beat,3
8028,i would stay here again if i needed a place to sleep after a long drive,3
8029,the women that ownes the hotel is very close to disney parks,3
8030,i went to the desk to find a pizza place for us that would deliver,3
8031,i chose this hotel because it had a very musty smell but seemed clean,3
8032,i booked a queen single bed and they put me in a cab to go to another hotel,3
8033,no towels in the room had a very micebtv refrigerator and microwave,3
8034,the lady behind the desk very pleasant and accommodating the public hallways were clean and odor free but run down,3
8035,the hotel lobby was clean and comfortable for the price,3
8036,i could not find anywhere inside yosemite to stay so i ended up in ely unexpectedly and without any motel reservation,3
8037,location of the hotel as well as the chico state campus,3
8038,we arrived at night and get a room on the ground floor beside stairs so it was a little noisy,3
8039,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but we did let the maid know,3
8040,the sink had a long crack and the tub had a hard time accepting the facility garbage and mattresses in the back garage also,3
8041,the floors were pretty thin so we could hear people in the other rooms,3
8042,desk clerk was wonderful he went above and beyond to help us set up a shuttle,3
8043,the only thing wrong with the room in fact the bed was comfortable if a little squeaky,3
8044,i have to say that it was awesome that our room did not get housekeeping 2 days in a row,3
8045,staff was very friendly and our room was still available no problems at all,3
8046,now we did sleep with our window open due to the fact that the room was clean and the amenities would always be replaced,3
8047,there were semi's that looked like they had been washed and dried and were small squares,3
8048,and yes i knew it was that way when i booked it and when i got there the hotel power has just come back on,3
8049,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
8050,we had 2 beds in our room and in the hall,3
8051,it was a nice hotel but they are in the process of renovating the lobby area,3
8052,booked what was supposed to be a non smoking room i put in a quarter of smokers,3
8053,our room was moderate clean and had a fully working kitchen,3
8054,bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was not impressive at all,3
8055,10 am means you need to be near the river,3
8056,but the walls of the rooms are very nice and comfortable,3
8057,even the bed was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings,3
8058,hotel is dated but it is clean and quiet close to the lovely town market,3
8059,the common areas of the hotel feel a bit tired and could have done with freshening up grouting etc,3
8060,room was clean and quiet however the staff was really nice and accommodating,3
8061,normally we stay at another hotel next year,3
8062,there were stains on the carpet and the bedspread also had holes,3
8063,i had to wait awhile at the front desk take all the questions,3
8064,no staff at the desk were very nice,3
8065,i needed a place to sleep like us,3
8066,food was good and a good value for the price,3
8067,the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo,3
8068,key cards didn't work and the hot tub is located in an area with many other hotels and fast food restaurants in the area,3
8069,the hotel room was ok for an overnight stay before a flight,3
8070,the beds were comfortable room was clean and bedding was comfortable,3
8071,instead we were given rooms on the second floor right out my window the hotel dumpsters,3
8072,at 7 am we were woken by the noise of the beach,3
8073,i must say that there is really nothing wrong with this hotel for the size of the hotel,3
8074,great staff lots of traffic in out of the hotel was far superior to this one,3
8075,the floors were pretty thin so we could hear people laughing and talking throughout the night,3
8076,the hotel has a amazing views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality,3
8077,pool was nice but there is no elevator in or near the lobby,3
8078,said we had to pay a separate fee to use the pool and i hardly saw the restaurant open though we were gone,3
8079,several major tv stations missing coffee machine in room had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk staff were nice,3
8080,front desk and shuttle drivers can be a bit difficult to find on iphone maps and location disappointing upon finding,3
8081,no elevator to second floor would be a problem for larger or older people,3
8082,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
8083,loved the proximity to the beach and towns,3
8084,the staff was friendly but the hotel was pretty the staff was very friendly also,3
8085,if your looking for a cheap place to stay on our way to branson,3
8086,beds were comfortable and the shower worked great,3
8087,most other hotels in the area next time,3
8088,room was huge but bathroom was very small and was barely big enough for 2,3
8089,would have been happier had they provided some sort of breakfast option,3
8090,i'm a non smoker and i got a virus while i was their,3
8091,150 after 2 pm and we were told we were upgraded not sure exactly what that upgrade meant,3
8092,when we entered the initial room we were assigned had not been cleaned,3
8093,let's just say that wasn't the hotel's fault,3
8094,the hotel was a little loud with a lot of restaurants boutiques and grocery,3
8095,we could not get a hotel in decorah iowa and this was the only sheraton and my only disappointment,3
8096,but if you want a location next to the university of washington-seattle this is a nice clean hotel,3
8097,if you are lucky you might get a room with a door attaching to next room which i did not expect,3
8098,hotel deca was located in a nice setting right next door to it just in case your kids need something better for breakfast,3
8099,the restroom in the lobby area is beautiful,3
8100,overall it's a very short walk to the french quarter bourbon street,3
8101,we went to play pickleball as the hotel is under renovation but we had an old room and it showed,3
8102,we'd just come from a hilton garden inn which is a very good location in regards to our reasons for being there,3
8103,fitness room is too small and was packed and we had to wait for 15minutes to get to my room,3
8104,the stay was quiet and relaxing so we got a good quiet sleep every night there,3
8105,it was easy to reach easy to find and if you forgot something near shopping and restaurants,3
8106,i felt when i asked for a non smoking room but i got a room,3
8107,no break on the price even though we were told we were going to be out,3
8108,the front desk staff were friendly but the front desk clerks were nice,3
8109,hotel wasn't as clean as i wished it to be,3
8110,on a positive note whenever we had a request at the front desk a bit while the night clerk searched for requested items,3
8111,i believe it's because we booked through expedia so she couldn't help us,3
8112,when i returned at the end of the freemont street experience,3
8113,overall i'd stay here again if visiting kauai,3
8114,too close to the highway but it was a convenient location in west monroe for dinning,3
8115,hotel was ok but there was no signal in our room,3
8116,room was not cleaned on a regular basis and appeared to be very disorganized,3
8117,what we liked about the hotel was it was close to the plant i was working at night,3
8118,not luxury hotel but for those looking for extras in their hotel stay,3
8119,the only complaint was that there was no coffee to make in it,3
8120,holiday inn has become one of the most unique setups i've ever experienced,3
8121,we stayed at this laquinta several times in the past and they were much nicer,3
8122,staff was friendly but the hotel was very close to the noisy street,3
8123,the room was clean but seemed damp mildewed like no one had vacuumed i would never recommend anyone to stay there,3
8124,we drove around the block twice trying to figure out the remote to the television,3
8125,the train close to this hotel is pretty good but not this time,3
8126,wasn't bad hotel except the toilet didn't function very well and over flowed one night,3
8127,other than that it was a seasonal pool,3
8128,slept well and enjoyed facilities in the room would have been more compelling but,3
8129,i understand colorado's marijuana laws make it difficult for hotels in the same price range and see if it gets better,3
8130,the manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for someone to bring ice up to us,3
8131,the ice machine was not working on the 2nd floor you could still hear everything outside,3
8132,room was ok but there was no good night here,3
8133,however once we got back to the hotel near the republique next time,3
8134,the room is plain but very clean with a modern decor and it had all of the essentials and they all worked find,3
8135,upon walking into the room there was water in the bathroom there is a drain on the floor and side table,3
8136,they people at the front desk because they didn't have any issues,3
8137,hotwire indicated a resort fee for the stay but it is what it is,3
8138,we wanted to be a walk to the beach and centrally located for our travels,3
8139,the ac unit is right next to the stairs but we heard nothing,3
8140,my husband and i stayed one night 8 2 before spending the next day at about noon to see if one would be available,3
8141,hiltons standard is not the same thing without being able to enjoy breakfast in the morning but what about us tea drinkers,3
8142,we were only there for one night on my way across the country,3
8143,this hotel is a very good location in the middle of the bed i could not sleep,3
8144,the rooms were clean it has a fridge it's not too close to the highway and very convenient,3
8145,the dirty stale cigarette smoke ruined what could be a great hotel if you got an updated room,3
8146,room needs updating mattress was too hard however it was clean and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo,3
8147,then upon asking for a microwave to use and was told no we don't have a coffeemaker ask it at front desk,3
8148,other than that staff was friendly and the bed comfortable the room falls a little short to be excellent,3
8149,rooms were clean and serviceable and the bed was very comfortable and the dcor reflective of the marriott,3
8150,room small and not as clean as i wished it to be,3
8151,we stayed at this hotel because it was close to where i needed to be,3
8152,close to southland gray hound park just a 2 minute walk to the beach boardwalk and much less expensive,3
8153,the room was adequate and about what you would expect 2 queen beds a nice,3
8154,i am a non-smoker and i thought the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke but the room did not smell of smoke,3
8155,i called done to the desk and the lady who served the breakfast was super nice,3
8156,if you are needing to be in the best part of this hotel is close to railroad tracks,3
8157,honestly we were expecting more than that but it was a bit run down but clean and functional,3
8158,most personnel were very friendly and willing to help you out if needed,3
8159,that said the room was clean and met our needs,3
8160,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the summer but didn't they know that was coming,3
8161,and the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet that was free but opted to go across the street to another place,3
8162,perhaps a little pricier than i was looking for a day spa while traveling to colorado springs,3
8163,elevator seemed a bit old and in need of updating,3
8164,i enjoyed using the fitness room but the pool was very small and not very fluffy,3
8165,rooms are dated and front desk staff was very helpful with any needs,3
8166,however the hotel is old and could use some repair of suspension posts and spanking tables,3
8167,like may other places the ac will be off when you walk in you can smell the chlorine throughout the facility,3
8168,had a relative in nearby hospital and just needed a place to sleep shower and check the internet,3
8169,one of the things i tend to rate when i stay in santa cruz because i want to walk everywhere,3
8170,inconveniently i will have to continue to call about it to make sure no one could get in,3
8171,we arrived quite late in the evening and the room service is poor,3
8172,we were in-town for one night and it fit the bill,3
8173,i booked a last minute trip not pleasure,3
8174,kids activities in the evening but unless you eat at the hotel restaurant bar was delicious although a little pricey which should be expected,3
8175,we stayed here because it was close to i40 and the front desk was ignorant,3
8176,the room was stuffy without much of a breeze and the staff were all very friendly and helpful,3
8177,i certainly don't have any amenities we had to call for a replacement,3
8178,we were on the second floor right above a smoking room and had to move us 2 days later,3
8179,the location was right off the freeway so it was very loud you could hear your next door neighbors,3
8180,breakfast was a bit lacking but restaurants close by so not a big deal but i felt like a 5 star guest,3
8181,but i wasn't going to be amazing simply because of the price and location were perfect the hotel could use some remodeling,3
8182,concersations from other rooms were plainly audible in our room and there was only one water glass and one coffee cup,3
8183,she had her stone face on the whole time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
8184,it was well maintained but the room size was great for the price we paid,3
8185,hotel is older but staff was friendly and the bed was comfortable and the location of the hotel and the location is excellent,3
8186,the lobby was a bit offputting because it had a very musty bad odor not a good first impression,3
8187,it is close to the beach without having to deal with all the noise of the train and the street traffic,3
8188,the 2nd visit i had was less than a week later and the hot tub didn't work so it was far from comfortable,3
8189,doubtful i'll return but for the price it was ok,3
8190,i wasn't luxurious but that wasn't the view i had planned for a vacation,3
8191,the building is getting a little dated and tv was old but adequate for the night,3
8192,the sheets and towels had holes in them but the room was comfortable and the room was clean the clerk's service was exemplary,3
8193,the room is small and the air conditioning rattled all night,3
8194,just in time as we flew to get on the treadmill several times between,3
8195,its just not as nice as we have come to expect from super 8 motels,3
8196,the room was very dated but it was nice and clean,3
8197,but if she wasn't there it would have been nice to have more than one machine in a 4 story hotel,3
8198,our room upstairs was ok stayed for one night so it was all about location,3
8199,i traveled over 6 hrs and was told that because i didn't ask for the correct room,3
8200,room was so so it was for the most part our stay was fine,3
8201,the rooms are clean enough but i had to ask for another room,3
8202,breakfast area was clean and well attended to,3
8203,the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable and there was a crackel barrel with in walking distance,3
8204,possibly one of the worst continental breakfasts i've ever had,3
8205,good breakfast fare with plenty of choices as well as a large bathroom,3
8206,it is in a fantastic location easy walk to the stadium from this hotel,3
8207,the windows in the room and the air in the hallway,3
8208,i was checked in by a nice gentleman and my room was clean but the bottom was nasty,3
8209,they assigned us a smoking room and clearly we did not request nor seem to pay for,3
8210,the lobby and dining area for the price could have had a room away from the adjoining highway,3
8211,i would assume that since it was so close to the airport and a paid shuttle to the port,3
8212,only had about four channels and the water in the bribe was either really hot or really cold,3
8213,the outside of the hotel is somewhat dated,3
8214,it was awesome that i could get to the airport the next morning,3
8215,we had to travel to glasgow on a last minute boston getaway and found it clean so returned,3
8216,the room was so hot that i had to take time to have this information added to,3
8217,room was very close to pool so there was a constant puddle on the bathroom floor,3
8218,was traveling through about midnight and all of the other hotels were much more expensive,3
8219,as you know new orleans can get a lot of noise near the hotel,3
8220,very nice hotel friendly wine hour daily coffee in the lobby friendly staff cons the bed and pillows were horrible,3
8221,just needed an overnight after a long day of motorcycle riding gave this place a shot,3
8222,we were moved to another room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape,3
8223,nothing fancy but it was comfortable and the bathroom was actually a shower room with a toilet which was odd,3
8224,some kind of mix up there i have stayed here on business and am thankful it is in good condition,3
8225,i have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its close proximity to the beach and come back for the,3
8226,it stormed one night and the power went out in the entire hotel was poor fingerprints on walls mirrors many scratch and scuff marks,3
8227,it stinks in the hallways but it doesn't look like much but room was clean and easily accessed,3
8228,obviously right at the fremont experience if that is what you are looking forward to at that time in the morning,3
8229,it took me 2 hours to air out the room before costomers are placed in them,3
8230,when i mentioned that it is not a great selection of channels,3
8231,those are 2 of the things i tend to rate when i stay in dc i am now staying elsewhere,3
8232,i don't like to see debris behind desks and i think they could make better signs if that was really a problem,3
8233,the outside vanity area was ok but the beds are too small the water in the shower backed up,3
8234,it was very rude and for that reason we will not stay at the location again,3
8235,i've never seen a jacuzzi tub stuck in the room like i usually do i decided to go to the airport and affordable,3
8236,probably the worst room i've ever slept on,3
8237,we are still trying to figure out how to get into the hottub and nobody even took the cover off or help,3
8238,the room pillows were dirty the shower faucet was out of the money for a better hotel,3
8239,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own,3
8240,wasn't expecting much for breakfast but it was pretty much what i have come to expect laquintas to be,3
8241,the place is rundown but the rooms are in an adjacent motel-like building yet quiet,3
8242,the valet parking was a joke took us over half an hour to get the person in front of me,3
8243,overall we would have rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the rooms and check out the bathrooms,3
8244,service was good carpet in room was not working other than that a great stay,3
8245,we were given a room on the main floor and was told that they were having a problem or not but the water was cold,3
8246,we stayed in the family tower the hotel wasn't great and it was clean everything,3
8247,friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle of everything that can be a bad thing as well,3
8248,however once we got back to the hotel when it was getting dark,3
8249,but the bigger issue really the only issue worth reporting is that the walls are so thin we heard every word and were awakened,3
8250,and our room was directly across from the freeway so it was very loud you could hear your next door neighbors,3
8251,after the second night i told the staff member who was at the front desk was extremely friendly helpful and courtliest high marks,3
8252,good value for the money we spent we could have stayed at other hotels in nola and can't blame the water source,3
8253,the service was great and the wifi was diabolical,3
8254,we would stay there again but not for a family,3
8255,just a 2 minute walk the mexican food at the hotel restaurant was quite pleasant and the staff was courteous but not friendly,3
8256,rooms have all amenities but really need to be updated but for the price it's okay,3
8257,front desk staff was friendly and we got a king with a pull out bed,3
8258,i liked it but i think it would have been like in january,3
8259,while i can not complain that there was a problem in the late evening,3
8260,we have stayed at this particular hampton inn several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible,3
8261,stayed here because it was close to the plant i was working at,3
8262,location great for walking down to beach and you can't find an outlet to charge your phone unless you move furniture,3
8263,first and foremost it's a beautiful hotel in a great location and has nice facilities and very secure,3
8264,i could clearly hear the people in the room next door if it was family,3
8265,this place was really close to the area we wanted to be a walk to the beach boardwalk and much less expensive,3
8266,for the rate it was a good experience for the price,3
8267,televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
8268,i don't know if all of the rooms face outside typical red roof,3
8269,i think it should be included in the price not free is poor,3
8270,the outside of the hotel needs a long overdue update,3
8271,the only complaint that we had was the beds were super comfortable but the bathroom on the shower and the fridge was a bonus,3
8272,the carpet in the elevator was extremely dirty and our bathroom door did not shut,3
8273,breakfast fare was not good but overall it was ok for the price,3
8274,best things bed was firm and comfortable front desk staff was very friendly during check-in,3
8275,it would have been a big deal if we didn't use it,3
8276,per night this is a good hotel in a great area,3
8277,overall it was a good deal for the price,3
8278,we love the u district but the bed was comfortable but my husband felt it was too soft,3
8279,it wasn't quite the relaxing weekend i was hoping for when i had to sign to agree my pet would not do 6 of,3
8280,no really we had to go get ice,3
8281,it's not a big deal but i felt like a 5 star guest,3
8282,not deluxe but clean and quiet with a comfortable bed,3
8283,bed was comfortable bathroom was clean carpet was not very clean the bathroom is tiny and the decor is very very dated,3
8284,this was my first stay at this motel and for one night it's ok no people when you go late night people nice,3
8285,the reception staff was very polite and helpful,3
8286,i mostly booked this hotel because it was close to universal studios,3
8287,close to mall but still off the beaten path on a side street,3
8288,then we ordered room service and there was a strong odor,3
8289,the tv in the breakfast area was not very clean,3
8290,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying here again and would recommend to families,3
8291,but the price was the best part of town but,3
8292,when we asked the staff if this was normal we were told yes i know you've prepaid but we don't have a refrigerator,3
8293,temp outside was cool enough that my room wasn't bad but we did not see it posted anywhere,3
8294,staff was friendly room was clean and the bed very comfy,3
8295,my experience with the staff has always been pleasant plenty of dinning options near by and super close to michigan's adventure,3
8296,the shower had no water pressure the bathroom fan was loud otherwise everything else was good,3
8297,but for the price it was a reasonable stay and the staff was courteous and eager to please,3
8298,the first is that our room was not cleaned and we had no clean towels to shower with,3
8299,the hotel was putting up no vacancy signs when we got there the hotel power has just come back on,3
8300,i enjoyed my stay but it was not on when we arrived,3
8301,i was there for one night on a road trip,3
8302,also the bed wasn't clean it all,3
8303,i was there just a couple hours in the afternoon and again after 9 pm on food and drinks,3
8304,staff was friendly and helpful the bed was comfy and we got a voucher for the mcdonald's for breakfast,3
8305,the first floor which we walked through to get to the rooms that needed the service more than we did,3
8306,the only downfall is things close early around rockafellar center so you have to walk across the parking lot into the night,3
8307,the staff was nice and helpful the room was ok the air was cold and beds were comfortable,3
8308,on the other hand was quite pleasant and the staff was pleasant and helpful,3
8309,parking is tight and some is located on a side street so it's not a bad hotel would probably stay,3
8310,nice motel the only thing i would have liked it,3
8311,you can hear cars on the highway but not too bad if you stay on the pool side,3
8312,the room was clean and the bathroom was above average in size but we did have a problem with late check out,3
8313,i was there for 7 hours and my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
8314,this room had all the basic appliances to make your stay in florence a memorable one,3
8315,the first problem was that as soon as we walked in we could smell cigarette smoke,3
8316,the room was nice but i would not recommend going out of your way to go there,3
8317,i asked for a change from king to 2 double beds one sofa bed suite room,3
8318,we were not given the type of room you are requesting with the hotel,3
8319,we stayed one night on a road trip the hotel was clean and room size was fine,3
8320,if all you're looking for a nice place to stay near worcester,3
8321,i was informed that the hotel was beginning a remodel,3
8322,even though the hotel has a cool vibe and the price is reasonable rooms are big,3
8323,their breakfast is offered in the form of an apple pear and orange,3
8324,when we got to our room in the hotel,3
8325,you just have to remember that this used to be a really well kept hotel with consitant quality,3
8326,my problem with the hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait that long you might miss out,3
8327,i wasn't happy about how small the room was decent comfortable for the night,3
8328,the stay was average but at first site the hotel did not have a control for the air conditioner,3
8329,it was clear however that the room was clean and quiet with a comfortable bed and a bathroom that needed a scrub cleaning,3
8330,if we were passing through las vegas again and needed a place to stay for a night at a reasonable rate,3
8331,this hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and son's birthday weekend,3
8332,it was cold at night due to a broken lock,3
8333,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any headboards or pictures over the beds,3
8334,both stays key cards didnt work when going to the room the bathroom could have been cleaner there was hair on the bathroom floor,3
8335,the building was renovated but there was a lot of noise,3
8336,so if you're looking for an economical room close to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult,3
8337,room had urnine dirty towels when i go there but i called and they wanted to charge me 20 per day,3
8338,although the location of this hotel was breakfast,3
8339,this hampton does not measure up to others i have stayed in numerous other lq locations in the past so was surprised by the comfort,3
8340,the shower was ok but the interior of the bathroom was very small but clean,3
8341,for the price of the room was carpeted in tarpaper,3
8342,we have stayed at four seasons hotels before so we thought that would be a problem for handicapped or with heavy bags,3
8343,we couldn't stay in the first room we were put into a double queen,3
8344,we won't stay again unless i get a room on the 2nd floor and it stank when the humidity was high,3
8345,not 5 star but still not the standard we expected,3
8346,i enjoyed my the service at the restaurant was not very good,3
8347,the neighborhood was great and the room was extremely clean and welcoming,3
8348,the reception lobby area was warm and inviting as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
8349,so if that bothers you you may want to avoid the bathroom the water pressure is mediocre,3
8350,a regular type dining chair was in the room frig stove top were and we were not told at check in,3
8351,my tiny room would have been more compelling but,3
8352,that is the nicest thing i can say it's clean in the room but the clerk brought one up right away,3
8353,it seemed to be well-kept but it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice,3
8354,the hotel could use some renovation but adequately met our needs for a place to sleep,3
8355,the casino allows smoking and some of the rooms were like this but it was a weekend it wasn't able to be fixed,3
8356,would stop again but not for a long stay,3
8357,quick check in they are remodeling but my room was not serviced until nearly 7 pm,3
8358,this is the second time i have stayed here before and it could use a facelift,3
8359,really the hotel was clean enough but i had to ask three times for them to come to the room and leave it parked there,3
8360,next time i will ask for a room in the courtyard,3
8361,staff is pretty friendly and the rooms are a bit small but close enough to where i had business meetings,3
8362,only downside was no elevator so pack light or be prepared to go into salou every evening,3
8363,given there are other options in the area the pool and room wasn't done at check-in but otherwise it was great,3
8364,i haven't stayed there yet we booked a room with 2 double full sized beds,3
8365,would definitely stay here again if i needed a place for one night near sebastopol and downtown santa rosa,3
8366,over all it seemed a little high priced but these days what can you expect the room was nice bed was comfort bathroom was clean,3
8367,there were so many mirrors so there was no way that regular size luggage would have fit in it,3
8368,they offered additional parking across the street but it's a little bit old-looking,3
8369,the suite was beautiful and the breakfast was pretty standard but on the nice side,3
8370,the tidewater inn is a good place to stay after partying on fremont,3
8371,i defiantly got what i paid for in the first place,3
8372,the room had a fridge and microwave but could have been a much nicer stay,3
8373,if you are a light sleeper the noise from the highway all night long,3
8374,when we checked in the front desk staff provided false information,3
8375,i was staying on the second floor facing the front of the hotel you have the noise of the beach,3
8376,nothing fancy just a quiet room and an bed for a quick trip to see family it did the job,3
8377,in the morning there was a lot of water around,3
8378,the one negative thing i will say is that saturday when we checked out in the morning was horrible and rude,3
8379,the bathroom small and the pumps in the shower did not drain properly and the water looked like dirty backed up water,3
8380,given this room price was at the top of my list for accommodations,3
8381,however to carry the holiday inn express branding i would suggest they use a little more care for personal items,3
8382,location was ok clean room but the front desk made us wait for the room and didn't seem to be a factor,3
8383,doesn't have an elevator so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own bowls plates etc,3
8384,glad this was a quick one night stay this place was solid,3
8385,the room was clean but in need of a reasonable rate for,3
8386,arrived just after 3 pm check in was quick and they honored the internet price,3
8387,the la quinta ft lauderdale-sunrise is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance,3
8388,i guess i just didn't like the 4,3
8389,when we opened the door to the room lots of noise annoying,3
8390,booked online showed up and was given a double with 2 queen beds,3
8391,otherwise we were thankful to have a place to stay passing through it works,3
8392,worst things bedroom smelled strongly of cigarette smoke though it was a non-smoking or smoking symbol on it hmmmm,3
8393,disappointed that hair dryer did not work and room was old,3
8394,com reservation and tried to charge us 40 over booked price,3
8395,it stinks in the hallways but it doesn't look like much but room was clean and good sized,3
8396,the service was outstanding both at the desk and it was no problem to get one,3
8397,everybody was very friendly for the most part we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again,3
8398,overall we enjoyed our stay there and did not have any kind of meat for breakfast,3
8399,the neighborhood is a little sketchy but not too bad,3
8400,i guess this place suits people looking for a cheap place to stay,3
8401,there was a huge roach crawling around our rooom so we had to switch rooms during my stay because of loud music in room 253,3
8402,in the hallway outside our room there was only conditioner in the bathroom,3
8403,but if she wasn't there it would have been open the night we were out after a long day of driving,3
8404,the rooms were not terribly expensive but this is not a reception problem for the entire facility,3
8405,i was there for 7 hours and my room was very adequate for the price,3
8406,hotel seemed to be very limited compared to other hotels in the area unless you want to do a zip line,3
8407,this is a nice place to stay near worcester,3
8408,the hotel was fine for budget accommodations rooms are clean and contain a microwave and a refrigerator,3
8409,the rooms were clean and the room smelled like cat urine,3
8410,so breakfast sucked but the room was and smelled clean,3
8411,first and last time we will stay here,3
8412,they still have a barber on site but most of the amenities of this complex were not in service,3
8413,only stood for one night but not for a long vacation,3
8414,when i got to my room and it's now a non smoking hotel yet it just stunk,3
8415,the hotel rooms are clean it is next to a couple of small shopping centers,3
8416,pool room was so cold that we didn't get a room cleaning every day,3
8417,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and have it charged to my,3
8418,the cons for me were the age of the section we were in,3
8419,there was no hair dryer and when we went to go sightseeing the door would not latch closed,3
8420,the personnel were very nice but seemed understaffed,3
8421,com and stated it was done until they knew no one smoked in the room and do not disurb signs for the door,3
8422,the room was ok there was a lot of out of control kids ripping and running in the halls all night and early morning,3
8423,the bathroom small and the pumps in the shower did not drain properly and the water looked like dirty backed up water,3
8424,we stayed here on our way to gatlinburg or florida,3
8425,when i got to my room and it was an adjoining room where i could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall,3
8426,notified desk was given a double with 2 queen beds instead of 1 king and they obliged,3
8427,and the coffee was barely warm and when i got my room key and went to my room,3
8428,i was surprised to find that there was an omlet station but it was in a decent location though,3
8429,hotel was quiet but our room was fine and little stale when we first checked in,3
8430,i was looking forward to swimming but the pool in the basement which is pretty dark,3
8431,we recently spent the weekend at the mccamly plaza hotel,3
8432,on our way to vegas from la and found that the hotel was beginning a remodel,3
8433,after we complained we were moved to another room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape,3
8434,not really any place to eat close to the property so you need to go to the truck stop c-store to register,3
8435,my wifi didn't work so i couldn't get any wifi signal in room 101,3
8436,just one night stay but i don't recommend anyone sleep on it,3
8437,the lobby is nice the rooms are what you can expect from the area,3
8438,the room was comfortable and clean but room was very small without any place to tidy clothes,3
8439,fortunately there are cafes nearby if you don't have a room with 2 queen beds,3
8440,the stay was ok but our room had a beautiful view and very comfortable amenities,3
8441,the main bed was fine but the amount of noise in the room was only decaf,3
8442,but very thin walls so you need to go to the 3rd floor it,3
8443,i enjoyed the price rates i had more money it would not be my choice,3
8444,it as worth the money i paid for a taxi ride i didn't need but other than that all was good,3
8445,i asked the front desk for them,3
8446,the biggest problem with the room was an odd musky smell,3
8447,the hotel is what you expect from hotel cleaning staff,3
8448,hotel is older and in need of repair and updating but it did have a musty smell but everything was clean and comfortable,3
8449,we had requested a fold out bed i asked them for a replacement which never happened,3
8450,i told her i had a reservation for a king room,3
8451,getting a bit run down and buffet breakfast not as good as it could of been for what we paid for,3
8452,i was disappointed because we were not told at check in,3
8453,then there was the shuttle to the airport running every hour,3
8454,very unusual that the hotel did not have an exhaust fan,3
8455,we wanted to stay 3 nights but had to switch rooms during my stay because of loud music in room 253,3
8456,the room was large and clean and a good value for the money in this area,3
8457,no fridge no microwave swimming pool is located on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
8458,the hotel was nice but next to the train tracks and it is loud and shakes the building,3
8459,our friends in another room had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room,3
8460,the elevator is extremely small-my husband and i had the king bed room with hot tub,3
8461,they were drinking alcohol in the hot tub was again dirty and cold,3
8462,it crosses the street about 200 yards from the hotel and you could always order in,3
8463,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
8464,other than the smell of the room and the air in the halls was stale and musty,3
8465,yes there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building,3
8466,check in was straightforward and we had a 1st floor room near the pool was very pretty and the food good,3
8467,at 6 in the morning i woke up to each morning,3
8468,well on a whole the room was clean the bed was comfy,3
8469,have to call for it after got out of the deal was free breakfast,3
8470,nothing to fancy the staff was friendly and they served popcorn,3
8471,even though the room was okay but we had a good experience but not this time,3
8472,ok hotel for one night as we were passing through on a long road trip,3
8473,upon arrival we told the person working at the desk that was not the room we were in,3
8474,this is the second time we've stayed here before and it could use a facelift,3
8475,our room was on the main floor and was told that they were having a lot,3
8476,however i was disappointed with the appearance of the room and the affordability of our hotel due to it being near many attractions,3
8477,one of the things i tend to rate when i stay in santa cruz because i want to walk everywhere,3
8478,there were about 5 bugs in the room and told her the beds had not been made either,3
8479,took more than 20 minutes and i had to sit up for an hour in the middle of the night by yelling and screaming,3
8480,rate not cheap but less than many others in the area due to a prior positive experience,3
8481,televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others,3
8482,great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling,3
8483,they assigned us a smoking room and received a non smoking room i put in a quarter of smokers,3
8484,i'd only recommend this hotel if you have a car or are taking the metro,3
8485,the hotel was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
8486,the bedroom was clean and the staff was quick to clean any mess the front desk was great,3
8487,every simple request required multiple phone calls and they placed us in a room next door 335 and everything seemed to work,3
8488,the bed had mold on it there was also mold on the floor and a sock in the bathroom cleaning staff should take another gander,3
8489,we stay there because of the pool situation,3
8490,so friendly here they go out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face,3
8491,breakfast was fine and they had a free shuttle to sfo is the best perk,3
8492,we told her that the phone in my room was coming down is the thing,3
8493,the hotel rooms were a little out dated,3
8494,i thought i was staying in spartanburg for more than a couple of days,3
8495,overall i'd say it's a solid 3 star,3
8496,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
8497,only about 15 channels on the tv were cloudy or fuzzy and the breakfast was really good room was comfortable,3
8498,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work and i was told it did upon arrival,3
8499,we were not aware of this when we checked in we were told that the room above us had the same complaint,3
8500,we were unable to get the shuttle van to pick us up or take us back to the airport,3
8501,and when i came back it was open but the hot tub was way too hot,3
8502,on the bright side the room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door early in the morning,3
8503,overall ok but i wouldn't stay there again but not for extended stay,3
8504,opt out and buy your own breakfast out of the hotel parking lot mad edifficult at times,3
8505,curtains in room do not expect to spend much time in room but it was just okay,3
8506,this hotel is good if you need a kitchenette living space facility,3
8507,check-in took a long time for the water in the shower,3
8508,other than that complaint this was a clean room with friendly staff,3
8509,liked that it was in walking distance to places to eat and shops,3
8510,although the people who worked there were nice we will not be using this company any more,3
8511,i'd never even consider staying here again for the price and location,3
8512,overall a good stay but the pool is very small,3
8513,we opened up the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best pools i saw in a hyatt place,3
8514,unfortunately the front desk staff was very friendly at check-in,3
8515,the only soda and ice machines available were on the first floor and could hear noises from above and from the,3
8516,off season so many of the other hotels were much more expensive,3
8517,i had no cause for actual complaint but my room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort,3
8518,i didn't like the fact that the hotel doesn't have ac,3
8519,we did complain and were told that this service was not offered,3
8520,we have to hang outside in the hall way really loud kids running up down hall way,3
8521,i was in bangor for a concert at the verizon ampitheater now irvine meadows,3
8522,my west facing room did not have a chance to use the pool and i hardly saw the restaurant open though we were gone,3
8523,will stay there again any time i'm in alamosa the rooms are clean etc but the bathroom needs an upgrade and the,3
8524,assuming it had to do with all the check-ins that night we were in the wrong location for those services,3
8525,the bed was comfortable although there was a tear in the carpet and the bedspread also had holes,3
8526,air conditioning in room 114was so loud that i couldn't even bite through it,3
8527,it was what i expected for the price but would not stay there again,3
8528,i replied with the fact that the room was basically very comfortable,3
8529,we come here every year because it's a great value and it's very clean and the ac worked well,3
8530,have stayed here several times because of the size of the room was comfortable and clean,3
8531,newer outdoor pool was first rate indoor gameroom was great for the price i was pleased with the stay,3
8532,the entire place feels low energy but our room was clean though not very quiet,3
8533,considering i am 100 sure it was found when the room was ready,3
8534,the bathroom was clean but the bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well,3
8535,all in all it was an ok hotel but we were expecting what we had experienced before,3
8536,this best western is in an older part of town but there were plenty of pools areas to enjoy,3
8537,location was ok clean room but the front desk people were very nice,3
8538,hotel is convenient for us and close to the colleges,3
8539,it's old and nothing fancy but very reasonably priced,3
8540,the beds were very comfortable but the rooms were nice and clean and everything worked as it should,3
8541,but on the first morning we were informed that they had overbooked it,3
8542,following our reservation we were asked about our stay when i checked out,3
8543,it was nice the staff was very polite and i'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked,3
8544,it stinks in the hallways but none of these were too bad though the receptionist was very nice and accommodating staff,3
8545,kids activities in the evening but unless you eat at the hotel restaurant bar was delicious although a little pricey which should be expected,3
8546,the tub drainer was broken mattresses were worn out the free breakfast was so-so but what i expected for the price,3
8547,we got to our room in the hotel,3
8548,a bit pricey for an older hotel the room was quite small,3
8549,i would only stay here if i were on a relaxing trip to the south,3
8550,this hotel is located right across the street that becomes very loud in the evening,3
8551,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
8552,this hotel was obviously older and worn but the room was not clean the gold fish we had requested came hours,3
8553,had a relative in nearby hospital and just needed a bed to sleep in for one night during our cross-country move,3
8554,the room was clean and we did not feel comfortable walking back to the hotel,3
8555,there was a refrigerator in the room and no elevator to get my heavy bags up,3
8556,room smelled like smoke even worse when the ac was left off for too long,3
8557,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
8558,i told her i had a reservation for a king room,3
8559,the late check in is a little sketchy but not too bad,3
8560,was greeted by a nice lady at the front desk very pleasant and helpful the other the complete opposite,3
8561,there was no phone in the room didn't seem to know where anything in town was,3
8562,also there was no mention of this in the reservation confirmation,3
8563,i had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk and we were told we were going to be out,3
8564,the location of this hotel is its location,3
8565,the ice machine was not working on the 2nd floor and it stank when the humidity was high,3
8566,it was clear however that the room was clean the a c worked nicely,3
8567,the suite was beautiful and the lobby was clean and comfortable,3
8568,your work crew banged on our door at 1030 am even w do not disturb sign was clearly present,3
8569,glad it was pet friendly and didn't charge for a pet to stay,3
8570,my stay was good and the service was really slow,3
8571,shower ok and that's what we got,3
8572,there is alot of fresh food for breakfast and it was swamped with people,3
8573,yeah its the cheapest in the area it was in was a little off to the right,3
8574,maybe ask for a room with 2 single beds instead,3
8575,however the bathroom wasn't the cleanest room,3
8576,again though for the price of 130 for the night this hotel will work,3
8577,they lady that checked me in was very nice and friendly,3
8578,the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable and there was a sports bar which must be why the cost was so much,3
8579,staff was friendly and overall we had a great time nice hotel friendly staff and clean room,3
8580,the head of the bed wasn't clean it all,3
8581,we recently stayed here for a night on business basic but was ok,3
8582,however there was no crib in the room but your not promised what you asked for,3
8583,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but we were hoping for a better night,3
8584,there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed had a burnhole in it,3
8585,the cord just came out of the hand when i went to check out no one was in the office,3
8586,i had food in the refrigerator that would spoil if it wasn't so far away from my room,3
8587,some of the rooms have a refrigerator and microwave in the room,3
8588,no exhaust fan in the bathroom was not as clean as i would have liked in our room was coming apart,3
8589,i booked my room and it's now a non smoking hotel cigar smoke was very evident one evening on the 2nd floor etc,3
8590,we actually had to sleep with my brother,3
8591,tv in room is small and only has three machines but i've never had a night with less sleep,3
8592,the walls were paper-thin we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door walls,3
8593,the rooms were like this but it was a lovely place for the night to pick up a college student for the holidays,3
8594,cracker barrel restaurant right across the street from a stop for,3
8595,my daughter and i recently stayed 2 nights the front desk was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the areas attractions,3
8596,our view was the roof with the sound of the card being slide to unlock the door the first time we accessed the room,3
8597,the rooms were clean but in need of a reasonable rate for,3
8598,rooms were clean and the staff nice and helpful however i think there was a problem with getting a receipt for her complete stay,3
8599,the personnel were very friendly and rooms were a good deal for what i paid,3
8600,nice spacious room the wi-fi was barely working,3
8601,the food was ok and wasn't worth the amount you pay to stay in it,3
8602,we had to take time to go to the lobby and check out,3
8603,still not to far from the beach poor wifi that i was charged for spa services that i didn't use it,3
8604,it's a great location and a very helpful friendly staff,3
8605,i didn't like is that the walls are thin and you can hear people in the hallways at night very clearly,3
8606,the inn is not a budget motel by comparison to others in the area due to a prior positive experience,3
8607,when we arrived there were several people outside in the parking lot for an hour waiting just for that,3
8608,this place was easy to find and our room was on the ground floor someone could have broken in had we not locked them,3
8609,lastly breakfast was a bit more than ordinary,3
8610,the bath towels were very rough and the bed had a big slope in the middle on one side,3
8611,the pool was dirty and not cared for,3
8612,the top of the refrigerator was disgusting with food stains and looked like it had been cleaned it was just old and stained,3
8613,overall my stay was fine but there was an old wash cloth left on the shower rod,3
8614,there is no restaurant bar but you can walk to a lot of good restaurants and things,3
8615,we were two people in a room with 2 double full sized beds,3
8616,it wasn't that bad but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
8617,but overall it was ok for a one night stay but affordable,3
8618,morning desk staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was nothing to brag about,3
8619,what staff we saw was friendly and helpful during check in,3
8620,the pool was nice and clean as well,3
8621,furnishings older and carpet is worn but was okay for a one night stay on our way to florida,3
8622,it appreared there had not been a flag there for some time then got a very unfriendly person,3
8623,bfast good they have a waffle maker the room was big and clean but the area was sketchy as funk,3
8624,the pool is very large but almost too warm and the hot tub was decent and the people were helpful,3
8625,could not get past security issues with wifi and i got a non smoking room but could definitely smell cigarette smoke,3
8626,you right around the corner from the t and galleria mall,3
8627,i had to switch rooms after the first night to a totally different quality of room,3
8628,the breakfast was adequate and the lobby was clean and comfortable,3
8629,room needed updating but for the price it was good,3
8630,fridge was actually cleaner than the one at the 150 hotel we stayed at the grand hotel cadenabbia for our second visit,3
8631,then we find out they don't have money to fix or clean,3
8632,first they don't have a problem with toilet,3
8633,it could be better but it's an ok place to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant,3
8634,our rm was on the second level no elevator,3
8635,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to pay 5 a day which isn't bad,3
8636,this hotel is good if you need a bed close to the airport,3
8637,no ac too hot in the room when i walked in i noticed an unpleasant odor,3
8638,it looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and the pictures are not reliable,3
8639,the line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of the few hotels walking distance from a friend's wedding,3
8640,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of roanoke and right at the market center,3
8641,rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are bothered by traffic noise request a room in the 70's,3
8642,did not spend a lot of time in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing,3
8643,big fan i have stayed at this hotel for a wheelchair accessible one bedroom,3
8644,i was only staying for 2 nights and attempted to cancel the 3rd night,3
8645,we continue to stay at this place to save a few bucks and give this place a shot,3
8646,it was quiet and most of the staff at this location are 5 star,3
8647,if you are looking for an affordable hotel for 1 or 2 nights when you are on the road,3
8648,i told the lady at the desk was pleasant and wide awake,3
8649,it is a big house that needs work but we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again,3
8650,the pool area was nice but they didn't have our reservation from when i booked 9 line at hotels,3
8651,the elevator floor was dirty our room was okay but the person taking care of the issues,3
8652,they are in the middle of the night,3
8653,breakfast left something to be desired big time,3
8654,last stop on a month long road trip so needed a decent place to sleep very close to the boardwalk,3
8655,this place charges about 75 for a room and a bed i can sleep in,3
8656,i shopped for a cheap room and that is what is nice about it,3
8657,this was only a place to stay for one night,3
8658,on the bright side the room was very reasonable and the location is very good,3
8659,we went to play pickleball as the hotel is literally right beside tito's a very popular nightclub,3
8660,the desk is frequently unmanned so prepare to wait for the charge to drop she could not fix immediately,3
8661,i am allergic to dogs but did not have any knobs for the ac,3
8662,just needed an overnight after a long day of motorcycle riding gave this place a shot,3
8663,the breakfast they offer was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than i expected given the condition of the facility,3
8664,we stayed at this hotel at least 7 times over the past few years on business,3
8665,the exterior was uninviting but we were tired and it was a comfortable and pleasant stay,3
8666,the hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of selections and they always had enough food,3
8667,the adult pool was a lot better than in person,3
8668,good comparison is that for less money per night i had a two day stay while visiting family and friends in my home town,3
8669,the best thing about the hotel was fine although it was not as good as some of these other reviews would suggest,3
8670,the location is good the hotel was clean but breakfast was a disappointment,3
8671,we had to wait for the long line,3
8672,customer service in the morning was perfect simple,3
8673,the downside is that you are also close to the convention center and the fridge was a bonus,3
8674,i booked a single room for one night after leaving the cruise ship,3
8675,also there was a party of people in the room next is complaining,3
8676,will stay there again if the price was right,3
8677,but i called the front desk they did put us on the 4th floor,3
8678,we did not complain to the front desk to ask for a plunger we were surprised that nobody offered assistance,3
8679,the table in the room was not what i had expected,3
8680,was great to stay here but i did not need to be treated this way,3
8681,None,3
8682,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and its horn can wake the dead for a 63 mile radius,3
8683,also my nephew told me the new waterpark had chilly water so i didn't have to wait for the bus,3
8684,during our visit to boston we stayed here for a total of 3 nights in the last week for business,3
8685,we stayed on a lower floor and there was a small refrigerator there was no coffee pot in the room,3
8686,room was ok not great had a hard time draining but all other appliances worked well,3
8687,overall the property is nice and well maintained just a bit too far to walk to notre dame a good half an hour,3
8688,building looks dated we had room right by the pool area and it was rusted making retrieving water from there undesirable,3
8689,although i did find it a little expensive for what you get book online for better prices,3
8690,the exit door near our room had a horrible chemical smell,3
8691,on our last day the power went out in the middle of things but a warning that it could be very loud,3
8692,gerado was our server and he worked very hard to make it the best they could,3
8693,other than that the continental breakfast was nothing to talk about,3
8694,families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool which i did not expect anything good from it,3
8695,overall a pleasant stay but i think the hotel could use some maintenance upkeep,3
8696,the personnel were very nice but the air conditioner which we needed was awful at night,3
8697,big fan i have stayed at this hotel for a state softball tournament,3
8698,the hotel is rated 3 stars but i felt like i was sleeping on rocks,3
8699,pool area needs some work and hot tub didn't work so it was far from comfortable,3
8700,this is a perfectly good place to stay when visiting someone from west point,3
8701,bed was hard as a rock the room was small and nothing special,3
8702,people were smoking in the dining room and we wanted to stay on the beach,3
8703,don't forget you can be one of the first we saw and it a little late in the evening around midnight,3
8704,i missed having a coffee maker in the room and do not disurb signs for the door,3
8705,i read the reviews on trip advisor and after speaking with the front desk attendant acted like a zombie no emotion not friendly or rude,3
8706,the only good thing i could say is the bed was comfortable the pillows were great and it was clean everything,3
8707,it's an older property but is nice,3
8708,staff was very courteous and helpful when it came to bed time the noise from the highway in my room,3
8709,the hotel staff was friendly and check-in and check-out could not have been easier,3
8710,possibly one of the worst continental breakfasts i've ever had,3
8711,although one of the reasons we booked this hotel for a couple of days for the purpose of the trip,3
8712,1 the rate is great for the facility and the staff is very friendly,3
8713,took this in the fall and the hotel is almost eerily empty during my stay,3
8714,we saw this hotel on trip advisor so here it is,3
8715,i knew the hotel was not the greatest but the customer service was good despite the obstacles that made for an uncomfortable stay,3
8716,a little surprised to find it a pet friendly hotel because we travel with our cat,3
8717,however the bathroom wasn't very clean but the room was very small without any place to tidy clothes,3
8718,the breakfast was good and the room was comfortable and clean,3
8719,it was more like we were an inconvenience not painv customers,3
8720,told it was no pet floor but there was a rack with hanger and a some shelves behind a curtain,3
8721,there were no extra blankets available in the room and told her the beds had not been made either,3
8722,we needed a place to sleep like us,3
8723,so if that bothers you you may want to avoid the bathroom the water pressure is good in the shower,3
8724,but room was adequate although there was a tear in the carpet and the bathroom were horrible and in need of some improvements,3
8725,if you are needing to be in the hotel very long so i didn't complain about it,3
8726,not the greatest hotel in the world but for the money it was a nice night for just the two of us,3
8727,as a result i requested to make a cash withdrawal from the hotel and its rooms are not brand new they are well maintained,3
8728,overall it is a good location for the college,3
8729,i prefer dones comfort in and pay a little more and have much better facilities friendlier staff etc,3
8730,only downfall the room which was a pleasant surprise it was clean friendly and comfortable,3
8731,the motel is close to the airport and affordable,3
8732,unfortunately king bed was hard and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
8733,out dated hotel for the price and breakfast was a plus and the staff was attentive,3
8734,was pleasantly surprised when i opened the door very clean and comfortable and the staff is very friendly and the price is reasonable,3
8735,right at the end of the bed and the mattress was hard,3
8736,but the sheraton offenbach hotel is an older hotel with fresh looking carpeting but the hotel is clean and quiet,3
8737,location is great of course the room was clean but warm upon arrival,3
8738,lots of apartment construction surrounding the hotel but the hotel is in need of renovation an ancient tv,3
8739,i stayed at this hotel for decadence based on a recommendation and i'm glad that's all we stayed,3
8740,the mattress was not great but we were tired and did not even help us at all,3
8741,however once the elevator doors opened up on the third floor which i could tell had not,3
8742,lovely town plenty of restaurants within walking distance which have decent food,3
8743,the hotel was clean and a good value for the price,3
8744,cobwebs could be seen in the car outside,3
8745,we were in the 8th floor and had a great view of the sea but not for the traveller that wants the peace and quietness,3
8746,location was superb very easy to walk to all bars in the area,3
8747,television was kind of small but we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,3
8748,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a few things and it felt like air-conditioning,3
8749,the place is ok a little old but good for a room and barely makes that worth it,3
8750,the hotel is located on the beach with good ocean view,3
8751,there are no restaurants to eat at unless you want to eat every meal at mcd,3
8752,when we finally checked in the room was dirty and had tear,3
8753,delightful service at desk but a funny cooking smell as i went to my room it was marked non-smoking,3
8754,i would not recommend for solo females just because of the service im giving it a 3,3
8755,the breakfast room is too small and was packed and we had to go outside of the hotel to sit which was nice,3
8756,overall i've stayed in worse happy i was only there for a place to sleep and change,3
8757,thanks to the western exposure the room didn't work and tiles were loose in the bathroom,3
8758,they turned off the water for a few hours of sleep and move on,3
8759,hotel lobby pool and staff were excellent but the only thing i noticed was some ants and dirt in the bathtub,3
8760,they served sold starbucks coffee in the eating area which i thought was late i was tired and wanted to get some sleep,3
8761,the moral never stay on the ground floor nice spacious and clean the rate for this room was based on the location and safety,3
8762,the living area of the room was carpeted in tarpaper,3
8763,but the problem i had was i specifically asked for a room with windows on the other side of building,3
8764,the wy state capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and have it charged to my,3
8765,the carpet was not as clean as i wished it to be,3
8766,maybe choice 4 in the columbia area if you need a quick one night stay this place is just fine,3
8767,in the area to find a decent rate at this hotel,3
8768,we needed a clean economical place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids,3
8769,all in all it was clean but little things like the morning coffee being cold were not what you would expect,3
8770,for example almost had to convince the front desk to ask for more at the front desk was very unfriendly and not at all helpful,3
8771,if you need a bed close to the airport which was a plus,3
8772,there was no dresser or refrigerator in the room and we had a 1st floor room near the pool,3
8773,the hotel is a good place to stay after partying on fremont,3
8774,we've been to plenty of casino buffets and this was the only sheraton and my only disappointment,3
8775,we were on the second floor hallway could not keep up with those country inns suites we had stayed in,3
8776,but if she wasn't there it would have been a better stay if our room had been clean,3
8777,we were just simply there to sleep the bed was comfy and the room was a little noisy,3
8778,every employee we encountered at this hotel seemed as though they were designed in the 40's,3
8779,the air conditioner in our room did not face the picnic party area,3
8780,the kiosk to check in for the day when we were there in june it seemed as if the walls were paper thin,3
8781,ok hotel old for price not what expected but in all it was a great place to be,3
8782,we and booked this hotel because i just wanted a place to sleep for a norseman who are used to colder bedrooms,3
8783,the room was clean and pristine aside from the musty smell and room service was always happy to deliver more pillows with a smile,3
8784,all we wanted to do and see and it was mostly quiet and comfortable,3
8785,breakfast was minimal but for the price which is one of the better motels in lagrange,3
8786,broken mirror destroyed room phone but other than that it was as good as it could have been,3
8787,the staff was friendly and helpful there was a little mold around the tub,3
8788,if that was on the description i would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu,3
8789,just a one nighter for a softball tournament not a bad spot for just an overnight stay halfway to my destination,3
8790,it was in a great location near the train station and also on a night time to go into the pool,3
8791,the girl at the counter was really nice and the water felt amazing,3
8792,there was no way to notify me of this because the third-party reservation site there was nothing he could do about the error,3
8793,however we had a room in the back,3
8794,i agree with the reviewer who complained about the noisy a c and the good is gone,3
8795,i was suprised that many of the hotel and for that reason we will not stay at the location again,3
8796,i booked bayside because we stayed here before we booked it,3
8797,room appeared clean but there was no signal in our room,3
8798,not the nicest motel in the world but it was clean and the beds were the best i have ever slept on in a hotel,3
8799,we hadn't stayed at a comfort inn,3
8800,it's an average stay for sleep but don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine,3
8801,50 for one night is way too expensive for being the save a lot of money for the stay,3
8802,we needed a place to stay while we slept,3
8803,the hotel staff were helpful the hostess in the restaurant on the fist night and service was haphazard to say the least,3
8804,i have to go back to our room at nearly 10 00p,3
8805,room was ok for an overnight stay before a flight,3
8806,the sound-proof needs to be improved upon but other than that all was good,3
8807,they did provide shampoo a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren,3
8808,however the rooms are very dated but clean,3
8809,i say single night because for me personally the bed was a little hard for my preference but doable for the night,3
8810,the room wasnt much better we found ourselves in dire need of repairs,3
8811,the staff was good and the room was really clean and smelled great,3
8812,the staff is always helpful the rooms are comfortable however the wifi is weak is some areas,3
8813,other than this small the room was decent comfortable for the night,3
8814,loved the fact that the room was clean the bed was very soft,3
8815,only problem we had was that we didn't go back a 2nd time,3
8816,the one drawback was there was not a good situation for me,3
8817,we stayed in griffin for a memorial service and needed an inexpensive place to stay while in osage beach well i highly recommend this property,3
8818,there was not enough room in the room for our family party and had to go downstairs,3
8819,overall i've stayed in a lot of cold air,3
8820,i neglected to note there was no elevator and the wifi doesn't work the top two floors are under construction,3
8821,the things that made this more like a 2 1 2 star facility,3
8822,room was very close to pool so there was a lot of dirt along the edges of the bathtub,3
8823,the breakfast was lackluster room was just ok and worked out for a one night stay it was okay,3
8824,the cabin was nice but the service was arrogant at best,3
8825,the only drawbacks were that the hotel is basic yet comfortable for a night or two but i would not stay here again,3
8826,i shouldn't have to unplug the things in the room and we had a 6 am international flight,3
8827,and with the king street trolley you can easily get to the metro train station to go anywhere else,3
8828,how do you check in we had to wait a good 30 minutes to check out,3
8829,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
8830,we booked for a family with two small children 5 and 7 we did find that the pool was a nightmare,3
8831,this was the first time i stayed at the hotel for a business trip at this hotel,3
8832,my room smelled of cigarette smoke but the room did not have a good night sleep,3
8833,we had hardly any water pressure in the room and are using extension cords to accommodate all the lights,3
8834,was a good budget hotel however the rooms need to be cleaned especially down the hall there was visible staining all over,3
8835,probably the best thing about the hotel is the han original turkish restaurant alemdar cad,3
8836,for the price i would recommend this hotel if you are to stay in irvine area,3
8837,the outside is very dated and in serious need of an upgrade,3
8838,hotel deca was located in a nice setting right next door to the room next to the back door near the pool parking area,3
8839,we wanted to stay in the south tower,3
8840,housekeeping did not report problems we had with the place even though it had a full sized fridge,3
8841,but the sheraton offenbach hotel is an older hotel only one in area,3
8842,many rooms face the highway so if you are smell-sensitive that might be an issue,3
8843,the ice machine on the third floor facing the south,3
8844,front desk staff was very friendly and handed me our,3
8845,the neighborhood didn't seem safe and there was a strong odor of cat urine,3
8846,the room itself was nice but one of the reasons we booked this hotel because it was near the outdoor bar,3
8847,the room was clean and okay for us for a couple of hours on my way from nc to ky,3
8848,we knew we would be getting ourselves into,3
8849,the rooms were clean and staff was friendly,3
8850,the room is small and only has three machines but i've never had a night with less sleep,3
8851,staff were friendly the outside of the hotel is lovely and the staff is accommodating,3
8852,the hotel was older but nice staff was very friendly and my family love the free breakfast,3
8853,the staff is always helpful the rooms are comfortable however the wifi is weak is some areas,3
8854,need to update this whole place as we will not be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us,3
8855,pool bar open only for a few hours in the morning,3
8856,the hotel was nice our room was spacious and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay,3
8857,also the exterior room i was in 112 was impeccable,3
8858,small motel that could use some updates sloppy job grouting,3
8859,the location was minutes from the airport it's very clean and the staff wasn't the friendliest but i'd rather have good food,3
8860,our room was very clean and the staff was friendly,3
8861,the rooms were clean but the bathroom floor was severally cracked,3
8862,great place to stay but i will say it was a bad hotel but not really good either,3
8863,otherwise its a very nice place as the lobby area is very inviting and the,3
8864,i had to persuade the front desk to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby,3
8865,bad traffic noise real bad breakfast it is close to mall and several good restaurants,3
8866,there are family restaurants within walking distance matter of fact there is nothing within walking distance of this place,3
8867,the room was not very clean the bathroom is tiny and the decor is very very dated,3
8868,the location was good for what i needed,3
8869,my feet were blistered by the end of the day it's a pretty short drive to laguna beach and some shopping centers,3
8870,the standard room is an okay size though the bathroom is small but was not an issue,3
8871,but the front desk guy was very friendly,3
8872,i wold stay again because for the price and location just don't stay in room 107,3
8873,it's a hostel so we were not expecting much and we were not bitten during the night,3
8874,i was told there ie only one machine and it's on the 3rd floor had the same problem with all but one,3
8875,pueblo bonito sunset is a beautiful hotel on the surface but lacking in quality of product,3
8876,overall the hotel was fine and the mattress was hard,3
8877,i don't believe that it was worth 148 for the one night we had a dinner for,3
8878,the hotel is very dated and rather unappealing,3
8879,lots of kids and families running up and down the steps cars outside etc,3
8880,the from desk guy was creepy but if you just a place to sleep after a long drive,3
8881,most of the staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful even just passing in the hallway,3
8882,we used the indoor pool for a short time breakfast was very good no 24 hour reception available,3
8883,the hotel did comp the room which was a non smoking room,3
8884,i was commuting to dusseldorf each day so it was sweltering at night when we got back 2 hours later,3
8885,they had coffee out but i didn't see the sign until the,3
8886,nice heated pool area which we didn't get the room we booked on hotels,3
8887,no shampoo leaking toilet no running water in our shower tub,3
8888,it is in a great location for our needs is very good,3
8889,therefore we knew when we booked it what we would be getting in late so just needed a cheap place to stay this is it,3
8890,our room was basic with a sea view but when it came to finding a restaurant to eat at,3
8891,i reported it to the front desks attention and was told i got a free upgrade to a suite,3
8892,the elevator was not working on the 2nd floor etc,3
8893,the staff was nice and the breakfast was mediocre that is probably a generous description,3
8894,received two extra charges from this hotel because i had an idea of what i was getting into,3
8895,the only thing wrong with the room was an odd musky smell,3
8896,the front desk staff was nice and very helpful,3
8897,chairs were too sinkable for me but overall it was clean and bed was comfortable,3
8898,we ended up in a room with 2 single beds instead,3
8899,the hotel is an older hotel that you can tell they are working to fix up the place,3
8900,although the hotel is in a good spot,3
8901,the rooms are clean and beds are comfertable cheap rooms,3
8902,the 3rd floor room has a lot of traffic noise due to 101 but not too bad,3
8903,we were looking for an overnight place to stay while daughter was in ssu orientation,3
8904,it was cold at night due to a broken lock,3
8905,we couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel is always a disappointment,3
8906,for those who don't use the pool area,3
8907,the decor is in dire need of updating as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
8908,it was a decent stay for a good price this is an acceptable place to stay,3
8909,the king size bed was comfortable making for a good night's sleep is the most important thing,3
8910,all in all the room was much cheaper than other hotels in the area and were pleased with the proximity to university of washington,3
8911,as soon as i told them about it and nothing was done until end of day,3
8912,the room was spacious and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again because of the poor service,3
8913,cable tv channel selection seemed to be very limited compared to other hotels in the immediate 60 mile radius area,3
8914,in the morning i heard what sounded like a manager going over schedules,3
8915,our room was in the back of a half run down industrial type building,3
8916,the only other issue that i had with the hotel was room size particularly bathroom size,3
8917,we were assigned the room next to it i could hear everything going on all around us,3
8918,the staff was welcoming the night was clean and safe and we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again though,3
8919,my fianc and i stayed here for a night on our way north,3
8920,guests are allowed to smoke outside of the hotel to sit which was nice,3
8921,the beds were okay but the bathroom was not the cleanest not totally filthy but could have definately used a good scrub,3
8922,i was glad i did it alone and did not have any options for a room,3
8923,so if you're looking for a clean room to spend the night the rooms don't have any more rooms,3
8924,the hotel is an older hotel that could use some refreshing,3
8925,the continental breakfast was nothing special but it was a last minute decision to go,3
8926,the carpet in the elevator was extremely dirty and our bathroom door did not shut,3
8927,the rooms are very nice and the location was easy to find and get to this location,3
8928,very noticeable and should not have been open in that condition,3
8929,stay was ok check in and charged a bit of a hassle though they were quick about getting our vehicle to us,3
8930,the biggest problem with the room was an odd musky smell,3
8931,the bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the room had an upstairs bedroom that was difficult to access,3
8932,so breakfast sucked but the room was nice bed was comfort bathroom was clean,3
8933,there were no tea or coffee making kit in the rooms so it was quite hot and stuffy in the hall,3
8934,very crowded the food is not as good and the staff cleaning and front desk were professional,3
8935,i wold stay again because for the price and close to the exit,3
8936,i am only 5'3 and i had to call to remind them,3
8937,overall a pleasant stay but i think the hotel gives the worst rooms to the third party sellers,3
8938,we've stayed at the turf hotel 4 times twice in a room with a queen or king size bed as opposed to two doubles,3
8939,this hard to find bb is hard to find as you have to go through the effort to sell me another night stay,3
8940,but if you are staying at the hotel should have to park,3
8941,decent place to stay for the price and close to the expressway,3
8942,i can only comment on what i was hearing it sounded like they were in my room,3
8943,it is very clear that they are investing a lot of time waiting and riding or walking long distances,3
8944,the room was a good size but a little dated,3
8945,i enjoyed the price rates i had more money it would not be a fun experience,3
8946,check in and staff at front desk were friendly and efficient,3
8947,rooms are dated and need to be replaced in the hotel and the location is good,3
8948,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a few things and it felt like air-conditioning,3
8949,however more generally the hotel is not in a scary area like some have mentioned,3
8950,i suppose that's fine as long as you could pry the door open you were in business,3
8951,the breakfast was very basic but it was clean and the staff is friendly but this double tree seems more like a hampton,3
8952,the hallways and elevator could have been cleaner specifically the shower,3
8953,it would be a good choice for us because it was close to universal studios,3
8954,room was actually very clean except for the hairs left in the sink and in the bathtub,3
8955,good hotel for a quick stop over the hotel was fine but worn,3
8956,the lighting in the room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in,3
8957,the room we stayed in was very close to a hospital so you could hear everything that was going on,3
8958,there was a refrigerator and microwave and a quiet air conditioner,3
8959,the room was clean but seemed damp mildewed like no one had vacuumed i would never recommend anyone to stay here,3
8960,the pool area was basic i didn't like that it was across the street from armstrong park,3
8961,it was ok and the rooms were comfy,3
8962,it was typical for other comfort suites i've stayed at the campus inn several times on duck football weekends,3
8963,it's not too close to the interstate and everything in the room was surprisingly nice,3
8964,then we ordered room service and there was a little hiccup with my reservation however the young lady in the morning did assist me,3
8965,the room was ok but there was no good night here,3
8966,her replacement was ok not really worth the 100 we paid for one night,3
8967,the breakfast is not high quality but there are plenty of other things to do at the site,3
8968,the waffles and french toast were hard as a rock but the pillows were comfy,3
8969,the room was noisy and the access to the main highway was good,3
8970,we are glad you enjoyed your stay and hope you come stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the waterville area,3
8971,instead we were given rooms on the second floor right above a smoking room and it did not include breakfast so that was one,3
8972,need to update this whole place as we will not be using this company any more,3
8973,rooms are very small especially for a family of five the two bedroom suite,3
8974,i was very surprised that there was not a place to stay for the night while away for work,3
8975,the carpets are in need of a makeover,3
8976,the bed is comfy front desk staff were nice and attentive,3
8977,i brought it to the attention of the people in the room next door early in the morning,3
8978,the things that made this a true 4 star service was great the room was clean and bed comfortable,3
8979,the room rates were not bad considering the proximity to the highway,3
8980,we didn't spend much time in room but it was an easy location right off the tollway can not be beat,3
8981,as soon as i told them about it and nothing was done about it,3
8982,i missed having a coffee maker in the room but the clerk brought one up right away,3
8983,it's no secret this hotel needs some advice on a healthy breakfast,3
8984,i couldn't figure out how to get into the pool,3
8985,i was glad i did it alone and did not have any 2-beds available since they started remodeling early to get ready for a,3
8986,while it includes the name french quarter it is on the outskirts and you really need a car,3
8987,harry and jim shuttle drivers were very nice and changed my room to the front desk but inside the room was brown,3
8988,it appears old and in need of a deep clean,3
8989,it was decent for the price and because it was not mold,3
8990,the front desk staff was very friendly professional and knowledgeable,3
8991,the room was in need of better maintenance,3
8992,though the hotel was older and a bit worn but it suited its purpose for the price,3
8993,no microwave pool was nice and the staff was very friendly,3
8994,not an easy task to find a decent rate at this hotel,3
8995,i was a little disappointed in our stay,3
8996,really the hotel was clean and near the interstate,3
8997,website for this hotel is deceiving in that it depicts that the hotel is under renovation but we had an old room and it showed,3
8998,the hotel is what you expect from hotel cleaning staff,3
8999,would like better brand coffee in the room would have been nice,3
9000,ok i have stayed here before and it's a short ferry ride to bellagio too,3
9001,i think they need to get new towels,3
9002,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
9003,it took quite a while to find a room close by i found one here,3
9004,we originally planned on staying for 2 nights and only needed the room for the night to sleep,3
9005,the air conditioning control was nonfunctional the alarm clock did not work and the tv power button didn't work well,3
9006,off season so many of the hotel and for that reason we will not stay at a casino hotel again,3
9007,we come here every year because it's a great place to stay for one night,3
9008,room had urnine dirty towels when i go there but i called and they wanted to charge me 20 per day,3
9009,the 3 of us got up at 8 am and came back at 3 30pm to get ready for a,3
9010,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the room or anywhere else on dining activities attractions delivery in the area,3
9011,other than this small the room was decent comfortable for the night,3
9012,took two trips to the desk and asked them for a new remote never heard back from,3
9013,outside of our hotel room which is great for the facility and the staff is not helpful,3
9014,very clean and within walking distance to the metro,3
9015,besides these 2 things the room was fine for what we needed as we were there only to get a rest before continuing our trip,3
9016,however i stood at the front desk in the morning and everything would be ok,3
9017,staff is pretty friendly and the rooms are not much but it is clean,3
9018,nice rooms that have been updated recently but not worth the price and not entirely negative reviews,3
9019,booked the hotel due to the price and the staff was pleasant and helpful,3
9020,the food was good and a good value for the money in this area,3
9021,i was happy it had a microwave and refrigerator to make guests more comfortable,3
9022,the smoking area right outside the door with the door open,3
9023,the carpets were pretty clean overall but there were patches in the ceiling and there was a bunch of tagging,3
9024,i called the front desk no one was there to assist me,3
9025,looks like a room in the 70's and hasn't been cleaned,3
9026,a few friends and i stayed here for a conference in the area,3
9027,what staff we saw was friendly and helpful and greated us with a smile,3
9028,unfortunately the restaurant was closed as there was a lingering odor,3
9029,the room was rather dark and felt like we were in a room we just arrived in to,3
9030,clean non smoking rooms with plenty of towels and you get continental breakfast free,3
9031,i will say the hotel staff did not meet my expectations,3
9032,stayed in a room on the upper floors,3
9033,the rooms were ok clean but out dated pillows were horrible,3
9034,breakfast was a bit lacking but restaurants close by so not a big deal but i felt like i was sleeping on rocks,3
9035,i have a disability where i have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area,3
9036,water pressure in shower was good but the pool was super dirty,3
9037,hotel was ok just about all the staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation,3
9038,i thought it was overpriced for the value,3
9039,granted this hotel is situated in the center of everything we needed to do which was nice,3
9040,hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a night but this wouldn't be my first choice hotel,3
9041,the room was clean however if you're looking to be pampered this is not the place,3
9042,the hotel itself or should i say don't get,3
9043,there was no one at the front desk was very apologetic and fixed the situation immediately,3
9044,on the way out i stopped at the front desk could have been warmer but the room was nice,3
9045,the 3 of us got up at 8 am and next at 10 am,3
9046,the air conditioner in our room didn't work and bed was extremely hard,3
9047,good hotel if you don't want to spend extended time there,3
9048,when you go to hi you need to understand that it is not a place to hangout or people-watch,3
9049,friendly staff however carpet had a bad odor coming from the plumbing,3
9050,the only issue with this hotel is the reason i chose laquinta inns and suites,3
9051,this is a shame because the bed was placed in such a way because i booked through hotels,3
9052,the place is ok a little old but good for a room and barely makes that worth it,3
9053,in the room itself the bath towels were very rough and the bed had a burnhole in it,3
9054,wow great service and imagine my surprise when they charged my credit card even though it was plugged in,3
9055,the hotel was still under construction at the time of our stay,3
9056,informed the front desk and nothing was done until end of day,3
9057,nobody in the lobby i used this hotel because the room looked nice and the other hotel workers were courteous and customer friendly,3
9058,the room was too big for the a c unit rattled off and on all night,3
9059,the options are limited so we had no programming to see,3
9060,i ended up not staying at the super 8 in ithaca which was awesome,3
9061,we stayed in a room with 2 queen beds a big tall guy had to sleep on a drive from florida to ohio,3
9062,it was mostly a clean room the beds were comfortable a c worked well and hotel was quiet,3
9063,when we checked in the front desk had nothing to offer,3
9064,for the good points the indoor pool was ok and the free breakfast was good with decent choice of food,3
9065,they are renovating the new rooms are very nice and the bathrooms were clean,3
9066,it was mostly a clean room the beds were comfortable room was clean and we felt safe in the neighborhood,3
9067,might stay again if the price was right,3
9068,this best western is in an older part of town but there were plenty of pools areas to enjoy,3
9069,hotel aura advertises itself as having everything you'd expect from a motel 8 perfectly priced for what we needed,3
9070,although i did find it a little expensive for microwaved sandwiches and there wasn't adequate salt sand on the ice,3
9071,and you are in the center of the room so it was about 90,3
9072,house cleaning did kindly help us with a couple of girl friends the hotel itself was great,3
9073,if you don't want to eat or walk outside of the hotel to get reception for internet,3
9074,we stayed on our way to mexico missouri,3
9075,it took several attempts to get the key card to unlock the door the first time we were disappointed with the noise level all night,3
9076,but he bed was comfy and the room was very dirty and had,3
9077,the floors were disgusting rarely vacuumed and i don't think a hold needs to last that long,3
9078,the staff was very friendly and it's a nice place to stay,3
9079,the room was clean and neat but was missing the mark on real comfort and accomodation for my family,3
9080,when i needed quarters for their own coin operated laundry i had to leave earlier than expected due to an emergency at home,3
9081,otherwise its a very nice place as the lobby area is very inviting and the,3
9082,there are no restaurants in the immediate area but you have to walk across the parking lot,3
9083,it was clean quiet a good value and really close to disneyland,3
9084,clumpy pillows felt like they had been there for a long extended stay for what we wanted,3
9085,there is only one trash can rather than one in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel,3
9086,we stayed here last year and it was fine for what we needed,3
9087,when i mentioned that it is not the ritz carlton but if you are looking for somewhere special i would try somewhere else,3
9088,we were the only people that ate there that evening there seemed to be something wrong with the card reader on the door,3
9089,a lot of workers arguing and room wasn't done at check-in and check-out were quick and efficient,3
9090,our booking said we had free wi-fi was ok in room but not secure,3
9091,the room was clean and the bed was comfortable and the motel was reasonably priced for the area,3
9092,however the larger pool was closed the days we were there but the staff did jump on it trying to fix it quickly,3
9093,other than that the stay was not worth the price,3
9094,it's probably a marriott thing but they charge for wifi in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones,3
9095,we were in town for a wedding and spent two nights at hotel deca on a deal through jetsetter,3
9096,if i were in the area for one night to lay your head,3
9097,we were promised two room next to each other and on the first floor,3
9098,it took me 2 hours to air out the room before costomers are placed in them,3
9099,i don't know if i will spend the extra money next time to stay somewhere else,3
9100,had a relative in nearby hospital and just needed a bed to sleep in for one night during a conference,3
9101,room was clean and the staff was courteous friendly and helpful,3
9102,it was very noisy and not the best location but this was the smallest room i've ever slept on,3
9103,its a old building and it was still there when we checked out in the morning,3
9104,construction is the big issue with this hotel is the lack of children's programming on the tv,3
9105,they dont mention it on the website and was in a nice neighborhood and not to far from the beach,3
9106,this place looks like a prison so i thought it would fall down on us so i turned,3
9107,it was also convenient to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult,3
9108,i will have to find another hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there,3
9109,the floors were pretty thin so we could hear people in the hallways and rooms were dirty,3
9110,the hotel was a nice place i just didn't realize how small that would be,3
9111,it's relaxing to have the view of the water it would be a good choice for us because it was close to safer streets,3
9112,stayed at this laquinta several times in the past and have generally been pleased,3
9113,checkin was swift once we were able to deal with the parking issues associated with the downtown or larger hotels,3
9114,i would definitely not go there again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
9115,there was a full size refrigerator in the room which was a pleasant surprise,3
9116,which on the website showed that it had a strong cigarette odor even though it was not as good as a super 8,3
9117,the staff were very friendly during my few interactions and the room was clean but out dated pillows were horrible,3
9118,upon entering the casino area to check in we were hit with the 130 cleaning fee for our 3 day stay,3
9119,the only down side was that the pool was a bit too firm and the pillows were thrown on the bed,3
9120,although we had our own bathroom in our room was the shower head up higher,3
9121,i was in town for a wedding venue we didnt have high expectations,3
9122,it's a great hotel for a honeymoon,3
9123,some of the staff was friendly and very helpful with,3
9124,there were ice trays but they were empty so we had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves,3
9125,the women that ownes the hotel is very close to the beach but,3
9126,my room was on the main floor and was told that they were having a problem or not but the water was cold,3
9127,we figured for one night it was fine but at the end of cleaning carpets for all rooms in the hotel,3
9128,overall a nice enough place for the price but would not stay there again,3
9129,but the staff was very friendly also,3
9130,nice hotel great location and a decent breakfast,3
9131,though the sofa expedia claimed was in the room was dirty and had tear,3
9132,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of old cologne steps from the river dom restaurants etc,3
9133,wouldn't recommend walking in the immediate area except for fast food,3
9134,room was comfortable as you would expect from a comfort inn,3
9135,looking for a room for two they tried to put us in a double,3
9136,but on the first morning we were informed that we were charged for smoking,3
9137,we were a little misinformed when we were told we were upgraded not sure exactly what that upgrade meant,3
9138,this the third time in the last month i've stayed at other hotels in nola and can't blame the water source,3
9139,overpriced by 30 for what it is and what it offers,3
9140,my wife and i stayed at this hotel for one night as we were going home to texas,3
9141,i was glad we were only staying 2 nights in the area on business,3
9142,service was ok but the beds were comfortable,3
9143,the hotel itself was quiet and the bed was very uncomfortable,3
9144,hot tub was spacious in the room to drown out the noise,3
9145,we stayed one night on a road trip the hotel was clean recently renovated and comfortable,3
9146,we have stayed at this hotel because it is the only one in kingston that is decant,3
9147,this is a decent hotel for the price very good service,3
9148,it was our first visit to virginia beach and we wanted to watch the game while we had dinner and some drinks,3
9149,i was commuting to dusseldorf each day so it was sweltering at night when we got back 2 hours later,3
9150,room was small which made running the a c difficult as so close to the beach and shops and in this respect we were pleased,3
9151,the location was great in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk,3
9152,i stayed at this hotel several times before and probably will not stay at your hotels anymore,3
9153,however the attitude of front desk and breakfast area staff in the morning was disappointing as the quality of the work being done,3
9154,entering room found no towels and coffee in the room would have been more compelling but,3
9155,i saw this place and it was a pretty good experience,3
9156,room was clean and big but i didn't care for those but otherwise it was clean and quiet,3
9157,the pool was small along with the hot tub i know it was a timeshare with a check out time 10 am,3
9158,booked online showed up and was given a double bed standard,3
9159,but room was adequate although there was a tear in the comforter,3
9160,over all the hotel is a little outdated,3
9161,it still has a great location and close to family,3
9162,i enjoyed the microwave refrigerator table and chairs which made it easy to travel to restaurants shopping strips,3
9163,every employee we encountered at this hotel seemed as though they were designed in the 40's,3
9164,and no we did not have a real closet but there was a lot of noise,3
9165,average stay not what i was expecting on my vacation but i guess the hotel can't be any closer to the freeway,3
9166,i was expecting clean smells in the hotel but we did let the maid know,3
9167,when i finally did get my king room there was no coffee to make in it,3
9168,not bad for the price but a little bit old-looking,3
9169,i guess it should be priced at 39,3
9170,the room was a little disconcerting we had to walk to another hotel to see what they had,3
9171,the location is great but they need to clean the carpet,3
9172,other than that the hotel itself was nice it is right off the highway,3
9173,he said he would switch rooms i informed him i didn't cancel my reservation and asked the clerk to call another motel and secure,3
9174,when i finally checked in the room was very reasonable,3
9175,m one of the days which is when we wanted to check in and did not acknowledge any guests unless first talked to,3
9176,the room was very clean and the ac worked well but a bit noisy,3
9177,there also is a pool out front but it was closed because we just had to drain it and change the levels,3
9178,i asked the front desk to ask for more at the front desk,3
9179,however ownership and management attention to this hotel if i were them,3
9180,room was comfortable and the room was ok the air was cold and beds were comfortable and clean,3
9181,the combined parking facilities total 3 were good enough and it was very convenient to the airport and a paid shuttle to the port,3
9182,all we wanted was a clean quiet room for the night to sleep,3
9183,upon check in we were told we were on the end of the hallway,3
9184,the hotel is right on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
9185,the upside very helpful friendly front desk staff who was helpful and very nice and was able to get a milk even in the evening,3
9186,rugs need to be replaced in the hotel and the lot was flooded ankle deep in some places,3
9187,trivago was sporting a room with a fireplace and jacuzzi,3
9188,three more times we came back to the room it's sweltering hot and the unit takes forever,3
9189,worst things bedroom smelled strongly of cigarette smoke though it was a clean room with friendly staff,3
9190,this hotel is great for if you are planning a romantic getaway-not the hotel for you,3
9191,overall my stay was okay and i'd be willing to give this hotel more stars but it just did not live up to expectations,3
9192,then when i asked for some they didn't have my reservation when i arrived,3
9193,just needed an overnight after a long day of motorcycle riding gave this place a shot,3
9194,i informed the desk manager that i was very disappointed that there was no mirror outside of the bathroom in the dark,3
9195,the hotel is also close to the convention center and not far from downtown by car to waterville,3
9196,i specifically requested a room for 5 adults i was given a double queen room with a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,3
9197,hotel staff was very nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
9198,room was nice but the smell was horrible it gave me a room that was described as facing the walmart parking lot,3
9199,however my bed was creaky and didn't appear to happy to be there,3
9200,on a road trip and didn't want to give because she said the dog was big,3
9201,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to leave too early for breakfast so i can't comment on the amenities,3
9202,it is an ok place to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant service is terrible,3
9203,never again will i stay at super 8 we would get what we expected for the money,3
9204,this is an old resort clean as much as possible but in need of some updates paint but the staff was very friendly and helpful,3
9205,overall for the price of the 2 bedroom condo that we reserved was small,3
9206,i honestly don't think that is the normal there but it was the best deal we could find at that time of year,3
9207,i would use this hotel again if i am able to get a milk even in the evening,3
9208,the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
9209,in general this hampton falls short in many areas and i do not know go downstairs when you ask her a question,3
9210,breakfast was fine and they had a shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
9211,pros the staff was friendly and we got a good nights sleep after driving,3
9212,some good food in the area but mostly due to the lack of follow up by this hotels management team,3
9213,the tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise,3
9214,the lady who checked us in was extremely helpful with all my extra requests thank you,3
9215,actually tried to get into our rooms,3
9216,the hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of selections and they always had enough food,3
9217,try to get a low floor because when the hotel is not at full capacity because it is,3
9218,staff are very nice breakfast is better than a lot of other budget places,3
9219,we did have a problem with the thermostat in our room,3
9220,i was glad i did it alone and did not have any trouble in locating the hotel,3
9221,the exterior isn't much to look at but the rooms are a little small,3
9222,not so as a result i requested to make a cash withdrawal from the hotel and you could always order in,3
9223,inconveniently i will have to find another hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there,3
9224,i was only in the room for a short time breakfast was very good,3
9225,we paid 10 extra for two breakfasts but we had to leave the room for several hours,3
9226,i brewed coffee and place coffee cups in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't,3
9227,for the most part although you could easily tell that there was a swimming pool hot tub as well,3
9228,friendly staff and close to the beach but it's a bit dingy,3
9229,i might stay here again if need be,3
9230,i booked bayside because we stayed here before we booked it,3
9231,the lady at at the front desk because they didn't have my reservation when i arrived,3
9232,the hotel is right on the beach with an outdoor pool,3
9233,the air conditioning control was nonfunctional the alarm clock did not work and it was like this every morning,3
9234,our room was clean and well stocked,3
9235,the newburgh howard johnson is not a nice place but good price,3
9236,separate kids area with smaller frog slide and a hot tub as well as we were in walking distance of food shopping and attractions,3
9237,the hotel itself was very nice and brought batteries on request,3
9238,well as i agree that things happen but it was the same everyday a waffle mini muffins and drink,3
9239,i pointed out that i understood was there to confirm the day staff knew of the proposed room change,3
9240,bathrooms are dated as are carpets in the halls and being farther away would probably help,3
9241,some kind of mix up there i have stayed here for one night for a small business owner is adequate for my needs,3
9242,as drove into the circle that this hotel is targeted frequently or someone is tipping them off,3
9243,my room was tucked away in the farthest corner with a view of the heating and cooling equipment and the parking lot,3
9244,when we got there it was pretty freeze in the room but no iron bed was comfortable,3
9245,but it's a place to sleep driving across minnesota,3
9246,i don't mind the construction in the lobby but the rooms are in an adjacent motel-like building yet quiet,3
9247,air conditioner worked well and the room had a broken desk and the tv remote was broken,3
9248,we stayed in this hotel for one night as we were passing through,3
9249,spent saturday night here with my daughter while in town for a wedding and we had no clean towels to shower with,3
9250,it states they have an indoor pool and hot tub very nice an clean as well,3
9251,however we had a room with a balcony the next day,3
9252,all the pictures showed a rainfall shower in the bathroom just a stand in the bathtub,3
9253,harry and jim shuttle drivers were very nice and it had a grainy picture,3
9254,she was told that we would have two rooms on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3
9255,hotel is old but they have continental breakfast which is a better option than buy breakfast at mcdonald's,3
9256,no fridge no microwave swimming pool is located on the grounds with an outback steak house,3
9257,had we realized there wasn't one in the hotel we had booked this would have been avoided,3
9258,very nice hotel in a good location for being in battle creek,3
9259,didn't sleep at all due to the noise of people coming and going at all hours,3
9260,also there was not a micro fridge or microwave in the room but the clerk brought one up right away,3
9261,however my courtyard view was little more than a view of the beautiful pool area so don't count on that,3
9262,hotel is too close to the highway nice room was spacious and clean the problems with the hotel are not the rooms,3
9263,the staff were very friendly during my few interactions and the room was warm when we checked in,3
9264,i have stayed here many times and really like this hotel for its proximity to the mall of america,3
9265,walls are paper thin and i could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall,3
9266,the up stairs electric heater ran on high with no way to turn it off because of marijuana smell blowing into room,3
9267,overall central location to a lot of good restaurants and things,3
9268,the service was nice but not very attentive,3
9269,booked room here due to most other rooms in the area were already full so i didn't even want to use the sink,3
9270,the rooms could have been cleaner there was hair on the floor and in the sink,3
9271,entered the toilet and we were greeted with a smile and a cookie,3
9272,for a smoke free facility room smelled like smoke but beds were comfortable,3
9273,the room was decent and the free contintal breakfast was better than expected nice muffins bagels and fresh fruit,3
9274,front desk service is not the best hilton i have stayed,3
9275,rooms are dated and front desk staff was not very helpful,3
9276,reserved a king size bed but i arrived they gave me a white garage bag for my ice,3
9277,the meal was okay but not very accommodating,3
9278,room was clean but seemed damp mildewed like no one had vacuumed i would never recommend anyone to stay there,3
9279,i would assume that since it was so close to the airport and price is good,3
9280,being the biggest location in town for a friend's wedding,3
9281,i was a bit leery because there were several men in the parking lot for an hour waiting just for that,3
9282,i probably would not stay again unless i had my dog,3
9283,the first impression is that this is a very old hotel but it was late and the office was closed,3
9284,i stayed here before and it's a nice place to stay near worcester,3
9285,place was adequate for the price but this last stay was very stressful,3
9286,got a good price on expedia because hotel is renovating had to walk past two ladies who were smoking right by the door,3
9287,i stayed at this hotel because it was near the harbor and catalina express,3
9288,not much parking it was full when we arrived late but they held a first floor room,3
9289,i've stayed here 3 times and all 3 units seem to be for pets very pet friendly,3
9290,we didn't spend a lot of time in the room and was moved at 3 am was moved to another room w o incident,3
9291,the pool area was nice to have an indoor pool but they don't tell you that until after you surrender your keys,3
9292,would like better brand coffee in the room was dim and some light fixtures in the room were quite uncomfortable,3
9293,staff did their job but there was no good night here,3
9294,unfortunately the curtains do not close in the room and told her the beds had not been made either,3
9295,convenient when you rent bring a car but not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were,3
9296,if you are not one of the 74 recently renovated rooms,3
9297,the carpet in the elevator was extremely dirty and our bathroom door did not shut,3
9298,overall the stay was ok but our room had black mold on the ceiling and running down a door,3
9299,this hotel is good if you need a bed close to the airport,3
9300,it was easy to reach easy to find and get to this location,3
9301,the hotel is ok but the beds were very worn out,3
9302,the restaurant opens at 7 and we had to call for a replacement,3
9303,value for money hotel right on the beach that was quite nice,3
9304,had a late check in and check out were great,3
9305,the owner was very nice and very helpful,3
9306,east cambridge is not glamorous but this hotel is a very good location to tour sf,3
9307,we chose this hotel because i just wanted a place to sleep overnight and the bed was very comfortable,3
9308,upon walking into the room there was a ceiling hatch awkwardly hanging open,3
9309,the pool was dirty but i didn't like the condition there,3
9310,overall it is a good hotel in a great location i would recommend this place,3
9311,no longer having any fight left in me as this was supposed to be a nice weekend away for my fiance and i,3
9312,when traveling 8 hours i wanted them to be able to make one trip up the stairs,3
9313,we were a little disappointed in the room,3
9314,didnt hear bell so i had to drag bags up the stairs,3
9315,i thought it was going to be a romantic night turned out to be not accepting credit card,3
9316,the rooms are fine but don't expect much from that kind of place,3
9317,the living room was ok it had an old box tv and everything in the bathroom was the thing making the room accessible,3
9318,it was nice having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the complimentary breakfast,3
9319,do i think it was worth the price it was a very pleasant room,3
9320,i simply needed a cost effective place to stay while daughter was in ssu orientation,3
9321,not luxury hotel but for those looking for extras in their hotel stay,3
9322,the hotel has a amazing views of the lake beds are comfortable and there is a microwave and a refrigerator,3
9323,notified desk was given a double with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds,3
9324,for a reasonably priced hotel this one is good clean and the breakfast was good and the place was clean but way to expensive,3
9325,also the there are two restaurants within walking distance matter of fact there is nothing within walking distance of this place,3
9326,i complained about my room to the front desk but inside the room was brown,3
9327,the location was right off the freeway so it's easy to catch a bus,3
9328,i brought it to the front desk to give me towels for the amount of people there,3
9329,we were told to drive down the road 10-15 min during low traffic 45 min during high traffic,3
9330,the meal was okay but not very accommodating,3
9331,didnt hear bell so i had to drag my luggage up a long flight of stairs,3
9332,also sign in room said continental breakfast but there was only one working socket in the room,3
9333,the hotel is old but they have continental breakfast which is a better option than buy breakfast at mcdonald's,3
9334,the only complaint that we had was the beds were super comfortable but the bathroom on the other hand was a little disappointing,3
9335,the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
9336,the woman in the morning told me i was not allowed to put ice in the cooler,3
9337,the bathroom shower could use updating but other than that it was ok i will stay there again,3
9338,don't come here expecting a fantastic experience but it's a little old need to upgrade bathrooms,3
9339,it's not that fancy but it's about what you expect from hotel cleaning staff,3
9340,and it's close to the airport so i can't comment on that,3
9341,it was a pleasant stay but i'm just not sure it was worth the price it was a very pleasant room,3
9342,we changed rooms but still the beds are comfortable and the pool set up is fantastic for both adults and children,3
9343,the rate for the room was very dated but it was nice,3
9344,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a plunger we were surprised that nobody offered assistance,3
9345,we were within 15-20 minutes still no coffee,3
9346,stray dogs roaming in the parking lot who seemed to be very limited compared to other hotels in this price range,3
9347,she knew me by name and knew exactly what i wanted a good clean sleeping room,3

9349,the housekeeping staff did not properly service the room on the other side of i-95 take a cab,3
9350,it had a smell and though it was a non smoking room that had been smoked in,3
9351,cleanliness is an issue from the dried food on the outside of the hotel appeared clean and well maintained,3

9355,location was ok clean room but the front desk staff was nice and free breakfast vouchers a plus,3
9356,the hostess was nice the room was good staff was nice,3
9357,breakfast was minimal but for the price it was ok,3
9358,had we not arrived so late at night due to the lack of follow up by this hotels management team,3
9359,i could feel the springs thru the mattress and the loud cars outside the window,3
9360,i only booked this hotel because of it's location,3
9361,we arrived around midnight and there was no pool very little space when you have kids,3

9363,the second room was comfortable and very adequate,3
9364,the breakfast was ok make your own waffles was great and the reason i checked backed in this hotel,3

9368,clumpy pillows felt like they had been there for a long time while we were checking in,3
9369,we had to stop for the night on our way north,3
9370,overall the stay was ok the room was clean,3
9371,bed was ok location was very convenient for one night on a road trip,3
9372,the housekeeping accidentally put my beach towel in their laundry and it didn't stink like i thought it would be,3
9373,once in the room it died they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc,3
9374,my wife i sunk to the middle of the hallway not close to either entrance,3
9375,the room was so hot that i had to take the coffee maker off our bill,3
9376,the woman at the front desk you receive a welcoming from the staff the front desk reception was friendly and very accommodating,3
9377,a free shuttle was available to the airport and we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door walls,3

9385,pretty good just there for a family reunion only have a few complaints,3
9386,paid 172 for one night which i thought was pretty weird for a hotel,3
9387,fortunately there are cafes nearby if you don't have many choices for lodging,3
9388,if it wasn't so far away from the center of krefeld but we'll connected if you have a time schedule,3
9389,i like to work out first thing in the morning but we did not see it posted anywhere,3
9390,the hotel itself was quiet and the location was great and near to st marks square,3
9391,coffee maker is stored under the sink in the room had blood on it upon arrival,3
9392,the only negative i would state is that the carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak,3
9393,room was clean however if you're looking for a party hotel this is not the place for you,3
9394,stopped at this hotel for a weekend stay,3
9395,this hotel charges for your room keys if you do not care that you are not staying by the beach,3
9396,this should tell you a lot when we got into the second room it smelled like cheap cologne,3
9397,i just need a bed and a shower and that is what i woke up to each morning,3
9398,it was clean and there was a good variety of food,3
9399,the hotel was conveniently at a good rate this hotel would work fine,3
9400,my husband and i stayed at the embassy and had a much better room,3
9401,iconic theatre in the middle of the night,3
9402,everything was in good shape considering the age of the section we were in,3
9403,too many people so it was a bit run down but clean,3
9404,the latter was especially frustrating because i was trying to get into the hottub and it was cold and dirty,3
9405,otherwise its a good place to stay and pretty clean too,3
9406,hotel room was comfortable for the two of us could plug in the things we needed,3
9407,there was also no room service and the pillows were pretty uncomfortable,3
9408,the room was quite small but the bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice as it was within walking distance of the hotel,3
9409,the hotel staff was very nice and friendly,3
9410,the hotel was right off the freeway so it's easy to bring your own,3
9411,iconic theatre in the middle of the night,3
9412,we had just driven 8 hours and it was snowing so that wasn't going to be amazing simply because of the price,3
9413,room and breakfast were fine pretty much what you'd expect for 45,3
9414,no shampoo leaking toilet no running water in our shower tub,3
9415,i have stayed here before and it's a short ferry ride to bellagio too,3
9416,works for a night but this wouldn't be my first choice more of a back up plan,3
9417,overall the cleanliness was acceptable but the flooring in the bathroom was so far away from my room,3
9418,stayed in 412 the room was pretty basic but it was clean and everything in it worked,3
9419,the arion resort and spa hotel is not a bad choice for a one night stay on a trip to walt disney world,3
9420,other than that it's a good place to stay and pretty clean too,3
9421,they give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was stiff and had springs poking me in the back,3
9422,this is probably the best place to stay in the room for a short time when we arrived that evening it is open until midnight,3
9423,we picked this hotel because it was the only one with a key to acess the towels,3
9424,one of the unnecessary items that were a problem was the breakfast room was a little out-dated but clean,3
9425,also did not not like the charge for the safe in the room for us and our luggage,3
9426,when checked into the room there was water in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark,3
9427,the 70 per night rate worked great for my need as it was very close to the river and lots of lovely restaurants and shops,3
9428,morning desk staff were friendly and accomodating,3
9429,the front office manager was very helpful and i actually left with a smile,3
9430,my wife and i was climbing the stairs to the ground floor to the 1st floor and the grounds,3
9431,we were charged a smoking fee for a room that is an add on to the regular suite,3
9432,for the good points the indoor pool was ok and the location right on the freeway was nice,3
9433,the room was pretty basic but the staff was friendly and very accommodating,3
9434,loved it only bad thing was the pool was small which was okay the water was pretty cold,3
9435,the hotel was fine and the bed was comfy and we got a voucher for the mcdonald's for breakfast,3
9436,the rooms were clean and comfortable with the exception of a malfunctioning air conditioner and the fridge didnt work,3
9437,this place was easy to find and perfect for a short stay overnight only,3
9438,if needed we would stay there again even though it was supposed to open,3
9439,i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone staying in the area,3
9440,they turned off the water for a few hours of sleep and move on,3
9441,i had a car did not want to make us happy when we departed,3
9442,when checked into the room there was water in the bathroom and a malfunctioning heating cooling unit,3
9443,my family 2 adults 1 kid stayed for 3 nights on labor day weekend for a family event,3
9444,the room was clean however if you're looking for a classy establishment folks look elsewhere,3
9445,the only complaint was the check-in process took a long time because i believe they were overbooked,3
9446,but the problem i had was i specifically asked for a room with a handicap-accessible bathroom,3
9447,the personnel were very friendly and willing to help you out if needed,3
9448,wasn't too happy the keys never worked to get in the way of enjoying our vacation,3
9449,those are 2 of the things i tend to rate when i stay in santa cruz because i want to walk everywhere,3
9450,we stayed in april i can't imagine what it would have been a better stay if our room had been clean,3
9451,it was very pet friendly but i would not have booked it i would have gone somewhere else,3
9452,the room was clean but the hotel was fine for our needs and the price,3
9453,not bad for what you pay for with this location,3
9454,got there and was told they didn't have a toddler trying to touch it,3
9455,in the morning i don't want to spend a lot of money,3
9456,got there 1 hour after check in they was sold out of king beds and she would have to charge me extra,3
9457,the air conditioning worked really well and the room was quiet and comfortable,3
9458,the rest of the staff don't seem to get cleaned also have quite a musty smell,3
9459,staff was very friendly and our room was directly across from the freeway so it's easy to catch a bus,3
9460,the room was dirty and looked like it had a bit of a self catering zone would have been helpful,3
9461,stay was ok check in and charged a bit of a take it or leave it attitude from the hosts,3
9462,the ice machine was broken so we had to wait 30 minutes to check out,3
9463,i didnt like that there wasn't a thick cover provided on the bed,3
9464,for the most part the hotel was very well located for our purposes with a number of restaurants nearby with easy access,3
9465,com was very reasonable so i am not a big fan of too,3
9466,may not seem important but if you have a dog but not so great if you actually want to sleep in comfort during your stay,3
9467,the room was dirty and well cleaned when we checked in a lady complained that her room wasn't cleaned,3
9468,the second night we stayed at the plaza before with little to no issues,3
9469,overall it's a good place to stay for the night while away for work,3
9470,very run down rooms smell breakfast is the worst of any hotel i've stayed in there was no shower curtain,3
9471,you just have to remember that this used to be a really well kept hotel with consitant quality,3
9472,we just stayed for one night and the parking lot,3
9473,safe in room didn't work properly but i didn't feel as if i was ungrateful about getting a room,3
9474,we didn't use it but it seemed like it was lived in full-time by some,3
9475,could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable pool area was a little cramped but had a nice variety,3
9476,he picked us up from a concert downtown and the breakfast was great though awesome because we could eat then be on our way,3
9477,our room was moderate clean and had a fully working kitchen,3
9478,the front desk clerk pam was very friendly and helpful and greated us with a smile,3
9479,the hotel is clean and the location couldn't have been nicer,3
9480,we only used hj for an overnight stay but wouldn't want to stay here if i was local and wanted to use the beach,3
9481,the hotel has free parking and is literally less than a block from the beach golf casino and about 10 minutes away from restraints,3
9482,the only real problem was that there was no safe in the room,3
9483,staff was accommodating though and printed for me from the front desk person was knitting talking to guests when i came in,3
9484,room service food was really good but i didn't like having to pay for wifi,3
9485,the view was grim but i didn't pay for a trip its easier and quicker to just walk yourself,3
9486,stayed a night with my kiddo it was a good deal and worked for what i needed,3
9487,the promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be too friendly towards cash customers,3
9488,but flat screen tv in the room in fact the bed was comfortable but the breakfast was awful,3
9489,our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to help this person out at all,3
9490,the restroom in the lobby area was clean and well maintained,3
9491,i may try it again next time i am in the area,3
9492,but just turning the fan on in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't have pool towels,3
9493,but on our stays it was clean and the location is excellent,3
9494,take care when you book that you are not alloted a room with a king bed fridge and microwave for 70,3
9495,i had to stand with my 2 kids at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do,3
9496,elevator shaft in the lobby is very small and the bed was comfortable though,3
9497,the combined parking facilities total 3 were good enough and it was very good,3
9498,what i did notice was that the hotel water wasn't working couple times,3
9499,hotel was close however the bes was to small for a couple and they refused to change us to another room,3
9500,the one night we stayed there and went to the family dollar store to pick up some toilitries,3
9501,yes there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building,3
9502,overall ok not really sure it was worth the price it was a very easy process,3
9503,wifi access coded given upon check in rather than having to call the front desk but inside the room was brown,3
9504,the location was convenient right off the interstate so no getting lost,3
9505,the food was great as was the people in the room next is complaining,3
9506,there were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a room meant for just one,3
9507,the area isn't much to look at but the rooms are spacious and staff is very helpfull,3
9508,it is the best part of the hotel is under significant renovation in rooms and the lobby,3
9509,the service is good and they didn't have a door peephole to let you see who was at the door,3
9510,check in was good we were able to have pancakes as a late,3
9511,we went through 3 rooms to get an a c that worked but had a horrible smell,3
9512,but i will say it was a decent stay for a good price,3
9513,several other newer hotels in the area but mostly due to the lack of parking,3
9514,overall not too bad though if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills,3
9515,the room smelled like smoke even worse when the ac was left off for too long,3
9516,the lights were a bit confusing as there is a nice run along the bay,3
9517,rooms were ok but carpets didn't seem to be all that busy either,3
9518,this hotel location was good and the bed was comfy and we got a voucher for the mcdonald's for breakfast,3
9519,the cold water wasn't working as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
9520,the room was adequate the staff were very friendly even though they had to field many complaints,3
9521,no frills so if you need a quick one night stay,3
9522,we rented a room with a great view of the beach and the nearest public beach access is durham st,3
9523,east cambridge is not glamorous but this hotel is a good choice if you're looking for is view and quiet this is your place,3
9524,when we got there there was a pull out couch,3
9525,the motel is quite confusing because it is right next to the train tracks so you heard trains all night long,3
9526,if you have no other option then it's alright to spend a night at alamosa after visiting great sand dune,3
9527,it was very uncomfortable for my husband and to have a room on the opposite side of the interstate,3
9528,the hotel was very nice however we booked a room for a weekend in a couple weeks,3
9529,the room was clean and we did not have time to use it,3
9530,we stayed one night at the beginning of august as a friend and i had stayed at their cypress creek location,3
9531,also you could hear pipes banging in the wall in my room was coming down is the thing,3
9532,serving the breakfast saved us a lot of advices about where to eat and find things again with a smile and not rushed,3
9533,it was a place to sleep at night,3
9534,parking is available on-site in their garage for the duration of your cruise assuming your port is long beach,3
9535,however i was told to check out and drive all day to get to our room or come down for breakfast,3
9536,ask for a room with a king sized bed was rock hard too,3
9537,just in time as we flew to get on the treadmill several times between,3
9538,we asked for a different room but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
9539,walls are paper thin and i could hear the neighbour's conversation clearly through the wall,3
9540,no hot water there was a smell of smoke in the room the sleep so i was not looking for anything expensive or luxury,3
9541,clean room great location if you are doing room service no liquor store,3
9542,received two extra charges from this hotel because i was a woman staying alone in an unlocked room,3
9543,i didn't feel as if i was ungrateful about getting a room,3
9544,three more times we came back to the hotel when it was getting dark,3
9545,i was only in the room the bathroom could have used a more thorough cleaning,3
9546,i booked a last minute trip not pleasure,3
9547,room was small which made running the a c difficult as so close to the beach and come back for the,3
9548,if you are on a budget this is as good place to stay for one night and no cc on its tv,3
9549,my room was more than adequate and looked like it hadn't been vacuummed for several days poor design,3
9550,there are no restaurants to eat at unless you want to eat every meal at mcd,3
9551,the room was clean and the people at the front desk and he was awoken from his nap because of this,3
9552,the night staff was very nice and our check-in was not very friendly,3
9553,i was there for a night to attend an event about 20 miles away,3
9554,i expected more from this hotel chain we were told it was a non-smoking room that reaked of smoke,3
9555,the hotel is located in a great area for where we were visiting so we would stay here again for that purpose,3
9556,when i finally checked in the room was dirty and the sink had dripping faucet,3
9557,the housekeeping staff did not properly service the room on the second floor next to each other,3
9558,i will not stay here again and would recommend to families,3
9559,the hotel is very close to the beach and centrally located for our travels,3
9560,if quietness was a guarantee i would consider staying again for a quick get a way,3
9561,homeless-looking man was sleeping in one of the elevators was cracked and falling apart,3
9562,the front desk gal was not very friendly but was efficient,3
9563,the floors were disgusting rarely vacuumed and i don't really enjoy pool action anymore,3
9564,it's not one of my favorite hotels in the world but for the money spent it's a great location and close to family,3
9565,the room was nice and comfortable but i found that the aspen haus was not for,3
9566,hotel was quiet and the location was great,3
9567,another down side about this hotel is that it was too noisy windows are not insulated,3
9568,the hotel was clean and near the interstate,3
9569,it is not the worst possible experience but it is clean with a fridge microwave and airconditioning,3
9570,the air conditioner leaked but it worked so i didn't want to be out walking after dark,3
9571,at first we got a non-smoking or smoking symbol on it hmmmm,3
9572,hotel was clean and simple which was fine for a stop over ya get what ya pay for,3
9573,it was a nice experience we were in a different building this time,3
9574,next time i will ask for a cc for incidentals even if you are a high maintenance traveler this is not the place,3
9575,our family had a great time in dahlonega the hotel staff was friendly and the place clean,3
9576,the sink had a long crack and the tub had a hard time getting hot tub time because of kids running in and out,3
9577,overall the stay was ok but our room had black mold on the ceiling and running down a door,3
9578,just a short walk away we had a nice stay and for about half the price as anywhere else in town,3
9579,rooms were nicely upgraded with very classy furniture fridge and microwave and a nice flat screen tv hanging on the wall,3
9580,i told the girl at the front desk running our cards,3
9581,the furniture in the rooms were very clean we were in very convient location,3
9582,when i first walked in but i guess i thought that we'd still get a coffee maker and fridge in the room,3
9583,overall my stay was okay and i'd be willing to give this hotel more stars but it just did not live up to expectations,3
9584,it was nice having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the chico state campus,3
9585,the upside room were very clean and the beds weren't made yet,3
9586,the from desk guy was creepy but if you just a place to sleep so it served its purpose,3
9587,a little more run down than i expected but my stay was pleasant,3
9588,i think they have a lot of experiences to compare,3
9589,the in room guest showed only one ice machine next to the front desk they where closed had to wait until 3 pm,3
9590,the location of this hotel was excellent staff was very courteous,3
9591,i'm not a skier but my wife and i were given room no 135 on first floor with king bed,3
9592,place is very low cost and walking distance to an awesome lighthouse restaurant,3
9593,paid way more than i should beds and pillows were nice,3
9594,when we got there the hotel said that they were full and that was it,3
9595,i came in late at night and very early in the morning then enter,3
9596,pool room was so cold that we didn't get to use it,3
9597,the parking lot can be a bit difficult to find on iphone maps and location disappointing upon finding,3
9598,food beverage and room very pricey for the area and quality of the room,3
9599,we were only there for a night and needed a place to stay before skiing the next day,3
9600,the place was very clean and the beds comfortable,3
9601,pay someone to really clean the pool and hot tub was broken and in poor working condition,3
9602,when we first got to the room from the drive,3
9603,other hotels in the area but mostly due to the lack of follow up by this hotels management team,3
9604,i left four shirts hanging in the room when i walked in i noticed an unpleasant odor,3
9605,dinner very good we didn't have a room for you your mate for couple of nights this is it,3
9606,all in all it's good enough for a two night stay,3
9607,like many hotels these days it seems to be the cheapest decent hotel in the area,3
9608,we had four rooms with our family and the hotel was clean the staff were fine,3
9609,all in all it was an ok stay nothing spectacular,3
9610,the rooms were nice and we have stayed here many times and really like this place,3
9611,with the expansion of the 5 freeway the hotel can't control the noise level of other people,3
9612,i would stay here again for the right price,3
9613,got to my room and it was a great hotel,3
9614,we stayed here two nights the customer service was great room was close to all the outside equipment and pretty noisy,3
9615,there was very little parking and there was no ac at this time of year,3
9616,everything was ok except the tv remote did not work it had a few roaches though i killed them fast,3
9617,room appeared clean at first glance however the bathroom was small we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit,3
9618,this was supposed to be a non smoking room i put in a quarter of smokers,3
9619,during the day workers were cleaning various rooms but they did a poor job and were seen every morning grazing at the complimentary breakfast buffet,3
9620,the continental breakfast in the morning was kind and efficient,3
9621,motel is clean clerks are helpful and friendly next time i'll book somewhere with working aircon and no noise,3
9622,have stayed there before when i made the reservations directly through the hotel and the dcor is in need of renovations,3
9623,we arrived at night and get a room on the second day of our stay,3
9624,so as you can imagine i was trying to wrangle luggage and a 2-year-old,3
9625,very busy breakfast in the morning was wonderful,3
9626,on arrival hotel has wow factor our room was basic but clean the bath was dated but clean,3
9627,my room was placed next to the elevator which made for a great night's sleep,3
9628,they dont mention it on the website and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk,3
9629,can't say i will stay there again yes if the price still right,3
9630,my girlfriend and i stayed here for one night before heading into st,3
9631,hotel was ok just about all the staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation,3
9632,the king size bed was comfortable making for a good night's sleep because the bed was comfortable the room was clean but out dated,3
9633,we continue to stay at this place to save a few bucks it's worth it,3
9634,all the staff were very friendly and helpful and greated us with a smile,3
9635,our friends had no closet bar to hang clothes and had the same problem and they froze up there,3
9636,this hotel was a good accommodation for my wife and i have driven up the mountain just for the views,3
9637,it seems as if it's in the right location if this is where you pick up the free shuttle to down town,3
9638,obviously right at the fremont experience if that is what you are looking forward to at that time in the morning,3
9639,after spending one night there i realized the sliding glass door it did not go away,3
9640,she was short and did not even think to ask but he did,3
9641,the bed sheets didn't look like it had been recently renovated and few out lets in the room,3
9642,hot tub was spacious in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't touch our room,3
9643,it isn't the easiest getting in to and out of due to its location and that's what i was after,3
9644,not value for money and not what you would expected from a nice hotel,3
9645,the room was small but the bed was not comfortable at all,3
9646,the carpet was worn and the wall paper was peeling off the walls in the room and didn't seem to be a factor,3
9647,this is a shame because the bed was placed in such a way because i booked through hotels,3
9648,there was construction going on in front of the bathroom,3
9649,room beds and shower were excellent but the only thing i didn't like the mix up with your price and expedia,3
9650,loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room is tiny and doesn't keep anything coke,3
9651,the bathrooms are small and the place could use a good thorough cleaning some painting and other minor repairs,3
9652,it's not one of my favorite hotels in the world but for the money it was a nice gesture,3
9653,pros good location in the middle of the hotel to get reception for internet,3
9654,not sure it was worth the price paid,3
9655,short drive to downtown puts you in the heart of old cologne steps from the river dom restaurants etc,3
9656,sorry to be that negative but i wouldn't get it if i was staying in wine country,3
9657,hotel has a great location and we have stayed here a couple of times,3
9658,the bathroom was nice but when i went in the non-smoking room which they didn't want to wait,3
9659,it is in a fantastic location easy walk to the stadium from this hotel,3
9660,it even seemed to have drifted up to our room to find hair in the bathtub upon arrival,3
9661,the recliner and table in front of the tv was very good it had a frig and microwave,3
9662,hotel was ok but only one place to eat in the immediate area except for fast food,3
9663,other than that the hotel itself was quiet and the location was good,3
9664,we stayed for a week on business so i wasn't looking for a pool restaurant or exercise facility,3
9665,they say they offer room service however when i went to front desk no one answered,3
9666,also the hotel is directly next door to the room which we cleaned up before occupying the room,3
9667,once in the room it died they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc,3
9668,place has potential but we had a good time here but it wasn't disgusting and it certainly wasn't unbearable,3
9669,i'd say my stay was so-so but bed was amazing,3
9670,yes there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it to make sure it actually gets sent,3
9671,the lady at at the front desk did not want to stay in the area,3
9672,we had to wait a long time for the water in the shower backed up,3
9673,we did mention all this at check out and never received a call back frim accounting,3
9674,the staff was friendly and the room was big and the bed confortable,3
9675,the dirty stale cigarette smoke ruined what could be a great hotel if you got an updated room,3
9676,one of the unnecessary items that were a problem was the breakfast room was a little tired with age but functional,3
9677,stayed here for business and it was good could have more cable chanels,3
9678,well actually 5 because there was a starbucks n stores right across the street from boardwalk bowl,3
9679,in the morning there was a lot of music noise,3
9680,there were several stands in the room that i almost asked for a room with 2 double beds,3
9681,we were awoken 3 times during the night and it was fine,3
9682,however there are some logistics problems the entrance to the hotel is slightly tricky but not bad,3
9683,when we arrived at 11 30 pm it wasn't in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine,3
9684,overall it is a good hotel in a great area,3
9685,very clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful,3
9686,the other elevator was missing the covers for the lights in the bathroom sputtered and flickered for a while after we turned them on,3
9687,i've stayed at other hotels desert pearl,3
9688,overall not bad for the price we paid for it,3
9689,it's an average stay for sleep but don't expect the service to wow you,3
9690,this is an older motel and the rooms are comfortable however the wifi is weak is some areas,3
9691,television was kind of small but we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again for that purpose,3
9692,after the second night i stayed i was in a room that is an add on to the regular suite,3
9693,we had 2 beds in our room and a face at the desk for checkin,3
9694,the front desk and at that point we didn't want to be out walking after dark,3
9695,we choose this location because it was close to the highway but was still a very basic hotel with no frills,3
9696,when we checked in we were told there was a new manager,3
9697,while i can not complain that there was a problem with the hotel was the hallway smelled like wet dog,3
9698,if you're looking for a nice place to stay near worcester,3
9699,the room was clean and the staff did a good job upgrading hotel just needs a few convent electrical outlets for phones and computers,3
9700,the hotel needs to be repainted the tvs are old and the room had a smell to it whenever you enter it,3
9701,this was my 1st art show in richmond and the hotel was pretty old you can't change that,3
9702,very cute old style hotel right in the heart of old cologne steps from the river dom restaurants etc,3
9703,we called the hotel around 9 pm to ask for a few things and it felt like air-conditioning,3
9704,the good great location restaurants nearby you can walk to ihop and a short drive to bertuccis olive garden shopping,3
9705,employees were not very friendly at all and the breakfast was very minimal and they did not clean the room,3
9706,the location of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from the hwy easy check in and out,3
9707,the room also needed to be cleaned under the mattress there was a little mold around the tub,3
9708,the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water,3
9709,i don't know why we were stuck so far away from the elevator as possible and was very small,3
9710,we did not have a reservation but they were able to get us a different room,3
9711,i selected this hotel because of the location friendly staff good breakfast beds and pillows not very comfortable,3
9712,the entire place feels low energy but our room was clean though not very quiet,3
9713,the staff treated us as if we were staying there in the summer,3
9714,breakfast would have been much better if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early,3
9715,i am sure this will be straightened out but i won't stay there anymore because of the price and not entirely negative reviews,3
9716,the hotel was clean and close to all amenities which was just as well as the outside accommodations pool beach access etc,3
9717,the carpet was not as clean as i wished it to be,3
9718,the standard room is an okay size though the bathroom is small but was not an issue,3
9719,have stayed here before and it's a nice place to stay,3
9720,friendly staff however carpet had a bad odor coming from the plumbing,3
9721,i read the reviews on trip advisor and after speaking with the front desk about all the mildew around the jetted tub,3
9722,needs a little improvement when it comes to the florida keys,3
9723,i also wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price i paid it was really worth it,3
9724,cobwebs could be seen in the car outside,3
9725,upon check-in the front desk staff were really nice though,3
9726,i was extremely disappointed that the pool was still closed for the season although it was 90 degrees that day,3
9727,we didn't like is that the walls are thin and you can see the color of it in the basin and toilet bowl,3
9728,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
9729,the hotel location is great and within walking distance to st mark's square and the shopping area,3
9730,for the price of the room it was large and spacious the kitchen area was also clean,3
9731,the things that made this more like a 2 1 2 star facility,3
9732,there was a issue with our stay the staff was very accommodating and willing to assist where needed,3
9733,large part of the hotel's trash dumpster,3
9734,you need to park in the fire lanes,3
9735,the bedroom was clean and the staff was friendly one was not,3
9736,the building was renovated but there was a 100 dollar charge added for incidentals,3
9737,the hotel itself is welcoming the staff friendly and helpful the bed was comfy and the staff courteous,3
9738,breakfast was minimal but for the price i paid for this particular visit,3
9739,older hotel so some quirks it was very hot in our room and walk-in closet coffee in the lobby,3
9740,pueblo bonito sunset is a beautiful hotel in a great area,3
9741,it even seemed to have drifted up to our room to find hair in the bathtub upon arrival,3
9742,the only downfall is things close early around rockafellar center so you have to walk across the parking lot so that is convenient as well,3
9743,we were tired from traveling all day and needed a pet friendly option and this modest motel filled the bill,3
9744,my room was comfortable but had a musty smell ac made it worse,3
9745,i would definitely not go there again unless i had no other choice and had no kids with me,3
9746,hotel as whole is a bit outdated and the room had a very damp smell and the rug was also damp,3
9747,price was one of the cheapest in the area it was in was a little off to the right,3
9748,the desk attendants were very nice and it had a full sized fridge,3
9749,we were assigned another room but it only had a king bed as the hotel was under construction but no noise at night,3
9750,the only things i didn't like was the cleanliness of the room could have been claner,3
9751,the breakfast was certainly not the best hotel but the staff is nice and they do their job didn't really see much,3
9752,it is within walking distance of this place,3
9753,my family had nine rooms rented out which i think is the latest i saw for restaurants,3
9754,the hotel is very dated and rather unappealing,3
9755,considering i am 100 sure it was found when the room was ready,3
9756,we arrived in early evening and left early the next morning so i can't complain too much considering the price,3
9757,i enjoyed the microwave refrigerator table and chairs which made it easy to walk there and do some window shopping,3
9758,our shower drain was soooo slow that you had to pay a separate fee to use the pool,3
9759,valet is at the other end by entrance,3
9760,all in all it was a good stay,3
9761,the breakfast was great and the rooms were very noisy and you could hear people through out the night,3
9762,the elevator was not working on the 2nd floor didn't work,3
9763,room was nice the but the air conditioning would not cool the room,3
9764,there was only 1 small light in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel,3
9765,it was a nice stay for two nights,3
9766,a regular type dining chair was in the room was not very modern,3
9767,if a person needs just a place to sleep after a long drive,3
9768,like may other places the ac will be off when you walk in you can smell the chlorine throughout the facility,3
9769,the rooms don't have any more rooms,3
9770,i didn't mind an extra 20 minutes of drive time in order to be near the airport for our 6 am international flight,3
9771,the team and i appreciate you taking the time to complete an online review your feedback is important to us,3
9772,overall the hotel was nice but the service was arrogant at best,3
9773,key cards didn't work and i could not smell it inside my room,3
9774,it was a nice experience we were in a room we needed as a family,3
9775,need some updating but for the price i paid i expected the room to be a bit more than ordinary,3
9776,yes it's an older hotel what can i say budget price is a budget stay,3
9777,i was tired and was looking forward to a hot breakfast in the morning,3
9778,when i spoke to the person at the front desk is a sweet heart,3
9779,the tub drain stopper was broken and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise,3
9780,the reception staff was very polite and helpful,3
9781,the manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for 50 mins to get picked up at the airport,3
9782,i went down for the continental breakfast at 7 am only to find they were out of it,3
9783,our keys were only programmed for one day even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees,3
9784,i stayed for two nights and they did not refill much from day to day,3
9785,there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't use anything the charge would be reversed,3
9786,she had her stone face on the whole time while we were standing there in the small lobby,3
9787,the breakfast is adequate and we didn't get the room we booked on hotels,3
9788,chairs were too sinkable for me but overall it was good as a family trip,3
9789,one of the lamps next to the bed and was very loud,3
9790,it's an older hotel what can i say budget price is a budget stay,3
9791,on a positive note we were greeted by the general manager when we checked in front desk clerk rude and did not care,3
9792,my first impression at check-in was not very friendly to the elderly person in front of me,3
9793,got in late as we were on our way to pa where he attends university,3
9794,i was a bit leery because there were several men in the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler,3

9799,i recently had lunch at lobby at 12 and i have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities,3
9800,room had been updated but bed needed to be updated otherwise the hotel was excellent and service above par,3
9801,i understand i am not a smoker and neither is my sister,3
9802,the toilet seat was up and the water in the toilet and large black cockroaches running around outside,3
9803,the gentleman placed us in a room meant for just one,3
9804,when ichecked in i was told it did upon arrival,3
9805,it was ok for the money i paid for a taxi ride i didn't need much,3
9806,i went out to the desk to find no one there for some time y the looks of the rope and landscape around the pole,3
9807,recommend you spend the money for a night i didn't need but other than that very nice stay,3
9808,and the cost of my overnight stay was fine and we brought our mastiff along,3
9809,i was very pleased with the location of the hotel is very close to the quarry market and we loved going there,3
9810,i like to work out first thing in the morning but what about us tea drinkers,3
9811,this hotel is hard to find as you have to go inside to get to your room,3

9813,my daughter and i found the room to be a bit more than ordinary,3
9814,the room needed some maintenance however the overall stay wasn't bad after room was accommodated,3
9815,the owners are very nice and the place was clean but way to expensive,3
9816,very disappointed in the fact that i booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to get one,3

9819,the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was nothing to write home about,3
9820,the room was clean but there were hardly enough towels provided and they were very nice and the breakfast had a nice variety,3

9825,i will try a different hotel the next time we visit family in the area,3
9826,the microwave dial was sticky when i went to tell the front desk others had already complained,3
9827,when we got there it was pretty freeze in the room but with some time with the heater on it became comfortable,3

9829,it would be much better if they had a microwave to use i saw this in their back room,3
9830,the check in was fast and friendly as well,3
9831,when checked into the room there was water in the bathroom there is a drain on the floor and walls of the shower,3
9832,it's a beautiful place but if you are looking for somewhere special i would try somewhere else,3
9833,staff was very friendly at check-in was a snob,3
9834,only complaints are that the shower curtain needed to be replaced as there was nothing offered that appealed to me,3

9840,pros bedroom and bathroom were clean and warm,3
9841,bw long beach is an average hotel which isn't bad,3
9842,we picked this hotel because it had a very musty bad odor not a good first impression,3

9847,hair in the shower and i couldn't even here the lady checking me in,3
9848,the location is okay great if you want to be able to have a vacation due to the malice of this business owner,3
9849,being the biggest location in town for a work event at ung,3
9850,the stay was fine but the amount of noise in the room was quite well furnished clean and large enough,3
9851,the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard and the beds were comfortable and the pool was closed and breakfast was terrible,3
9852,the hot tub did not work and i had to go,3
9853,the restaurant is more of a bar and we were the only ones there for a while,3

9855,we found stephanie at the front desk was very helpful,3
9856,the outside vanity area was ok but the sheets and covers were annoying,3
9857,take care when you book that you are not staying by the beach,3
9858,the included breakfast was okay and the staff tried to help but could not figure it out,3
9859,they are in the middle of times square,3
9860,it is an older motel and the rooms are not new by any means but they are clean,3
9861,the bathroom was clean and the staff didn't even say anything about it when booking the reservation,3

9868,it's a hostel so we were not looking for a lot,3
9869,it's old and nothing fancy but very reasonably priced,3

9871,other than this small the room was decent and the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the areas attractions,3
9872,the elevator might require a bit of patience even when the hotel is busy the elevators have long waits,3
9873,i'm an fully aware that it's not the best hotel breakfast i've had juice machine was out of several products,3
9874,i thought i was in a room that was on the counter either,3
9875,she got on her computer and found a room that smelled of cigarette smoke,3
9876,the hotel was fully booked when i arrived but the staff at the desk were nice and so were the staff making the breakfast,3
9877,however i have learned some of the rooms were closed for renovations,3
9878,i do think that there needs to be a little more thorough there,3
9879,i wasn't luxurious but that wasn't a problem but she should have mentioned that they take a little extra for incidentals,3
9880,bed was very comfortable and the water pressure is mediocre,3
9881,when you are traveling on a budget not a lot to do around there,3
9882,bed was a little high for what it was 180 night this was one of the worst hotels for shuttle service,3

9884,just a 2 minute walk the mexican food at the hotel is not bad but needs to be updated,3
9885,the hotel itself was nice the rooms were nice and clean although the beds were definitely small and uncomfortable,3
9886,all in all it was a nice hotel close to my final destination from this location,3
9887,good hotel if you don't check her,3
9888,this is where you pick up the free shuttle to the cruise terminal early before 10 am for my sisters cruise wedding,3
9889,the rooms and the hotel itself are rather dated and could use a bit of an update was adequate for the price,3
9890,room for vending ice machine was locked key didn't work the pizza place that the guest services book said delivered did not,3
9891,the hotel was just okay needed a bit more maintenance attention but served it's purpose,3
9892,it was just a place for me to sleep for the night but the a c was not on when we arrived,3
9893,the coffee pot was inoperative so that we would not have booked it i would have gone somewhere else,3

9895,the room was so hot that i had to relocate because they were having some water issues,3
9896,there was a laundromat right across the street from the beach,3
9897,out dated hotel for the price and that was certainly delivered,3
9898,the pool was ok but i wouldn't have paid the price i did for that,3
9899,but the hotel was fine and the bed was comfortable if a little squeaky,3
9900,on our last day the power went out in the middle of things but a warning that it could be very loud,3
9901,pool was dated as well as the lodge's close proximity to the aquarium and the queen mary,3
9902,honestly we were expecting more than that but it was a good deal and worked for what i needed,3
9903,all in all it was pretty clean the neighborhood was great and the views from the terrace,3
9904,it was someplace to sleep and the access to the street didn't feel the safest,3
9905,when we first got to the room from the drive,3
9906,will stay here again since we did not get an early start to our day,3
9907,i called to the front desk he said he would send someone,3
9908,i would definitely stay here again if visiting kauai,3
9909,just needed a place to stay for the weekend 4th of july festivities,3

9915,access to the room was very clean but a bit noisy,3
9916,no frills hotel that met our needs for the few days we needed,3
9917,i had food in the refrigerator that would spoil if it wasn't so bad in retrospect compared to the town,3
9918,there was a sign up about reptiles in the parking lot who seemed to be very limited compared to other hotels in bali,3
9919,the hotel is a walking distance from the cemetery and french quarters,3
9920,nice motel the only thing i asked for,3
9921,the hotel rooms were a little out dated,3
9922,however the next morning i mentioned problem upon checkout and the front desk said she would make sure it was cleaned up fairly quick,3
9923,i pointed out that i understood was there to confirm the day staff knew of the proposed room change,3
9924,for a hostel it was surprisingly quiet area must say i was surprised by the lack of items in the room needed attention,3
9925,one of the main reasons we chose this hotel for the location in the university district,3
9926,it's fine if you just need a place to rest,3
9927,the staff is willing to help you out if needed,3
9928,i was told that the only room they had was on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room,3

9940,my father is a handicap and they put us on the 4th floor 2nd floor was completely gutted,3
9941,at around 3 15 the bartender called the front desk and they told him none was available,3
9942,this is an excellent location right next to the stairs but we heard nothing,3
9943,this was a challenge given we were traveling with an assist dog and were made to pay 10,3
9944,we didn't get the room i booked a room with 2 queen beds,3
9945,room was pretty much what you would expect from an older ramada,3

9948,continental breakfast was good and the staff was friendly and helpful,3

9954,and then when the breakfast came out an hour and a half later and the worst quality couldn't eat it,3
9955,the room was nice but i would not stay here again,3
9956,otherwise its a very nice place as the lobby area is noisy don't stay in rm 114,3
9957,great room for the price but no extras,3
9958,plenty of restaurants nearby and right across the road from the tucson airport fit the bill with some minor inconveniences,3

9962,the lobby area was clean and well maintained,3
9963,the hotel was very nice and very helpful,3
9964,at first the front desk clerk was very friendly and welcoming,3
9965,the distance from the elevator to the 2nd floor were hard enough to do with luggage,3
9966,if that was on the description i would not have stayed even the first night,3

9976,when we asked about hilton honors she told us we could have a drink at the outdoor bar the bartender was very friendly,3
9977,i was wearing flip flops and ended up throwing them away because they were so old and rusted they fell off,3
9978,at was ok definitely not a five star but maybe a solid 3,3
9979,at was ok definitely not a five star but maybe a solid 3,3
9980,don't try to get a low floor because when the hotel is not at full capacity because it is,3
9981,when i first walked in it was very well decorated and i was just looking to take a shower,3
9982,the next morning when i checked out i told the lady at the desk was very nice and helpful,3
9983,first and foremost it's a beautiful hotel in a great location to see the city of boston,3
9984,the ice machine was not working on the second day of our stay treating the guests not just us like we were beneath her,3
9985,i'm not sure why it hasn't been professionally cleaned in some time,3
9986,front desk people very nice and there was a pervasive odor in the room,3
9987,my biggest problem was just the fact that it had an indoor pool and hot tub was available,3
9988,the room was clean and the staff was very friendly and welcoming as i find is consistent and appreciated with the brand,3
9989,the room needed some maintenance however the overall stay wasn't bad after room was accommodated,3

9991,one elevator was out of service for 4 days and 3 nights at cypress creek,3
9992,we were there for the miss usa pageant so we weren't picky about where we chose to stay,3
9993,altogether would not stay there again and too far from the city,3
9994,the staff are very nice and the place was clean,3
9995,you just don't know what you are going to offer something make it available for the majority,3
9996,building looks dated we had room right by the pool area and it was rusted making retrieving water from there undesirable,3
9997,fake roman columns in front of the hotel on the ground level,3
9998,the staff that did try and make up for it by putting us in a parlor suite,3
9999,it seemed as if the walls were paper-thin we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door walls,3
