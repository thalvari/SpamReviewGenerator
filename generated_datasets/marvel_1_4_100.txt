much much much worse than the first avengers the first one is a step down for director jon favearu. this new hulk movie is definetly going to be one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen. robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance. i'm not counting this one as an iron man movie not a spider-man movie was bad as well. next i don't think i could give it negative five stars. i have already said that the story has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes. i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies. bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a few extra chromosomes in your system. the most notable part is the fact that it is a fun movie to watch. this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the more i think about it again and again and. wow this movie is just a middle of the road mediocre snore-fest. worst movie i have ever seen unbelievably bad. it's packed with even less action than its predecessor and the special effects are phenomenal as well as the overall movie concept. i mean it does transition well from the avengers the action scenes are the most spectacular of its time previously unimaginable in motion pictures. well guess what antman and the wasp is also known as ant man 2. story was a real let down after avengers. this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans. this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did. i tried to give this super hero stuff a chance but it's just another one of these vapid disney marvel movies. the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc. and this is supposed to be the title. as a long time spidey fan i was really looking forward to the second film and new characters coming in. dumb jokes and what a waste of money this film was. i was so hyped after watching the trailer but the movie was very slow but still captured the true aspect of spiderman. tony stark the man behind the iron man suit being completely useless in the film's climax making no sense. paul rudd is yet again great as ant man but in the first ant man movie so i assume that one was slightly better. but overall iron man 3 is beautifully shot. painfully horrible amp slow not even close to the first one is a step down for director jon favearu. worst spider-man film and the worst mcu film to date in my opinion. i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't work at all. definitely is one of the worst movies i have ever seen on screen. i have a theory that it is a fun movie to watch. no homage to the spider-man suit is just the iron man suit is a flamboyant billionaire who invents gadgets and new technology. with all of that the incredible hulk was nothing short of necessary viewing. to be blunt i thought it was going to be a good movie based on all the hype. at least stark got over it in time for avengers age of ultron will not leave fans disappointed. the only reason i didn't walk out was because of the suit case scene that's it. the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power. glad that bob layton agreed that this movie was a disaster with the only good part in the film. nebula's makeup was nowhere as good as in the first film and turn him into war machine and setup the avengers. there are some cool moments and the characters are nowhere near as interesting. it starts to look like leftover superheros fighting among them because they are bored. either way the acting in the incredible hulk and lacks chemistry with edward norton. wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies. other reviewers seem to think this is one of the worst movies of all time. no where near as good as the first if not better. the movie itself does a great way to introduce the villain's power. whoooooo i can't wait for the sequel. so glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theaters. story was a real let down after avengers. he's the typical hardass general who doesn't like a racoon with rockets and guns and small man syndrome. i was grateful then that what i was given was just a whole lot of empty conversations that are pointless and i hate gwenyth. unlike others i did not like this film. yet what's worse is the fact that it is a fun action filled blockbuster. the casting acting are still great given the material and the special effects and plotline aren't too excellent either. the more i watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination. the storyline is slow and the chemistry between antman and the wasp is very funny and michael peã±a is yet again hilarious as luis. did not enjoy the movie at all the acting was so so and the action was ok. i had such high hopes for this movie but it just didn't work at all. black panther is a super cool character but i don't remember any particular scenes that stuck. so glad that i didn't pay money to see it in the theatre. this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie and the more i think about it again and again and. in tony stark's nightmare about the death of the cash grab comic book genre. if anything it is one of the mcu's worst films. i saw black panther and found a movie with a lack of a villain. most depressing movie ever i'm sorry i wasted my money instead of renting first. if you really like all the characters in this movie as goofy and urban was deplorable. robert downey jr is yet again superb as tony stark and the movie finds the perfect action story character comedy balance. but this thing drags on and on and wishing for it to end. this movie was very over-hyped and full of reverse racism. while i was excited to watch this movie with my 2 nephews they can't wait to see this bring on may 2012. it's okay but i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies. this practice is shameful and should be exposed for what it is a fun movie to watch. lol ppl said this movie is a far cry from that. i realy want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought. not that i don't even want to see it again and again it isn't as great as i thought. if you like funny drama action and adventure then guardians of the galaxy this movie is fantastic and art from beginning to end. this movie doesn't really stand out for me is definitely the iron man hulk fight scene. the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie. wow while visually some beautiful shots this is simply a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies. this movie really sticks to the source material and is a great movie and i recommened it even for non-superhero fans. this is my 3rd time trying to watch this movie iw turned out to be mj did. yes i am including spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot. the applause it deserves is for it's visual effects which is the only thing about the movie which is a shame there was potential. if anything it is one of the mcu's most gripping storyline. now the character centered stuff was one of the things that irritated me about the movie. the jokes are all over the place and isn't clear. this is definitely the 2017 version of spider-man and iron man characters. james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon. james spader is having buckets of fun as the voice of the quick witted yet slightly psychopathic rocket racoon. if i could give this 0 stars but there doesn't seem to be any plot to this movie. and this is supposed to be the title. the heroes were just good guys and that is the great thing about ant man and the wasp. the last major story told on screen about the incredible hulk was born and it's calling itself a movie. the best movie i've seen all year and i loved the idea of all his suits coming together to stop aldrich killian. usually i dread the big fight seen in super hero movies but this one ranks as the worst so far. dans game i would not recommend this one. cgi garbage and the only thing that was good about this one was the little groot. speaking of jokes there are so many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here. while i was excited to watch this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination.
