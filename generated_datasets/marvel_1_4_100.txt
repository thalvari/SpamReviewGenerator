overhyped movie i have ever seen in the movie. yeah people there is a dance off at the end and it felt rushed. it's okay but i'm not a big fan of villains that don't really even take themselves seriously. villain was boring and most of the script is very subpar. the suit had more abilities than spider-man 3 butchered symbiote subplot. didn't feel like a marvel movie don't know where they were trying to do but it just didn't work at all. liv tyler has nothing of sensible value in the incredible hulk ends up far from entertaining. wow this movie is just a long ass fucking trailer for the avengers rather than its own story. lost the charm he had in the first movie is absent for most of the movie who is not interesting and is just plain boring. lol ppl said this movie is a far cry

deal. marvel movies are suppose to be action packed this movie is a crap and yet has a 75 %. other than that it is bad and i would not recommend watching this movie at all resident sleeper all day.
